 Solomon having pronounced all vanity, and particularly knowledge and 
 learning, which he was so far from giving himself joy of that he found 
 the increase of it did but increase his sorrow, in this chapter he goes 
 on to show what reason he has to be tired of this world, and with what 
 little reason most men are fond of it. 

 I. He shows that there is no true happiness and satisfaction to be had
 in mirth and pleasure, and the delights of sense, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:11-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He reconsiders the pretensions of wisdom, and allows it to be
 excellent and useful, and yet sees it clogged with such diminutions of
 its worth that it proves insufficient to make a man happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.
 
 III. He enquires how far the business and wealth of this world will go
 towards making men happy, and concludes, from his own experience, that,
 to those who set their hearts upon it, "it is vanity and vexation of
 spirit,"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:17-23">ver. 17-23</A>),

 and that, if there be any good in it, it is only to those that sit
 loose to it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with
 mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <I>is</I>
 vanity.
 &nbsp; 2  I said of laughter, <I>It is</I> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?
 &nbsp; 3  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
 acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
 till I might see what <I>was</I> that good for the sons of men, which
 they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
 &nbsp; 4  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
 vineyards:
 &nbsp; 5  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them
 of all <I>kind of</I> fruits:
 &nbsp; 6  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
 bringeth forth trees:
 &nbsp; 7  I got <I>me</I> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
 house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
 above all that were in Jerusalem before me:
 &nbsp; 8  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
 of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
 singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <I>as</I> musical
 instruments, and that of all sorts.
 &nbsp; 9  So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
 me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
 &nbsp; 10  And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
 withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all
 my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.
 &nbsp; 11  Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought,
 and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all
 <I>was</I> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <I>there was</I> no profit
 under the sun.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here, in pursuit of the <I>summum bonum</I>--<I>the felicity</I>
 of man, adjourns out of his study, his library, his elaboratory, his 
 council-chamber, where he had in vain sought for it, into the park and 
 the playhouse, his garden and his summer-house; he exchanges the 
 company of the philosophers and grave senators for that of the wits and 
 gallants, and the beaux-esprits, of his court, to try if he could find 
 true satisfaction and happiness among them. Here he takes a great step 
 downward, from the noble pleasures of the intellect to the brutal ones 
 of sense; yet, if he resolve to make a thorough trial, he must knock at 
 this door, because here a great part of mankind imagine they have found 
 that which he was in quest of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He resolved to try what mirth would do and the pleasures of wit, 
 whether he should be happy if he constantly entertained himself and 
 others with merry stories and jests, banter and drollery; if he should 
 furnish himself with all the pretty ingenious turns and repartees he 
 could invent or pick up, fit to be laughed over, and all the bulls, and 
 blunders, and foolish things, he could hear of, fit to be ridiculed and 
 laughed at, so that he might be always in a merry humour. 

 1. This experiment made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "Finding that <I>in much wisdom is much grief,</I> and that those who
 are serious are apt to be melancholy, <I>I said in my heart</I>" (to my 
 heart), "<I>Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth;</I> I will try if 
 that will give thee satisfaction." Neither the temper of his mind nor 
 his outward condition had any thing in them to keep him from being 
 merry, but both agreed, as did all other advantages, to further it; 
 <I>therefore</I> he resolved to take a lease this way, and said, 
 "<I>Enjoy pleasure,</I> and take thy fill of it; cast away care, and 
 resolve to be merry." So a man may be, and yet have none of these fine 
 things which he here got to entertain himself with; many that are poor 
 are very merry; beggars in a barn are so to a proverb. Mirth is the 
 entertainment of the fancy, and, though it comes short of the solid 
 delights of the rational powers, yet it is to be preferred before those 
 that are merely carnal and sensual. Some distinguish man from the 
 brutes, not only as <I>animal rationale--a rational animal,</I> but as
 <I>animal risibile--a laughing animal;</I> therefore he that said to his
 soul, <I>Take thy ease, eat and drink,</I> added, <I>And be merry,</I> 
 for it was in order to that that he would eat and drink. "Try 
 therefore," says Solomon, "to laugh and be fat, to laugh and be happy." 
 
 2. The judgment he passed upon this experiment: <I>Behold, this also is
 vanity,</I> like all the rest; it yields no true satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 <I>I said of laughter, It is mad,</I> or, <I>Thou art mad,</I> and
 therefore I will have nothing to do with thee; <I>and of mirth</I> (of 
 all sports and recreations, and whatever pretends to be diverting), 
 <I>What doeth it?</I> or, <I>What doest thou?</I> Innocent mirth, 
 soberly, seasonable, and moderately used, is a good thing, fits for 
 business, and helps to soften the toils and chagrins of human life; 
 but, when it is excessive and immoderate, it is foolish and fruitless.

 (1.) It does no good: <I>What doeth it? Cui bono--of what use is
 it?</I> It will not avail to quiet a guilty conscience; no, nor to ease 
 a sorrowful spirit; nothing is more ungrateful than <I>singing songs to 
 a heavy heart.</I> It will not satisfy the soul, nor ever yield it true 
 content. It is but a palliative cure to the grievances of this present 
 time. Great laughter commonly ends in a sigh.

 (2.) It does a great deal of hurt: <I>It is mad,</I> that is, it makes
 men mad, it transports men into many indecencies, which are a reproach 
 to their reason and religion. They are mad that indulge themselves in 
 it, for it estranges the heart from God and divine things, and 
 insensibly eats out the power of religion. Those that love to be merry
 forget to be serious, and, while they take the timbrel and harp, they 
 <I>say to the Almighty, Depart from us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:12,14">Job xxi. 12, 14</A>.

 We may, as Solomon, <I>prove</I> ourselves, <I>with mirth,</I> and
 judge of the state of our souls by this: How do we stand affected to 
 it? Can we be merry and wise? Can we use it as sauce, and not as food? 
 But we need not try, as Solomon did, whether it will make a happiness 
 for us, for we may take his word for it, <I>It is mad;</I> and <I>What 
 does it?</I> Laughter and pleasure (says Sir William Temple) come from 
 very different affections of the mind; for, as men have no disposition 
 to laugh at things they are most pleased with, so they are very little 
 pleased with many things they laugh at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Finding himself not happy in that which pleased his fancy, he 
 resolved next to try that which would please the palate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Since the knowledge of the creature would not satisfy, he would see
 what the liberal use of it would do: <I>I sought in my heart to give 
 myself unto wine,</I> that is, to good meat and good drink. Many give 
 themselves to these without consulting their hearts at all, not looking 
 any further than merely the gratification of the sensual appetite; but 
 Solomon applied himself to it rationally, and as a man, critically, and 
 only to make an experiment. Observe,

 1. He did not allow himself any liberty in the use of the delights of
 sense till he had tired himself with his severe studies. Till his 
 <I>increase</I> of <I>sorrow,</I> he never thought of giving himself 
 <I>to wine.</I> When we have spent ourselves in doing good we may then 
 most comfortably refresh ourselves with the gifts of God's bounty. 
 <I>Then</I> the delights of sense are rightly used when they are used 
 as we use cordials, only when we need them; as Timothy drank wine for 
 his health's sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1 Tim. v. 23</A>.

 <I>I thought to draw my flesh with wine</I> (so the margin reads it) or
 <I>to wine.</I> Those that have addicted themselves to drinking did at 
 first put a force upon themselves; they drew their flesh to it, and 
 with it; but they should remember to what miseries they hereby draw 
 themselves.

 2. He then looked upon it as folly, and it was with reluctance that he
 gave himself to it; as St. Paul, when he commended himself, called it a 
 <I>weakness,</I> and desired to be borne with in his 
 <I>foolishness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:1">2 Cor. xi. 1</A>.

 He sought <I>to lay hold on folly,</I> to see the utmost that that
 folly would do towards making men happy; but he had like to have 
 carried the jest (as we say) too far. He resolved that the folly should 
 not take hold of him, not get the mastery of him, but he would lay hold 
 on it, and keep it at a distance; yet he found it too hard for him. 

 3. He took care at the same time to <I>acquaint</I> himself <I>with
 wisdom,</I> to manage himself wisely in the use of his pleasures, so 
 that they should not do him any prejudice nor disfit him to be a 
 competent judge of them. When he <I>drew his flesh with wine</I> he 
 <I>led his heart with wisdom</I> (so the word is), kept up his pursuits 
 after knowledge, did not make a sot of himself, nor become a slave to 
 his pleasures, but his studies and his feasts were foils to each other, 
 and he tried whether both mixed together would give him that 
 satisfaction which he could not find in either separately. This Solomon 
 proposed to himself, but he found it <I>vanity;</I> for those that 
 think to give themselves to wine, and yet to acquaint their hearts with 
 wisdom, will perhaps deceive themselves as much as those do that think 
 to serve both God and mammon. <I>Wine is a mocker;</I> it is a great 
 cheat; and it will be impossible for any man to say that thus far he 
 will give himself to it and no further. 

 4. That which he aimed at was not to gratify his appetite, but to find
 out man's happiness, and this, because it pretended to be so, must be 
 tried among the rest. Observe the description he gives of man's 
 happiness--it is <I>that good for the sons of men which they should do
 under the heaven all their days.</I>

 (1.) That which we are to enquire after is not so much the good we must
 have (we may leave that to God), but the good we must do; that ought to 
 be our care. <I>Good Master, what good thing shall I do?</I> Our 
 happiness consists not in being idle, but in doing aright, in being 
 well employed. If we <I>do that which is good,</I> no doubt we shall 
 have comfort and <I>praise of the same.</I>

 (2.) It is good to be done <I>under the heaven,</I> while we are here
 in this world, while it is day, while our doing time lasts. This is our 
 state of work and service; it is in the other world that we must expect 
 the retribution. Thither our works will follow us. 

 (3.) It is to be done <I>all the days of our life.</I> The good we are
 to do we must persevere in the doing of to the end, while our doing 
 time lasts, <I>the number of the days of our life</I> (so it is in the 
 margin); the days of our life are numbered to us by him in whose hand 
 our times are and they are all to be spent as he directs. But that any 
 man should give himself to wine, in hopes to find out in that the best 
 way of living in this world, was an absurdity which Solomon here, in 
 the reflection, condemns himself for. Is it possible that this should 
 be the good that men should do? No; it is plainly very bad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Perceiving quickly that it was folly to give himself to wine, he 
 next tried the most costly entertainments and amusements of princes and 
 great men. He had a vast income; the revenue of his crown was very 
 great, and he laid it out so as might most please his own humour and 
 make him look great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gave himself much to building, both in the city and in the 
 country; and, having been at such vast expense in the beginning of his 
 reign to build a house for God, he was the more excusable if afterwards 
 he pleased his own fancy in building for himself; he began his work at 
 the right end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Matt. vi. 33</A>),

 not as the people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:4">Hag. i. 4</A>),

 that <I>ceiled their own houses</I> while God's <I>lay waste,</I> and
 it prospered accordingly. In building, he had the pleasure of employing 
 the poor and doing good to posterity. We read of Solomon's buildings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:15-19">1 Kings ix. 15-19</A>),

 and they were all <I>great works,</I> such as became his purse, and
 spirit, and great dignity. See his mistake; he enquired after the 
 <I>good</I> works he should do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and, in pursuit of the enquiry, applied himself to <I>great</I> works.
 <I>Good</I> works indeed are truly great, but many are reputed great 
 works which are far from being good, wondrous works which are not 
 gracious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22">Matt. vii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He took to love a garden, which is to some as bewitching as 
 building. He <I>planted himself vineyards,</I> which the soil and 
 climate of the land of Canaan favoured; he <I>made himself</I> fine 
 <I>gardens and orchards</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and perhaps the art of gardening was no way inferior then to what it is
 now. He had not only forests of timber-trees, but <I>trees of all kinds 
 of fruit,</I> which he himself had planted; and, if any worldly 
 business would yield a man happiness, surely it must be that which Adam 
 was employed in while he was in innocency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He laid out a great deal of money in water-works, ponds, and canals, 
 not for sport and diversion, but for use, <I>to water the wood that 
 brings forth trees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 he not only planted, but watered, and then left it to God to give the
 increase. <I>Springs of water</I> are great <I>blessings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:19">Josh. xv. 19</A>);

 but where nature has provided them art must direct them, to make them
 serviceable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:1">Prov. xxi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He increased his family. When he proposed to himself to do <I>great 
 works</I> he must employ many hands, and therefore procured <I>servants 
 and maidens,</I> which were bought with his money, and of those he 
 <I>had servants born in his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thus his retinue was enlarged and his court appeared more magnificent.
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:58">Ezra ii. 58</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He did not neglect country business, but both entertained and 
 enriched himself with that, and was not diverted from it either by his 
 studies or by his pleasures. He <I>had large possessions of great and 
 small cattle,</I> herds and flocks, as his father had before him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:29,31">1 Chron. xxvii. 29, 31</A>),

 not forgetting that his father, in the beginning, was a keeper of
 sheep. Let those that deal in cattle neither despise their employment 
 nor be weary of it, remembering that Solomon puts his having 
 <I>possessions of cattle</I> among his <I>great works</I> and his 
 pleasures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He grew very rich, and was not at all impoverished by his building 
 and gardening, as many are, who, for that reason only, repent it, and 
 call it <I>vanity and vexation.</I> Solomon scattered and yet 
 increased. He filled his exchequer with <I>silver and gold,</I> which 
 yet did not stagnate there, but were made to circulate through his 
 kingdom, so that he made <I>silver to be in Jerusalem as stones</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:27">1 Kings x. 27</A>);

 nay, he had the <I>segullah, the peculiar treasure of kings and of the
 provinces,</I> which was, for richness and rarity, more accounted of 
 than <I>silver and gold.</I> The neighbouring kings, and the distant 
 provinces of his own empire, sent him the richest presents they had, to 
 obtain his favour and the instructions of his wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He had every thing that was charming and diverting, all sorts of 
 melody and music, vocal and instrumental, <I>men-singers and 
 women-singers,</I> the best voices he could pick up, and all the wind 
 and band-instruments that were then in use. His father had a genius for 
 music, but it should seem he employed it more to serve his devotion 
 than the son, who made it more for his diversion. These are called 
 <I>the delights of the sons of men;</I> for the gratifications of sense 
 are the things that the generality of people set their affections upon 
 and take the greatest complacency in. The delights of the children of 
 God are of quite another nature, pure, spiritual, and heavenly, and the 
 delights of angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. He enjoyed, more than ever any man did, a composition of rational 
 and sensitive pleasures at the same time. He was, in this respect, 
 <I>great, and increased more than all that were before him,</I> that he 
 was wise amidst a thousand earthly enjoyments. It was strange, and the 
 like was never met with, 

 (1.) That his pleasures did not debauch his judgment and conscience. In
 the midst of these entertainments <I>his wisdom remained with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 In the midst of all these childish delights he preserved his spirit
 manly, kept the possession of his own soul, and maintained the dominion 
 of reason over the appetites of sense; such a vast stock of wisdom had 
 he that it was not wasted and impaired, as any other man's would have 
 been, by this course of life. But let none be emboldened hereby to lay
 the reins on the neck of their appetites, presuming that they may do 
 that and yet retain their wisdom, for they have not such a strength of 
 wisdom as Solomon had; nay, and Solomon was deceived; for how did 
 <I>his wisdom remain with him</I> when he lost his religion so far as 
 to build altars to strange gods, for the humouring of his strange 
 wives? But thus far <I>his wisdom remained with him</I> that he was 
 master of his pleasures, and not a slave to them, and kept himself 
 capable of making a judgment of them. He went over into the enemies'
 country, not as a deserter, but as a <I>spy, to discover the nakedness 
 of their land.</I>

 (2.) Yet his judgment and conscience gave no check to his pleasures,
 nor hindered him from exacting the very quintessence of the delights of 
 sense, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It might be objected against his judgment in this matter that if <I>his
 wisdom remained with him</I> he could not take the liberty that was 
 necessary to a full experimental acquaintance with it: "Yea," said he, 
 "I took as great a liberty as any man could take, for <I>whatsoever my 
 eyes desired I kept not from them,</I> if it could be compassed by 
 lawful means, though ever so difficult or costly; and as <I>I withheld 
 not any joy from my heart</I> that I had a mind to, so <I>I withheld 
 not my heart from any joy,</I> but, with a <I>non-obstante--with the
 full exercise</I> of my wisdom, I had a high gust of my pleasures, 
 relished and enjoyed them as much as ever any Epicure did;" nor was 
 there any thing either in the circumstances of his condition or in the 
 temper of his spirit to sour or embitter them, or give them any alloy.
 In short,

 [1.] He had as much pleasure in his business as ever any man had: <I>My
 heart rejoiced in all my labour;</I> so that the toil and fatigue of 
 that were no damp to his pleasures. 

 [2.] He had no less profit by his business. He met with no
 disappointment in it to give him any disturbance: <I>This was my 
 portion of all my labour;</I> he had this added to all the rest of his 
 pleasures that in them he did not only see, but eat, the labour of his 
 hands; and this was all he had, for indeed it was all he could expect, 
 from his labours. It sweetened his business that he enjoyed the success 
 of it, and it sweetened his enjoyments that they were the product of 
 his business; so that, upon the whole, he was certainly as happy as the 
 world could make him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. We have, at length, the judgment he deliberately gave of all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When the Creator had made his great works he reviewed them, and 
 <I>behold, all was very good;</I> every thing pleased him. But when 
 Solomon reviewed <I>all his works that his hands had wrought</I> with 
 the utmost cost and care, <I>and the labour that he had laboured to
 do</I> in order to make himself easy and happy, nothing answered his 
 expectation; <I>behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit;</I> he 
 had no satisfaction in it, no advantage by it; <I>there was no profit 
 under the sun,</I> neither by the employments nor by the enjoyments of 
 this world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and
 folly: for what <I>can</I> the man <I>do</I> that cometh after the king?

 &nbsp; 16  For <I>there is</I> no remembrance of the wise more than of the
 fool for ever; seeing that which now <I>is</I> in the days to come
 shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <I>man?</I> as the
 fool.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon having tried what satisfaction was to be had in learning first, 
 and then in the pleasures of sense, and having also put both together, 
 here compares them one with another and passes a judgment upon 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sets himself to consider both wisdom and folly. He had considered 
 these before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>);

 but lest it should be thought he was then too quick in passing a
 judgment upon them, he here turns himself again to behold them, to see 
 if, upon a second view and second thoughts, he could gain more 
 satisfaction in the search than he had done upon the first. He was sick 
 of his pleasures, and, as nauseating them, he turned from them, that he 
 might again apply himself to speculation; and if, upon this rehearing 
 of the cause, the verdict be still the same, the judgment will surely 
 be decisive; <I>for what can the man do that comes after the king?</I> 
 especially such a king, who had so much of this world to make the 
 experiment upon and so much wisdom to make it with. The baffled trial
 needs not be repeated. No man can expect to find more satisfaction in 
 the world than Solomon did, nor to gain a greater insight into the 
 principles of morality; when a man has done what he can still it is 
 <I>that which has been already done.</I> Let us learn, 

 1. Not to indulge ourselves in a fond conceit that we can mend that
 which has been well done before us. Let us <I>esteem others better than 
 ourselves,</I> and think how unfit we are to attempt the improvement of 
 the performances of better heads and hands than ours, and rather own 
 how much we are beholden to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:37,38">John iv. 37, 38</A>.

 2. To acquiesce in Solomon's judgment of the things of this world, and
 not to think of repeating the trial; for we can never think of having 
 such advantages as he had to make the experiment nor of being able to 
 make it with equal application of mind and so little danger to 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives the preference to wisdom far before folly. Let none 
 mistake him, as if, when he speaks of the vanity of human literature, 
 he designed only to amuse men with a paradox, or were about to write 
 (as a great wit once did) <I>Encomium mori&aelig;--A panegyric in praise of
 folly.</I> No, he is maintaining sacred truths, and therefore is 
 careful to guard against being misunderstood. I soon <I>saw</I> (says 
 he) <I>that there is an excellency in wisdom more than in folly,</I> as 
 much as there is in light above darkness. The pleasures of wisdom, 
 though they suffice not to make men happy, yet vastly transcend the 
 pleasures of wine. Wisdom enlightens the soul with surprising 
 discoveries and necessary directions for the right government of 
 itself; but sensuality (for that seems to be especially the folly here 
 meant) clouds and eclipses the mind, and is as darkness to it; it puts 
 out men's eyes, makes them to stumble in the way and wander out of it. 
 Or, though wisdom and knowledge will not make a man happy (St. Paul
 shows a <I>more excellent way</I> than gifts, and that is grace), yet 
 it is much better to have them than to be without them, in respect of 
 our present safety, comfort, and usefulness; for <I>the wise man's eyes 
 are in his head</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 where they should be, ready to discover both the dangers that are to be
 avoided and the advantages that are to be improved; a wise man has not 
 his reason to seek when he should use it, but looks about him and is 
 quick-sighted, knows both where to step and where to stop; whereas 
 <I>the fool walks in darkness,</I> and is ever and anon either at a 
 loss, or at a plunge, either bewildered, that he knows not which way to 
 go, or embarrassed, that he cannot go forward. A man that is discreet 
 and considerate has the command of his business, and acts decently and 
 safely, as those that walk in the day; but he that is rash, and 
 ignorant, and sottish, is continually making blunders, running upon one 
 precipice or other; his projects, his bargains, are all foolish, and 
 ruin his affairs. Therefore <I>get wisdom, get understanding.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Yet he maintains that, in respect of lasting happiness and 
 satisfaction, the wisdom of this world gives a man very little 
 advantage; for, 

 1. Wise men and fools fare alike. "It is true the wise man has very
 much the advantage of the fool in respect of foresight and insight, and 
 yet the greatest probabilities do so often come short of success that 
 <I>I myself perceived,</I> by my own experience, that <I>one event 
 happens to them all</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 those that are most cautious of their health are as soon sick as those
 that are most careless of it, and the most suspicious are imposed 
 upon." David had observed that <I>wise men die,</I> and are involved in 
 the same common calamity with the fool and the brutish person, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:12">Ps. xlix. 12</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11"><I>ch.</I> ix. 11</A>.
 
 Nay, it has of old been observed that <I>Fortune favours fools,</I> and
 that half-witted men often thrive most, while the greatest projectors 
 forecast worst for themselves. The same sickness, the same sword, 
 devours wise men and fools. Solomon applies this mortifying observation 
 to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that though he was a wise man, he might not <I>glory in his wisdom; I
 said to my heart,</I> when it began to be proud or secure, <I>As it 
 happens to the fool, so it happens to me, even to me;</I> for thus 
 emphatically it is expressed in the original: "So, <I>as for me,</I> it 
 happens to me. Am I rich? So is many a Nabal that fares as sumptuously 
 as I do. Is a foolish man sick, does he get a fall? So do I, <I>even 
 I;</I> and neither my wealth nor my wisdom will be my security. <I>And 
 why was I then more wise?</I> Why should I take so much pains to get 
 wisdom, when, as to this life, it will stand me in so little stead? 
 <I>Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</I>" Some make 
 this a correction of what was said before, like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:10">Ps. lxx. 10</A>),

 "<I>I said, This is my infirmity;</I> it is my folly to think that wise
 men and fools are upon a level;" but really they seem to be so, in 
 respect of the event, and therefore it is rather a confirmation of what 
 he had before said, That a man may be a profound philosopher and 
 politician and yet not be a happy man. 

 2. Wise men and fools are forgotten alike

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>There is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool.</I> It is
 promised to the righteous that they <I>shall be had in everlasting 
 remembrance,</I> and <I>their memory shall be blessed,</I> and they 
 shall shortly <I>shine as the stars;</I> but there is no such promise 
 made concerning the wisdom of this world, that that shall perpetuate 
 men's names, for those names only are perpetuated that are <I>written 
 in heaven,</I> and otherwise the names of this world's wise men are 
 written with those of its fools in the dust. <I>That which now is in 
 the days to come shall all be forgotten.</I> What was much talked of in 
 one generation is, in the next, as if it had never been. New persons 
 and new things jostle out the very remembrance of the old, which in a
 little time are looked upon with contempt and at length quite buried in 
 oblivion. <I>Where is the wise? Where is the disputer of this 
 world?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:20">1 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 And it is upon this account that he asks, <I>How dies the wise man? As
 the fool.</I> Between the death of a godly and a wicked man there is a
 great difference, but not between the death of a wise man and a fool;
 the fool is buried and forgotten

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:10"><I>ch.</I> viii. 10</A>),

 <I>and no one remembered the poor man that by his wisdom delivered the
 city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>);

 so that to both the grave is a <I>land of forgetfulness;</I> and wise
 and learned men, when they have been awhile there out of sight, grow 
 out of mind, a new generation arises that <I>knew them not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought
 under the sun <I>is</I> grievous unto me: for all <I>is</I> vanity and
 vexation of spirit.
 &nbsp; 18  Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
 because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
 &nbsp; 19  And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <I>man</I> or a fool?
 yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have
 laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.
 This <I>is</I> also vanity.
 &nbsp; 20  Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all
 the labour which I took under the sun.
 &nbsp; 21  For there is a man whose labour <I>is</I> in wisdom, and in
 knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
 therein shall he leave it <I>for</I> his portion. This also <I>is</I>
 vanity and a great evil.
 &nbsp; 22  For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
 his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?
 &nbsp; 23  For all his days <I>are</I> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea,
 his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
 &nbsp; 24  <I>There is</I> nothing better for a man, <I>than</I> that he should
 eat and drink, and <I>that</I> he should make his soul enjoy good in
 his labour. This also I saw, that it <I>was</I> from the hand of God.
 &nbsp; 25  For who can eat, or who else can hasten <I>hereunto,</I> more
 than I?
 &nbsp; 26  For <I>God</I> giveth to a man that <I>is</I> good in his sight
 wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth
 travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <I>him that
 is</I> good before God. This also <I>is</I> vanity and vexation of
 spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Business is a thing that wise men have pleasure in. They are in their 
 element when they are in their business, and complain if they be out of 
 business. They may sometimes be tired with their business, but they are 
 not weary of it, nor willing to leave it off. Here therefore one would 
 expect to have found the good that men should do, but Solomon tried 
 this too; after a contemplative life and a voluptuous life, he betook 
 himself to an active life, and found no more satisfaction in it than in 
 the other; still it is all <I>vanity and vexation of spirit,</I> of 
 which he gives an account in these verses, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the business was which he made trial of; it was business 
 <I>under the sun</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:17-20"><I>v.</I> 17-20</A>),

 about the things of this world, sublunary things, the riches, honours,
 and pleasures of this present time; it was the business of a king. 
 There is business <I>above the sun,</I> perpetual business, which is 
 perpetual blessedness; what we do in conformity to that business (doing 
 <I>God's will as it is done in heaven</I>) and in pursuance of that 
 blessedness, will turn to a good account; we shall have no reason to 
 hate that labour, nor to despair of it. But it is <I>labour under the 
 sun,</I> labour for the <I>meat that perishes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27,Isa+55:2">John vi. 27; Isa. lv. 2</A>),

 that Solomon here speaks of with so little satisfaction. It was the
 better sort of business, not that of the <I>hewers of wood and drawers 
 of water</I> (it is not so strange if men hate all that labour), but it 
 was <I>in wisdom, and knowledge, and equity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It was rational business, which related to the government of his
 kingdom and the advancement of its interests. It was labour managed by 
 the dictates of wisdom, of natural and acquired knowledge, and the 
 directions of justice. It was labour at the council-board and in the 
 courts of justice. It was labour wherein he <I>showed himself wise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which as much excels the labour wherein men only show themselves strong
 as the endowments of the mind, by which we are allied to angels, do 
 those of the body, which we have in common with the brutes. That which 
 many people have in their eye more than any thing else, in the 
 prosecution of their worldly business, is to <I>show themselves 
 wise,</I> to get the reputation of ingenious men and men of sense and 
 application.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His falling out with this business. He soon grew weary of it. 

 1. He <I>hated all his labour,</I> because he did not meet with that
 satisfaction in which he expected. After he had had his fine houses, 
 and gardens, and water-works, awhile, he began to nauseate them, and 
 look upon them with contempt, as children, who are eager for a toy and 
 fond of it at first, but, when they have played with it awhile, are 
 weary of it, and throw it away, and must have another. This expresses 
 not a gracious hatred of these things, which is our duty, to love them 
 less than God and religion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>),

 nor a sinful hatred of them, which is our folly, to be weary of the
 place God has assigned us and the work of it, but a natural hatred of 
 them, arising from a surfeit upon them and a sense of disappointment in 
 them. 

 2. He <I>caused his heart to despair of all his labour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 he took pains to possess himself with a deep sense of the vanity of
 worldly business, that it would not bring in the advantage and 
 satisfaction he had formerly flattered himself with the hopes of. Our 
 hearts are very loth to quit their expectations of great things from 
 the creature; we must go about, must fetch a compass, in arguing with 
 them, to convince them that there is not that in the things of this 
 world which we are apt to promise ourselves from them. Have we so often 
 bored and sunk into this earth for some rich mine of satisfaction, and 
 found not the least sign or token of it, but been always frustrated in 
 the search, and shall we not at length set our hearts at rest and 
 despair of ever finding it?

 3. He came to that, at length, that he <I>hated life itself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 because it is subject to so many toils and troubles, and a constant
 series of disappointments. God had given Solomon such largeness of 
 heart, and such vast capacities of mind, that he experienced more than 
 other men of the unsatisfying nature of all the things of this life and 
 their insufficiency to make him happy. Life itself, that is so precious 
 to a man, and such a blessing to a good man, may become a burden to a 
 man of business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reasons of this quarrel with his life and labours. Two things 
 made him weary of them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his business was so great a toil to himself: The <I>work that 
 he had wrought under the sun was grievous unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 His thoughts and cares about it, and that close and constant
 application of mind which was requisite to it, were a burden and 
 fatigue to him, especially when he grew old. It is the effect of a 
 curse on that we are to work upon. Our business is said to be <I>the 
 work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the Lord had 
 cursed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:29">Gen. v. 29</A>)
 
 and of the weakening of the faculties we are to work with, and of the
 sentence pronounced on us, that in <I>the sweat of our face we must eat 
 bread.</I> Our labour is called <I>the vexation of our heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 it is to most a force upon themselves, so natural is it to us to love
 our ease. A man of business is described to be uneasy both in his 
 <I>going out</I> and his <I>coming in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 (1.) He is deprived of his pleasure by day, for <I>all his days are 
 sorrow,</I> not only sorrowful, but sorrow itself, nay, many sorrows 
 and various; his travail, or labour, all day, is grief. Men of business 
 ever and anon meet with that which vexes them, and is an occasion of 
 anger or sorrow to them. Those that are apt to fret find that the more 
 dealings they have in the world the oftener they are made to fret. The 
 world is a <I>vale of tears,</I> even to those that have much of it. 
 Those that <I>labour</I> are said to be <I>heavy-laden,</I> and are 
 therefore called to come to Christ for rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>.

 (2.) He is disturbed in his repose <I>by night.</I> When he is overcome 
 with the hurries of the day, and hopes to find relief when he lays his 
 head on his pillow, he is disappointed there; cares <I>hold his eyes 
 waking,</I> or, if he sleep, yet his heart wakes, and that <I>takes no 
 rest in the night.</I> See what fools those are that make themselves 
 drudges to the world, and do not make God their rest; night and day 
 they cannot but be uneasy. So that, upon the whole matter, it is <I>all 
 vanity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 <I>This is vanity</I> in particular

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:19,23"><I>v.</I> 19, 23</A>),

 nay, it is <I>vanity and a great evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is a great affront to God and a great injury to themselves,
 therefore a <I>great evil;</I> it is a vain thing <I>to rise up early 
 and sit up late</I> in pursuit of this world's goods, which were never 
 designed to be our chief good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the gains of his business must all be left to others. Prospect 
 of advantage is the spring of action and the spur of industry; 
 <I>therefore</I> men labour, because they hope to get by it; if the 
 hope fail, the labour flags; and <I>therefore</I> Solomon quarrelled 
 with all the works, the great works, he had made, because they would 
 not be of any lasting advantage to himself. 

 (1.) He must leave them. He could not at death take them away with him,
 nor any share of them, nor should he return any more to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:10">Job vii. 10</A>),

 nor would the remembrance of them do him any good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 But I must <I>leave all to the man that shall be after me,</I> to the 
 generation that comes up in the room of that which is passing away. As 
 there were many before us, who built the houses that we live in, and 
 into whose purchases and labours we have entered, so there shall be 
 many after us, who shall live in the houses that we build, and enjoy 
 the fruit of our purchases and labours. Never was land lost for want
 of an heir. To a gracious soul this is no uneasiness at all; why should 
 we grudge others their turn in the enjoyments of this world, and not 
 rather be pleased that, when we are gone, those that come after us 
 shall fare the better for our wisdom and industry? But to a worldly 
 mind, that seeks for its own happiness in the creature, it is a great 
 vexation to think of leaving the beloved pelf behind, at this 
 uncertainty.

 (2.) He must leave them to those that would never have taken so much
 pains for them, and will there by excuse himself from taking any pains. 
 He that raised the estate did it by <I>labouring in wisdom, and 
 knowledge, and equity;</I> but he that enjoys it and spends it (it may 
 be) <I>has not laboured therein</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and, more than that, never will. The bee toils to maintain the drone.
 Nay, it proves a snare to him: it is left him <I>for his portion,</I> 
 which he rests in, and takes up with; and miserable he is in being put 
 off with it for a portion. Whereas, if an estate had not come to him 
 thus easily, who knows but he might have been both industrious and 
 religious? Yet we ought not to perplex ourselves about this, since it 
 may prove otherwise, that what is well got may come to one that will 
 use it well and do good with it.

 (3.) He knows not whom he must leave it to (for God makes heirs), or at
 least what <I>he</I> will prove to whom he leaves it, whether <I>a wise 
 man or a fool,</I> a wise man that will make it more or a fool that 
 will bring it to nothing; <I>yet he shall have rule over all my 
 labour,</I> and foolishly undo that which his father wisely did. It is 
 probable that Solomon wrote this very feelingly, being afraid what 
 Rehoboam would prove. St Jerome, in his commentary on this passage, 
 applies this to the good books which Solomon wrote, in which he had 
 shown himself wise, but he knew not into whose hands they would fall, 
 perhaps into the hands of a fool, who, according to the perverseness of 
 his heart, makes a bad use of what was well written. So that, upon the 
 whole matter, he asks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>What has man of all his labour?</I> What has he to himself and to
 his own use? What has he that will go with him into another world?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The best use which is therefore to be made of the wealth of this 
 world, and that is to use it cheerfully, to take the comfort of it, and 
 do good with it. With this he concludes the chapter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.

 There is no true happiness to be found in these things. They are 
 <I>vanity,</I> and, if happiness be expected from them, the 
 disappointment will be <I>vexation of spirit.</I> But he will put us in 
 a way to make the best of them, and to avoid the inconveniences he had 
 observed. We must neither over-toil ourselves, so as, in pursuit of 
 more, to rob ourselves of the comfort of what we have, nor must we 
 over-hoard for hereafter, nor lose our own enjoyment of what we have to 
 lay it up for those that shall come after us, but serve ourselves out 
 of it first. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What that good is which is here recommended to us; and which is the 
 utmost pleasure and profit we can expect or extract from the business 
 and profit of this world, and the furthest we can go to rescue it from 
 its <I>vanity</I> and the <I>vexation</I> that is in it. 

 (1.) We must do our duty with them, and be more in care how to use an
 estate well, for the ends for which we were entrusted with it, than how 
 to raise or increase an estate. This is intimated 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 where <I>those</I> only are said to have the comfort of this life who
 are good in <I>God's sight,</I> and again, <I>good before God,</I> 
 truly good, as Noah, whom <I>God saw righteous before him.</I> We must 
 set God always before us, and give diligence in every thing to approve 
 ourselves to him. The Chaldee-paraphrase says, <I>A man</I> should 
 <I>make his soul to enjoy good by keeping the commandments of God and 
 walking in the ways that are right before him,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 by <I>studying the words of the law, and being in care about the day of
 the great judgment that is to come.</I>

 (2.) We must take the comfort of them. These things will not make a 
 happiness for the soul; all the good we can have out of them is for the 
 body, and if we make use of them for the comfortable support of that, 
 so that it may be fit to serve the soul and able to keep pace with it 
 in the service of God, then they turn to a good account. <I>There
 is</I> therefore <I>nothing better for a man,</I> as to these things, 
 than to allow himself a sober cheerful use of them, according as his 
 rank and condition are, to have meat and drink out of them for himself, 
 his family, his friends, and so delight his senses and make his <I>soul 
 enjoy good,</I> all the good that is to be had out of them; do not lose 
 that, in pursuit of that good which is not to be had out of them. But 
 observe, He would not have us to give up business, and take our ease, 
 that we may <I>eat and drink;</I> no, we must <I>enjoy good in our 
 labour;</I> we must use these things, not to excuse us from, but to 
 make us diligent and cheerful in, our worldly business.

 (3.) We must herein <I>acknowledge God;</I> we must see that <I>it is 
 from the hand of God,</I> that is, 

 [1.] The <I>good things</I> themselves that we enjoy are so, not only 
 the products of his creating power, but the gifts of his providential 
 bounty to us. And <I>then</I> they are truly pleasant to us when we 
 take them from the hand of God as a Father, when we eye his wisdom 
 giving us that which is fittest for us, and acquiesce in it, and taste 
 his love and goodness, relish them, and are thankful for them. 

 [2.] A heart to enjoy them is so; this is the gift of God's grace.
 Unless he give us wisdom to make a right use of what he has, in his 
 providence, bestowed upon us, and withal peace of conscience, that we 
 may discern God's favour in the world's smiles, we cannot make our 
 souls enjoy any good in them.</P>

 2. Why we should have this in our eye, in the management of ourselves 
 as to this world, and look up to God for it. 

 (1.) Because Solomon himself, with all his possessions, could aim at no
 more and desire no better

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Who can hasten to this more than I?</I> This is that which I was
 ambitious of: I wished for no more; and those that have but little, in 
 comparison with what I have, may attain to this, to be content with 
 what they have and enjoy the good of it." Yet Solomon could not obtain 
 it by his own wisdom, without the special grace of God, and therefore 
 directs us to expect it from the hand of God and pray to him for it.

 (2.) Because riches are a blessing or a curse to a man according as he 
 has or has not a heart to make good use of them.

 [1.] God makes them a reward to a good man, if with them he give him 
 <I>wisdom, and knowledge, and joy,</I> to enjoy them cheerfully himself 
 and to communicate them charitably to others. To those who are <I>good 
 in God's sight,</I> who are of a good spirit, honest and sincere, pay a 
 deference to their God and have a tender concern for all mankind, 
 <I>God will give wisdom and knowledge in this world, and joy with the 
 righteous in the world to come;</I> so the Chaldee. Or he will give 
 that wisdom and knowledge in things natural, moral, political, and 
 divine, which will be a constant joy and pleasure to them. 

 [2.] He makes them a punishment to a bad man if he denies him a heart
 to take the comfort of them, for they do but tantalize him and 
 tyrannize over him: <I>To the sinner God gives by travail,</I> by 
 leaving him to himself and his own foolish counsels, to <I>gather and 
 to heap up</I> that, which, as to himself, will not only burden him 
 like <I>thick clay</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:6">Hab. ii. 6</A>),

 but be <I>a witness against him and eat his flesh as it were fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3">Jam. v. 3</A>);

 while God designs, by an overruling providence, to give it to him that
 is <I>good before him;</I> for the <I>wealth of the sinner is laid up 
 for the just,</I> and <I>gathered for him that will pity the poor.</I> 
 Note, <I>First, Godliness, with contentment, is great gain;</I> and 
 <I>those</I> only have true joy that are <I>good in God's sight,</I> 
 and that have it from him and in him. <I>Secondly,</I> Ungodliness is 
 commonly punished with discontent and an insatiable covetousness, which 
 are sins that are their own punishment. <I>Thirdly,</I> When God gives 
 abundance to wicked men it is with design to force them to a 
 resignation in favour of his own children, when they are of age and 
 ready for it, as the Canaanites kept possession of the good land till 
 the time appointed for Israel's entering upon it. 

 [3.] The burden of the song is still the same: <I>This is also vanity
 and vexation of spirit.</I> It is vanity, at the best, even to the good 
 man; when he has all that the sinner has scraped together it will not 
 make him happy without something else; but it is <I>vexation of 
 spirit</I> to the sinner to see what he had laid up enjoyed by him that 
 is <I>good in God's sight,</I> and therefore evil in his. So that, take 
 it which way you will, the conclusion is firm, <I>All is vanity and 
 vexation of spirit.</I></P>
