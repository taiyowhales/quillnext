 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was with reference to some great and surprising deliverance of the
 people of God out of bondage and distress that this psalm was penned,
 most likely their return out of Babylon in Ezra's time. Though Babylon
 be not mentioned here (as it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1-9">Ps. cxxxvii.</A>)

 yet their captivity there was the most remarkable captivity both in
 itself and as their return out of it was typical of our redemption by
 Christ. Probably this psalm was penned by Ezra, or some of the prophets
 that came up with the first. We read of singers of the children of
 Asaph, that famous psalmist, who returned then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:41">Ezra ii. 41</A>.

 It being a song of ascents, in which the same things are twice repeated 
 with advancement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2,3,4,5">ver. 2, 3,
 and ver. 4, 5</A>),

 it is put here among the rest of the psalms that bear that title.

 I. Those that had returned out of captivity are here called upon to be
 thankful,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Those that were yet remaining in captivity are here prayed for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:4">ver. 4</A>)

 and encouraged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 It will be easy, in singing this psalm, to apply it either to any 
 particular deliverance wrought for the church or our own land or to the 
 great work of our salvation by Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> turned again the
 captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
 &nbsp; 2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
 singing: then said they among the heathen, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done
 great things for them.
 &nbsp; 3  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done great things for us; <I>whereof</I> we are

 While the people of Israel were captives in Babylon their harps were 
 hung upon the willow-trees, for then God called to weeping and 
 mourning, then he mourned unto them and they lamented; but now that 
 their captivity is turned they resume their harps; Providence pipes to 
 them, and they dance. Thus must we accommodate ourselves to all the 
 dispensations of Providence and be suitably affected with them. And the 
 harps are never more melodiously tunable than after such a melancholy 
 disuse. The long want of mercies greatly sweetens their return. Here 
 is, 

 1. The deliverance God has wrought for them: He <I>turned again the
 captivity of Zion.</I> It is possible that Zion may be in captivity for 
 the punishment of her degeneracy, but her captivity shall be turned 
 again when the end is answered and the work designed by it is effected.
 Cyrus, for reasons of state, proclaimed liberty to God's captives, and 
 yet it was <I>the Lord's doing,</I> according to his word many years 
 before. God sent them into captivity, not as dross is put into the fire 
 to be consumed, but as gold to be refined. Observe, The release of 
 Israel is called <I>the turning again of the captivity of Zion,</I> the 
 holy hill, where God's tabernacle and dwelling-place were; for the 
 restoring of their sacred interests, and the reviving of the public 
 exercise of their religion, were the most valuable advantages of their 
 return out of captivity. 

 2. The pleasing surprise that this was to them. They were amazed at it; 
 it came so suddenly that at first they were in confusion, not knowing 
 what to make of it, nor what it was tending to: "We thought ourselves 
 <I>like men that dream;</I> we thought it too good news to be true, and 
 began to question whether we were well awake or no, and whether it was 
 not still" (as sometimes it had been to the prophets) "only a 
 representation of it in vision," as St. Peter for a while thought his 
 deliverance was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:9">Acts xii. 9</A>.

 Sometimes the people of God are thus prevented with the blessings of 
 his goodness before they are aware. <I>We were like those that are
 recovered to health</I> (so Dr. Hammond reads it); "such a comfortable 
 happy change it was to us, as life from the dead or sudden ease from 
 exquisite pain; we thought ourselves in a new world." And the surprise 
 of it put them into such an ecstasy and transport of joy that they 
 could scarcely contain themselves within the bounds of decency in the 
 expressions of it: <I>Our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue 
 with singing.</I> Thus they gave vent to their joy, gave glory to their 
 God, and gave notice to all about them what wonders God had wrought for 
 them. Those that were laughed at now laugh and a <I>new song is put 
 into their mouths.</I> It was a laughter of joy in God, not scorn of 
 their enemies. 

 3. The notice which their neighbours took of it: <I>They said among the
 heathen,</I> Jehovah, the God of Israel, <I>has done great things</I> 
 for that people, such as our gods cannot do for us. The heathen had
 observed their calamity and had triumphed in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:8,9,Ps+137:7">Jer. xxii. 8, 9; Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>.

 Now they could not but observe their deliverance and admire that. It 
 put a reputation upon those that had been scorned and despised, and 
 made them look considerable; besides, it turned greatly to the honour 
 of God, and extorted from those that set up other gods in competition 
 with him an acknowledgment of his wisdom, power, and providence. 

 4. The acknowledgments which they themselves made of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The heathen were but spectators, and spoke of it only as matter of
 news; they had no part nor lot in the matter; but the people of God 
 spoke of it as sharers in it,

 (1.) With application: "He has <I>done great things for us,</I> things 
 that we are interested in and have advantage by." Thus it is 
 comfortable speaking of the redemption Christ has wrought out as 
 wrought out for us. <I>Who loved me, and gave himself for me.</I> 

 (2.) With affection: "<I>Whereof we are glad.</I> The heathen are 
 amazed at it, and some of them angry, but we are glad." While Israel 
 went a whoring from their God joy was forbidden them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1">Hos. ix. 1</A>);

 but now that the iniquity of Jacob was purged by the captivity, and 
 their sin taken away, now God makes them to rejoice. It is the 
 repenting reforming people that are, and shall be, the rejoicing 
 people. Observe here, 

 [1.] God's appearances for his people are to be looked upon as great 
 things.

 [2.] God is to be eyed as the author of all the great things done for 
 the church.

 [3.] It is good to observe how the church's deliverances are for us, 
 that we may rejoice in them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Turn again our captivity, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as the streams in the
 south.
 &nbsp; 5  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

 doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves <I>with
 him.</I>

 These verses look forward to the mercies that were yet wanted. Those 
 that had come out of captivity were still in distress, even in their 
 own land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3">Neh. i. 3</A>),

 and many yet remained in Babylon; and therefore they rejoiced with 
 trembling, and bore upon their hearts the grievances that were yet to 
 be redressed. We have here, 

 1. A prayer for the perfecting of their deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Turn again our captivity.</I> Let those that have returned to their
 own land be eased of the burdens which they are yet groaning under. Let 
 those that remain in Babylon have their hearts stirred up, as ours 
 were, to take the benefit of the liberty granted." The beginnings of 
 mercy are encouragements to us to pray for the completing of it. And 
 while we are here in this world there will still be matter for prayer, 
 even when we are most furnished with matter for praise. And, when we 
 are free and in prosperity ourselves, we must not be unmindful of our 
 brethren that are in trouble and under restraint. The bringing of those 
 that were yet in captivity to join with their brethren that had 
 returned would be as welcome to both sides as streams of water in those 
 countries, which, lying far south, were parched and dry. As cold water 
 to a thirsty soul, so would this good news be from that far country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:25">Prov. xxv. 25</A>.

 2. A promise for their encouragement to wait for it, assuring them 
 that, though they had now a sorrowful time, yet it would end well. But 
 the promise is expressed generally, that all the saints may comfort 
 themselves with this confidence, that their seedness of tears will 
 certainly end in a harvest of joy at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 (1.) Suffering saints have a seedness of tears. They are in tears 
 often; they share in the calamities of human life, and commonly have a 
 greater share in them than others. But they <I>sow in tears;</I> they 
 do the duty of an afflicted state and so answer the intentions of the 
 providences they are under. Weeping must not hinder sowing; when we 
 suffer ill we must be doing well. Nay, as the ground is by the rain 
 prepared for the seed, and the husbandman sometimes chooses to sow in 
 the wet, so we must improve times of affliction, as disposing us to 
 repentance, and prayer, and humiliation. Nay, there are tears which are 
 themselves the seed that we must sow, tears of sorrow for sin, our own 
 and others, tears of sympathy with the afflicted church, and the tears 
 of tenderness in prayer and under the word. These are precious seed, 
 such as the husbandman sows when corn is dear and he has but little for 
 his family, and therefore weeps to part with it, yet buries it under 
 ground, in expectation of receiving it again with advantage. Thus does 
 a good man sow in tears. 

 (2.) They shall have a harvest of joy. The troubles of the saints will 
 not last always, but, when they have done their work, shall have a 
 happy period. The captives in Babylon were long sowing in tears, but at 
 length they were brought forth with joy, and then they reaped the 
 benefit of their patient suffering, and brought their sheaves with them 
 to their own land, in their experiences of the goodness of God to them. 
 Job, and Joseph, and David, and many others, had harvests of joy after 
 a sorrowful seedness. Those that sow in the tears of godly sorrow shall 
 reap in the joy of a sealed pardon and a settled peace. Those that 
 <I>sow to the spirit,</I> in this vale of tears, <I>shall of the spirit 
 reap life everlasting,</I> and that will be a joyful harvest indeed. 
 <I>Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be</I> for ever 
 <I>comforted.</I></P>
