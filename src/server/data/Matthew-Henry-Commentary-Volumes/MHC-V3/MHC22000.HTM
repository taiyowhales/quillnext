 All <I>scripture,</I> we are sure, <I>is given by inspiration of God,
 and is profitable</I> for the support and advancement of the interests 
 of his kingdom among men, and it is never the less so for there being 
 found in it some things <I>dark and hard to be understood, which those 
 that are unlearned and unstable wrest to their own destruction.</I> In 
 our belief both of the divine extraction and of the spiritual 
 exposition of this book we are confirmed by the ancient, constant, and 
 concurring testimony both of the church of the Jews, to whom were 
 <I>committed the oracles of God,</I> and who never made any doubt of 
 the authority of this book, and of the Christian church, which happily 
 succeeds them in that trust and honour. 

 I. It must be confessed, on the one hand, that if he who barely reads 
 this book be asked, as the eunuch was <I>Understandest thou what thou 
 readest?</I> he will have more reason than he had to say, <I>How can I, 
 except some man shall guide me?</I> The books of scripture-history and 
 prophecy are very much like one another, but this <I>Song of 
 Solomon's</I> is very much unlike the songs of his father David; here 
 is not the name of God in it; it is never quoted in the New Testament; 
 we find not in it any expressions of natural religion or pious 
 devotion, no, nor is it introduced by vision, or any of the marks of 
 immediate revelation. It seems as hard as any part of scripture to be 
 made a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> nay, and to those who come to 
 the reading of it with carnal minds and corrupt affections, it is in 
 danger of being made a <I>savour of death unto death;</I> it is a 
 flower out of which they extract poison; and therefore the Jewish 
 doctors advised their young people not to read it till they were thirty 
 years old, lest by the abuse of that which is most pure and sacred 
 (<I>horrendum dictu--horrible to say!</I>) the flames of lust should be 
 kindled with fire from heaven, which is intended for the altar only. 
 But, 

 II. It must be confessed, on the other hand, that with the help of the
 many faithful guides we have for the understanding of this book it 
 appears to be a very bright and powerful ray of heavenly light, 
 admirable fitted to excite pious and devout affections in holy souls, 
 to draw out their desires towards God, to increase their delight in 
 him, and improve their acquaintance and communion with him. It is an 
 allegory, the letter of which kills those who rest in that and look no 
 further, but the spirit of which gives life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:6,Joh+6:63">2 Cor. iii. 6; John vi. 63</A>.

 It is a parable, which makes divine things more difficult to those who
 do not love them, but more plain and pleasant to those who do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:14,16">Matt. xiii. 14, 16</A>.

 Experienced Christians here find a counterpart of their experiences,
 and to them it is intelligible, while <I>those</I> neither understand 
 it nor relish it who have no part nor lot in the matter. It is a song,
 an <I>Epithalamium,</I> or nuptial song, wherein, by the expressions of 
 love between a bridegroom and his bride, are set forth and illustrated 
 the mutual affections that pass between God and a distinguished remnant 
 of mankind. It is a pastoral; the bride and bridegroom, for the more 
 lively representation of humility and innocence, are brought in as a 
 shepherd and his shepherdess. Now,

 1. This song might easily be taken in a spiritual sense by the Jewish 
 church, for whose use it was first composed, and was so taken, as 
 appears by the Chaldee-Paraphrase and the most ancient Jewish 
 expositors. God betrothed the people of Israel to himself; he entered 
 into covenant with them, and it was a marriage-covenant. He had given 
 abundant proofs of his love to them, and required of them that they 
 should love him with all their heart and soul. Idolatry was often 
 spoken of as spiritual adultery, and doting upon idols, to prevent 
 which this song was penned, representing the complacency which God took 
 in Israel and which Israel ought to take in God, and encouraging them 
 to continue faithful to him, though he might seem sometimes to withdraw 
 and hide himself from them, and to wait for the further manifestation 
 of himself in the promised Messiah. 

 2. It may more easily be taken in a spiritual sense by the Christian 
 church, because the condescensions and communications of divine love 
 appear more rich and free under the gospel than they did under the law, 
 and the communion between heaven and earth more familiar. God sometimes 
 spoke of himself as the husband of the Jewish church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:5,Ho+2:16,19">Isa. lxiv. 5, Hos. ii. 16, 19</A>),
 
 and rejoiced in it as his bride,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:4,5">Isa. lxii. 4, 5</A>.

 But more frequently is Christ represented as the bridegroom of his
 church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:1,Ro+7:4,2Co+11:2,Eph+5:32">Matt. xxv. 1;
 Rom. vii. 4; 2 Cor. xi. 2; Eph. v. 32</A>),

 and the church as the bride, the Lamb's wife, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7,21:2,9">Rev. xix. 7; xxi. 2, 9</A>.
 
 Pursuant to this metaphor Christ and the church in general, Christ and
 particular believers, are here discoursing with abundance of mutual 
 esteem and endearment. The best key to this book is the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">45th Psalm</A>,

 which we find applied to Christ in the New Testament, and therefore 
 this ought to be so too. It requires some pains to find out what may, 
 probably, be the meaning of the Holy Spirit in the several parts of 
 this book; as David's songs are many of them level to the capacity of 
 the meanest, and there are shallows in them learned, and there are 
 depths in it in which an elephant may swim. But, when the meaning is
 found out, it will be of admirable use to excite pious and devout 
 affections in us; and the same truths which are plainly laid down in 
 other scriptures when they are extracted out of this come to the soul 
 with a more pleasing power. When we apply ourselves to the study of 
 this book we must not only, with Moses and Joshua, <I>put off our shoe 
 from off our foot,</I> and even forget that we have bodies, because 
 <I>the place where we stand is holy ground,</I> but we must, with John, 
 <I>come up hither,</I> must spread our wings, take a noble flight, and 
 soar upwards, till by faith and holy love we <I>enter into the 
 holiest,</I> for <I>this is no other than the house of God and this is 
 the gate of heaven.</I></P>
