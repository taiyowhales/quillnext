 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a psalm by itself, like none of the rest; it excels them all, 
 and shines brightest in this constellation. It is much longer than any 
 of them more than twice as long as any of them. It is not making long 
 prayers that Christ censures, but making them for a pretence, which
 intimates that they are in themselves good and commendable. It seems to
 me to be a collection of David's pious and devout ejaculations, the 
 short and sudden breathings and elevations of his soul to God, which he 
 wrote down as they occurred, and, towards the latter end of his time, 
 gathered out of his day-book where they lay scattered, added to them 
 many like words, and digested them into this psalm, in which there is 
 seldom any coherence between the verses, but, like Solomon's proverbs, 
 it is a chest of gold rings, not a chain of gold links. And we may not 
 only learn, by the psalmist's example, to accustom ourselves to such 
 pious ejaculations, which are an excellent means of maintaining 
 constant communion with God, and keeping the heart in frame for the 
 more solemn exercises of religion, but we must make use of the 
 psalmist's words, both for the exciting and for the expressing of our 
 devout affections; what some have said of this psalm is true, "He that 
 shall read it considerately, it will either warm him or shame him." The 
 composition of it is singular and very exact. It is divided into 
 twenty-two parts, according to the number of the letters of the Hebrew 
 alphabet, and each part consists of eight verses, all the verses of the 
 first part beginning with Aleph, all the verses of the second with 
 Beth, and so on, without any flaw throughout the whole psalm. 
 Archbishop Tillotson says, It seems to have more of poetical skill and 
 number in it than we at this distance can easily understand. Some have 
 called it the saints' alphabet; and it were to be wished we had it as 
 ready in our memories as the very letters of our alphabet, as ready as 
 our A B C. Perhaps the penman found it of use to himself to observe 
 this method, as it obliged him to seek for thoughts, and search for 
 them, that he might fill up the quota of every part; and the letter he 
 was to begin with might lead him to a word which might suggest a good 
 sentence; and all little enough to raise any thing that is good in the 
 barren soil of our hearts. However, it would be of use to the learners, 
 a help to them both in committing it to memory and in calling it to 
 mind upon occasion; by the letter the first word would be got, and that 
 would bring in the whole verse; thus young people would the more easily 
 learn it by heart and retain it the better even in old age. If any
 censure it as childish and trifling, because acrostics are now quite 
 out of fashion, let them know that the royal psalmist despises their 
 censure; he is a teacher of babes, and, if this method may be 
 beneficial to them, he can easily stoop to it; if this to be vile, he 
 will be yet more vile.</P>

 II. The general scope and design of it is to magnify the law, and make 
 it honourable; to set forth the excellency and usefulness of divine 
 revelation, and to recommend it to us, not only for the entertainment, 
 but for the government, of ourselves, by the psalmist's own example, 
 who speaks by experience of the benefit of it, and of the good 
 impressions made upon him by it, for which he praises God, and 
 earnestly prays, from first to last, for the continuance of God's grace 
 with him, to direct and quicken him in the way of his duty. There are 
 ten different words by which divine revelation is called in this psalm, 
 and they are synonymous, each of them expressive of the whole compass 
 of it (both that which tells us what God expects from us and that which 
 tells us that we may expect from him) and of the system of religion 
 which is founded upon it and guided by it. The things contained in the 
 scripture, and drawn from it, are here called, 

 1. God's law, because they are enacted by him as our Sovereign. 

 2. His way, because they are the rule both of his providence and of
 our obedience. 

 3. His testimonies, because they are solemnly declared to the world and 
 attested beyond contradiction. 

 4. His commandments, because given with authority, and (as the word 
 signifies) lodged with us as a trust. 

 5. His precepts, because prescribed to us and not left indifferent.

 6. His word, or saying, because it is the declaration of his mind, and
 Christ, the essential eternal Word, is all in all in it.

 7. His judgments, because framed in infinite wisdom, and because by 
 them we must both judge and be judged.

 8. His righteousness, because it is all holy, just, and good, and the
 rule and standard of righteousness. 

 9. His statutes, because they are fixed and determined, and of
 perpetual obligation. His truth, or faithfulness, because the 
 principles upon which the divine law is built are eternal truths. And I 
 think there is but one verse (it is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:122">ver. 122</A>)

 in all this long psalm in which there is not one or other of these ten 
 words; only in three or four they are used concerning God's providence 
 or David's practice (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:75,84,121">ver. 75, 84, 121</A>),

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:132">ver. 132</A>

 they are called God's name. The great esteem and affection David had 
 for the word of God is the more admirable considering how little he had 
 of it, in comparison with what we have, no more perhaps in writing than 
 the first books of Moses, which were but the dawning of this day, which 
 may shame us who enjoy the full discoveries of divine revelation and 
 yet are so cold towards it. In singing this psalm there is work for all 
 the devout affections of a sanctified soul, so copious, so various, is 
 the matter of it. We here find that in which we must give glory to God 
 both as our ruler and great benefactor, that in which we are to teach 
 and admonish ourselves and one another (so many are the instructions 
 which we here find about a religious life), and that in which we are to 
 comfort and encourage ourselves and one another, so many are the sweet 
 experiences of one that lived such a life. Here is something or other 
 to suit the case of every Christian. Is any afflicted? Is any merry? 
 Each will find that here which is proper for him. And it is so far from 
 being a tedious repetition of the same thing, as may seem to those who 
 look over it cursorily, that, if we duly meditate upon it, we shall 
 find almost every verse has a new thought and something in it very 
 lively. And this, as many other of David's psalms, teaches us to be
 sententious in our devotions, both alone and when others join with us; 
 for, ordinarily, the affections, especially of weaker Christians, are 
 more likely to be raised and kept by short expressions, the sense of 
 which lies in a little compass, than by long and laboured periods.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here shows that godly people are happy people; they are, 
 and shall be, blessed indeed. Felicity is the thing we all pretend to 
 aim at and pursue. He does not say here wherein it consists; it is 
 enough for us to know what we must do and be that we may attain to it, 
 and that we are here told. All men would be happy, but few take the 
 right way; God has here laid before us the right way, which we may be
 sure will end in happiness, though it be strait and narrow.
 Blessednesses are to the righteous; all manner of blessedness. Now
 observe the characters of the happy people. Those are happy,

 1. Who make the will of God the rule of all their actions, and govern
 themselves, in their whole conversation, by that rule: They <I>walk in
 the law of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 God's word is a law to them, not only in this or that instance, but in
 the whole course of their conversation; they walk within the hedges of
 that law, which they dare not break through by doing any thing it
 forbids; and they walk in the paths of that law, which they will not
 trifle in, but <I>press forward</I> in them <I>towards the mark,</I>
 taking every step by rule and never walking at all adventures. This is
 <I>walking in God's ways</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 the ways which he has marked out to us and has appointed us to walk in. 
 It will not serve us to make religion the subject of our discourse, but 
 we must make it the rule of our walk; we must walk <I>in his ways,</I> 
 not in the way of the world, or of our own hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:10,11,31:7">Job xxiii. 10, 11; xxxi. 7</A>.

 2. Who are upright and honest in their religion--<I>undefiled in the
 way,</I> not only who keep themselves pure from the pollutions of 
 actual sin, <I>unspotted from the world,</I> but who are habitually 
 sincere in their intentions, <I>in whose spirit there is no guile,</I> 
 who are really as good as they seem to be and row the same way as they 
 look. 

 3. Who are true to the trust reposed in them as God's professing 
 people. It was the honour of the Jews that <I>to them were committed 
 the oracles of God;</I> and blessed are those who preserve pure and 
 entire that sacred deposit, <I>who keep his testimonies</I> as a 
 treasure of inestimable value, keep them as the apple of their eye, so 
 keep them as to carry the comfort of them themselves to another world 
 and leave the knowledge and profession of them to those who shall come 
 after them in this world. Those who would <I>walk in the law of the 
 Lord</I> must <I>keep his testimonies,</I> that is, his truths. Those 
 will not long make conscience of good practices who do not adhere to 
 good principles. Or <I>his testimonies</I> may denote his covenant; the 
 ark of the covenant is called <I>the ark of the testimony.</I> Those do 
 not keep covenant with God who do not keep the commandments of God.

 4. Who have a single eye to God as their chief good and highest end in
 all they do in religion
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 They <I>seek him with their whole
 heart.</I> They do not seek themselves and their own things, but God 
 only; this is that which they aim at, that God may be glorified in 
 their obedience and that they may be happy in God's acceptance. He is,
 and will be, the rewarder, the reward, of all those who thus <I>seek 
 him diligently, seek him with the heart,</I> for that is it that God 
 looks at and requires; and <I>with the whole heart,</I> for if the 
 heart be divided between him and the world it is faulty. 

 5. Who carefully avoid all sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They do no iniquity;</I> they do not allow themselves in any sin; 
 they do not commit it as those do who are the servants of sin; they do 
 not make a practice of it, do not make a trade of it. They are 
 conscious to themselves of much iniquity that clogs them in the ways of 
 God, but not of that iniquity which draws them out of those ways. 
 Blessed and holy are those who thus exercise themselves <I>to have 
 always consciences void of offence.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Thou hast commanded <I>us</I> to keep thy precepts diligently.
 &nbsp; 5  O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

 commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught, 

 1. To own ourselves under the highest obligations to walk in God's law. 
 The tempter would possess men with an opinion that they are at their 
 liberty whether they will make the word of God their rule or no, that, 
 though it may be good, yet it is not so necessary as they are made to 
 believe it is. He taught our first parents to question the command: 
 <I>Hath God said, You shall not eat?</I> And therefore we are concerned 
 to be well established in this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts,</I> to make religion 
 our rule; and <I>to keep</I> them <I>diligently,</I> to make religion 
 our business and to mind it carefully and constantly. We are bound, and 
 must obey at our peril. 

 2. To look up to God for wisdom and grace to do so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>O that my ways were directed</I> accordingly! not only that all
 events concerning us may be so ordered and disposed by the providence 
 of God as not to be in any thing a hindrance to us, but a furtherance 
 rather, in the service of God, but that our hearts may be so guided and 
 influenced by the Spirit of God that we may not in any thing transgress 
 God's commandments--not only that our eyes may be directed to behold 
 God's statutes, but our hearts directed to keep them. See how the 
 desire and prayer of a good man exactly agree with the will and command 
 of a good God: "Thou wouldest have me keep thy precepts, and, Lord, I 
 fain would keep them." <I>This is the will of God, even our 
 sanctification;</I> and it should be our will. 

 3. To encourage ourselves in the way of our duty with a prospect of the 
 comfort we shall find in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) It is the undoubted character of every good man that he has a 
 <I>respect to all</I> God's <I>commandments.</I> He has a respect to 
 the command, eyes it as his copy, aims to conform to it, is sorry 
 wherein he comes short; and what he does in religion he does with a 
 conscientious regard to the command, because it is his duty. He has 
 <I>respect to all</I> the <I>commandments,</I> one as well as another, 
 because they are all backed with the same authority 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:10,11">Jam. ii. 10, 11</A>)

 and all levelled at the same end, the glorifying of God in our 
 happiness. Those who have a sincere respect to any command will have a
 general respect to every command, to the commands of both testaments 
 and both tables, to the prohibitions and the precepts, to those that 
 concern both the inward and the outward man, both the head and the 
 heart, to those that forbid the most pleasant and gainful sins and to 
 those that require the most difficult and hazardous duties.

 (2.) Those who have a sincere <I>respect to all</I> God's 
 <I>commandments shall not be ashamed,</I> not only they will thereby be 
 kept from doing that which will turn to their shame, but they shall 
 have <I>confidence towards God</I> and boldness of access to the throne 
 of his grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21">1 John iii. 21</A>.

 They shall have credit before men; their honesty will be their honour. 
 And they shall have clearness and courage in their own souls; they 
 shall not be ashamed to retire into themselves, nor to reflect upon 
 themselves, for their hearts shall not condemn them. David speaks this 
 with application to himself. Those that are upright may take the 
 comfort of their uprightness. "As, if I be wicked, woe to me; so, if I 
 be sincere, it is well with me."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_7"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
 have learned thy righteous judgments.
 &nbsp; 8  I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's endeavour to perfect himself in his religion, and to make 
 himself (as we say) master of his business. He hopes to <I>learn</I> 
 God's <I>righteous judgments.</I> He knew much, but he was still 
 pressing forward and desired to know more, as knowing this, that <I>he 
 had not yet attained;</I> but as far as perfection is attainable in 
 this life he reached towards it, and would not take up short of it. As
 long as we live we must be scholars in Christ's school, and sit at his 
 feet; but we should aim to be head-scholars, and to get into the 
 highest form. God's judgments are all righteous, and therefore it is 
 desirable not only to learn them, but to be learned in them, <I>mighty 
 in the scriptures.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The use he would make of his divine learning. He coveted to be 
 learned in the laws of God, not that he might make himself a name and 
 interest among men, or fill his own head with entertaining 
 speculations, but, 

 1. That he might give God the glory of his learning: <I>I will praise 
 thee when I have learned thy judgments,</I> intimating that he could 
 not learn unless God taught him, and that divine instructions are 
 special blessings, which we have reason to be thankful for. Though 
 Christ keeps a free-school, and teaches without money and without 
 price, yet he expects his scholars should give him thanks both for his 
 word and for his Spirit; surely it is a mercy worth thanks to be taught 
 so gainful a calling as religion is. Those have learned a good lesson 
 who have learned to praise God, for that is the work of angels, the 
 work of heaven. It is an easy thing to praise God in word and tongue; 
 but those only are well learned in this mystery who have learned to 
 <I>praise</I> him <I>with uprightness of heart,</I> that is, are inward 
 with him in praising him, and sincerely aim at his glory in the course 
 of their conversation as well as in the exercises of devotion. God 
 accepts only the praises of the upright. 

 2. That he might himself come under the government of that learning: 
 <I>When I shall have learned thy righteous judgments I will keep thy 
 statutes.</I> We cannot keep them unless we learn them; but we learn 
 them in vain if we do not keep them. Those have well learned God's
 statutes who have come up to a full resolution, in the strength of his 
 grace, to keep them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His prayer to God not to leave him: "<I>O forsake me not!</I> that 
 is, leave me not to myself, withdraw not thy Spirit and grace from me, 
 for then <I>I shall</I> not <I>keep thy statutes.</I>" Good men see 
 themselves undone if God forsakes them; for then the tempter will be 
 too hard for them. "Though thou seem to forsake me, and threaten to 
 forsake me, and dost, for a time, withdraw from me, yet let not the 
 desertion be total and final; for that is hell. <I>O forsake me not 
 utterly!</I> for woe unto me if God departs from me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by
 taking heed <I>thereto</I> according to thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. A weighty question asked. By what means may the next generation be 
 made better than this? <I>Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his 
 way?</I> Cleansing implies that it is polluted. Besides the original 
 corruption we all brought into the world with us (from which we are not 
 cleansed unto this day), there are many particular sins which young 
 people are subject to, by which they defile their way, <I>youthful 
 lusts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:22">2 Tim. ii. 22</A>);

 these render their way offensive to God and disgraceful to themselves. 
 Young men are concerned to cleanse their way--to get their hearts 
 renewed and their lives reformed, to make clean, and keep clean, from 
 the <I>corruption that is in the world through lust,</I> that they may 
 have both a good conscience and a good name. Few young people do 
 themselves enquire by what means they may recover and preserve their 
 purity; and therefore David asks the question for them.

 2. A satisfactory answer given to this question. Young men may
 effectually <I>cleanse their way by taking heed thereto according 
 to</I> the word of God; and it is the honour of the word of God that it 
 has such power and is of such use both to particular persons and to 
 communities, whose happiness lies much in the virtue of their youth.

 (1.) Young men must make the word of God their rule, must acquaint 
 themselves with it and resolve to conform themselves to it; that will 
 do more towards the cleansing of young men than the laws of princes or
 the morals of philosophers. 

 (2.) They must carefully apply that rule and make use of it; they must 
 take heed to their way, must examine it by the word of God, as a 
 touchstone and standard, must rectify what is amiss in it by that 
 regulator and steer by that chart and compass. God's word will not do
 without our watchfulness, and a constant regard both to it and to our 
 way, that we may compare them together. The ruin of young men is either 
 living at large (or by no rule at all) or choosing to themselves false 
 rules: let them ponder the path of their feet, and walk by 
 scripture-rules; so their way shall be clean, and they shall have the 
 comfort and credit of it here and for ever.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
 from thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's experience of a good work God had wrought in him, which he 
 takes the comfort of and pleads with God: "<I>I have sought thee,</I> 
 sought to thee as my oracle, sought after thee as my happiness, sought 
 thee as my God; for <I>should not a people seek unto their God?</I> If 
 I have not yet found thee, <I>I have sought thee,</I> and thou never 
 saidst, Seek in vain, nor wilt say so to me, for <I>I have sought thee 
 with my heart, with my whole heart,</I> sought thee only, sought thee 
 diligently." 

 2. His prayer for the preservation of that work: "Thou that hast 
 inclined me to seek thy precepts, never suffer me to wander from them." 
 The best are sensible of their aptness to wander; and the more we have 
 found of the pleasure there is in keeping God's commandments the more 
 afraid we shall be of wandering from them and the more earnest we shall 
 be in prayer to God for his grace to prevent our wanderings.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
 against thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The close application which David made of the word of God to 
 himself: <I>He hid it in his heart,</I> laid it up there, that it might 
 be ready to him whenever he had occasion to use it; he laid it up as 
 that which he valued highly, and had a warm regard for, and which he 
 was afraid of losing and being robbed of. God's word is a treasure 
 worth laying up, and there is no laying it up safely but in our hearts; 
 if we have it only in our houses and hands, enemies may take it from 
 us; if only in our heads, our memories may fail us: but if our hearts 
 be delivered into the mould of it, and the impressions of it remain on 
 our souls, it is safe. 

 2. The good uses he designed to make of it: <I>That I might not sin 
 against thee.</I> Good men are afraid of sin, and are in care to 
 prevent it; and the most effectual way to prevent is to hide God's word 
 in our hearts, that we may answer every temptation, as our Master did, 
 with, <I>It is written,</I> may oppose God's precepts to the dominion 
 of sin, his promises to its allurements, and his threatenings to its 
 menaces.</P>

 Here, 

 1. David gives glory to God: "<I>Blessed art thou, O Lord!</I> Thou art 
 infinitely happy in the enjoyment of thyself and hast no need of me or 
 my services; yet thou art pleased to reckon thyself honoured by them; 
 assist me therefore, and then accept me." In all our prayers we should 
 intermix praises. 

 2. He asks grace from God: "<I>Teach me thy statutes;</I> give me to 
 know and do my duty in every thing. Thou art the fountain of all 
 blessedness; O let me have this drop from that fountain, this blessing 
 from that blessedness: <I>Teach me thy statutes,</I> that I may know

 thee."</P>

 I. David looks back with comfort upon the respect he had paid to the 
 word of God. He had the testimony of his conscience for him, 

 1. That he had edified others with what he had been taught out of the
 word of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</I> 
 This he did, not only as a king in making orders, and giving judgment, 
 according to the word of God, nor only as a prophet by his psalms, but 
 in his common discourse. Thus he showed how full he was of the word of 
 God, and what a holy delight he took in his acquaintance with it; for 
 it is <I>out of the abundance of the heart</I> that <I>the mouth 
 speaks.</I> Thus he did good with his knowledge; he did not hide God's 
 word from others, but hid it for them; and, out of that <I>good 
 treasure in his heart,</I> brought <I>forth good things,</I> as the 
 householder out of his store <I>things new and old.</I> Those whose 
 hearts are fed with the bread of life should with their lips feed many.
 He had prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 that God would teach him; and here he pleads, "Lord, I have endeavoured 
 to make a good use of the knowledge thou hast given me, therefore 
 increase it;" for <I>to him that has shall be given.</I> 

 2. That he had entertained himself with it: "<I>Lord, teach me thy 
 statutes;</I> for I desire no greater pleasure than to know and do them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I have rejoiced in the way of thy commandments,</I> in a constant 
 even course of obedience to thee; not only in the speculations and 
 histories of thy word, but in the precepts of it, and in that path of 
 serious godliness which they chalk out to me. <I>I have rejoiced in</I> 
 this <I>as much as in all riches,</I> as much as ever any worldling 
 rejoiced in the increase of his wealth. In the way of God's 
 commandments I can truly say, <I>Soul, take thy ease;</I>" in true 
 religion there is all riches, the unsearchable riches of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He looks forward with a holy resolution never to cool in his 
 affection to the word of God; what he <I>does that he will do,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:12">2 Cor. xi. 12</A>.

 Those that have found pleasure in the ways of God are likely to proceed 
 and persevere in them.

 1. He will dwell much upon them in his thoughts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I will meditate in thy precepts.</I> He not only discoursed of them 
 to others (many do that only to show their knowledge and authority), 
 but he communed with his own heart about them, and took pains to digest 
 in his own thoughts what he had declared, or had to declare, to others. 
 Note, God's words ought to be very much the subject of our thoughts. 

 2. He will have them always in his eye: <I>I will have respect unto
 thy ways,</I> as the traveller has to his road, which he is in care not 
 to miss and always aims and endeavours to hit. We do not meditate on 
 God's precepts to good purpose unless we have respect to them as our 
 rule and our good thoughts produce good works and good intentions in 
 them. 

 3. He will take a constant pleasure in communion with God and obedience 
 to him. It is not for a season that he rejoices in this light, but 
 "<I>I will</I> still, I will for ever, <I>delight myself in thy 
 statutes,</I> not only think of them, but do them with delight,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 David took more delight in God's statutes than in the pleasures of his 
 court or the honours of his camp, more than in his sword or in his 
 harp. When the law is written in the heart duty becomes a delight. 

 4. He will never forget what he has learned of the things of God:
 "<I>I will not forget thy word,</I> not only I will not quite forget 
 it, but I will be mindful of it when I have occasion to use it." Those 
 that meditate in God's word, and delight in it, are in no great danger 
 of forgetting it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, <I>that</I> I may live,
 and keep thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught, 

 1. That we owe our lives to God's mercy. David prays, <I>Deal 
 bountifully with</I> me, <I>that I may live.</I> It was God's bounty 
 that gave us life, that gave us this life; and the same bounty that 
 gave it continues it, and gives all the supports and comforts of it; if 
 these be withheld, we die, or, which is equivalent, our lives are 
 embittered and we become weary of them. If God deals in strict justice 
 with us, we die, we perish, we all perish; if these forfeited lives be 
 preserved and prolonged, it is because God deals bountifully with us, 
 according to his mercy, not according to our deserts. The continuance 
 of the most useful life is owing to God's bounty, and on that we must 
 have a continual dependence. 

 2. That therefore we ought to spend our lives in God's service. Life is 
 <I>therefore</I> a choice mercy, because it is an opportunity of 
 obeying God in this world, where there are so few that do glorify him; 
 and this David had in his eye: "Not <I>that I may live</I> and grow 
 rich, live and be merry, but <I>that I may live and keep thy word,</I> 
 may observe it myself and transmit it to those that shall come after, 
 which the longer I live the better I shall do."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out
 of thy law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. That there are <I>wondrous things</I> in God's <I>law,</I> which we 
 are all concerned, and should covet, to <I>behold,</I> not only strange 
 things, which are very surprising and unexpected, but excellent things, 
 which are to be highly esteemed and valued, and things which were long 
 <I>hidden from the wise and prudent,</I> but are now <I>revealed unto 
 babes.</I> If there were wonders in the law, much more in the gospel, 
 where Christ is all in all, whose name is <I>Wonderful.</I> Well may 
 we, who are so nearly interested, desire to behold these wondrous 
 things, when the angels themselves reach <I>to look into them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:12">1 Pet. i. 12</A>.

 Those that would see the wondrous things of God's law and gospel must 
 beg of him to <I>open their eyes</I> and to give them an understanding. 
 We are by nature blind to the things of God, till his grace cause the 
 scales to fall from our eyes; and even those in whose hearts God has 
 said, <I>Let there be light,</I> have yet need to be further 
 enlightened, and must still pray to God to open their eyes yet more and 
 more, that those who at first <I>saw men as trees walking</I> may come 
 to see all things clearly; and the more God opens our eyes the more 
 wonders we see in the word of God, which we saw not before.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_19"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  I <I>am</I> a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments
 from me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. The acknowledgment which David makes of his own condition: <I>I am a 
 stranger in the earth.</I> We all are so, and all good people confess 
 themselves to be so; for heaven is their home, and the world is but 
 their inn, the land of their pilgrimage. David was a man that knew as 
 much of the world, and was as well known in it, as most men. God built 
 him a house, established his throne; strangers submitted to him, and 
 people that he had not known served him; he had a name like the names 
 of the great men, and yet he calls himself a stranger. We are all 
 strangers on earth and must so account ourselves.

 2. The request he makes to God thereupon: <I>Hide not thy commandments 
 from me.</I> He means more: "Lord, show thy commandments to me; let me 
 never know the want of the word of God, but, as long as I live, give me 
 to be growing in my acquaintance with it. <I>I am a stranger,</I> and 
 therefore stand in need of a guide, a guard, a companion, a comforter; 
 let me have thy commandments always in view, for they will be all this 
 to me, all that a poor stranger can desire. <I>I am a stranger</I> 
 here, and must be gone shortly; by thy commandments let me be prepared 
 for my removal hence."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  My soul breaketh for the longing <I>that it hath</I> unto thy
 judgments at all times.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had prayed that God would open his eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)
 
 and open the law
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 now here he pleads the earnestness of his desire for knowledge and 
 grace, for it is the fervent prayer that avails much. 

 1. His desire was importunate: <I>My soul breaketh for the longing it 
 hath to thy judgments,</I> or (as some read it) "<I>It is taken up, and 
 wholly employed, in longing for thy judgments;</I> the whole stream of 
 its desires runs in this channel. I shall think myself quite broken and 
 undone if I want the word of God, the direction, converse, and comfort 
 of it." 

 2. It was constant--<I>at all times.</I> It was not now and then, in a 
 good humour, that he was so fond of the word of God; but it is the 
 habitual temper of every sanctified soul to hunger after the word of 
 God as its necessary food, which there is no living without.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Thou hast rebuked the proud <I>that are</I> cursed, which do err
 from thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The wretched character of wicked people. The temper of their minds 
 is bad. They are <I>proud;</I> they magnify themselves above others. 
 And yet that is not all: they magnify themselves against God, and set 
 up their wills in competition with and opposition to the will of God, 
 as if their hearts, and tongues, and all, were their own. There is
 something of pride at the bottom of every wilful sin, and the tenour of 
 their lives is no better: They <I>do err from thy commandments,</I> as 
 Israel, that did <I>always err in their hearts;</I> they err in 
 judgment, and embrace principles contrary to thy commandments, and then 
 no wonder that they err in practice, and wilfully turn aside out of the 
 good way. This is the effect of their pride; for they say, <I>What is 
 the Almighty, that we should serve him?</I> As Pharaoh, <I>Who is the 
 Lord?</I> 

 2. The wretched case of such. They are certainly cursed, for <I>God 
 resists the proud;</I> and those that throw off the commands of the law 
 lay themselves under its curse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Gal. iii. 10</A>),

 and he that now <I>beholds them afar off</I> will shortly say to them, 
 <I>Go, you cursed.</I> The proud sinners bless themselves; God curses 
 them; and, though the most direful effects of this curse are reserved 
 for the other world, yet they are often severely rebuked in this world: 
 Providence crosses them, vexes them, and, wherein they dealt proudly, 
 God shows himself above them; and these rebukes are earnests of worse. 
 David took notice of the rebukes proud men were under, and it made him 
 cleave the more closely to the word of God and pray the more earnestly 
 that he might not <I>err from God's commandments.</I> Thus saints get 
 good by God's judgments on sinners.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
 testimonies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays against the reproach and contempt of men, that they 
 might be <I>removed,</I> or (as the word is) <I>rolled, from off 
 him.</I> This intimates that they lay upon him, and that neither his 
 greatness nor his goodness could secure him from being libelled and 
 lampooned. Some despised him and endeavoured to make him mean; others 
 reproached him and endeavoured to make him odious. It has often been 
 the lot of those that do well to be ill-spoken of. It intimates that 
 they lay heavily upon him. Hard and foul words indeed break no bones, 
 and yet they are very grievous to a tender and ingenuous spirit; 
 therefore David prays, "Lord, <I>remove</I> them from me, that I may 
 not be thereby either driven from my duty or discouraged in it." God 
 has all men's hearts and tongues in his hand, and can silence lying 
 lips, and raise up a good name that is trodden in the dust. To him we 
 may appeal as the assertor of right and avenger of wrong, and may 
 depend on his promise that he will clear up our <I>righteousness as the 
 light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.

 Reproach and contempt may humble us and do us good and then it shall be 
 removed.

 2. He pleads his constant adherence to the word and way of God: <I>For 
 I have kept thy testimonies.</I> He not only pleads his innocency, that 
 he was unjustly censured, but,

 (1.) That he was jeered for well-doing. He was despised and abused for 
 his strictness and zeal in religion; so that it was for God's name's 
 sake that he suffered reproach, and therefore he could with the more 
 assurance beg of God to appear for him. The reproach of God's people, 
 if it be not removed now, will be turned into the greater honour 
 shortly. 

 (2.) That he was not jeered out of well-doing: "Lord, remove it from 
 me, <I>for I have kept thy testimonies</I> notwithstanding." If in a 
 day of trial we still retain our integrity, we may be sure it will end 
 well.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Princes also did sit <I>and</I> speak against me: <I>but</I> thy
 servant did meditate in thy statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How David was abused even by great men, who should have known better 
 his character and his case, and have been more generous: <I>Princes did 
 sit,</I> sit in council, sit in judgment, and <I>speak against me.</I> 
 What even princes say is not always right; but it is sad when judgment 
 is thus turned to wormwood, when those that should be the protectors of 
 the innocent are their betrayers. Herein David was a type of Christ, 
 for they were the princes of this world that vilified and <I>crucified 
 the Lord of glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 2. What method he took to make himself easy under these abuses: he
 <I>meditated in God's statutes,</I> went on in his duty, and did not 
 regard them; as a deaf man, he heard not. When they spoke against him, 
 he found that in the word of God which spoke for him, and spoke comfort 
 to him, and then none of these things moved him. Those that have 
 pleasure in communion with God may easily despise the censures of men, 
 even of princes.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Thy testimonies also <I>are</I> my delight <I>and</I> my counsellors.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here David explains his meditating in God's statutes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which was of such use to him when princes sat and spoke against him. 

 1. Did the affliction make him sad? The word of God comforted him, and
 was <I>his delight,</I> more his delight than any of the pleasures 
 either of court or camp, of city or country. Sometimes it proves that 
 the comforts of the word of God are most pleasant to a gracious soul 
 when other comforts are embittered. 

 2. Did it perplex him? Was he at a loss what to do when the princes 
 spoke against him? God's statutes were <I>his counsellors,</I> and they 
 counselled him to bear it patiently and commit his cause to God. God's 
 <I>testimonies</I> will be the best counsellors both to princes and 
 private persons. <I>They are the men of my counsel;</I> so the word is. 
 There will be found more safety and satisfaction in consulting them 
 than in the multitude of other counsellors. Observe here, Those that 
 would have God's testimonies to be their delight must take them for 
 their counsellors and be advised by them; and let those that take them 
 for their counsellors in close walking take them for their delight in 
 comfortable walking.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me
 according to thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's complaint. We should have thought his soul soaring to 
 heaven; but he says himself, <I>My soul</I> not only rolls in the dust, 
 but <I>cleaves to the dust,</I> which is a complaint either, 

 1. Of his corruptions, his inclination to the world and the body (both
 which are dust), and that which follows upon it, a deadness to holy 
 duties. When he would <I>do good evil was present with him.</I> God 
 intimated that Adam was not only mortal, but sinful, when he said, 
 <I>Dust thou art,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>.

 David's complaint here is like St. Paul's of a body of death that he
 carried about with him. The remainders of in-dwelling corruption are a 
 very grievous burden to a gracious soul. Or,

 2. Of his afflictions, either trouble of mind or outward trouble.
 <I>Without were fightings, within were fears,</I> and both together 
 brought him even to the <I>dust of death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:15">Ps. xxii. 15</A>),

 and his soul clave inseparably to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His petition for relief, and his plea to enforce that petition:
 "<I>Quicken thou me according to thy word.</I> By thy providence put 
 life into my affairs, by thy grace put life into my affections; cure me 
 of my spiritual deadness and make me lively in my devotion." Note, When 
 we find ourselves dull we must go to God and beg of him to quicken us; 
 he has an eye to God's word as a means of quickening (for the words 
 which God speaks, <I>they are spirit and they are life</I> to those 
 that receive them), and as an encouragement to hope that God would 
 quicken him, having promised grace and comfort to all the saints, and 
 to David in particular. God's word must be our guide and plea in every 
 prayer.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
 statutes.
 &nbsp; 27  Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I
 talk of thy wondrous works.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 1. The great intimacy and freedom that had been between David and his 
 God. David had opened his case, opened his very heart to God: "<I>I 
 have declared my ways,</I> and acknowledged thee in them all, have 
 taken thee along with me in all my designs and enterprises." Thus 
 <I>Jephthah uttered all his words,</I> and Hezekiah spread his letters, 
 <I>before the Lord. "I have declared my ways,</I> my wants, and 
 burdens, and troubles, that I meet with in my way, or my sins, my 
 by-ways (I have made an ingenuous confession of them), and <I>thou 
 heardest me,</I> heardest patiently all I had to say, and tookedst 
 cognizance of my case." It is an unspeakable comfort to a gracious soul 
 to think with what tenderness all its complaints are received by a 
 gracious God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:14,15">1 John v. 14, 15</A>.

 2. David's earnest desire of the continuance of that intimacy, not by
 visions and voices from heaven, but by the word and Spirit in an 
 ordinary way: <I>Teach me thy statutes,</I> that is, <I>Make me to 
 understand the way of thy precepts.</I> When he knew God had heard his 
 declaration of his ways he did not say, "Now, Lord, tell me my lot, and 
 let me know what the event will be;" but, "Now, Lord, tell me my duty; 
 let me know what thou wouldst have me to do as the case stands." Note, 
 Those who in all their ways acknowledge God may pray in faith that he 
 will <I>direct their steps</I> in the right way. And the surest way of 
 keeping up our communion with God is by learning his statutes and 
 walking intelligently in the <I>way of his precepts.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:6,7">1 John i. 6, 7</A>.

 3. The good use he would make of this for the honour of God and the 
 edification of others: "Let me have a good understanding of <I>the way 
 of thy precepts;</I> give me a clear, distinct, and methodical 
 knowledge of divine things; <I>so shall I talk</I> with the more 
 assurance, and the more to the purpose, <I>of thy wondrous works.</I>" 
 We can talk with a better grace of God's wondrous works, the wonders of 
 providence, and especially the wonders of redeeming love, when we 
 understand the way of God's precepts and walk in that way.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
 unto thy word.
 &nbsp; 29  Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
 graciously.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's representation of his own griefs: <I>My soul melteth for 
 heaviness,</I> which is to the same purport with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 <I>My soul cleaveth to the dust.</I> Heaviness in the heart of man 
 makes it to melt, to drop away like a candle that wastes. The penitent 
 soul melts in sorrow for sin, and even the patient soul may melt in the 
 sense of affliction, and it is then its interest to pour out its 
 supplication before God.

 2. His request for God's grace.

 (1.) That God would enable him to bear his affliction well and 
 graciously support him under it: "<I>Strengthen thou me</I> with 
 strength in my soul, <I>according to thy word,</I> which, as the bread 
 of life, strengthens man's heart to undergo whatever God is pleased to 
 inflict. Strengthen me to do the duties, resist the temptations, and 
 bear up under the burdens, of an afflicted state, that the spirit may 
 not fail. <I>Strengthen me according to</I> that <I>word</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:25">Deut. xxxiii. 25</A>),

 <I>As thy days so shall thy strength be.</I>"

 (2.) That God would keep him from using any unlawful indirect means for 
 the extricating of himself out of his troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Remove from me the way of lying.</I> David was conscious to himself 
 of a proneness to this sin; he had, in a strait, cheated Ahimelech

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:2">1 Sam. xxi. 2</A>),
 
 and Achish,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:13,27:10"><I>v.</I> 13 and <I>ch.</I> xxvii. 10</A>.

 Great difficulties are great temptations to palliate a lie with the
 colour of a pious fraud and a necessary self-defence; therefore David 
 prays that God would prevent him from falling into this sin any more, 
 lest he should settle in the way of it. A course of lying, of deceit 
 and dissimulation, is that which every good man dreads and which we are 
 all concerned to beg of God by his grace to keep us from. 

 (3.) That he might always be under the guidance and protection of God's 
 government: <I>Grant me thy law graciously;</I> grant me that to keep 
 me from the <I>way of lying.</I> David had the law written with his own 
 hand, for the king was obliged to transcribe a copy of it for his own 
 use 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:18">Deut. xvii. 18</A>);

 but he prays that he might have it written in his heart; for then, and 
 then only, we have it indeed, and to good purpose. "Grant it me more
 and more." Those that know and love the law of God cannot but desire to 
 know it more and love it better. "Grant it me <I>graciously;</I>" he 
 begs it as a special token of God's favour. Note, We ought to reckon
 God's law a grant, a gift, an unspeakable gift, to value it, and pray 
 for it, and to give thanks for it accordingly. The divine code of 
 institutes and precepts is indeed a charter of privileges; and God is

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
 <I>before me.</I>
 &nbsp; 31  I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, put me not to
 shame.
 &nbsp; 32  I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
 enlarge my heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 I. That those who will make anything to purpose of their religion must 
 first make it their serious and deliberate choice; so David did: <I>I 
 have chosen the way of truth.</I> Note, 

 1. The way of serious godliness is the way of truth; the principles it 
 is founded on are principles of eternal truth, and it is the only true 
 way to happiness. 

 2. We must choose to walk in this way, not because we know no other 
 way, but because we know no better; nay we know no other safe and good 
 way. Let us choose that way for our way, which we will walk in, though 
 it be narrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That those who have chosen the way of truth must have a constant 
 regard to the word of God as the rule of their walking: <I>Thy 
 judgments have I laid before me,</I> as he who learns to write lays his 
 copy before him, that he may write according to it, as the workman lays 
 his model and platform before him, that he may do his work exactly. As 
 we must have the word in our heart by an habitual conformity to it, so 
 we must have it in our eye by an actual regard to it upon all 
 occasions, that we may walk accurately and by rule.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That those who make religion their choice and rule are likely to 
 adhere to it faithfully: "<I>I have stuck to thy testimonies</I> with 
 unchanged affection and an unshaken resolution, stuck to them at all 
 times, through all trials. <I>I have chosen them,</I> and therefore 
 <I>I have stuck</I> to them." Note, The choosing Christian is likely to 
 be the steady Christian; while those that are Christians by chance tack 
 about if the wind turn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That those who stick to the word of God may in faith expect and 
 pray for acceptance with God; for David means this when he begs, 
 "<I>Lord, put me not to shame;</I> that is, never leave me to do that 
 by which I shall shame myself, and do thou not reject my services, 
 which will put me to the greatest confusion."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That the more comfort God gives us the more duty he expects from us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Here we have,

 1. His resolution to go on vigorously in religion: <I>I will run the 
 way of thy commandments.</I> Those that are going to heaven should make 
 haste thither and be still pressing forward. It concerns us to redeem 
 time and take pains, and to go on in our business with cheerfulness. We 
 <I>then</I> run the way of our duty, when we are ready to it, and 
 pleasant in it, and <I>lay aside every weight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb. xii. 1</A>.

 2. His dependence upon God for grace to do so: "I shall <I>then</I>
 abound in thy work, <I>when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</I>" God, by 
 his Spirit, enlarges the hearts of his people when he gives them wisdom 
 (for that is called <I>largeness of heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:29">1 Kings iv. 29</A>),

 when he <I>sheds abroad the love of God</I> in the heart, and puts 
 gladness there. The joy of our Lord should be wheels to our 
 obedience.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33 Teach me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the way of thy statutes; and I shall
 keep it <I>unto</I> the end.
 &nbsp; 34  Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I
 shall observe it with <I>my</I> whole heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 I. David prays earnestly that God himself would be his teacher; he had
 prophets, and wise men, and priests, about him, and was himself well 
 instructed in the law of God, yet he begs to be taught of God, as 
 knowing that <I>none teaches like him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:22">Job xxxvi. 22</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 1. What he desires to be taught, not the notions or language of God's
 statutes, but <I>the way</I> of them--"the way of applying them to 
 myself and governing myself by them; teach me the way of my duty which 
 thy statutes prescribe, and in every doubtful case let me know what 
 thou wouldst have me to do, let me hear the word behind me, saying, 
 <I>This is the way, walk in it</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21">Isa. xxx. 21</A>.

 2. How he desires to be taught, in such a way as no man could teach 
 him: <I>Lord, give me understanding.</I> As the God of nature, he has 
 given us intellectual powers and faculties; but here we are taught to 
 pray that, as the God of grace, he would give us understanding to use 
 those powers and faculties about the great things which belong to our 
 peace, which, through the corruption of nature, we are averse to: 
 <I>Give me understanding,</I> an enlightened understanding; for it is 
 as good to have no understanding at all as not to have it sanctified. 
 Nor will the spirit of revelation in the word answer the end unless we 
 have the spirit of wisdom in the heart. This is that which we are 
 indebted to Christ for; for the <I>Son of God has come and has given us 
 understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He promises faithfully that he would be a good scholar. If God 
 would teach him, he was sure he should learn to good purpose: "<I>I 
 shall keep thy law,</I> which I shall never do unless I be taught of 
 God, and therefore I earnestly desire that I may be taught." If God, by 
 his Spirit, give us a right and good understanding, we shall be, 

 1. Constant in our obedience: "<I>I shall keep it to the end,</I> to
 the end of my life, which will be the surest proof of sincerity." It 
 will not avail the traveller to keep the way for a while, if he do not 
 keep it to the end of his journey. 

 2. Cordial in our obedience: <I>I shall observe it with my whole 
 heart,</I> with pleasure and delight, and with vigour and resolution. 
 That way which the whole heart goes the whole man goes; and that should 
 be the way of God's commandments, for the keeping of them is the whole 
 of man.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_35"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_36"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein
 do I delight.
 &nbsp; 36  Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
 covetousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He had before prayed to God to enlighten his understanding, that he 
 might know his duty, and not mistake concerning it; here he prays to 
 God to bow his will, and quicken the active powers of his soul, that he 
 might do his duty; for <I>it is God that works in us both to will and 
 to do,</I> as well as to understand, what is good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:13">Phil. ii. 13</A>.

 Both the good head and the good heart are from the good grace of God, 
 and both are necessary to every good work. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The grace he prays for. 

 1. That God would make him able to do his duty: "<I>Make me to go;</I> 
 strengthen me for every good work." Since we are not sufficient of 
 ourselves, our dependence must be upon the grace of God, for from him 
 all our sufficiency is. God puts his Spirit within us, and so causes us 
 to <I>walk in his statutes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:27">Ezek. xxxvi. 27</A>),

 and this is that which David here begs.

 2. That God would make him willing to do it, and would, by his grace, 
 subdue the aversion he naturally had to it: "<I>Incline my heart to thy 
 testimonies,</I> to those things which thy testimonies prescribe; not 
 only make me willing to do my duty, as that which I must do and 
 therefore am concerned to make the best of, but make me desirous to do 
 my duty as that which is agreeable to the new nature and really 
 advantageous to me." Duty is then done with delight when the heart is 
 inclined to it: it is God's grace that inclines us, and the more 
 backward we find ourselves to it the more earnest we must be for that 
 grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sin he prays against, and that is covetousness: "<I>Incline my 
 heart to keep thy testimonies,</I> and restrain and mortify the 
 inclination there is in me to <I>covetousness.</I>" That is a sin which 
 stands opposed to all God's testimonies; for the love of money is such 
 a sin as is the root of much sin, of all sin. Those therefore that 
 would have the love of God rooted in them must get the love of the 
 world rooted out of them; for <I>the friendship of the world is enmity 
 with God.</I> See in what way God deals with men, not by compulsion, 
 but he draws with the cords of a man, working in them an inclination to 
 that which is good and an aversion to that which is evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His plea to enforce this prayer: "Lord, bring me to, and keep me 
 in, <I>the way of thy commandments, for therein do I delight;</I> and 
 therefore I pray thus earnestly for grace to walk in that way. Thou 
 hast wrought in me this delight in the way of thy commandments; wilt 
 thou not work in me an ability to walk in them, and so crown thy own 
 work?"</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_37"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; <I>and</I> quicken
 thou me in thy way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays for restraining grace, that he might be prevented and 
 kept back from that which would hinder him in the way of his duty: 
 <I>Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity.</I> The honours, pleasures, 
 and profits of the world are the vanities, the aspect and prospect of 
 which draw multitudes away from the paths of religion and godliness.
 The eye, when fastened on these, infects the heart with the love of 
 them, and so it is alienated from God and divine things; and therefore, 
 as we ought to <I>make a covenant with our eyes,</I> and lay a charge 
 upon them, that they shall not wander after, much less fix upon, that 
 which is dangerous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1">Job xxxi. 1</A>),

 so we ought to pray that God by his providence would keep vanity out of 
 our sight and that by his grace he would keep us from being enamoured 
 with the sight of it.

 2. He prays for constraining grace, that he might not only be kept from 
 every thing that would obstruct his progress heaven-ward, but might 
 have that grace which was necessary to forward him in that progress: 
 "<I>Quicken thou me in thy way;</I> quicken me to redeem time, to 
 improve opportunity, to press forward, and to do every duty with 
 liveliness and fervency of spirit." Beholding vanity deadens us and 
 slackens our pace; a traveller that stands gazing upon every object 
 that presents itself to his view will not rid ground; but, if our eyes 
 be kept from that which would divert us, our hearts will be kept to 
 that which will excite us.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_38"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>38  Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who <I>is devoted</I> to thy
 fear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 1. The character of a good man, which is the work of God's grace in 
 him; he is <I>God's servant,</I> subject to his law and employed in his 
 work, that is, <I>devoted to his fear,</I> given up to his direction 
 and disposal, and taken up with high thoughts of him and all those acts 
 of devotion which have a tendency to his glory. Those are truly God's 
 servants who, though they have their infirmities and defects, are 
 sincerely <I>devoted to the fear of God</I> and have all their 
 affections and motions governed by that fear; they are engaged and 
 addicted to religion. 

 2. The confidence that a good man has towards God, in dependence upon 
 the word of his grace to him. Those that are God's servants may, in 
 faith and with humble boldness, pray that God would <I>establish his 
 word to them,</I> that is, that he would fulfil his promises to them in 
 due time, and in the mean time give them an assurance that they shall 
 be fulfilled. What God has promised we must pray for; we need not be so 
 aspiring as to ask more; we need not be so modest as to ask less.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments <I>are</I>
 good.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays against <I>reproach,</I> as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 David was conscious to himself that he had done that which might give 
 <I>occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,</I> which would 
 blemish his own reputation and turn to the dishonour of his family; now 
 he prays that God, who has all men's hearts and tongues in his hands, 
 would be pleased to prevent this, to <I>deliver him from all his 
 transgressions,</I> that he <I>might not be the reproach of the 
 foolish,</I> which he feared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:8">Ps. xxxix. 8</A>);

 or he means that reproach which his enemies unjustly loaded him with. 
 Let their <I>lying lips be put to silence.</I>

 2. He pleads the goodness of God's judgments: "Lord, thou sittest in 
 the throne, and <I>thy judgments are right</I> and <I>good,</I> just 
 and kind, to those that are wronged, and therefore to thee I appeal 
 from the unjust and unkind censures of men." It is a small thing to be 
 judged of man's judgment, while <I>he that judges us is the Lord.</I> 
 Or thus: "Thy word, and ways, and thy holy religion, are very good, but 
 the reproaches cast on me will fall on them; therefore, <I>Lord, turn 
 them away;</I> let not religion be wounded through my side."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_40"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>40  Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
 righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David professes the ardent affection he had to the word of God: 
 "<I>I have longed after thy precepts,</I> not only loved them, and 
 delighted in what I have already attained, but I have earnestly desired 
 to know them more and do them better, and am still pressing forward 
 towards perfection." Tastes of the sweetness of God's precepts will but 
 set us a longing after a more intimate acquaintance with them. He 
 appeals to God concerning this passionate desire after his precepts: 
 "<I>Behold, I have</I> thus loved, thus <I>longed;</I> thou knowest all 
 things, thou knowest that I am thus affected." 

 2. He prays for grace to enable him to answer this profession. "Thou 
 hast wrought in me this languishing desire, put life into me, that I 
 may prosecute it; <I>quicken me in thy righteousness,</I> in thy 
 righteous ways, according to thy righteous promise." Where God has 
 wrought to will he will work to do, and where he has wrought to desire 
 he will satisfy the desire.</P>

 for I trust in thy word.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's prayer for the salvation of the Lord. "Lord, thou art my 
 Saviour; I am miserable in myself, and thou only canst make me happy; 
 <I>let thy salvation come to me.</I> Hasten temporal salvation to me 
 from my present distresses, and hasten me to the eternal salvation, by 
 giving me the necessary qualifications for it and the comfortable 
 pledges and foretastes of it." 

 2. David's dependence upon the grace and promise of God for that 
 salvation. These are the two pillars on which our hope is built, and 
 they will not fail us:--

 (1.) The grace of God: <I>Let thy mercies come, even thy salvation.</I> 
 Our salvation must be attributed purely to God's mercy, and not to any 
 merit of our own. Eternal life must be expected as the <I>mercy of our 
 Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:21">Jude 21</A>.

 "Lord, I have by faith thy mercies in view; let me by prayer prevail to
 have them come to me."

 (2.) The promise of God: "<I>Let it come according to thy word,</I> thy 
 word of promise. <I>I trust in thy word,</I> and therefore may expect 
 the performance of the promise." We are not only allowed to trust in 
 God's word, but our trusting in it is the condition of our benefit by 
 it. 

 3. David's expectation of the good assurance which that grace and 
 promise of God would give him: "<I>So shall I have wherewith to answer 
 him that reproaches me</I> for my confidence in God, as if it would 
 deceive me." When God saves those out of their troubles who trusted in 
 him he effectually silences those who would have <I>shamed that counsel 
 of the poor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:6">Ps. xiv. 6</A>),

 and their reproaches will be for ever silenced when the salvation of
 the saints is completed; then it will appear, beyond dispute, that it 
 was not in vain to trust in God.</P>

 I have hoped in thy judgments.
 &nbsp; 44  So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's humble petition for the tongue of the learned, that he might 
 know how to <I>speak a word in season</I> for the glory of God: <I>Take 
 not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth.</I> He means, "Lord, let 
 the word of truth be always in my mouth; let me have the wisdom and 
 courage which are necessary to enable me both to use my knowledge for 
 the instruction of others, and, like the good householder, to bring out 
 of my treasury <I>things new and old,</I> and to make profession of my 
 faith whenever I am called to it." We have need to pray to God that we 
 may never be afraid or ashamed to own his truths and ways, nor deny him 
 before men. David found that he was sometimes at a loss, that the 
 <I>word of truth</I> was not so ready to him as it should have been, 
 but he prays, "Lord, let it not be taken utterly from me; let my always 
 have so much of it at hand as will be necessary to the due discharge of 
 my duty." 

 2. His humble profession of the heart of the upright, without which the 
 tongue of the learned, however it may be serviceable to others, will 
 stand us in no stead.

 (1.) David professes his confidence in God: "Lord, make me ready and 
 mighty in the scriptures, <I>for I have hoped in those judgments</I> of 
 thy mouth, and, if they be not at hand, my support and defence have 
 departed from me." 

 (2.) He professes his resolution to adhere to his duty in the strength 
 of God's grace: "<I>So shall I keep thy law continually.</I> If I have 
 thy word not only in my heart, but in my mouth, I shall do all I should 
 do, stand complete in thy whole will." Thus shall the <I>man of God be 
 perfect, thoroughly furnished for every good word and work,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:17,Col+3:16">2 Tim. iii. 17; Col. iii. 16</A>.
 
 Observe how he resolves to keep God's law,

 [1.] Continually, without trifling. God must be served in a constant 
 course of obedience every day, and all the day long. 

 [2.] <I>For ever and ever,</I> without backsliding. We must never be 
 <I>weary of well-doing.</I> If we serve him to the end of our time on
 earth, we shall be serving him in heaven to the endless ages of 
 eternity; so shall we <I>keep his law for ever and ever.</I> Or thus: 
 "Lord, let me have the word of truth in <I>my mouth,</I> that I may 
 commit that sacred deposit to the rising generation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">2 Tim. ii. 2</A>)

 and by them it may be transmitted to succeeding ages; so shall thy law 
 be kept <I>for ever and ever,</I>" that is, from one generation to 
 another, according to that promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>),

 <I>My word in thy mouth shall not depart out of the mouth of thy seed,

 loved.
 &nbsp; 48  My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
 have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe in these verses, 

 1. What David experienced of an affection to the law of God: "<I>I seek 
 thy precepts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 I desire to know and do my duty, and consult thy word accordingly; I do 
 all I can to <I>understand what the will of the Lord is</I> and to 
 discover the intimations of his mind. <I>I seek thy precepts,</I> for 
 <I>I have loved them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>.

 I not only give consent to them as good, but take complacency in them 
 as good for me." All that love God love his government and therefore 
 love all his commandments.

 2. What he expected from this. Five things he promises himself here in 
 the strength of God's grace:--

 (1.) That he should be free and easy in his duty: "<I>I will walk at 
 liberty,</I> freed from that which is evil, not hampered with the 
 fetters of my own corruptions, and free to that which is good, doing it 
 not by constraint, but willingly." The service of sin is perfect 
 slavery; the service of God is perfect liberty. Licentiousness is
 bondage to the greatest of tyrants; conscientiousness is freedom to the 
 meanest of prisoners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:32,36,Lu+1:74,75">John viii. 32, 36; Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 (2.) That he should be bold and courageous in his duty: <I>I will speak
 of thy testimonies also before kings.</I> Before David came to the 
 crown kings were sometimes his judges, as Saul, and Achish; but, if he 
 were called before them to give a reason of the hope that was in him, 
 he would <I>speak of God's testimonies,</I> and profess to build his 
 hope upon them and make them his council, his guards, his crown, his 
 all. We must never be afraid to own our religion, though it should
 expose us to the wrath of kings, but speak of it as that which we will 
 live and die by, like the three children before Nebuchadnezzar, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:16,Ac+4:20">Dan. iii. 16; Acts iv. 20</A>.

 After David came to the crown kings were sometimes his companions; they 
 visited him and he returned their visits; but he did not, in 
 complaisance to them, talk of every thing but religion, for fear of 
 affronting them and making his conversation uneasy to them. No; God's 
 testimonies shall be the principal subject of his discourse with the 
 kings, not only to show that he was not ashamed of his religion, but to 
 instruct them in it and bring them over to it. It is good for kings to
 hear of God's testimonies, and it will adorn the conversation of 
 princes themselves to speak of them.

 (3.) That he should be cheerful and pleasant in his duty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 "<I>I will delight myself in thy commandments,</I> in conversing with 
 them, in conforming to them. I will never be so well pleased with 
 myself as when I do that which is pleasing to God." The more delight we 
 take in the service of God the nearer we come to the perfection we aim 
 at. 

 (4.) That he should be diligent and vigorous in his duty: <I>I will

 will lay my hands to the command, not only to praise it, but practise

 thinking of them as matters of speculation, but contrive how I may 
 observe them in the best manner." By <I>this</I> it will appear that we

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>49  Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou
 hast caused me to hope.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things David here pleads with God in prayer for that mercy and 
 grace which he hoped for, according to the word, by which his requests 
 were guided:--

 1. That God had given him the promise on which he hoped: "Lord, I
 desire no more than that thou wouldst <I>remember thy word unto thy 
 servant,</I> and <I>do as thou hast said;</I>" see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:23">1 Chron. xvii. 23</A>.

 "Thou art wise, and therefore wilt perfect what thou hast purposed, and 
 not change thy counsel. Thou art faithful, and therefore wilt perform 
 what thou hast promised, and not break thy word." Those that make God's 
 promises their portion may with humble boldness make them their plea.
 "Lord, is not that the word which thou hast spoken; and wilt thou not 
 make it good?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:9,Ex+33:12">Gen. xxxii. 9; Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>.

 2. That God, who had given him the promise in the word, had by his 
 grace wrought in him a hope in that promise and enabled him to depend 
 upon it, and had raised his expectations of great things from it. Has 
 God kindled in us desires towards spiritual blessings more than towards 
 any temporal good things, and will he not be so kind as to satisfy 
 those desires? Has he filled us with hopes of those blessings, and will 
 he not be so just as to accomplish these hopes? He that did by his 
 Spirit work faith in us will, according to our faith, work for us, and 
 will not disappoint us.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_50"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>50  This <I>is</I> my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
 quickened me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is David's experience of benefit by the word. 

 1. As a means of his sanctification: "<I>Thy word has quickened me.</I> 
 It made me alive when I was dead in sin; it has many a time made me 
 lively when I was dead in duty; it has quickened me to that which is 
 good when I was backward and averse to it, and it has quickened me in 
 that which is good when I was cold and indifferent." 

 2. Therefore as a means of his consolation when he was in affliction 
 and needed something to support him: "Because thy word has quickened me
 at other times, it has comforted me then." The word of God has much in
 it that speaks <I>comfort in affliction;</I> but those only may apply 
 it to themselves who have experienced in some measure the quickening 
 power of the word. If through grace it make us holy, there is enough
 in it to make us easy, in all conditions, under all events.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>51  The proud have had me greatly in derision: <I>yet</I> have I not
 declined from thy law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here tells us, and it will be of use to us to know it, 

 1. That he had been jeered for his religion. Though he was a man of 
 honour, a man of great prudence, and had done eminent services to his 
 country, yet, because he was a devout conscientious man, <I>the proud 
 had him greatly in derision;</I> they ridiculed him, bantered him, and 
 did all they could to expose him to contempt; they laughed at him for 
 his praying, and called it <I>cant,</I> for his seriousness, and called 
 it <I>mopishness,</I> for his strictness, and called it <I>needless 
 preciseness.</I> They were the proud that sat in the scorner's seat and 
 valued themselves on so doing. 

 2. That yet he had not been jeered out of his religion: "They have done 
 all they could to make me quit it for shame, but none of these things 
 move me: <I>I have not declined from thy law</I> for all this; but, 
 <I>if this be to be vile</I>" (as he said when Michal had him greatly 
 in derision), "<I>I will be yet more vile.</I>" He not only had not 
 quite forsaken the law, but had not so much as declined from it. We 
 must never shrink from any duty, nor let slip an opportunity of doing 
 good, for fear of the reproach of men, or their revilings. The 
 traveller goes on his way though the dogs bark at him. Those can bear 
 but little for Christ that cannot bear a hard word for him.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_52"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>52  I remembered thy judgments of old, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and have
 comforted myself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When David was derided for his godliness he not only held fast his 
 integrity, but, 

 1. He comforted himself. He not only bore reproach, but bore it 
 cheerfully. It did not disturb his peace, nor break in upon the repose 
 of his spirit in God. It was a comfort to him to think that it was for 
 God's sake that he bore reproach, and that his worst enemies could find 
 <I>no occasion against him, save only in the matter of his God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:5">Dan. vi. 5</A>.

 Those that are derided for their adherence to God's law may comfort 
 themselves with this, that <I>the reproach of Christ</I> will prove, in 
 the end, <I>greater riches</I> to them <I>than the treasures of 
 Egypt.</I>

 2. That which he comforted himself with was the remembrance of God's 
 <I>judgments of old,</I> the providences of God concerning his people 
 formerly, both in mercy to them and in justice against their 
 persecutors. God's judgments of old, in our own early days and in the 
 days of our fathers, are to be remembered by us for our comfort and 
 encouragement in the way of God, for he is still the same.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The character of wicked people; he means those that are openly and 
 grossly wicked: <I>They forsake thy law.</I> Every sin is a 
 transgression of the law, but a course and way of wilful and avowed sin 
 is downright forsaking it and throwing it off. 

 2. The impression which the wickedness of the wicked made upon David; 
 it frightened him, it put him into an amazement. He trembled to think 
 of the dishonour thereby done to God, the gratification thereby given 
 to Satan, and the mischiefs thereby done to the souls of men. He 
 dreaded the consequences of it both to the sinners themselves (and 
 cried out, <I>O gather not my soul with sinners! let my enemy be as the 
 wicked</I>) and to the interests of God's kingdom among men, which he 
 was afraid would be thereby sunk and ruined. He does not say, 
 "<I>Horror has taken hold on me</I> because of their cruel designs 
 against me," but "because of the contempt they put on God and his law." 
 Sin is a monstrous horrible thing in the eyes of all that are 
 sanctified,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>54  Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my
 pilgrimage.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's state and condition; he was <I>in the house of</I> his 
 <I>pilgrimage,</I> which may be understood either as his peculiar 
 trouble (he was often tossed and hurried, and forced to fly) or as his 
 lot in common with all. This world is the house of our pilgrimage, the 
 house in which we are pilgrims; it is our tabernacle; it is our inn. We 
 must confess ourselves <I>strangers and pilgrims upon earth,</I> who 
 are not at home here, nor must be here long. Even David's palace is but 
 the house of his pilgrimage. 

 2. His comfort in this state: "<I>Thy statutes have been my songs,</I> 
 with which I here entertain myself," as travellers are wont to divert 
 the thoughts of their weariness, and take off something of the 
 tediousness of their journey, by singing a pleasant song now and then. 
 David was the sweet singer of Israel, and here we are told whence he 
 fetched his songs; they were all borrowed from the word of God. God's 
 statutes were as familiar to him as the songs which a man is accustomed 
 to sing; and he conversed with them in his pilgrimage-solitudes. They 
 were as pleasant to him as songs, and <I>put gladness into his 
 heart</I> more than those have that <I>chant to the sound of the 
 viol,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:5">Amos vi. 5</A>.

 <I>Is any afflicted</I> then? Let him sing over God's statutes, and try 
 if he cannot so <I>sing away sorrow,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>55  I have remembered thy name, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the night, and have
 kept thy law.
 &nbsp; 56  This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The converse David had with the word of God; he kept it in mind, and 
 upon every occasion he called it to mind. God's name is the discovery 
 he has made of himself to us in and by his word. <I>This is his 
 memorial unto all generations,</I> and therefore we should always keep 
 it in memory--remember it <I>in the night,</I> upon a waking bed, when 
 we are communing with our own hearts. When others were sleeping David 
 was remembering God's name, and, by repeating that lesson, increasing 
 his acquaintance with it; in the night of affliction this he called to 
 mind. 

 2. The conscience be made of conforming to it. The due remembrance of 
 God's name, which is prefixed to his law, will have a great influence 
 upon our observance of the law: <I>I remembered thy name in the 
 night,</I> and therefore was careful to <I>keep thy law</I> all day. 
 How comfortable will it be in the reflection if our own hearts can 
 witness for us that we have thus remembered God's name, and kept his 
 law! 
 
 3. The advantage he got by it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 <I>This I had because I kept thy precepts.</I> Some understand this 
 indefinitely: <I>This I had</I> (that is I had that which satisfied me; 
 I had every thing that is comfortable) <I>because I kept thy 
 precepts.</I> Note, All that have made a business of religion will own 
 that it has turned to a good account, and that they have been 
 unspeakable gainers by it. Others refer it to what goes immediately 
 before: "I had the comfort of keeping thy law because I kept it." Note, 
 God's work is its own wages. A heart to obey the will of God is a most 
 valuable reward of obedience; and the more we do the more we may do, 
 and shall do, in the service of God; the branch that bears fruit is 
 made <I>more fruitful,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may hence gather the character of a godly man. 

 1. He makes the favour of God his felicity: <I>Thou art my portion, O 
 Lord!</I> Others place their happiness in the wealth and honours of 
 this world. Their portion is in this life; they look no further; they 
 desire no more; these are <I>their good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 But all that are sanctified take the Lord for the portion of their 
 inheritance and their cup, and nothing less will satisfy them. David 
 can appeal to God in this matter: "Lord, thou knowest that I have 
 chosen thee for my portion, and depend upon thee to make me happy."

 2. He makes the law of God his rule: "<I>I have said that I would keep 
 thy words;</I> and what I have said by thy grace I will do, and will 
 abide by it to the end." Note, Those that take God for their portion 
 must take him for their prince, and swear allegiance to him; and, 
 having promised to <I>keep his word,</I> we must often put ourselves in 
 mind of our promise,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>58  I intreated thy favour with <I>my</I> whole heart: be merciful
 unto me according to thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, having in the foregoing verse reflected upon his covenants with 
 God, here reflects upon his prayers to God, and renews his petition. 
 Observe, 

 1. What he prayed for. Having taken God for his portion, he 
 <I>entreated his favour,</I> as one that knew he had forfeited it, was 
 unworthy of it, and yet undone without it, but for ever happy if he 
 could obtain it. We cannot demand God's favour as a debt, but must be 
 humble suppliants for it, that God will not only be reconciled to us, 
 but accept us and smile upon us. He prays, "<I>Be merciful to me,</I> 
 in the forgiveness of what I have done amiss, and in giving me grace to 
 do better for the future." 

 2. How he prayed--<I>with his whole heart,</I> as one that knew how to 
 value the blessing he prayed for. The gracious soul is entirely set
 upon the favour of God, and is therefore importunate for it. <I>I will 
 not let thee go except thou bless me.</I> 

 3. What he pleaded--the promise of God: "<I>Be merciful to me, 
 according to thy word.</I> I desire the mercy promised, and depend upon 
 the promise for it." Those that are governed by the precepts of the 
 word and are resolved to keep them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>)

 may plead the promises of the word and take the comfort of them.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_59"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_60"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>59  I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy
 testimonies.
 &nbsp; 60  I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had said he <I>would keep God's word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>),

 and it was well said; now here he tells us how and in what method he 
 pursued that resolution. 

 1. He <I>thought on his ways.</I> He thought beforehand what he should 
 do, pondering the path of his feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:26">Prov. iv. 26</A>),

 that he might walk surely, and not at all adventures. He thought after 
 what he had done, reflected upon his life past, and recollected the 
 paths he had walked in and the steps he had taken. The word signifies a 
 fixed abiding thought. Some make it an allusion to those who work 
 embroidery, who are very exact and careful to cover the least flaw, or 
 to those who cast up their accounts, who reckon with themselves, What 
 do I owe? What am I worth? "<I>I thought</I> not on my wealth (as the 
 covetous man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11">Ps. xlix. 11</A>)

 but <I>on my ways,</I> not on what I have, but what I do:" for what we
 do will follow us into another world when what we have must be left 
 behind. Many are critical enough in their remarks upon other people's 
 ways who never think of their own: but <I>let every man prove his own 
 work.</I>

 2. He <I>turned his feet to God's testimonies.</I> He determined to 
 make the word of God his rule, and to walk by that rule. He turned
 from the by-paths to which he had turned aside, and returned to God's 
 testimonies. He turned not only his eye to them, but his feet, his 
 affections to the love of God's word and his conversation to the 
 practice of it. The bent and inclinations of his soul were towards 
 God's testimonies and his conversation was governed by them. Penitent
 reflections must produce pious resolutions.

 3. He did this immediately and without demur

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 <I>I made haste
 and delayed not.</I> When we are under convictions of sin we must 
 strike while the iron is hot, and not think to defer the prosecution of 
 them, as Felix did, to <I>a more convenient season.</I> When we are 
 called to duty we must lose no time, but set about it <I>to-day, while 
 it is called to-day.</I> Now this account which David here gives of 
 himself may refer either to his constant practice every day (he 
 reflected on his ways at night, directed his feet to God's testimonies 
 in the morning, and what his hand found to do that was good he did it 
 without delay), or it may refer to his first acquaintance with God and 
 religion, when he began to throw off the vanity of childhood and youth, 
 and to remember his Creator; that blessed change was, by the grace of 
 God, thus wrought. Note, 

 (1.) Conversion begins in serious consideration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:28,Lu+15:17">Ezek. xviii. 28; Luke xv. 17</A>.
 
 (2.) Consideration must end in a sound conversion. To what purpose have 
 we thought on our ways if we do not turn our feet with all speed to 
 God's testimonies?</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_61"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>61  The bands of the wicked have robbed me: <I>but</I> I have not
 forgotten thy law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The malice of David's enemies against him. They were wicked men, who 
 hated him for his godliness. There were bands or troops of them 
 confederate against him. They did him all the mischief they could; they
 robbed him; having endeavoured to take away his good name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),
 
 they set upon his goods, and spoiled him of them, either by plunder in 
 time of war or by fines and confiscations under colour of law. Saul (it 
 is likely) seized his effects, Absalom his palace, and the Amalekites
 rifled Ziklag. Worldly wealth is what we may be robbed of. David, 
 though a man of war, could not keep his own. <I>Thieves break through 
 and steal.</I> 

 2. The testimony of David's conscience for him that he had held fast 
 his religion when he was stripped of every thing else, as Job did when 
 the bands of the Chaldeans and Sabeans had robbed him: <I>But I have 
 not forgotten thy law.</I> No care nor grief should drive God's word 
 out of our minds, or hinder our comfortable relish of it and converse 
 with it. Nor must we ever think the worse of the ways of God for any 
 trouble we meet with in those ways, nor fear being losers by our 
 religion at last, however we may be losers for it now.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_62"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>62  At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
 thy righteous judgments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though David is, in this psalm, much in prayer, yet he did not neglect 
 the duty of thanksgiving; for those that pray much will have much to 
 give thanks for. See, 

 1. How much God's hand was eyed in his thanksgivings. He does not say, 
 "<I>I will give thanks</I> because of thy favours to me, which I have 
 the comfort of," but, "<I>Because of thy righteous judgments,</I> all 
 the disposals of thy providence in wisdom and equity, which thou hast 
 the glory of." We must give thanks for the asserting of God's honour 
 and the accomplishing of his word in all he does in the government of 
 the world. 

 2. How much David's heart was set upon his thanksgivings. He would 
 <I>rise at midnight to give thanks</I> to God. Great and good thoughts 
 kept him awake, and refreshed him, instead of sleep; and so zealous was 
 he for the honour of God that when others were in their beds he was 
 upon his knees at his devotions. He did not affect to be seen of men in 
 it, but gave thanks in secret, where our heavenly Father sees. He had 
 praised God <I>in the courts of the Lord's house,</I> and yet he will 
 do it in his bed-chamber. Public worship will not excuse us from secret 
 worship. When David found his heart affected with God's judgments, he
 immediately offered up those affections to God, in actual adorations, 
 not deferring, lest they should cool. Yet observe his reverence; he did 
 not lie still and give thanks, but rose out of his bed, perhaps in the 
 cold and in the dark, to do it the more solemnly. And see what a good
 husband he was of time; when he could not lie and sleep, he would rise 
 and pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had often expressed the great love he had to God; here he 
 expresses the great love he had to the people of God; and observe, 

 1. Why he loved them; not so much because they were his best friends,
 most firm to his interest and most forward to serve him, but because 
 they were such as <I>feared God</I> and <I>kept his precepts,</I> and 
 so did him honour and helped to support his kingdom among men. Our love 
 to the saints is <I>then</I> sincere when we love them for the sake of 
 what we see of God in them and the service they do to him. 

 2. How he showed his love to them: He was <I>a companion of them.</I> 
 He had not only a spiritual communion with them in the same faith and 
 hope, but he joined with them in holy ordinances in the courts of the 
 Lord, where rich and poor, prince and peasant, meet together. He 
 sympathized with them in their joys and sorrows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:33">Heb. x. 33</A>);

 he conversed familiarly with them, communicated his experiences to 
 them, and consulted theirs. He not only took such to be his companions 
 as did fear God, but he vouchsafed himself to be a companion with all, 
 with any, that did so, wherever he met with them. Though he was a king, 
 he would associate with the poorest of his subjects that feared God,

 statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David pleads that God is good to all the creatures according to 
 their necessities and capacities; as the heaven is full of God's glory, 
 so <I>the earth is full of his mercy,</I> full of the instances of his 
 pity and bounty. Not only the land of Canaan, where God is known and 
 worshipped, but the whole earth, in many parts of which he has no 
 homage paid him, is full of his mercy. Not only the children of men 
 upon the earth, but even the inferior creatures, taste of God's 
 goodness. <I>His tender mercies are over all his works.</I> 

 2. He therefore prays that God would be good to him according to his 
 necessity and capacity: "<I>Teach me thy statutes.</I> Thou feedest the 
 young ravens that cry, with food proper for them; and wilt thou not 
 feed me with spiritual food, the bread of life, which my soul needs and 
 craves, and cannot subsist without? <I>The earth is full of thy 
 mercy;</I> and is not heaven too? Wilt thou not then give me spiritual 
 blessings in heavenly places?" A gracious heart will fetch an argument 
 from any thing to enforce a petition for divine teaching. Surely he 
 that will not let his birds be unfed will not let his children be 
 untaught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>65  Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according unto thy word.
 &nbsp; 66  Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed
 thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David makes a thankful acknowledgment of God's gracious dealings 
 with him all along: <I>Thou hast dealt well with thy servant.</I> 
 However God has dealt with us, we must own he has dealt <I>well</I> 
 with us, better than we deserve, and all in love and with design to 
 work for our good. In many instances God has done well for us beyond 
 our expectations. He has done well for all his servants; never any of 
 them complained that he had used them hardly. <I>Thou hast dealt well 
 with</I> me, not only according to thy mercy, but <I>according to thy 
 word.</I> God's favours look best when they are compared with the 
 promise and are seen flowing from that fountain. 

 2. Upon these experiences he grounds a petition for divine instruction: 
 "<I>Teach me good judgment and knowledge,</I> that, by thy grace, I may 
 render again, in some measure, according to the benefit done unto me." 
 Teach me <I>a good taste</I> (so the word signifies), a good relish, to 
 discern things that differ, to distinguish between truth and falsehood, 
 good and evil; for <I>the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes 
 meat.</I> We should pray to God for a sound mind, that we may have 
 <I>spiritual senses exercised,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:14">Heb. v. 14</A>.

 Many have knowledge who have little judgment; those who have both are 
 well fortified against the snares of Satan and well furnished for the 
 service of God and their generation. 

 3. This petition is backed with a plea: "<I>For I have believed thy 
 commandments,</I> received them, and consented to them that they are 
 good, and submitted to their government; therefore, Lord, <I>teach 
 me.</I>" Where God has given a good heart a good head too many in faith 
 be prayed for.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_67"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>67  Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept
 thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here tells us what he had experienced, 

 1. Of the temptations of a prosperous condition: "<I>Before I was 
 afflicted,</I> while I lived in peace and plenty, and knew no sorrow, 
 <I>I went astray</I> from God and my duty." Sin is going astray; and we 
 are most apt to wander from God when we are easy and think ourselves at 
 home in the world. Prosperity is the unhappy occasion of much iniquity; 
 it makes people conceited of themselves, indulgent of the flesh, 
 forgetful of God, in love with the world, and deaf to the reproofs of 
 the word. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:6">Ps. xxx. 6</A>.

 It is good for us, when we are afflicted, to remember how and wherein 
 we went astray <I>before we were afflicted,</I> that we may answer the 
 end of the affliction.

 2. Of the benefit of an afflicted state: "<I>Now have I kept thy 
 word,</I> and so have been recovered from my wanderings." God often
 makes use of afflictions as a means to reduce those to himself who have
 wandered from him. Sanctified afflictions humble us for sin and show us 
 the vanity of the world; they soften the heart, and open the ear to 
 discipline. The prodigal's distress brought him to himself first and 
 then to his father.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_68"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>68  Thou <I>art</I> good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David praises God's goodness and gives him the glory of it: <I>Thou 
 art good and doest good.</I> All who have any knowledge of God and 
 dealings with him wilt own that he does good, and therefore will 
 conclude that he is good. The streams of God's goodness are so 
 numerous, and run so full, so strong, to all the creatures, that we 
 must conclude the fountain that is in himself to be inexhaustible. We 
 cannot conceive how much good our God does every day, much less can we 
 conceive how good he is. Let us acknowledge it with admiration and
 with holy love and thankfulness. 

 2. He prays for God's grace, and begs to be under the guidance and 
 influence of it: <I>Teach me thy statutes.</I> "Lord, thou doest good 
 to all, art the bountiful benefactor of all the creatures; this is the 
 good I beg thou wilt do to me,--Instruct me in my duty, incline me to 
 it, and enable me to do it. <I>Thou art good, and doest good;</I>
 Lord, <I>teach me thy statutes,</I> that I may be good and do good, may 
 have a good heart and live a good life." It is an encouragement to poor 
 sinners to hope that God will <I>teach them his way</I> because he is 
 <I>good and upright,</I>

 <A NAME="Ps119_70"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>69  The proud have forged a lie against me: <I>but</I> I will keep
 thy precepts with <I>my</I> whole heart.
 &nbsp; 70  Their heart is as fat as grease; <I>but</I> I delight in thy law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here tells us how he was affected as to the proud and wicked 
 people that were about him. 

 1. He did not fear their malice, nor was he by it deterred from his 
 duty: <I>They have forged a lie against me.</I> Thus they aimed to take 
 away his good name. Nay, all we have in the world, even life itself, 
 may be brought into danger by those who make no conscience of forging a 
 lie. Those that were proud envied David's reputation, because it 
 eclipsed them, and therefore did all they could to blemish him. They
 took a pride in trampling upon him. They therefore persuaded themselves 
 it was no sin to tell a deliberate lie if it might but expose him to 
 contempt. Their wicked wit forged lies, invented stories which there
 was not the least colour for, to serve their wicked designs. And what 
 did David do when he was thus belied? He will bear it patiently; he 
 will keep that precept which forbids him to render railing for railing, 
 and will with all his heart sit down silently. He will go on in his 
 duty with constancy and resolution: "Let them say what they will, <I>I 
 will keep thy precepts,</I> and not dread their reproach." 

 2. He did not envy their prosperity, nor was he by it allured from his 
 duty. <I>Their heart is as fat as grease.</I> The proud are <I>at
 ease</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:4">Ps. cxxiii. 4</A>);

 they are full of the world, and the wealth and pleasures of it; and 
 this makes them,

 (1.) Senseless, secure, and stupid; they are past feeling: thus the 
 phrase is used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10">Isa. vi. 10</A>.

 <I>Make the heart of this people fat.</I> They are not sensible of the 
 touch of the word of God or his rod.

 (2.) Sensual and voluptuous: "<I>Their eyes stand out with fatness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:7">Ps. lxxiii. 7</A>);

 they roll themselves in the pleasures of sense, and take up with them 
 as their chief good; and much good may it do them. I would not change 
 conditions with them. <I>I delight in thy law;</I> I build my security 
 upon the promises of God's word and have pleasure enough in communion 
 with God, infinitely preferable to all their delights." The children of 
 God, who are acquainted with spiritual pleasures, need not envy the 
 children of this world their carnal pleasures.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_71"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>71  <I>It is</I> good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
 learn thy statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. That it has been the lot of the best saints to be afflicted. The 
 proud and the wicked lived in pomp and pleasure, while David, though he 
 kept close to God and his duty, was still in affliction. <I>Waters of a 
 full cup are wrung out to</I> God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:10">Ps. lxxiii. 10</A>.

 2. That it has been the advantage of God's people to be afflicted. 
 David could speak experimentally: <I>It was good for me;</I> many a 
 good lesson he had learnt by his afflictions, and many a good duty he 
 had been brought to which otherwise would have been unlearnt and 
 undone. <I>Therefore</I> God visited him with affliction, that he might 
 learn God's statutes; and the intention was answered: the afflictions 
 had contributed to the improvement of his knowledge and grace. He that 
 chastened him taught him. <I>The rod and reproof give wisdom.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_72"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>72  The law of thy mouth <I>is</I> better unto me than thousands of
 gold and silver.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a reason why David reckoned that when by his afflictions he 
 learned God's statutes, and the profit did so much counterbalance the
 loss, he was really a gainer by them; for God's <I>law,</I> which he 
 got acquaintance with by his affliction, was <I>better</I> to him than 
 all the <I>gold and silver</I> which he lost by his affliction. 

 1. David had but a little of the word of God in comparison with what
 we have, yet see how highly he valued it; how inexcusable then are we, 
 who have both the Old and New Testament complete, and yet account them 
 as a strange thing! Observe, <I>Therefore</I> he valued the law, 
 because it is <I>the law of God's mouth,</I> the revelation of his 
 will, and ratified by his authority. 

 2. He had a great deal of gold and silver in comparison with what we 
 have, yet see how little he valued it. His riches increased, and yet he 
 did not set his heart upon them, but upon the word of God. That was 
 better to him, yielded him better pleasures, and better maintenance, 
 and a better inheritance, than all the treasures he was master of. 
 Those that have read, and believe, David's <I>Psalms</I> and Solomon's 
 <I>Ecclesiastes,</I> cannot but prefer the word of God far before the 
 wealth of this world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>73  Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
 understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David adores God as the God of nature and the author of his being: 
 <I>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:8">Job x. 8</A>.

 Every man is as truly the work of God's hands as the first man was, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15,16">Ps. cxxxix. 15, 16</A>.

 "<I>Thy hands have</I> not only <I>made me,</I> and given me a being, 
 otherwise I should never have been, but <I>fashioned me,</I> and given 
 me this being, this noble and excellent being, endued with these powers 
 and faculties;" and we must own that we are <I>fearfully and 
 wonderfully made.</I>

 2. He addresses himself to God as the God of grace, and begs he will be 
 the author of his new and better being. God made us to serve him and 
 enjoy him; but by sin we have made ourselves unable for his service and 
 indisposed for the enjoyment of him; and we must have a new and divine 
 nature, otherwise we had the human nature in vain; therefore David 
 prays, "Lord, since thou hast made me by thy power for thy glory, make 
 me anew by thy grace, that I may answer the ends of my creation and 
 live to some purpose: <I>Give me understanding, that I may learn thy 
 commandments.</I>" The way in which God recovers and secures his 
 interest in men is by giving them an understanding; for by that door he 
 enters into the soul and gains possession of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_74"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>74  They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
 have hoped in thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The confidence of this good man in the hope of God's salvation: 
 "<I>I have hoped in thy word;</I> and I have not found it in vain to do 
 so; it has not failed me, nor have I been disappointed in my 
 expectations from it. It is a hope that <I>maketh not ashamed;</I> but 
 is present satisfaction, and fruition at last." 

 2. The concurrence of other good men with him in the joy of that 
 salvation: "<I>Those that fear thee will be glad when they see me</I> 
 relieved by my hope in thy word and delivered according to my hope." 
 The comforts which some of God's children have in God, and the favours 
 they have received from him, should be matter of joy to others of them. 
 Paul often expressed the hope that for God's grace to him thanks would 
 be rendered by many, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:11,4:15">2 Cor. i. 11; iv. 15</A>.

 Or it may be taken more generally; good people are glad to see one 
 another; they are especially pleased with those who are eminent for 
 their hope in God's word.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_75"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>75  I know, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that thy judgments <I>are</I> right, and <I>that</I>
 thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still David is in affliction, and being so he owns, 

 1. That his sin was justly corrected: <I>I know, O Lord! that thy 
 judgments are right,</I> are righteousness itself. However God is 
 pleased to afflict us, he does us no wrong, nor can we charge him with 
 any iniquity, but most acknowledge that it is less than we have 
 deserved. We know that God is holy in his nature and wise and just in 
 all the acts of his government, and therefore we cannot but know, in 
 the general, that his <I>judgments are right,</I> though, in some 
 particular instances, there may be difficulties which we cannot easily 
 resolve. 

 2. That God's promise was graciously performed. The former may silence 
 us under our afflictions, and forbid us to repine, but this may satisfy 
 us, and enable us to rejoice; for afflictions are in the covenant, and 
 therefore they are not only not meant for our hurt, but they are really 
 intended for our good: "<I>In faithfulness thou hast afflicted me,</I> 
 pursuant to the great design of my salvation." It is easier to own, in 
 general, that God's <I>judgments are right,</I> than to own it when it 
 comes to be our own case; but David subscribes to it with application, 
 "Even my afflictions are just and kind."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_76"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_77"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>76  Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
 according to thy word unto thy servant.
 &nbsp; 77  Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for
 thy law <I>is</I> my delight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. An earnest petition to God for his favour. Those that own the 
 justice of God in their afflictions (as David had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:75"><I>v.</I> 75</A>)

 may, in faith, and with humble boldness, be earnest for the mercy of 
 God, and the tokens and fruits of that mercy, in their affliction. He 
 prays for God's <I>merciful kindness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:76"><I>v.</I> 76</A>),
 
 his <I>tender mercies,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:77"><I>v.</I> 77</A>.

 He can claim nothing as his due, but all his supports under his 
 affliction must come from mere mercy and compassion to one in misery, 
 one in want. "Let these <I>come to me,</I>" that is, "the evidence of
 them (clear it up to me that thou hast a kindness for me, and mercy in 
 store), and the effects of them; let them work my relief and 
 deliverance." 

 2. The benefit he promised himself from God's lovingkindness: "Let it 
 <I>come to me for my comfort</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:76"><I>v.</I> 76</A>);

 that will comfort me when nothing else will; that will comfort me 
 whatever grieves me." Gracious souls fetch all their comfort from a 
 gracious God, as the fountain of all happiness and joy: "Let it <I>come 
 to me, that I may live,</I> that is, that I may be revived, and my life 
 may be made sweet to me, for I have no joy of it while I am under God's 
 displeasure. <I>In his favour is life;</I> in his frowns are death." A 
 good man cannot live with any satisfaction any longer than he has some 
 tokens of God's favour to him. 

 3. His pleas for the benefits of God's favour. He pleads,

 (1.) God's promise: "Let me have thy kindness, <I>according to thy word 
 unto thy servant,</I> the kindness which thou hast promised and because 
 thou hast promised it." Our Master has passed his word to all his 
 servants that he will be kind to them, and they may plead it with him. 
 
 (2.) His own confidence and complacency in that promise: "<I>Thy law is 
 my delight;</I> I hope in thy word and rejoice in that hope." Note, 
 Those that delight in the law of God may depend upon the favour of God, 
 for it shall certainly make them happy.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_78"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_79"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>78  Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
 without a cause: <I>but</I> I will meditate in thy precepts.
 &nbsp; 79  Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
 known thy testimonies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here David shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How little he valued the will--will of sinners. There were those that
 dealt perversely with him, that were peevish and ill-conditioned 
 towards him, that sought advantages against him, and misconstrued all 
 he said and did. Even those that deal most fairly may meet with those 
 that deal perversely. But David regarded it not, for, 

 1. He knew it was <I>without cause,</I> and that for his love they were 
 his adversaries. The causeless reproach, like the curse causeless, may
 be easily slighted; it does not hurt us, and therefore should not move 
 us. 

 2. He could pray, in faith, that they might <I>be ashamed</I> of it; 
 God's dealing favourably with him might make them ashamed to think that 
 they had dealt perversely with him. "<I>Let</I> them <I>be ashamed,</I> 
 that is, let them be brought either to repentance or to ruin." 

 3. He could go on in the way of his duty, and find comfort in that. 
 "However they deal with me, <I>I will meditate in thy precepts,</I> and 
 entertain myself with them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How much he valued the good-will of saints, and how desirous he was 
 to stand right in their opinion, and keep up his interest in them and 
 communion with them: <I>Let those that fear thee turn to me.</I> He 
 does not mean so much that they might side with him, and take up arms 
 in his cause, as that they might love him, and pray for him, and 
 associate with him. Good men desire the friendship and society of those 
 that are good. Some think it intimates that when David had been guilty 
 of that foul sin in the murder of Uriah, though he was a king, those 
 that feared God grew strange to him and turned from him, for they were 
 ashamed of him; this troubled him, and therefore he prays, Lord, let 
 them <I>turn to me again.</I> He desires especially the company of 
 those that were not only honest, but intelligent, <I>that have known 
 thy testimonies,</I> have good heads as well as good hearts, and whose 
 conversation will be edifying. It is desirable to have an intimacy with 
 such.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_80"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>80  Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not
 ashamed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's prayer for sincerity, that his heart might be brought to 
 God's <I>statutes,</I> and that it might be <I>sound</I> in them, not 
 rotten and deceitful, that he might not rest in the form of godliness, 
 but be acquainted with the subject to the power of it,--that he might 
 be hearty and constant in religion, and that his soul might be in 
 health. 

 2. His dread of the consequences of hypocrisy: <I>That I be not 
 ashamed.</I> Shame is the portion of hypocrites, either here, if it be 
 repented of, or hereafter, if it be not: "<I>Let my heart be sound,</I> 
 that I fall not into scandalous sin, that I fall not quite off from the 
 ways of God, and so shame myself. <I>Let my heart be sound,</I> that I 
 may come <I>boldly to the throne of grace,</I> and may lift up my face 
 without spot at the great day."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the psalmist,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Longing for help from heaven: <I>My soul faints; my eyes fail.</I> 
 He longs <I>for the salvation of the Lord</I> and <I>for his word,</I> 
 that is, salvation according to the word. He is not thus eager for the 
 creatures of fancy, but for the objects of faith, salvation from the 
 present calamities under which he was groaning and the doubts and fears 
 which he was oppressed with. It may be understood of the coming of the 
 Messiah, and so he speaks in the name of the Old-Testament church; the 
 souls of the faithful even <I>fainted to see</I> that salvation of 
 which the prophets testified. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>);

 their eyes failed for it. Abraham saw it at a distance, and so did
 others, but at such a distance that it put their eyes to the stretch 
 and they could not stedfastly see it. David was now under prevailing 
 dejections, and, having been long so, his eyes cried our, "<I>When wilt 
 thou comfort me?</I> Comfort me with <I>thy salvation,</I> comfort me 
 with <I>thy word.</I>" Observe,

 1. The salvation and consolation of God's people are secured to them by 
 the word, which will certainly be fulfilled in its season. 

 2. The promised salvation and comfort may be, and often are, long 
 deferred, so that they are ready to faint and fall in the expectation 
 of them. 

 3. Though we think the time long ere the promised salvation and comfort 
 come, yet we must still keep our eye upon that salvation, and resolve 
 to take up with nothing short of it. "Thy salvation, thy word, thy 
 comfort, are what my heart is still upon."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Waiting for that help, assured that it will come, and tarrying till 
 it come: <I>But I hope in thy word;</I> and but for hope the heart 
 would break. When the <I>eyes fail</I> yet the faith must not; for 
 <I>the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak 
 and shall not lie.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_83"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>83  For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; <I>yet</I> do I not
 forget thy statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David begs God would make haste to comfort him, 

 1. Because his affliction was great, and therefore he was an object of 
 God's pity: Lord, make haste to help me, <I>for I have become like a 
 bottle in the smoke,</I> a leathern bottle, which, if it hung any while 
 in the smoke, was not only blackened with soot, but dried, and parched, 
 and shrivelled up. David was thus wasted by age, and sickness, and 
 sorrow. See how affliction will mortify the strongest and stoutest of
 men! David had been of a ruddy countenance, as fresh as a rose; but
 now he is withered, his colour is gone, his cheeks are furrowed. Thus 
 does man's beauty consume under God's rebukes, as a moth fretting a 
 garment. A bottle, when it is thus wrinkled with smoke, is thrown by,
 and there is no more use of it. Who will put wine into such old 
 bottles? Thus was David, in his low estate, looked upon <I>as a 
 despised broken vessel,</I> and as <I>a vessel in which there was no 
 pleasure.</I> Good men, when they are drooping and melancholy, 
 sometimes think themselves more slighted than really they are. 

 2. Because, though his affliction was great, yet it had not driven him
 from his duty, and therefore he was within the reach of God's promise: 
 <I>Yet do I not forget thy statutes.</I> Whatever our outward condition 
 is we must not cool in our affection to the word of God, nor let that 
 slip out of our minds; no care, no grief, must crowd that out. As some 
 <I>drink and forget the law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>),

 so others weep and forget the law; but we must in every condition, both 
 prosperous and adverse, have the things of God in remembrance; and, if 
 we be mindful of God's statutes, we may pray and hope that he will be 
 mindful of our sorrows, though for a time he seems to forget us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>84  How many <I>are</I> the days of thy servant? when wilt thou
 execute judgment on them that persecute me?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. David prays against the instruments of his troubles, that God would 
 make haste to execute judgment on those that persecuted him. He prays 
 not for power to avenge himself (he bore no malice to any), but that 
 God would take to himself the vengeance that belonged to him, and 
 <I>would repay</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19">Rom. xii. 19</A>),

 as the God that <I>sits in the throne judging right.</I> There is a day 
 coming, and a great and terrible day it will be, when God will execute 
 judgment on all the proud persecutors of his people, <I>tribulation to 
 those that troubled them;</I> Enoch foretold it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>),

 whose prophecy perhaps David here had an eye to; and that day we are to 
 look for and pray for the hastening of. <I>Come, Lord Jesus, come 
 quickly.</I> 

 2. He pleads the long continuance of his trouble: "<I>How many are the 
 days of thy servant? The days of my life are but few</I>" (so some); 
 "therefore let them not all be miserable, and therefore make haste to 
 appear for me against my enemies, <I>before I go hence and shall be 
 seen no more.</I>" Or rather, "<I>The days of my affliction are 
 many;</I> thou seest, Lord, how many they be; when wilt thou return in 
 mercy to me? Sometimes, for the elect's sake, <I>the days of trouble 
 are shortened.</I> O let the days of my trouble be shortened; I am 
 <I>thy servant;</I> and therefore, as the eyes of a servant are to the 
 hand of his master, so are mine to thee, until thou have mercy on 
 me."</P>

 &nbsp; 87  They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not
 thy precepts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David's state was <I>herein</I> a type and figure of the state both of 
 Christ and Christians that he was grievously persecuted; as there are 
 many of his psalms, so there are many of the verses of this psalm, 
 which complain of this, as those here. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account he gives of his persecutors and their malice against 
 him. 

 1. They were <I>proud,</I> and in their pride <I>they persecuted 
 him,</I> glorying in this, that they could trample upon one who was so 
 much cried up, and hoping to raise themselves on his ruins. 

 2. They were unjust: <I>They persecuted him wrongfully;</I> so far was 
 he from giving them any provocation that he had studied to oblige them; 
 but <I>for his love they were his adversaries.</I> 

 3. They were spiteful: <I>They dug pits for him,</I> which intimates 
 that they were deliberate in their designs against him and that what 
 they did was of malice prepense; it intimates likewise that they were 
 subtle and crafty, and had the serpent's head as well as the serpent's 
 venom, that they were industrious and would refuse no pains to do him a 
 mischief, and treacherous, laying snares in secret for him, as hunters 
 do take wild beasts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:7">Ps. xxxv. 7</A>.

 Such has been the enmity of the serpent's seed to the seed of the 
 woman. 

 4. They herein showed their enmity to God himself. The pits they <I>dug 
 for him</I> were <I>not after God's law;</I> he means they were very 
 much against his law, which forbids to <I>devise evil to our 
 neighbour,</I> and has particularly said, <I>Touch not my anointed.</I> 
 The law appointed that, if a man dug a pit which occasioned any 
 mischief, he should answer for the mischief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:33,34">Exod. xxi. 33, 34</A>),

 much more when it was dug with a mischievous design.

 5. They carried on their designs against him so far that <I>they had 
 almost consumed him upon earth;</I> they went near to ruin him and all 
 his interests. It is possible that those who shall shortly be
 consummate in heaven may be, for the present, <I>almost consumed on 
 earth;</I> and <I>it is of the Lord's mercies</I> (and, considering the 
 malice of their enemies, it is a miracle of mercy) <I>that they are not 
 quite consumed.</I> But the bush in which God is, though it burns, 
 shall not be burnt up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His application to God in his persecuted state. 

 1. He acknowledges the truth and goodness of his religion, though he 
 suffered: "However it be, <I>all thy commandments are faithful,</I> and 
 therefore, whatever I lose for my observance of them, I know I shall 
 not lose by it." True religion, if it be worth any thing, is worth 
 every thing, and therefore worth suffering for. "Men are false; I find 
 them do; men of low degree, men of high degree, are so, there is no 
 trusting them. But <I>all thy commandments are faithful;</I> on them I 
 may rely." 

 2. He begs that God would stand by him, and succour him: "<I>They 
 persecute me; help thou me;</I> help me under my troubles, that I may 
 bear them patiently, and as becomes me, and may still hold fast my 
 integrity, and in due time help me out of my troubles." <I>God help 
 me</I> is an excellent comprehensive prayer; it is a pity that it 
 should ever be used lightly and as a by-word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His adherence to his duty notwithstanding all the malice of his 
 persecutors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:87"><I>v.</I> 87</A>):

 <I>But I forsook not thy precepts.</I> That which they aimed at was to 
 frighten him from the ways of God, but they could not prevail; he would 
 sooner forsake all that was dear to him in this world than forsake the 
 word of God, would sooner lose his life than lose the comfort of doing 
 his duty.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_88"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>88  Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
 testimony of thy mouth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David in care to be found in the way of his duty. His constant 
 desire and design are to <I>keep the testimony of God's mouth,</I> to 
 keep to it as his rule and to keep hold of it as his confidence and 
 portion for ever. This we must keep, whatever we lose.

 2. David at prayer for divine grace to assist him therein: "<I>Quicken 
 me after thy lovingkindness</I> (make me alive and make me lively), 
 <I>so shall I keep thy testimonies,</I>" implying that otherwise he 
 should not keep them. We cannot proceed, nor persevere, in the good 
 way, unless God quicken us and put life into us; we are therefore here 
 taught to depend upon the grace of God for strength to do every good 
 work, and to depend upon it as grace, as purely the fruit of God's 
 favour. He had prayed before, <I>Quicken me in thy righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);

 but here, <I>Quicken me after thy lovingkindness.</I> The surest token 
 of God's good-will toward us is his good work in us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>89  For ever, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thy word is settled in heaven.
 &nbsp; 90  Thy faithfulness <I>is</I> unto all generations: thou hast
 established the earth, and it abideth.
 &nbsp; 91  They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for
 all <I>are</I> thy servants.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. The psalmist acknowledges the unchangeableness of the word of God 
 and of all his counsels: "<I>For ever, O Lord! thy word is settled.
 Thou art for ever thyself</I> (so some read it); thou art the same, and 
 with thee there is no variableness, and this is a proof of it. <I>Thy 
 word,</I> by which the heavens were made, <I>is settled</I> there in 
 the abiding products of it;" or the settling of God's word in heaven is 
 opposed to the changes and revolutions that are here upon earth. <I>All 
 flesh is grass;</I> but <I>the word of the Lord endures for ever.</I> 
 It <I>is settled in heaven,</I> that is, in the secret counsel of God, 
 which is hidden in himself and is far above out of our sight, and is 
 immovable, <I>as mountains of brass.</I> And his revealed will is as 
 firm as his secret will; as he will fulfil the thoughts of his heart, 
 so no word of his shall <I>fall to the ground;</I> for it follows here, 
 <I>Thy faithfulness is unto all generations,</I> that is, the promise 
 is sure to every age of the church and it cannot be antiquated by lapse 
 of time. The promises that look ever so far forward shall be performed 
 in their season. 

 2. He produces, for proof of it, the constancy of the course of nature: 
 <I>Thou hast established the earth for ever and it abides;</I> it is 
 what it was at first made, and where it was at first placed, poised 
 with its own weight, and notwithstanding the convulsions in its own 
 bowels, the agitations of the sea that is interwoven with it, and the 
 violent concussions of the atmosphere that surrounds it, it remains 
 unmoved. "<I>They</I>" (the heavens and the earth and all the hosts of 
 both) "<I>continue to this day according to thy ordinances;</I> they 
 remain in the posts wherein thou hast set them; they fill up the place 
 assigned them, and answer the purposes for which they were intended." 
 The stability of the ordinances of the day and night, of heaven and 
 earth, is produced to prove the perpetuity of God's covenant, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35,36,33:20,21">Jer. xxxi. 35, 36; xxxiii. 20, 21</A>.
 
 It is by virtue of God's promise to Noah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:22">Gen. viii. 22</A>)

 that <I>day and night, summer and winter,</I> observe a steady course. 
 "They have continued to this day, and shall still continue to the end 
 of time, acting according to the ordinances which were at first given 
 them; for all are thy servants; they do thy will, and set forth thy 
 glory, and in both <I>are thy servants.</I>" All the creatures are, in 
 their places, and according to their capacities, serviceable to their 
 Creator, and answer the ends of their creation; and shall man be the 
 only rebel, the only revolter from his allegiance, and the only 
 unprofitable burden of the earth?</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_92"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>92  Unless thy law <I>had been</I> my delights, I should then have
 perished in mine affliction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The great distress that David was in. He was in affliction, and 
 ready to <I>perish in his affliction,</I> not likely to die, so much as 
 likely to despair; he was ready to give up all for gone, and to look 
 upon himself as cut off from God's sight; he therefore admires the 
 goodness of God to him, that he had not perished, that he kept the 
 possession of his own soul, and was not driven out of his wits by his 
 troubles, but especially that he was enabled to keep close to his God 
 and was not driven off from his religion by them. Though we are not 
 kept from affliction, yet, if we are kept from perishing in our 
 affliction, we have no reason to say, <I>We have cleansed our hands in 
 vain;</I> or, <I>What profit is it that we have served God?</I> 

 2. His support in this distress. God's law was his delight,

 (1.) It had been so formerly, and the remembrance of that was a comfort 
 to him, as it afforded him a good evidence of his integrity. 

 (2.) It was so now in his affliction; it afforded him abundant matter 
 of comfort, and from these fountains of life he drew living waters, 
 when the cisterns of the creature were broken or dried up. His converse 
 with God's law, and his meditations on it, were his delightful 
 entertainment in solitude and sorrow. A Bible is a pleasant companion 
 at any time if we please.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_93"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>93  I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
 quickened me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A very good resolution: "<I>I will never forget thy precepts,</I> 
 but will always retain a remembrance of and regard to thy word as my 
 rule." It is a resolution for perpetuity, never to be altered. Note, 
 The best evidence of our love to the word of God is never to forget it. 
 We must resolve that we will never, at any time, cast off our religion, 
 and never, upon any occasion, lay aside our religion, but that we will 
 be constant to it and persevere in it. 

 2. A very good reason for it: "<I>For by them thou hast quickened 
 me;</I> not only they are quickening, but,"

 (1.) "They have been so to me; I have found them so." Those speak best 
 of the things of God who speak by experience, who can say that by the 
 word the spiritual life has been begun in them, maintained and 
 strengthened in them, excited and comforted in them. 

 (2.) "Thou hast made them so;" the word of itself, without the grace of 
 God, would not quicken us. Ministers can but prophesy upon the dry 
 bones, they cannot put life into them; but, ordinarily, the grace of 
 God works by the word and makes use of it as a means of quickening, and 
 this is a good reason why we should never forget it, but should highly 
 value what God has put such honour upon, and dearly love what we have 
 found and hope still to find such benefit by. See here what is the best 
 help for bad memories, namely, good affections. If we are quickened by 
 the word, we shall never forget it; nay, that word that does really 
 quicken us to and in our duty is not forgotten; though the expressions 
 be lost, if the impressions remain, it is well.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_94"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>94  I <I>am</I> thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David claims relation to God: "<I>I am thine,</I> devoted to thee 
 and owned by thee, thine in covenant." He does not say, <I>Thou art 
 mine</I> (as Dr. Manton observes), though that follows of course, 
 because that were a higher challenge; but, <I>I am thine,</I> 
 expressing himself in a more humble and dutiful way of resignation; nor 
 does he say, <I>I am thus,</I> but, <I>I am thine,</I> not pleading his 
 own good property or qualification, but God's propriety in him: "<I>I 
 am thine,</I> not my own, not the world's." 

 2. He proves his claim: "<I>I have sought thy precepts;</I> I have 
 carefully enquired concerning my duty and diligently endeavoured to do 
 it." This will be the best evidence that we belong to God; all that are 
 his, though they have not found perfection, are seeking it. 

 3. He improves his claim: "<I>I am thine; save me;</I> save me from 
 sin, save me from ruin." Those that have in sincerity given up 
 themselves to God to be his may be sure that he will protect them and 
 preserve them to his heavenly kingdom,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David complains of the malice of his enemies: <I>The wicked</I> (and 
 none but such would be enemies to so good a man) <I>have waited for me 
 to destroy me.</I> They were very cruel, and aimed at no less than his 
 destruction; they were very crafty, and sought all opportunities to do 
 him a mischief; and they were <I>confident</I> (they <I>expected,</I> 
 so some read it), that they should destroy him; they thought themselves 
 sure of their prey. 

 2. He comforts himself in the word of God as his protection: "While 
 they are contriving my destruction, <I>I consider thy testimonies,</I> 
 which secure to me my salvation." God's testimonies are <I>then</I> 
 likely to be our support, when we consider them, and dwell in our 
 thoughts upon them.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_96"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>96  I have seen an end of all perfection: <I>but</I> thy commandment
 <I>is</I> exceeding broad.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have David's testimony from his own experience, 

 1. Of the vanity of the world and its insufficiency to make us happy: 
 <I>I have seen an end of all perfection.</I> Poor perfection which one 
 sees an end of! Yet such are all those things in this world which pass 
 for perfections. David, in his time, had seen Goliath, the strongest, 
 overcome, Asahel, the swiftest, overtaken, Ahithophel, the wisest, 
 befooled, Absalom, the fairest, deformed; and, in short, he had <I>seen 
 an end of perfection,</I> of <I>all perfection.</I> He saw it by faith; 
 he saw it by observation; he saw an end of the perfection of the 
 creature both in respect of sufficiency (it was scanty and defective; 
 there is that to be done for us which the creature cannot do) and in 
 respect of continuance; it will not last our time, for it will not last 
 to eternity as we must. The glory of man is but as the flower of the 
 grass. 

 2. Of the fulness of the word of God, and its sufficiency for our 
 satisfaction: <I>But thy commandment is broad, exceedingly broad.</I> 
 The word of God reaches to all cases, to all times. The divine law lays 
 a restraint upon the whole man, is designed to sanctify us wholly. 
 There is a great deal required and forbidden in every commandment. The 
 divine promise (for that also is commanded) extends itself to all our 
 burdens, wants, and grievances, and has that in it which will make a 
 portion and happiness for us when we <I>have seen an end of all 
 perfection.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's inexpressible love to the word of God: <I>O how love I thy 
 law!</I> He protests his affection to the word of God with a holy 
 vehemency; he found that love to it in his heart which, considering the 
 corruption of his nature and the temptations of the world, he could not 
 but wonder at, and at that grace which had wrought it in him. He not 
 only loved the promises, but loved the law, and delighted in it after 
 the inner man. 

 2. An unexceptionable evidence of this. What we love we love to think 
 of; by <I>this</I> it appeared that David loved the word of God that it 
 was his <I>meditation.</I> He not only read the book of the law, but 
 digested what he read in his thoughts, and was delivered into it as 
 into a mould: it was his meditation not only in the night, when he was 
 silent and solitary, and had nothing else to do, but in the day, when 
 he was full of business and company; nay, and <I>all the day;</I> some 
 good thoughts were interwoven with his common thoughts, so full was he 
 of the word of God.</P>

 &nbsp; 100  I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of David's learning, not that of the Egyptians, 
 but of the <I>Israelites indeed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The good method by which he got it. In his youth he minded business 
 in the country as a shepherd; from his youth he minded business in the 
 court and camp. Which way then could he get any great stock of 
 learning? He tells us here how he came by it; he had it from God as the 
 author: <I>Thou hast made me wise.</I> All true wisdom is from God. He 
 had it by the word of God as the means, by <I>his commandments</I> and 
 <I>his testimonies.</I> These are able to <I>make us wise to 
 salvation</I> and <I>to furnish the man of God for every good work.</I>

 1. These David took for his constant companions: "<I>They are ever with
 me,</I> ever in my mind, ever in my eye." A good man, wherever he goes, 
 carries his Bible along with him, if not in his hands, yet in his head 
 and in his heart. 

 2. These he took for the delightful subject of his thoughts; they were 
 his <I>meditation,</I> not only as matters of speculation for his 
 entertainment, as scholars meditate on their notions, but as matters of 
 concern, for his right management, as men of business think of their 
 business, that they may do it in the best manner. 

 3. These he took for the commanding rules of all his actions: <I>I keep 
 thy precepts,</I> that is, I make conscience of doing my duty in every 
 thing. The best way to improve in knowledge is to abide and abound in 
 all the instances of serious godliness; for, <I>if any man do his will, 
 he shall know of the doctrine</I> of Christ, shall know more and more 
 of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.
 
 The love of the truth prepares for the light of it; the <I>pure in 
 heart shall see God</I> here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great eminency he attained to in it. By studying and practising 
 God's commandments, and making them his rule, he learnt to <I>behave 
 himself wisely in all his ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:14">1 Sam. xviii. 14</A>.

 2. He outwitted his enemies; God, by these means, made him wiser to 
 baffle and defeat their designs against him than they were to lay them. 
 Heavenly wisdom will carry the point, at last, against carnal policy. 
 By keeping the commandments we secure God on our side and make him our 
 friend, and therein are certainly wiser than those that make him their 
 enemy. By keeping the commandments we preserve in ourselves that peace 
 and quiet of mind which our enemies would rob us of, and so are wise 
 for ourselves, wiser than they are for themselves, for this world as 
 well as for the other. 

 2. He outstripped his <I>teachers,</I> and had more understanding than 
 all of them. He means either those who would have been his teachers, 
 who blamed his conduct and undertook to prescribe to him (by keeping 
 God's commandments he managed his matters so that it appeared, in the 
 event, he had taken the right measures and they had taken the wrong), 
 or those who should have been his teachers, the priests and Levites, 
 who sat in Moses's chair, and whose lips ought to have kept knowledge, 
 but who neglected the study of the law, and minded their honours and 
 revenues, and the formalities only of their religion; and so David, who 
 conversed much with the scriptures, by that means became more 
 intelligent than they. Or he may mean those who had been his teachers 
 when he was young; he built so well upon the foundation which they had 
 laid that, with the help of his Bible, he became able to teach them, to 
 teach them all. He was not now a babe that needed milk, but had 
 <I>spiritual senses exercised,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:14">Heb. v. 14</A>.

 It is no reflection upon our teachers, but rather an honour to them, to 
 improve so as really to excel them, and not to need them. By meditation 
 we preach to ourselves, and so we come to <I>understand more than our 
 teachers,</I> for we come to understand our own hearts, which they 
 cannot. 

 3. He outdid <I>the ancients,</I> either those of his day (he was 
 young, like Elihu, and they were very old, but his keeping God's 
 precepts taught more wisdom than the multitude of their years,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:7,8">Job xxxii. 7, 8</A>)

 or those of former days; he himself quotes the proverb of the ancients 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>),

 but the word of God gave him to understand things better than he could 
 do by tradition and all the learning that was handed down from 
 preceding ages. In short, the written word is a surer guide to heaven 
 than all the doctors and fathers, the teachers and ancients, of the 
 church; and the sacred writings kept, and kept to, will teach us more 
 wisdom than all their writings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's care to avoid the ways of sin: "<I>I have refrained my feet 
 from the evil ways</I> they were ready to step aside into. I checked 
 myself and drew back as soon as I was aware that I was entering into 
 temptation." Though it was a broad way, a green way, a pleasant way, 
 and a way that many walked in, yet, being a sinful way, it was an evil 
 way, and he refrained his feet from it, foreseeing the end of that way. 
 And his care was universal; he shunned every evil way. <I>By the words 
 of thy lips I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:4">Ps. xvii. 4</A>.

 2. His care to be found in the way of duty; <I>That I might keep thy 
 word,</I> and never transgress it. His abstaining from sin was,

 (1.) An evidence that he did conscientiously aim to keep God's word and 
 had made that his rule. 

 (2.) It was a means of his keeping God's word in the exercises of 
 religion; for we cannot with any comfort or boldness attend on God in 
 holy duties, so as in them to keep his word, while we are under guilt 
 or in any by-way.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_102"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>102  I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast
 taught me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's constancy in his religion. He had <I>not departed from God's 
 judgments;</I> he had not chosen any other rule than the word of God, 
 nor had he wilfully deviated from that rule. A constant adherence to 
 the ways of God in trying times will be a good evidence of our 
 integrity. 

 2. The cause of his constancy: "<I>For thou hast taught me;</I> that 
 is, they were divine instructions that I learned; I was satisfied that 
 the doctrine was of God, and therefore I stuck to it." Or rather, "It 
 was divine grace in my heart that enabled me to receive those 
 instructions." All the saints are taught of God, for he it is that 
 gives the understanding; and those, and those only, that are taught of 
 God, will continue to the end in the things that they have learned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>103  How sweet are thy words unto my taste! <I>yea, sweeter</I> than
 honey to my mouth!
 &nbsp; 104  Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
 every false way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The wonderful pleasure and delight which David took in the word of 
 God; it was <I>sweet to his taste, sweeter than honey.</I> There is 
 such a thing as a spiritual taste, an inward savour and relish of 
 divine things, such an evidence of them to ourselves, by experience, as 
 we cannot give to others. We have <I>heard him ourselves,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:2">John iv. 42</A>.

 To this scripture-taste the word of God is sweet, very sweet, sweeter 
 than any of the gratifications of sense, even those that are most 
 delicious. David speaks as if he wanted words to express the 
 satisfaction he took in the discoveries of the divine will and grace; 
 no pleasure was comparable to it.

 2. The unspeakable profit and advantage he gained by the word of God.

 (1.) It helped him to a good head: "<I>Through thy precepts I get 
 understanding</I> to discern between truth and falsehood, good and 
 evil, so as not to mistake either in the conduct of my own life or in 
 advising others." 

 (2.) It helped him to a good heart: "<I>Therefore,</I> because I have 
 got understanding of the truth, <I>I hate every false way,</I> and am 
 stedfastly resolved not to turn aside into it." Observe here,

 [1.] The way of sin is a false way; it deceives, and will ruin, all 
 that walk in it; it is the wrong way, and yet it seems to a man right, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:12">Prov. xiv. 12</A>.

 [2.] It is the character of every good man that he hates the way of 
 sin, and hates it because it is a false way; he not only refrains his 
 feet from it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:101"><I>v.</I> 101</A>),

 but he <I>hates it,</I> has an antipathy to it and a dread of it. 

 [3.] Those who hate sin as sin will hate all sin, hate every false way, 
 because every false way leads to destruction. And,

 [4.] The more understanding we get by the word of God the more rooted 
 will our hatred of sin be (for <I>to depart from evil, that is 
 understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>),

 and the more ready we are in the scriptures the better furnished we are 
 with answers to temptation.</P>

 path.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. The nature of the word of God, and the great intention of giving it 
 to the world; it is a <I>lamp and a light.</I> It discovers to us, 
 concerning God and ourselves, that which otherwise we could not have 
 known; it shows us what is amiss, and will be dangerous; it directs us 
 in our work and way, and a dark place indeed the world would be without 
 it. It is a lamp which we may set up by us, and take into our hands for 
 our own particular use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:23">Prov. vi. 23</A>.

 The commandment is a lamp kept burning with the oil of the Spirit; it 
 is like the lamps in the sanctuary, and the pillar of fire to Israel.

 2. The use we should make of it. It must be not only a <I>light to our
 eyes,</I> to gratify them, and fill our heads with speculations, but a
 <I>light to our feet</I> and <I>to our path,</I> to direct us in the 
 right ordering of our conversation, both in the choice of our way in 
 general and in the particular steps we take in that way, that we may 
 not take a false way nor a false step in the right way. We are then
 truly sensible of God's goodness to us in giving us such a lamp and 
 light when we make it a guide to our feet, our path.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_106"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>106  I have sworn, and I will perform <I>it,</I> that I will keep thy
 righteous judgments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The notion David had of religion; it is <I>keeping God's righteous 
 judgments.</I> God's commands are his judgments, the dictates of 
 infinite wisdom. They are righteous judgments, consonant to the eternal 
 rules of equity, and it is our duty to keep them carefully. 

 2. The obligation he here laid upon himself to be religious, binding
 himself, by his own promise, to that which he was already bound to by 
 the divine precept, and all little enough. "<I>I have sworn (I have 
 lifted up my head to the Lord, and I cannot go back</I>) and therefore 
 must go forward: <I>I will perform it.</I>" Note,

 (1.) It is good for us to bind ourselves with a solemn oath to be 
 religious. We must swear to the Lord as subjects swear allegiance to 
 their sovereign, promising fealty, appealing to God concerning our 
 sincerity in this promise, and owning ourselves liable to the curse if
 we do not perform it. 

 (2.) We must often call to mind the vows of God that are upon us, and 
 remember that we have sworn. 

 (3.) We must make conscience of performing unto the Lord our oaths (an 
 honest man will be as good as his word); nor have we sworn to our own 
 hurt, but it will be unspeakably to our hurt if we do not perform.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_107"> </A>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The representation David makes of the sorrowful condition he was in: 
 <I>I am afflicted very much,</I> afflicted in spirit; he seems to mean 
 that especially. He laboured under many discouragements; without were 
 fightings, within were fears. This is often the lot of the best
 saints; therefore think it not strange if sometimes it be ours. 

 2. The recourse he has to God in this condition; he prays for his 
 grace: "<I>Quicken me, O Lord!</I> make me lively, make me cheerful; 
 quicken me by afflictions to greater diligence in my work. <I>Quicken 
 me,</I> that is, deliver me out of my afflictions, which will be as 
 life from the dead." He pleads the promise of God, guides his desires 
 by it, and grounds his hopes upon it: <I>Quicken me according to thy 
 word.</I> David resolved to perform his promises to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:106"><I>v.</I> 106</A>)

 and therefore could, with humble boldness, beg of God to make good his 
 word to him.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_108"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>108  Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth,
 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and teach me thy judgments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things we are here taught to pray for, in reference to our 
 religious performances:--

 1. Acceptance of them. This we must aim at in all we do in religion, 
 that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of the Lord. What 
 David here earnestly prays for the acceptance of are the 
 <I>free-will-offerings,</I> not of his purse, but of his <I>mouth,</I> 
 his prayers and praises. <I>The calves of our lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>),
 
 <I>the fruit of our lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:15">Heb. i. 15</A>),

 these are the spiritual offerings which all Christians, as spiritual 
 priests, must offer to God; and they must be 
 <I>free-will-offerings,</I> for we must offer them abundantly and 
 cheerfully, and it is this willing mind that is accepted. The more 
 there is of freeness and willingness in the service of God the more 
 pleasing it is to him.

 2. Assistance in them: <I>Teach me thy judgments.</I> We cannot offer 
 any thing to God which we have reason to think he will accept of, but 
 what he is pleased to instruct us in the doing of; and we must be as 
 earnest for the grace of God in us as for the favour of God towards 
 us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>109  My soul <I>is</I> continually in my hand: yet do I not forget
 thy law.
 &nbsp; 110  The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from
 thy precepts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David in danger of losing his life. There is but a step between him 
 and death, for the <I>wicked have laid a snare</I> for him; Saul did so 
 many a time, because he hated him for his piety. Wherever he was he 
 found some design or other laid against him to take away his life, for 
 it was that they aimed at. What they could not effect by open force 
 they hoped to compass by treachery, which made him say, <I>My soul is 
 continually in my hand.</I> It was so with him, not only as a 
 <I>man</I> (so it is true of us all; wherever we are we lie exposed to 
 the strokes of death; what we carry in our hands is easily snatched 
 away from us by violence, or if sandy, as our life is, it easily of 
 itself slips through our fingers), but as a <I>man of war,</I> a 
 soldier, who often jeoparded his life in the high places of the field, 
 and especially as <I>a man after God's own heart,</I> and, as such, 
 hated and persecuted, and <I>always delivered to death</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:11">2 Cor. iv. 11</A>),
 
 <I>killed all the day long.</I>

 2. David in no danger of losing his religion, notwithstanding this, 
 thus in jeopardy every hour and yet constant to God and his duty. None 
 of these things move him; for,

 (1.) He <I>does not forget the law,</I> and therefore he is likely to 
 persevere. In the multitude of his cares for his own safety he finds 
 room in his head and heart for the word of God, and has that in his 
 mind as fresh as ever; and where that dwells richly it will be a 
 <I>well of living water.</I> 

 (2.) He has not yet erred from God's precepts, and therefore it is to 
 be hoped he will not. He had stood many a shock and kept his ground, 
 and surely that grace which had helped him hitherto would not fail him, 
 but would still prevent his wanderings.</P>

 <I>even unto</I> the end.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here in a most affectionate manner, like an Israelite 
 indeed, resolves to stick to the word of God and to live and die by 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He resolves to portion himself in it, and there to seek his 
 happiness, nay, there to enjoy it; "<I>Thy testimonies</I> (the truths, 
 the promises, of thy word) <I>have I taken as a heritage for ever, for 
 they are the rejoicing of my heart.</I>" The present delight he took in 
 them was an evidence that the good things contained in them were in his 
 account the best things, and the treasure which he set his heart upon. 

 1. He expected an eternal happiness in God's testimonies. The covenant 
 God had made with him was an everlasting covenant, and therefore he 
 took it as <I>a heritage for ever.</I> If he could not yet say, "They 
 are my heritage," yet he could say, "I have made choice of them for my 
 heritage; and will never take up with a portion in this life," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14,15">Ps. xvii. 14, 15</A>.

 God's testimonies are a heritage to all that have received the Spirit 
 of adoption; for, <I>if children, then heirs.</I> They are a 
 <I>heritage for ever,</I> and that no earthly heritage is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1 Pet. i. 4</A>);
 
 all the saints accept them as such, take up with them, live upon them, 
 and can therefore be content with but little of this world.

 2. He enjoyed a present satisfaction in them: <I>They are the rejoicing 
 of my heart,</I> because they will be <I>my heritage for ever.</I> It 
 requires the heart of a good man to see his portion in the promise of 
 God and not in the possessions of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He resolves to govern himself by it and thence to take his 
 measures: <I>I have inclined my heart to do thy statutes.</I> Those 
 that would have the blessings of God's testimonies must come under the 
 bonds of his statutes. We must look for comfort only in the way of 
 duty, and that duty must be done, 

 1. With full consent and complacency: "<I>I have,</I> by the grace of 
 God, <I>inclined my heart to it,</I> and conquered the aversion I had 
 to it." A good man brings his heart to his work and then it is done 
 well. A gracious disposition to do the will of God is the acceptable 
 principle of all obedience. 

 2. With constancy and perseverance. He would perform God's statutes 
 always, in all instances, in the duty of every day, in a constant 
 course of holy walking, and this <I>to the end,</I> without weariness. 
 This is following the Lord fully.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>113  I hate <I>vain</I> thoughts: but thy law do I love.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. David's dread of the risings of sin, and the first beginnings of it: 
 <I>I hate</I> vain <I>thoughts.</I> He does not mean that he hated them 
 in others, for there he could not discern them, but he hated them in 
 his own heart. Every good man makes conscience of his thoughts, for 
 they are words to God. Vain thoughts, how light soever most make of 
 them, are sinful and hurtful, and therefore we should account them 
 hateful and dreadful, for they do not only divert the mind from that 
 which is good, but open the door to all evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14">Jer. iv. 14</A>.

 Though David could not say that he was free from vain thoughts, yet he 
 could say that he hated them; he did not countenance them, nor give 
 them any entertainment, but did what he could to keep them out, at 
 least to keep them under. <I>The evil I do I allow not.</I>

 2. David's delight in the rule of duty: <I>But thy law do I love,</I> 
 which forbids those vain thoughts, and threatens them. The more we love 
 the law of God the more we shall get the mastery of our vain thoughts, 
 the more hateful they will be to us, as being contrary to the whole 
 law, and the more watchful we shall be against them, lest they draw us 
 from that which we love.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>114  Thou <I>art</I> my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy
 word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. God's care of David to protect and defend him, which he comforted
 himself with when his enemies were very malicious against him: <I>Thou
 art my hiding-place and my shield.</I> David, when Saul pursued him, 
 often betook himself to close places for shelter; in war he guarded 
 himself with his shield. Now God was both these to him, a hiding-place 
 to preserve him from danger and a shield to preserve him in danger, his 
 life from death and his soul from sin. Good people are safe under God's 
 protection. He is their <I>strength and their shield,</I> their <I>help 
 and their shield,</I> their <I>sun and their shield,</I> their 
 <I>shield and their great reward,</I> and here their <I>hiding-place 
 and their shield.</I> They may by faith retire to him, and repose in 
 him as their hiding-place, where they are kept in secret. They may by
 faith oppose his power to all the might and malice of their enemies, as 
 their shield to quench every fiery dart. 

 2. David's confidence in God. He is safe, and therefore he is easy,
 under the divine protection: "<I>I hope in thy word,</I> which has 
 acquainted me with thee and assured me of thy kindness to me." Those 
 who depend on God's promise shall have the benefit of his power and be 
 taken under his special protection.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>115  Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. David's firm and fixed resolution to live a holy life: <I>I will
 keep the commandments of my God.</I> Bravely resolved! like a saint,
 like a soldier; for true courage consists in a steady resolution
 against all sin and for all duty. Those that would keep God's
 commandments must be often renewing their resolutions to do so: "<I>I 
 will keep them.</I> Whatever others do, this I will do; though I be 
 singular, though all about me be evil-doers, and desert me; whatever I 
 have done hitherto, I will for the future walk closely with God. They 
 are the commandments of God, of my God, and therefore I will keep them.
 He is God and may command me, my God and will command me nothing but 
 what is for my good." 

 2. His farewell to bad company, pursuant to this resolution: <I>Depart 
 from me, you evil-doers.</I> Though David, as a good magistrate, was a 
 terror to evil-doers, yet there were many such, even about court, 
 intruding near his person; these he here abdicates, and resolves to 
 have no conversation with them. Note, Those that resolve to keep the 
 commandments of God must have no society with evil-doers; for bad 
 company is a great hindrance to a holy life. We must not choose wicked 
 people for our companions, nor be intimate with them; we must not do as 
 they do nor do as they would have us do,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays for sustaining grace; for this grace sufficient he 
 besought the Lord twice: <I>Uphold me;</I> and again, <I>Hold thou me 
 up.</I> He sees himself not only unable to go on in his duty by any 
 strength of his own, but in danger of falling into sin unless he was 
 prevented by divine grace; and therefore he is thus earnest for that 
 grace to uphold him in his integrity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:12">Ps. xli. 12</A>),

 to keep him from falling and to keep him from tiring, that he might 
 neither turn aside to evil-doing nor be weary of well-doing. We stand
 no longer than God holds us and go no further than he carries us.

 2. He pleads earnestly for this grace.

 (1.) He pleads the promise of God, his dependence upon the promise, and 
 his expectation from it: "<I>Uphold me, according to thy word,</I> 
 which word I hope in; and, if it be not performed, I shall be made 
 <I>ashamed of my hope,</I> and be called a fool for my credulity." But 
 those that hope in God's word may be sure that the word will not fail 
 them, and therefore their hope will not make them ashamed. 

 (2.) He pleads the great need he had of God's grace and the great 
 advantage it would be of to him: <I>Uphold me, that I may live,</I> 
 intimating that he could not live without the grace of God; he should 
 fall into sin, into death, into hell, if God did not hold him up; but, 
 supported by his hand, he shall live; his spiritual life shall be 
 maintained and be an earnest of eternal life. <I>Hold me up, and I 
 shall be safe,</I> out of danger and out of the fear of danger. Our 
 holy security is grounded on divine supports. 

 (3.) He pleads his resolution, in the strength of this grace, to 
 proceed in his duty: "<I>Hold me up,</I> and then <I>I will have 
 respect unto thy statutes continually</I> and never turn my eyes or 
 feet aside from them." <I>I will employ myself</I> (so some), I <I>will 
 delight myself</I> (so others) <I>in thy statutes.</I> If God's right 
 hand uphold us, we must, in his strength, go on in our duty both with 
 diligence and pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. God's judgment on wicked people, on those that <I>wander from his 
 statutes,</I> that take their measures from other rules and will not 
 have God to reign over them. All departure from God's statutes is 
 certainly an error, and will prove a fatal one. These are <I>the wicked 
 of the earth;</I> they mind earthly things, lay up their treasures in 
 the earth, live in pleasure on the earth, and are strangers and enemies 
 to heaven and heavenly things. Now see how God deals with them, that 
 you may neither fear them nor envy them. 

 1. He <I>treads them all down.</I> He brings them to ruin, to utter 
 ruin, to shameful ruin; he makes them his footstool. Though they are 
 ever so high, he can bring them low 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:9">Amos ii. 9</A>);

 he has done it many a time, and he will do it, for he resists the proud 
 and will triumph over those that oppose his kingdom. Proud persecutors 
 trample upon his people, but, sooner or later, he will trample upon 
 them.

 2. He <I>puts them all away like dross.</I> Wicked people are as dross, 
 which, though it be mingled with the good metal in the ore, and seems 
 to be of the same substance with it, must be separated from it. And in 
 God's account they are worthless things, the scum and refuse of the 
 earth, and no more to be compared with the righteous than dross with 
 fine gold. There is a day coming which will put them away from among 
 the righteous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:49">Matt. xiii. 49</A>),

 so that they shall have no place <I>in their congregation</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>),

 which will put them away into everlasting fire, the fittest place for 
 the dross. Sometimes, in this world, the wicked are, by the censures of 
 the church, or the sword of the magistrate, or the judgments of God, 
 <I>put away as dross,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:4,5">Prov. xxv. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons of these judgments. God casts them off because they 
 <I>err from his statutes</I> (those that will not submit to the 
 commands of the word shall feel the curses of it) and because <I>their 
 deceit is falsehood,</I> that is, because they deceive themselves by 
 setting up false rules, in opposition to God's statutes, which they err 
 from, and because they go about to deceive others with their 
 hypocritical pretences of good and their crafty projects of mischief. 
 <I>Their cunning is falsehood,</I> so Dr. Hammond. The utmost of their 
 policy is treachery and perfidiousness; this the God of truth hates and 
 will punish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The improvement David made of these judgments. He took notice of 
 them and received instruction from them. The ruin of the wicked helped 
 to increase, 

 1. His love to the word of God. "I see what comes of sin; <I>therefore 
 I love thy testimonies,</I> which warn me to take heed of those 
 dangerous courses and <I>keep me from the paths of the destroyer.</I>" 
 We see the word of Go fulfilled in his judgments on sin and sinners, 
 and therefore we should love it. 

 2. His fear of the wrath of God: <I>My flesh trembles for fear of 
 thee.</I> Instead of insulting over those who fell under God's 
 displeasure, he humbled himself. What we read and hear of the judgments 
 of God upon wicked people would make us,

 (1.) To reverence his terrible majesty, and to stand in awe of him: 
 <I>Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:20">1 Sam. vi. 20</A>.

 (2.) To fear lest we offend him and become obnoxious to his wrath. Good 
 men have need to be restrained from sin by <I>the terrors of the 
 Lord,</I> especially when judgment <I>begins at the house of God</I> 
 and hypocrites are discovered and <I>put away as dross.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here appeals to God, 

 1. As his witness that he had not done wrong; he could truly say, "<I>I 
 have done judgment and justice,</I> that is, I have made conscience of 
 rendering to all their due, and have not by force or fraud hindered any 
 of their right." Take him as a king, he <I>executed judgment and 
 justice to all his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:15">2 Sam. viii. 15</A>.

 Take him in a private capacity, he could appeal to Saul himself that 
 <I>there was no evil or transgression in his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:11">1 Sam. xxiv. 11</A>.
 
 Note, Honesty is the best policy and will be our rejoicing in the day 
 of evil.

 2. As his Judge, that he might not be wronged. Having done justice for 
 others that were oppressed, he begs that God would do him justice and 
 avenge him of his adversaries: "<I>Be surety for thy servant, for 
 good;</I> undertake for me against those that would run me down and 
 ruin me." He is sensible that he cannot make his part good himself, and 
 therefore begs that God would appear for him. Christ is our surety with 
 God; and, if he be so, Providence shall be our surety against all the 
 world. Who or what shall harm us if God's power and goodness be engaged 
 for our protection and rescue? He does not prescribe to God what he 
 should do for him; only let it be <I>for good,</I> in such way and 
 manner as Infinite Wisdom sees best; "only <I>let me not be left to my 
 oppressors.</I>" Though David had <I>done judgment and justice,</I> yet 
 he had many enemies; but, having God for his friend, he hoped they 
 should not have their will against him; and in that hope he prayed 
 again, <I>Let not the proud oppress me.</I> David, one of the best of 
 men, was oppressed by the proud, whom God beholds afar off; the 
 condition therefore of the persecuted is better than that of the 
 persecutors, and will appear so at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>123  Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
 righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, being oppressed, is here waiting and wishing for the salvation 
 of the Lord, which would make him easy. 

 1. He cannot but think that it comes slowly: <I>My eyes fail for thy 
 salvation.</I> His eyes were towards it and had been long so. He looked 
 for help from heaven (and we deceive ourselves if we look for it any 
 other way), but it did not come so soon as he expected, so that his 
 eyes began to fail, and he was sometimes ready to despair, and to think 
 that, because the salvation did not come when he looked for it, it 
 would never come. It is often the infirmity even of good men to be 
 weary of waiting God's time when <I>their</I> time has elapsed. 

 2. Yet he cannot hope that it comes surely; for he expects <I>the word 
 of God's righteousness,</I> and no other salvation than what is secured 
 by that word, which cannot fall to the ground because it is a word of 
 righteousness. Though our eyes fail, yet God's word does not, and 
 therefore those that build upon it, though now discouraged, shall in 
 due time see his salvation.</P>

 me thy statutes.
 &nbsp; 125  I <I>am</I> thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know
 thy testimonies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's petition for divine instruction: "<I>Teach me thy 
 statutes;</I> give me to know all my duty; when I am in doubt, and know 
 not for certain what is my duty, direct me, and make it plain to me; 
 now that I am afflicted, oppressed, and <I>my eyes</I> are ready to 
 <I>fail for thy salvation,</I> let me know what my duty is in this 
 condition." In difficult times we should desire more to be told what we 
 must do than what we may expect, and should pray more to be led into 
 the knowledge of scripture-precepts than of scripture-prophecies. If 
 God, who gave us his statutes, do not teach us, we shall never learn 
 them. How God teaches is implied in the next petition: <I>Give me 
 understanding</I> (a renewed understanding, apt to receive divine 
 light), <I>that I may know thy testimonies.</I> It is God's prerogative 
 to give an understanding, that understanding without which we cannot 
 know God's testimonies. Those who know most of God's testimonies desire 
 to know more, and are still earnest with God to teach them, never 
 thinking they know enough. 
 
 2. His pleas to enforce this petition.

 (1.) He pleads God's goodness to him: <I>Deal with me according to thy 
 mercy.</I> The best saints count this their best plea for any blessing, 
 "Let me have it according to thy mercy;" for we deserve no favour from 
 God, nor can we claim any as a debt, but we are most likely to be easy 
 when we cast ourselves upon God's mercy and refer ourselves to it.
 Particularly, when we come to him for instruction, we must beg it as a 
 mercy, and reckon that in being taught we are well dealt with. 

 (2.) He pleads his relation to God: "<I>I am thy servant,</I> and have 
 work to do for thee; therefore <I>teach me</I> to do it and to do it 
 well." The servant has reason to expect that, if he be at a loss about 
 his work, his master should teach him, and, if it were in his power, 
 give him an understanding. "Lord," says David, "I desire to serve thee; 
 show me how." If any man resolve to do God's will as his servant, he 
 shall be made to know his testimonies,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A complaint of the daring impiety of the wicked. David, having in 
 himself a holy indignation at it, humbly represents it to God: "Lord, 
 there are those that <I>have made void thy law,</I> have set thee and 
 thy government at defiance, and have done what in them lay to cancel 
 and vacate the obligation of thy commands." Those that sin through 
 infirmity transgress the law, but presumptuous sinners do in effect 
 make void the law, saying, <I>Who is the Lord? What is the Almighty, 
 that we should fear him?</I> It is possible a godly man may sin against 
 the commandment, but a wicked man would sin away the commandment, would 
 repeal God's laws and enact his own lusts. This is the sinfulness of 
 sin and the malignity of the carnal mind. 

 2. A desire that God would appear, for the vindication of his own 
 honour: "<I>It is time for thee, Lord, to work,</I> to do something for 
 the effectual confutation of atheists and infidels, and the silencing 
 of those that set their mouth against the heavens." God's time to work 
 is when vice has become most daring and the measure of iniquity is 
 full. <I>Now will I arise, saith the Lord.</I> Some read it, and the 
 original will bear it, <I>It is time to work for thee, O Lord!</I> it 
 is time for every one in his place to appear on the Lord's 
 side--against the threatening growth of profaneness and immorality. We 
 must do what we can for the support of the sinking interests of 
 religion, and, after all, we must beg of God to take the work into his 
 own hands.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here, as often in this psalm, professes the great love he had to 
 the word and law of God; and, to evidence the sincerity of it, observe, 

 1. The degree of his love. He loved his Bible better than he loved his 
 money--<I>above gold, yea, above fine gold.</I> Gold, fine gold, is what
 most men set their hearts upon; nothing charms them and dazzles their 
 eyes so much as gold does. It is fine gold, a fine thing in their eyes; 
 they will venture their souls, their God, their all, to get and keep 
 it. But David saw that the word of God answers all purposes better than 
 money does, for it enriches the soul towards God; and therefore he 
 loved it better than gold, for it had done that for him which gold 
 could not do, and would stand him in stead when the wealth of the world 
 would fail him. 

 2. The ground of his love. He loved all God's commandments because he 
 esteemed them to be right, all reasonable and just, and suited to the 
 end for which they were made. They are all as they should be, and no 
 fault can be found with them; and we must love them because they bear 
 God's image and are the revelations of his will. If we thus <I>consent
 to the law that it is good,</I> we shall delight in it after the inner 
 man. 

 3. The fruit and evidence of this love: He <I>hated every false 
 way.</I> The way of sin being directly contrary to God's precepts, 
 which are right, is a false way, and therefore those that have a love 
 and esteem for God's law hate it and will not be reconciled to it.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here how David was affected towards the word of God. 

 1. He admired it, as most excellent in itself: <I>Thy testimonies are 
 wonderful.</I> The word of God gives us admirable discoveries of God, 
 and Christ, and another world; admirable proofs of divine love and 
 grace. The majesty of the style, the purity of the matter, the harmony 
 of the parts, are all wonderful. Its effects upon the consciences of 
 men, both for conviction and comfort, are wonderful; and it is a sign 
 that we are not acquainted with God's testimonies, or do not understand 
 them, if we do not admire them. 

 2. He adhered to it as of constant use to him: "<I>Therefore doth my 
 soul keep them,</I> as a treasure of inestimable value, which I cannot 
 be without." We do not keep them to any purpose unless our souls keep 
 them. There they must be deposited, as the tables of testimony in the 
 ark, there they must have the innermost and uppermost place. Those that 
 see God's word to be admirable will prize it highly and preserve it 
 carefully, as that which they promise themselves great things from.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_130"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>130  The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
 understanding unto the simple.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The great use for which the word of God was intended, to give light, 
 that is, to give understanding, to give us to understand that which 
 will be of use to us in our travels through this world; and it is the 
 outward and ordinary means by which the Spirit of God enlightens the 
 understanding of all that are sanctified. God's testimonies are not 
 only wonderful for the greatness of them, but useful, as a light in a 
 dark place. 

 2. Its efficacy for this purpose. It admirably answers the end; for,

 (1.) Even <I>the entrance of God's word gives light.</I> If we begin at 
 the beginning, and take it before us, we shall find that the very first 
 verses of the Bible give us surprising and yet satisfying discoveries 
 of the origin of the universe, about which, without that, the world is 
 utterly in the dark. As soon as the word of God enters into us, and
 has a place in us, it enlightens us; we find we begin to see when we 
 begin to study the word of God. The very first principles of the 
 oracles of God, the plainest truths, the milk appointed for the babes, 
 bring a great light into the soul, much more will the soul be 
 illuminated by the sublime mysteries that are found there. "The 
 exposition or explication of thy word gives light;" then it is most 
 profitable when ministers do their part <I>in giving the sense,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:8">Neh. viii. 8</A>.

 Some understand it of the New Testament, which is the opening or 
 unfolding of the Old, which would give light concerning life and 
 immortality.

 (2.) It would <I>give understanding</I> even <I>to the simple,</I> to 
 the weakest capacities; for it shows us a way to heaven so plain that 
 the <I>wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>131  I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The desire David had towards the word of God: <I>I longed for thy 
 commandments.</I> When he was under a forced absence from God's 
 ordinances he longed to be restored to them again; when he enjoyed 
 ordinances he greedily sucked in the word of God, <I>as new-born babes 
 desire the milk.</I> When Christ is formed in the soul there are 
 gracious longings, unaccountable to one that is a stranger to the work.

 2. The degree of that desire appearing in the expressions of it: <I>I
 opened my mouth and panted,</I> as one overcome with heat, or almost
 stifled, pants for a mouthful of fresh air. Thus strong, thus earnest, 
 should our desires be towards God and the remembrance of his name,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's request for God's favour to himself: "<I>Look</I> graciously 
 <I>upon me;</I> let me have thy smiles, and the light of thy 
 countenance. Take cognizance of me and my affairs, <I>and be merciful 
 to me;</I> let me taste the sweetness of thy mercy and receive the 
 gifts of thy mercy." See how humble his petition is. He asks not for 
 the operations of God's hand, only for the smiles of his face; a good 
 look is enough; and for that he does not plead merit, but implores 
 mercy. 

 2. His acknowledgment of his favour to all his people: <I>As thou usest 
 to do unto those that love thy name.</I> This is either,

 (1.) A plea for mercy: "Lord, I am one of <I>those that love thy 
 name,</I> love thee and thy word, and thou usest to be kind to those 
 that do so; and wilt thou be worse to me than to others of thy people?" 
 Or, 

 (2.) A description of the favour and mercy he desired--"that which thou 
 usest to bestow on those that love thy name, which <I>thou bearest to 
 thy chosen,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:4,5">Ps. cvi. 4, 5</A>.

 He desires no more, no better, than neighbour's fare, and he will take 
 up with no less; common looks and common mercies will not serve, but 
 such as are reserved for those that love him, which are such as <I>eye 
 has not seen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>.

 Note, The dealings of God with those that love him are such that a man 
 needs not desire to be any better dealt with, for he will make them 
 truly and eternally happy. And as long as God deals with us no 
 otherwise than as he uses to deal with those that love him we have no 
 reason to complain,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here David prays for two great spiritual blessings, and is, in this 
 verse, as earnest for the good work of God in him as, in the verse 
 before, for the good-will of God towards him. He prays, 

 1. For direction in the paths of duty: "<I>Order my steps in thy 
 word;</I> having led me into the right way, let every step I take in 
 that way be under the guidance of thy grace." We ought to walk by rule; 
 all the motions of the soul must not only be kept within the bounds 
 prescribed by the word, so as not to transgress them, but carried out 
 in the paths prescribed by the word, so as not to trifle in them. And 
 therefore we must beg of God that by his good Spirit he would order our 
 steps accordingly. 

 2. For deliverance from the power of sin: "<I>Let no iniquity have 
 dominion over me,</I> so as to gain my consent to it, and that I should 
 be led captive by it." The dominion of sin is to be dreaded and 
 deprecated by every one of us; and, if in sincerity we pray against it, 
 we may receive that promise as an answer to the prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:14">Rom. vi. 14</A>),
 
 <I>Sin shall not have dominion over you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays that he might live a quiet and peaceable life, and might 
 not be harassed and discomposed by those that studied to be vexatious: 
 "<I>Deliver me from the oppression of man</I>--man, whom God can 
 control, and whose power is limited. Let them know themselves to be
 <I>but men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 and let me be delivered out of the hands of my enemies, that I may 
 serve God without fear; <I>so will I keep thy precepts.</I>" Not but 
 that he would keep God's precepts, though he should be continued under 
 oppression; "but so shall I keep thy precepts more cheerfully and with 
 more enlargement of heart, my bonds being loosed." <I>Then</I> we may 
 expect temporal blessings when we desire them with this in our eye, 
 that we may serve God the better.</P>

 David here, as often as elsewhere, writes himself God's servant, a 
 title he gloried in, though he was a king; now here, as became a good 
 servant, 

 1. He is very ambitious of his Master's favour, accounting that his 
 happiness and chief good. He asks not for corn and wine, for silver and 
 gold, but, "<I>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;</I> let me be 
 accepted of thee, and let me know that I am so. Comfort me with the 
 light of thy countenance in every cloudy and dark day. If the world 
 frown upon me, yet do thou smile." 

 2. He is very solicitous about his Master's work, accounting that his 
 business and chief concern. This he would be instructed in, that he 
 might do it, and do it well, so as to be accepted in the doing of it: 
 <I>Teach me thy statutes.</I> Note, We must pray as earnestly for grace 
 as for comfort. If God hides his face from us, it is because we have 
 been careless in keeping his statutes; and therefore, that we may be 
 qualified for the returns of his favour, we must pray for wisdom to do 
 our duty.</P>

 Here we have David in sorrow. 

 1. It is a great sorrow, to such a degree that he weeps <I>rivers of 
 tears.</I> Commonly, where there is a gracious heart, there is a 
 weeping eye, in conformity to Christ, who was a man of sorrows and 
 acquainted with grief. David had prayed for comfort in God's favour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:135"><I>v.</I> 135</A>),

 now he pleads that he was qualified for that comfort, and had need of 
 it, for he was one of those that mourned in Zion, and those that do so 
 shall be comforted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>.

 2. It is godly sorrow. He wept not for his troubles, though they were
 many, but for the dishonour done to God: <I>Because they keep not thy 
 law,</I> either <I>because my eyes keep not thy law,</I> so some (the 
 eye is the inlet and outlet of a great deal of sin, and therefore it 
 ought to be a weeping eye), or, rather, <I>they,</I> that is, those 
 about me,

 Here is, 

 1. The righteousness of God, the infinite rectitude and perfection of 
 his nature. As he is what he is, so he is what he should be, and in 
 every thing acts as becomes him; there is nothing wanting, nothing 
 amiss, in God; his will is the eternal rule of equity, and he is 
 righteous, for he does all according to it. 

 2. The righteousness of his government. He rules the world by his 
 providence, according to the principles of justice, and never did, nor 
 ever can do, any wrong to any of his creatures: <I>Upright are thy 
 judgments,</I> the promises and threatenings and the executions of 
 both. Every word of God is pure, and he will be true to it; he 
 perfectly knows the merits of every cause and will judge accordingly. 

 3. The righteousness of his commands, which he has given to be the rule 
 of our obedience: "<I>Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded,</I> 
 which are backed with thy sovereign authority, and to which thou dost 
 require our obedience, <I>are</I> exceedingly <I>righteous and 
 faithful,</I> righteousness and faithfulness itself." As he acts like 
 himself, so his law requires that we act like ourselves and like him, 
 that we be just to ourselves and to all we deal with, true to all the 
 engagements we lay ourselves under both to God and man. That which we
 are commanded to practise is righteous; that which we are commanded to 
 believe is faithful. It is necessary to our faith and obedience that we 
 be convinced of this.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_139"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>139  My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have
 forgotten thy words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The great contempt which wicked men put upon religion: <I>My enemies 
 have forgotten thy words.</I> They have often heard them, but so little 
 did they heed them that they soon forgot them, they willingly forgot 
 them, not only through carelessness let them slip out of their minds, 
 but contrived how to cast them behind their backs. This is at the 
 bottom of all the wickedness of the wicked, and particularly of their 
 malignity and enmity to the people of God; they have forgotten the 
 words of God, else those would give check to their sinful courses.

 2. The great concern which godly men show for religion. David reckoned
 those his enemies who forgot the words of God because they were enemies 
 to religion, which he had entered into a league with, offensive and 
 defensive. And therefore his <I>zeal</I> even <I>consumed him,</I> when 
 he observed their impieties. He conceived such an indignation at their 
 wickedness as preyed upon his spirits, even <I>ate them up</I> (as 
 Christ's zeal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:17">John ii. 17</A>),

 swallowed up all inferior considerations, and made him forget himself. 
 <I>My zeal has pressed or constrained me</I> (so Dr. Hammond reads it), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5">Acts xviii. 5</A>.

 Zeal against sin should constrain us to do what we can against it in 
 our places, at least to do so much the more in religion ourselves. The 
 worse others are the better we should be.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_140"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>140  Thy word <I>is</I> very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's great affection for the word of God: <I>Thy servant loves 
 it.</I> Every good man, being a servant of God, loves the word of God, 
 because it lets him know his Master's will and directs him in his 
 Master's work. Wherever there is grace there is a warm attachment to 
 the word of God. 

 2. The ground and reason of that affection; he saw it to be <I>very 
 pure,</I> and therefore he loved it. Our love to the word of God is 
 <I>then</I> an evidence of our love to God when we love it for the sake 
 of its purity, because it bears the image of God's holiness and is 
 designed to make us partakers of his holiness. It commands purity, and, 
 as it is itself refined from all corrupt mixture, so if we receive it 
 in the light and love of it it will refine us from the dross of 
 worldliness and fleshly-mindedness.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>141  I <I>am</I> small and despised: <I>yet</I> do not I forget thy
 precepts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David pious and yet poor. He was a man after God's own heart, one 
 whom the King of kings did delight to honour, and yet <I>small and 
 despised</I> in his own account and in the account of many others. 
 Men's excellency cannot always secure them from contempt; nay, it often 
 exposes them to the scorn of others and always makes them low in their 
 own eyes. <I>God has chosen the foolish things of the world,</I> and it 
 has been the common lot of his people to be a despised people. 

 2. David poor and yet pious, <I>small and despised</I> for his strict 
 and serious godliness, yet his conscience can witness for him that he 
 did <I>not forget God's precepts.</I> He would not throw off his 
 religion, though it exposed him to contempt, for he knew that was 
 designed to try his constancy. When we are small and despised we have 
 the more need to remember God's precepts, that we may have them to 
 support us under the pressures of a low condition.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_142"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>142  Thy righteousness <I>is</I> an everlasting righteousness, and
 thy law <I>is</I> the truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. That God's word <I>is righteousness,</I> and it <I>is an everlasting 
 righteousness.</I> It is the rule of God's judgment, and it is 
 consonant to his counsels from eternity and will direct his sentence 
 for eternity. The word of God will judge us, it will judge us in 
 righteousness, and by it our everlasting state will be determined. This 
 should possess us with a very great reverence for the word of God that 
 it is righteousness itself, the standard of righteousness, and it is 
 everlasting in its rewards and punishments. 

 2. That God's word is a law, and that law is truth. See the double 
 obligation we are under to be governed by the word of God. We are 
 reasonable creatures, and as such we must be ruled by truth, 
 acknowledging the force and power of it. If the principles be true, the 
 practices must be agreeable to them, else we do not act rationally. We 
 are creatures, and therefore subjects, and must be ruled by our 
 Creator; and whatever he commands we are bound to obey as a law. See 
 how these obligations are here twisted, these cords of a man. Here is 
 truth brought to the understanding, there to sit chief, and direct the 
 motions of the whole man; but, lest the authority of that should become
 weak through the flesh, here is a law to bind the will and bring that 
 into subjection. God's truth is a law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>)

 <I>and</I> God's <I>law is the truth;</I> surely we cannot break such 
 words as these asunder.</P>

 me understanding, and I shall live.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses are almost a repetition of the two foregoing verses, 
 but with improvement.

 1. David again professes his constant adherence to God and his duty,
 notwithstanding the many difficulties and discouragements he met with.
 He had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:141"><I>v.</I> 141</A>),

 <I>I am small and despised,</I> and yet adhere to my duty. Here he 
 finds himself not only mean, but miserable, as far as this world could 
 make him so: <I>Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me</I>--trouble 
 without, anguish within; they surprised him, they seized him, they held 
 him. Sorrows are often the lot of saints in this vale of tears; they 
 are <I>in heaviness through manifold temptations.</I> There he had 
 said, <I>Yet do I not forget thy precepts;</I> here he carries his 
 constancy much higher: <I>Yet thy commandments are my delights.</I> All 
 this trouble and anguish did not put his mouth out of taste for the 
 comforts of the word of God, but he could still relish them and find 
 that peace and pleasure in them which all the calamities of this 
 present time could not deprive him of. There are delights, variety of 
 delights, in the word of God, which the saints have often the sweetest 
 enjoyment of when they are in trouble and anguish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>.

 2. He again acknowledges the everlasting righteousness of God's word as 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:142"><I>v.</I> 142</A>):

 <I>The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting</I> and cannot 
 be altered; and, when it is admitted in its power into a soul, it is 
 there an abiding principle, <I>a well of living water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14">John iv. 14</A>.

 We ought to meditate much and often upon the equity and the eternity of 
 the word of God. Here he adds, by way of inference,

 (1.) His prayer for grace: <I>Give me understanding.</I> Those that 
 know much of the word of God should still covet to know more; for there 
 is more to be known. He does not say, "Give me a further revelation,"
 but, <I>Give me a further understanding;</I> what is revealed we should 
 desire to understand, and what we know to know better; and we must go 
 to God for a heart to know.

 (2.) His hope of glory: "Give me this renewed understanding, and then 
 <I>I shall live,</I> shall live for ever, shall be eternally happy, and 
 shall be comforted, for the present, in the prospect of it." <I>This is 
 life eternal, to know God,</I>

 Here we have, 

 I. David's good prayers, by which he sought to God for mercy; these he 
 mentions here, not as boasting of them, or trusting to any merit in 
 them, but reflecting upon them with comfort, that he had taken the 
 appointed way to comfort. Observe here,

 1. That he was inward with God in prayer; he prayed <I>with his 
 heart,</I> and prayer is acceptable no further than the heart goes 
 along with it. Lip-labour, if that be all, is lost labour. 

 2. He was importunate with God in prayer; he <I>cried,</I> as one in 
 earnest, with fervour of affection and a holy vehemence and vigour of 
 desire. <I>He cried with his whole heart;</I> all the powers of his
 soul were not only engaged and employed, but exerted to the utmost, in 
 his prayers. <I>Then</I> we are likely to speed when we thus strive and 
 wrestle in prayer. 

 3. That he directed his prayer to God: <I>I cried unto thee.</I>
 Whither should the child go but to his father when any thing ails him? 

 4. That the great thing he prayed for was salvation: <I>Save me.</I> A 
 short prayer (for we mistake if we think we shall be heard for our much 
 speaking), but a comprehensive prayer: "Not only rescue me from ruin, 
 but make me happy." We need desire no more than God's salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">Ps. l. 23</A>)

 and the <I>things that accompany</I> it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:9">Heb. vi. 9</A>.

 5. That he was earnest for an answer; and not only looked up in his 
 prayers, but looked up after them, to see what became of them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:3">Ps. v. 3</A>):

 "Lord, <I>hear me,</I> and let me know that thou hearest me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's good purposes, by which he bound himself to duty when he 
 was in the pursuit of mercy. "<I>I will keep thy statutes;</I> I am 
 resolved that by thy grace I will;" for, <I>if we turn away our ear 
 from hearing the law,</I> we cannot expect an answer of peace to our 
 prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:9">Prov. xxviii. 9</A>.
 
 This purpose is used as a humble plea
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:146"><I>v.</I> 146</A>):

 "<I>Save me</I> from my sins, my corruptions, my temptations, all the 
 hindrances that lie in my way, that I may <I>keep thy testimonies.</I>" 
 We must cry for salvation, not that we may have the ease and comfort of 
 it, but that we may have an opportunity of serving God the more 
 cheerfully.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_147"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_148"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>147  I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped
 in thy word.
 &nbsp; 148  Mine eyes prevent the <I>night</I> watches, that I might
 meditate in thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David goes on here to relate how he had abounded in the duty of prayer, 
 much to his comfort and advantage: he cried unto God, that is, offered 
 up to him his pious and devout affections with all seriousness.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The handmaids of his devotion. The two great exercises that attended 
 his prayers, and were helpful to them, were, 

 1. Hope in God's word, which encouraged him to continue instant in 
 prayer, though the answer did not come immediately: "I cried, and hoped 
 that at last I should speed, because <I>the vision is for an appointed 
 time, and at the end it will speak and not lie. I hoped in thy 
 word,</I> which I knew would not fail me." 

 2. Meditation in God's word. The more intimately we converse with the
 word of God, and the more we dwell upon it in our thoughts, the better 
 able we shall be to speak to God in his own language and the better we 
 shall know what to pray for as we ought. Reading the word will not
 serve, but we must meditate in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The hours of his devotion. <I>He anticipated the dawning of the 
 morning,</I> nay, and <I>the night-watches.</I> See here, 

 1. That David was an early riser, which perhaps contributed to his 
 eminency. He was none of those that say, <I>Yet a little sleep.</I> 

 2. That he began the day with God. The first thing he did in the
 morning, before he admitted any business, was to pray, when his mind 
 was most fresh and in the best frame. If our first thoughts in the 
 morning be of God they will help to keep us in his fear all the day 
 long. 

 3. That his mind was so full of God, and the cares and delights of his 
 religion, that a little sleep served his turn. Even in <I>the 
 night-watches,</I> when he awaked from his first sleep, he would rather 
 meditate and pray than turn himself and go to sleep again. He 
 <I>esteemed the words of God's mouth more than his necessary</I> 
 repose, which we can as ill spare as our <I>food,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:12">Job xxiii. 12</A>.

 4. That he would redeem time for religious exercises. He was full of
 business all day, but that will excuse no man from secret devotion; it 
 is better to take time from sleep, as David did, than not to find time 
 for prayer. And this is our comfort, when we pray in the night, that we 
 can never come unseasonably to the throne of grace; for we may have 
 access to it at all hours. Baal may be asleep, but Israel's God never 
 slumbers, nor are there any hours in which he may not be spoken 
 with.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_149"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>149  Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 quicken me according to thy judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David applies to God for grace and comfort with much solemnity. He 
 begs of God to hear his voice: "Lord, I have something to say to thee; 
 shall I obtain a gracious audience?" Well, what has he to say? What is 
 his petition and what is his request? It is not long, but it has much 
 in a little: "<I>Lord, quicken me;</I> stir me up to that which is 
 good, and make me vigorous, and lively, and cheerful in it. Let habits
 of grace be drawn out into act." 

 2. He encourages himself to hope that he shall obtain his request; for 
 he depends,

 (1.) Upon God's lovingkindness: "He is good, therefore he will be good 
 to me, who hope in his mercy. His lovingkindness manifested to me will 
 help to quicken me, and put life into me." 

 (2.) Upon God's <I>judgment,</I> that is, his wisdom ("He knows what I 
 need, and what is good for me, and therefore will quicken me"), or his
 promise, the word which he has spoken, mercy secured by the new 
 covenant: <I>Quicken me according to</I> the tenour of that 
 covenant.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_150"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ps119_151"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>150  They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far
 from thy law.
 &nbsp; 151  Thou <I>art</I> near, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and all thy commandments <I>are</I>
 truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The apprehension David was in of danger from his enemies.

 1. They were very malicious, and industrious in prosecuting their 
 malicious designs: They <I>follow after mischief,</I> any mischief they 
 could do to David or his friends; they would let slip no opportunity 
 nor let fall any pursuit that might be to his hurt. 

 2. They were very impious, and had no fear of God before their eyes: 
 <I>They are far from thy law,</I> setting themselves as far as they can 
 out of the reach of its convictions and commands. The persecutors of 
 God's people are such as make light of God himself; we may therefore be 
 sure that God will take his people's part against them. 

 3. They followed him closely and he was just ready to fall into their 
 hands: <I>They draw nigh,</I> nigher than they were; so that they got 
 ground of him. They were at his heels, just upon his back. God 
 sometimes suffers persecutors to prevail very far against his people, 
 so that, as David said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:3">1 Sam. xx. 3</A>),

 <I>There is but a step between them and death.</I> Perhaps this comes 
 in here as a reason why David was so earnest in prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:149"><I>v.</I> 149</A>.

 God brings us into imminent perils, as he did Jacob, that, like him, we 
 may wrestle for a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The assurance David had of protection with God: "<I>They draw 
 nigh</I> to destroy me, but <I>thou art near, O Lord!</I> to save me, 
 not only mightier than they and therefore able to help me against them, 
 but nearer than they and therefore ready to help." It is the happiness 
 of the saints that, when trouble is near, God is near, and no trouble 
 can separate between them and him. He is never far to seek, but he is 
 within our call, and means are within his call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>.

 <I>All thy commandments are truth.</I> The enemies thought to defeat 
 the promises God had made to David, but he was sure it was out of their 
 power; they were inviolably true, and would be infallibly 
 performed.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_152"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>152  Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou
 hast founded them for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This confirms what he had said in the close of the foregoing verses, 
 <I>All thy commandments are truth;</I> he means the covenant, the word 
 which God has commanded to a thousand generations. This is firm, as 
 true as truth itself. For, 

 1. God has founded it so; he has framed it for a perpetuity. Such is 
 the constitution of it, and so well ordered is it in all things, that 
 it cannot but be sure. The promises are <I>founded for ever,</I> so 
 that when heaven and earth shall have passed away every iota and tittle 
 of the promise shall stand firm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20">2 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 2. David had found it so, both by a work of God's grace upon his heart 
 (begetting in him a full persuasion of the truth of God's word and 
 enabling him to rely upon it with a full satisfaction) and by the works 
 of his providence on his behalf, fulfilling the promise beyond what he 
 expected. Thus he <I>knew of old,</I> from the days of his youth, ever 
 since he began to look towards God, that the word of God is what one 
 may venture one's all upon. This assurance was confirmed by the 
 observations and experiences of his own life all along, and of others 
 that had gone before him in the ways of God. All that ever dealt with 
 God, and trusted in him will own that they have found him faithful.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 I. David prays for succour in distress. <I>Is any afflicted? let him 
 pray;</I> let him pray as David does here. 

 1. He has an eye to God's pity, and prays, "<I>Consider my 
 affliction;</I> take it into thy thoughts, and all the circumstances of 
 it, and sit not by as one unconcerned." God is never unmindful of his 
 people's afflictions, but he will have us to <I>put him in 
 remembrance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:26">Isa. xliii. 26</A>),

 to spread our case before him, and then leave it to his compassionate 
 consideration to do in it as in his wisdom he shall think fit, in his 
 own time and way.

 2. He has an eye to God's power and prays, <I>Deliver me;</I> and 
 again, "<I>Deliver me;</I> consider my troubles and bring me out of 
 them." God has promised deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:15">Ps. l. 15</A>)

 and we may pray for it, with submission to his will and with regard to 
 his glory, that we may serve him the better. 

 3. He has an eye to God's righteousness, and prays, "<I>Plead my 
 cause;</I> be thou my patron and advocate, and take me for thy client." 
 David had a just cause, but his adversaries were many and mighty, and 
 he was in danger of being run down by them; he therefore begs of God to 
 clear his integrity and silence their false accusations. If God do not 
 plead his people's cause, who will? He is righteous, and they commit 
 themselves to him, and therefore he will do it, and do it effectually,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,Jer+50:34">Isa. li. 22; Jer. l. 34</A>.

 (4.) He has an eye to God's grace, and prays, "<I>Quicken me.</I> Lord, 
 I am weak, and unable to bear my troubles; my spirit is apt to droop 
 and sink. O that thou wouldst revive and comfort me, till the 
 deliverance is wrought!"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleads his dependence upon the word of God and his obedient
 regard to its directions: <I>Quicken</I> and <I>deliver me according to 
 thy word</I> of promise, <I>for I do not forget thy precepts.</I> The 
 more closely we cleave to the word of God, both as our rule and as our 
 stay, the more assurance we may have of deliverance in due time.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_155"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>155  Salvation <I>is</I> far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
 statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The description of wicked men. They do not only do God's statutes, 
 but they do not so much as seek them; they do not acquaint themselves 
 with them, nor so much as desire to know their duty, nor in the least 
 endeavour to do it. Those are wicked indeed who do not think the law of 
 God worth enquiring after, but are altogether regardless of it, being 
 resolved to live at large and to walk in the way of their heart. 

 2. Their doom: <I>Salvation is far from</I> them. They cannot upon any
 good grounds promise themselves temporal deliverance. <I>Let not that 
 man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</I> How can 
 those expect to seek God's favour with success, when they are in 
 adversity, who never sought his statutes when they were in prosperity?
 But eternal salvation is certainly far from them. They flatter 
 themselves with a conceit that it is near, and that they are going to 
 heaven; but they are mistaken: it is far from them. They thrust it from 
 them by thrusting the Saviour from them; it is so far from them that 
 they cannot reach it, and the longer they persist in sin the further it 
 is; nay, while salvation is far from them, damnation is near; it 
 slumbers not. <I>Behold, the Judge stands before the door.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David admires God's grace: <I>Great are thy tender mercies, O 
 Lord!</I> The goodness of God's nature, as it is his glory, so it is 
 the joy of all the saints. His mercies are tender, for he is full of 
 compassion; they are many, they are great, a fountain that can never be

 spoken of the misery of the wicked

 but God is good notwithstanding; there were tender mercies sufficient 
 in God to have saved them, if they had not "<I>despised the riches of 
 those mercies.</I>" Those that are delivered from the sinner's doom are 
 bound for ever to own the greatness of God's mercies which delivered 
 them. 

 2. He begs for God's grace, reviving quickening grace, <I>according to

 name,

 Here is, 

 1. David surrounded with difficulties and dangers: <I>Many are my 
 persecutors and my enemies.</I> When Saul the king was his persecutor 
 and enemy no marvel that many more were so: multitudes will follow the 
 pernicious ways of abused authority. David, being a public person, had
 many enemies, but withal he had many friends, who loved him and wished 
 him well; let him set the one over-against the other. In this David was 
 a type both of Christ and his church. The enemies, the persecutors, of 
 both, are many, very many. 

 2. David established in the way of his duty, notwithstanding: "<I>Yet 
 do I not decline from thy testimonies,</I> as knowing that while I 
 adhere to them God is for me; and then no matter who is against me." A 
 man who is steady in the way of his duty, though he may have many 
 enemies, needs fear none.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's sorrow for the wickedness of the wicked. Though he conversed 
 much at home, yet sometimes he looked abroad, and could not but see the 
 wicked walking on every side. He <I>beheld the transgressors,</I> those 
 whose sins were open before all men, and it <I>grieved</I> him to see 
 them dishonour God, serve Satan, debauch the world, and ruin their own 
 souls, to see the transgressors so numerous, so daring, so very 
 impudent, and so industrious to draw unstable souls into their snares. 
 All this cannot but be a grief to those who have any regard to the 
 glory of God and the welfare of mankind. 

 2. The reason of that sorrow. He was grieved, not because they were
 vexatious to him, but because they were provoking to God: <I>They kept 
 not thy word.</I> Those that hate sin truly hate it as sin, as a 
 transgression of the law of God and a violation of his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. David's appeal to God concerning his love to his precepts: "Lord, 
 thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love them; consider it 
 then, and deal with me as thou usest to deal with those that love thy 
 word, which thou hast magnified above all thy name." He does not say, 
 "Consider how I fulfil thy precepts;" he was conscious to himself that 
 in many things he came short; but, "Consider how I love them." Our 
 obedience is pleasing to God, and pleasant to ourselves, only when it 
 comes from a principle of love. 

 2. His petition thereupon: "<I>Quicken me,</I> to do my duty with 
 vigour; revive me, keep me alive, not according to any merit of mine, 
 though I love thy word, <I>but according to thy lovingkindness;</I>" to 
 that we owe our lives, nay, that is better than live itself. We need 
 not desire to be quickened any further than God's lovingkindness will 
 quicken us.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here comforts himself with the faithfulness of God's word, for 
 the encouragement of himself and others to rely upon it. 

 1. It has always been found faithful hitherto, and never failed any 
 that ventured upon it; <I>It is true from the beginning.</I> Ever since 
 God began to reveal himself to the children of men all he said was true 
 and to be trusted. The church, from its beginning, was built upon this 
 rock. It has not gained its validity by lapse of time, as many 
 governments, whose best plea is prescription and long usage, <I>Quod 
 initio non valet, tractu temporis convalescit--That which, at first, 
 wanted validity, in the progress of time acquired it.</I> But the 
 <I>beginning of God's word was true</I> (so some read it); his 
 government was laid on a sure foundation. And all, in every age, that 
 have received God's word in faith and love, have found every saying in 
 it <I>faithful and well worthy of all acceptation.</I> 

 2. It will be found faithful to the end, because righteous: "<I>Every 
 one of thy judgments remains for ever</I> unalterable and of perpetual 
 obligation, adjusting men's everlasting doom."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>161  Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my
 heart standeth in awe of thy word.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here lets us know,

 1. How he was discouraged in his duty by the fear of man: <I>Princes 
 persecuted him.</I> They looked upon him as a traitor and an enemy to 
 the government, and under that notion sought his life, and bade him 
 <I>go serve other gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.

 It has been the common lot of the best men to be persecuted; and the 
 case is the worse if princes be the persecutors, for they have not only 
 the sword in their hand, and therefore can do the more hurt, but they 
 have the law on their side, and can do it with reputation and a colour 
 of justice. It is sad that the power which magistrates have from God, 
 and should use for him, should ever be employed against him. But 
 <I>marvel not at the matter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>.

 It was a comfort to David that when princes persecuted him he could 
 truly say it was without cause, he never gave them any provocation.

 2. How he was kept to his duty, notwithstanding, by the fear of God: 
 "They would make me stand in awe of them and their word, and do as they 
 bid me; but <I>my heart stands in awe of thy word,</I> and I am 
 resolved to please God, and keep in with him, whoever is displeased and 
 falls out with me." Every gracious soul stands in awe of the word of 
 God, of the authority of its precepts and the terror of its 
 threatenings; and to those that do so nothing appears, in the power and 
 wrath of man, at all formidable. We ought to obey God rather than men, 
 and to make sure of God's favour, though we throw ourselves under the 
 frowns of all the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4,5">Luke xii. 4, 5</A>.

 The heart that stands in awe of God's word is armed against the 
 temptations that arise from persecution.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_162"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>162  I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The pleasure David took in the word of God. He rejoiced at it, 
 rejoiced that God had made such a discovery of his mind, that Israel 
 was blessed with that light when other nations sat in darkness, that he 
 was himself let into the understanding of it and had had experience of 
 the power of it. He took a pleasure in reading it, hearing it, and 
 meditating on it, and every thing he met with in it was agreeable to 
 him. He had just now said that his heart stood in awe of his word, and 
 yet here he declares that he rejoiced in it. The more reverence we have 
 for the word of God the more joy we shall find in it.

 2. The degree of that pleasure--<I>as one that finds great spoil.</I> 
 This supposes a victory over the enemy. It is through much opposition 
 that a soul comes to this, to <I>rejoice in God's word.</I> But, 
 besides the pleasure and honour of a conquest, there is great advantage 
 gained by the plunder of the field, which adds much to the joy. By the 
 word of God we become more than conquerors, that is, unspeakable 
 gainers.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_163"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>163  I hate and abhor lying: <I>but</I> thy law do I love.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Love and hatred are the leading affections of the soul; if those be 
 fixed aright, the rest move accordingly. Here we have them fixed aright 
 in David. 

 1. He had a rooted antipathy to sin; he could not endure to think of 
 it: <I>I hate and abhor lying,</I> which may be taken for all sin, 
 inasmuch as by it we deal treacherously and perfidiously with God and 
 put a cheat upon ourselves. Hypocrisy is lying; false doctrine is 
 lying; breach of faith is lying. Lying, in commerce or conversation, is 
 a sin which every good man hates and abhors, hates and doubly hates, 
 because of the seven things which the Lord hates <I>one</I> is a 
 <I>lying tongue</I> and <I>another</I> is a <I>false witness that 
 speaks lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:16">Prov. vi. 16</A>.

 Every man hates to have a lie told him; but we should more hate telling 
 a lie because by the former we only receive an affront from men, by the 
 latter we give an affront to God.

 2. He had a rooted affection to the word of God: <I>Thy law do I 
 love.</I> And therefore he abhorred lying, for lying is contrary to the 
 whole law of God; and the reason why he loved the law of God was 
 because of the truth of it. The more we see of the amiable beauty of 
 truth the more we shall see of the detestable deformity of a lie.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>164  Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
 judgments.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in this psalm, is full of complaints, yet those did neither 
 jostle out his praises nor put him out of tune for them; whatever 
 condition a child of God is in he does not want matter for praise and 
 therefore should not want a heart. See here, 

 1. How often David praised God--<I>Seven times a day,</I> that is,
 very frequently, not only every day, but often every day. Many think 
 that once a week will serve, or once or twice a day, but David would 
 praise God seven times a day at least. Praising God is a duty which we 
 should very much abound in. We must praise God at every meal, praise 
 him upon all occasions, in every thing give thanks. We should praise 
 God seven times a day, for the subject can never be exhausted and our
 affections should never be tired. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>.

 2. What he praised God for--<I>because of thy righteous judgments.</I>
 We must praise God for his precepts, which are all just and good, for 
 his promises and threatenings and the performance of both in his 
 providence. We are to praise God even for our afflictions, if through 
 grace we get good by them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>165  Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an account of the happiness of good men, who are governed by a 
 principle of love to the word of God, who make it their rule and are 
 ruled by it. 

 2. They are easy, and have a holy serenity; none enjoy themselves more 
 than they do: <I>Great peace have those that love thy law,</I> abundant 
 satisfaction in doing their duty and pleasure in reflecting upon it. 
 <I>The work of righteousness is peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17">Isa. xxxii. 17</A>),

 such peace as the world can neither give nor take away. They may be in 
 great troubles without and yet enjoy great peace within, <I>sat lucis 
 intus--abundance of internal light.</I> Those that love the world have 
 great vexation, for it does not answer their expectation; those that 
 love God's word have great peace, for it outdoes their expectation, and 
 in it they have sure footing.

 2. They are safe, and have a holy security: <I>Nothing shall offend 
 them;</I> nothing shall be a scandal, snare, or stumbling-block, to 
 them, to entangle them either in guilt or grief. No event of providence 
 shall be either an invincible temptation or an intolerable affliction 
 to them, but their love to the word of God shall enable them both to 
 hold fast their integrity and to preserve their tranquility. They will 
 make the best of that which is, and not quarrel with any thing that God 
 does. Nothing shall offend or hurt them, for every thing shall work for 
 good to them, and therefore shall please them, and they shall reconcile 
 themselves to it. Those in whom this holy love reigns will not be apt 
 to perplex themselves with needless scruples, nor to take offence at 
 their brethren,

 commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the whole duty of man; for we are taught, 

 1. To keep our eye upon God's favour as our end: "<I>Lord, I have hoped 
 for thy salvation,</I> not only temporal but eternal salvation. I have 
 hoped for that as my happiness and laid up my treasure in it; I have 
 hoped for it as thine, as a happiness of thy preparing, thy promising, 
 and which consists in being with thee. Hope of this has raised me above 
 the world, and borne me up under all my burdens in it." 

 2. To keep our eye upon God's word as our rule: <I>I have done thy 
 commandments,</I> that is, I have made conscience of conforming myself 
 to thy will in every thing. Observe here how God has joined these two 
 together, and let no man put them asunder. We cannot, upon good 
 grounds, hope for God's salvation, unless we set ourselves to do his 
 commandments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:14">Rev. xxii. 14</A>.

 But those that sincerely endeavour to do his commandments ought to keep 
 up a good hope of the salvation; and that hope will both engage and 
 enlarge the heart in doing the commandments. The more lively the hope 
 is the more lively the obedience will be.</P>

 ways <I>are</I> before thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David's conscience here witnesses for him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That his practices were good. 

 1. He loved God's testimonies, he loved them exceedingly. Our love to 
 the word of God must be a superlative love (we must love it better than 
 the wealth and pleasure of this world), and it must be a victorious 
 love, such as will subdue and mortify our lusts and extirpate carnal 
 affections. 

 2. He kept them, his soul kept them. Bodily exercise profits little in 
 religion; we must make heart-work of it or we make nothing of it. The 
 soul must be sanctified and renewed, and delivered into the mould of 
 the word; the soul must be employed in glorifying God, for he will be 
 worshipped in the spirit. We must keep both the precepts and the 
 testimonies, the commands of God by our obedience to them and his 
 promises by our reliance on them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he was governed herein by a good principle: "<I>Therefore</I> 
 I have kept thy precepts, because by faith I have seen thy eye always 
 upon me; <I>all my ways are before thee;</I> thou knowest every step I 
 take and strictly observest all I say and do. Thou dost see and accept 
 all that I say and do well; thou dost see and art displeased with all I 
 say and do amiss." Note, The consideration of this, that God's eye is 
 upon us at all times, should make us very careful in every thing to 
 keep his commandments,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. A general petition for audience repeated: <I>Let my cry come near 
 before thee;</I> and again, <I>Let my supplication come before 
 thee.</I> He calls his prayer his <I>cry,</I> which denotes the 
 fervency and vehemence of it, and his <I>supplication,</I> which 
 denotes the humility of it. We must come to God as beggars come to our 
 doors for an alms. He is concerned that his prayer might come before 
 God, might come near before him, that is, that he might have grace and 
 strength by faith and fervency to lift up his prayers, that no guilt 
 might interpose to shut out his prayers and to separate between him and 
 God, and that God would graciously receive his prayers and take notice 
 of them. His prayer that his supplication might come before God implied 
 a deep sense of his unworthiness, and a holy fear that his prayer 
 should come short or miscarry, as not fit to come before God; nor would 
 any of our prayers have had access to God if Jesus Christ had not
 approached to him as an advocate for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Two particular requests, which he is thus earnest to present:--

 1. That God, by his grace, would give him wisdom to conduct himself
 well under his troubles: <I>Give me understanding;</I> he means that 
 wisdom of the prudent which is to understand his way; "Give me to know 
 thee and myself, and my duty to thee."

 2. That God, by his providence, would rescue him out of his troubles: 
 <I>Deliver me,</I> that is, with the temptation make a way to escape, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The same general plea to enforce these requests--<I>according to
 thy word.</I> This directs and limits his desires: "Lord, give me such 
 an understanding as thou hast promised and such a deliverance as thou 
 hast promised; I ask for no other." It also encourages his faith and 
 expectation: "Lord, that which I pray for is what thou hast promised, 
 and wilt not thou be as good as thy word?"</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_171"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>171  My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
 statutes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A great favour which David expects from God, that he will teach him 
 his <I>statutes.</I> This he had often prayed for in this psalm, and 
 urged his petition for it with various arguments; and now that he is 
 drawing towards the close of the psalm he speaks of it as taken for 
 granted. Those that are humbly earnest with God for his grace, and 
 resolve with Jacob that they will not let him go unless he bless them 
 with spiritual blessings, may be humbly confident that they shall at 
 length obtain what they are so importunate for. The God of Israel will 
 grant them those things which they request of him. 

 2. The grateful sense he promises to have of that favour: <I>My lips 
 shall utter praise when thou hast taught me.</I>

 (1.) Then he shall have cause to praise God. Those that are taught of 
 God have a great deal of reason to be thankful, for this is the 
 foundation of all these spiritual blessings, which are the best 
 blessings, and the earnest of eternal blessings. 

 (2.) Then he shall know how to praise God, and have a heart to do it. 
 All that are taught of God are taught this lesson; when God opens the 
 understanding, opens the heart, and so opens the lips, it is that the 
 mouth may show forth his praise. We have learned nothing to purpose if 
 we have not learned to praise God. 

 (3.) <I>Therefore</I> he is thus importunate for divine instructions, 
 that he might praise God. Those that pray for God's grace must aim at 
 God's glory,

 Observe here, 

 1. The good knowledge David had of the word of God; he knew it so well 
 that he was ready to own, with the utmost satisfaction, that all God's 
 commandments are not only righteous, but righteousness itself, the rule 
 and standard of righteousness. 

 2. The good use he resolved to make of that knowledge: <I>My tongue 
 shall speak of thy word,</I> not only utter praise for it to the glory 
 of God, but discourse of it for the instruction and edification of 
 others, as that which he himself was full of (for out of the abundance 
 of the heart the mouth will speak) and as that which he desired others 
 also might be filled with. The more we see of the righteousness of 
 God's commandments the more industrious we should be to bring others 
 acquainted with them, that they may be ruled by them. We should always 
 make the word of God the governor of our discourse, so as never to 
 transgress it by sinful speaking or sinful silence; and we should often 
 make it the subject-matter of our discourse, that it may feed many and 
 <I>minister grace to the hearers.</I></P>

 my delight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. David prays that divine grace would work for him: <I>Let thy hand 
 help me.</I> He finds his own hands are not sufficient for him, nor can 
 any creature lend him a helping hand to any purpose; therefore he looks 
 up to God in hopes that the hand that had made him would help him; for, 
 if the Lord do not help us, whence can any creature help us? All our
 help must be expected from God's hand, from his power and his bounty. 

 2. He pleads what divine grace had already wrought in him as a pledge 
 of further mercy, being a qualification for it. Three things he 
 pleads:--

 (1.) That he had made religion his serious and deliberate choice: "<I>I
 have chosen thy precepts.</I> I took them for my rule, not because I 
 knew no other, but because, upon trial, I knew no better." Those are 
 good, and do good indeed, who are good and do good, not by chance, but 
 from choice; and those who have thus chosen God's precepts may depend 
 upon God's helping hand in all their services and under all their 
 sufferings. 

 (2.) That his heart was upon heaven: <I>I have longed for thy 
 salvation.</I> David, when he had got to the throne, met with enough in 
 the world to court his stay, and to make him say, "It is good to be 
 here;" but still he was looking further, and longing for something 
 better in another world. There is an eternal salvation which all the 
 saints are longing for, and therefore pray that God's hand would help 
 them forward in their way to it. 

 (3.) That he took pleasure in doing his duty: "<I>Thy law is my 
 delight.</I> Not only I delight in it, but it is my delight, the 
 greatest delight I have in this world." Those that are cheerful in 
 their obedience may in faith beg help of God to carry them on in their 
 obedience; and those that expect God's salvation must take delight in 
 his law and their hopes must increase their delight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David's heart is still upon praising God; and therefore, 

 1. He prays that God would give him time to praise him: "<I>Let my soul 
 live, and it shall praise thee,</I> that is, let my life be prolonged, 
 that I may live to thy glory." The reason why a good man desires to 
 live is that he may praise God in the land of the living, and do 
 something to his honour. Not, "Let me live and serve my country, live 
 and provide for my family;" but, "Let me live that, in doing this, I 
 may praise God here in this world of conflict and opposition." When we 
 die we hope to go to a better world to praise him, and that is more 
 agreeable for us, though here there is more need of us. And therefore 
 one would not desire to live any longer than we may do God some service 
 here. <I>Let my soul live,</I> that is, let me be sanctified and
 comforted, for sanctification and comfort are the life of the soul, 
 <I>and</I> then <I>it shall praise thee.</I> Our souls must be employed 
 in praising God, and we must pray for grace and peace that we may be 
 fitted to praise God. 

 2. He prays that God would give him strength to praise him: "<I>Let thy 
 judgments help me;</I> let all ordinances and all providences" (both 
 are God's judgments) "further me in glorifying God; let them be the 
 matter of my praise and let them help to fit me for that work."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps119_176"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>176  I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for
 I do not forget thy commandments.
 </FONT></P>

 Here is, 

 1. A penitent confession: <I>I have gone astray,</I> or wander up and 
 down, <I>like a lost sheep.</I> As unconverted sinners are like lost 
 sheep 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:4">Luke xv. 4</A>),

 so weak unsteady saints are like lost sheep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:12,13">Matt. xviii. 12, 13</A>.

 We are apt to wander like sheep, and very unapt, when we have gone 
 astray, to find the way again. By going astray we lose the comfort of 
 the green pastures and expose ourselves to a thousand mischiefs.

 2. A believing petition: <I>Seek thy servant,</I> as the good shepherd
 seeks a wandering sheep to bring it back again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:12">Ezek. xxxiv. 12</A>.

 "Lord, seek me, as I used to seek my sheep when they went astray;" for 
 David had been himself a tender shepherd. "Lord, own me for one of 
 thine; for, though I am a stray sheep, I have thy mark; concern thyself 
 for me, send after me by the word, and conscience, and providences; 
 bring me back by thy grace." <I>Seek me,</I> that is, <I>find me;</I> 
 for God never seeks in vain. <I>Turn me, and I shall be turned.</I> 

 3. An obedient plea: "Though I have gone astray, yet I have not
 wickedly departed, <I>I do not forget thy commandments.</I>" Thus he 
 concludes the psalm with a penitent sense of his own sin and believing 
 dependence on God's grace. With these a devout Christian will conclude 
 his duties, will conclude his life; he will live and die repenting and 
 praying. Observe here,

 (1.) It is the character of good people that they do not <I>forget 
 God's commandments,</I> being well pleased with their convictions and 
 well settled in their resolutions.

 (2.) Even those who, through grace, are mindful of their duty, cannot 
 but own that they have in many instances wandered from it. 

 (3.) Those that have wandered from their duty, if they continue mindful 
 of it, may with a humble confidence commit themselves to the care of 
 God's grace.</P>
