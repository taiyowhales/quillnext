 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Holy David is in this psalm putting himself upon a solemn trial, not by
 God and his country, but by God and his own conscience, to both which
 he appeals touching his integrity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 for the proof of which he alleges,

 I. His constant regard to God and his grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:3">ver. 3</A>.

 II. His rooted antipathy to sin and sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. His sincere affection to the ordinances of God, and his care about
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 Having thus proved his integrity, 

 1. He deprecates the doom of the wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 2. He casts himself upon the mercy and grace of God, with a resolution 
 to hold fast his integrity, and his hope in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must teach and admonish ourselves, and one 
 another, what we must be and do that we may have the favour of God, and 
 comfort in our own consciences, and comfort ourselves with it, as David 
 does, if we can say that in any measure we have, through grace, 
 answered to these characters. The learned Amyraldus, in his argument of 
 his psalm, suggests that David is here, by the spirit of prophecy, 
 carried out to speak of himself as a type of Christ, of whom what he 
 here says of his spotless innocence, was fully and eminently true, and 
 of him only, and to him we may apply it in singing this psalm. "We are 
 complete in him."</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that David penned this psalm when he was persecuted by 
 Saul and his party, who, to give some colour to their unjust rage, 
 represented him as a very bad man, and falsely accused him of many high 
 crimes and misdemeanors, dressed him up in the skins of wild beasts 
 that they might bait him. Innocency itself is no fence to the name, 
 though it is to the bosom, against the darts of calumny. Herein he was 
 a type of Christ, who was made a reproach of men, and foretold to his 
 followers that they also must have all manner of evil said against them 
 falsely. Now see what David does in this case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He appeals to God's righteous sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Judge me, O God!</I> be thou Judge between me and my accusers, 
 between the persecutor and the poor prisoner; bring me off with honour, 
 and put those to shame that falsely accuse me." Saul, who was himself 
 supreme judge in Israel, was his adversary, so that in a controversy 
 with him he could appeal to no other than to God himself. As to his
 offences against God, he prays, <I>Lord, enter not into judgment with 
 me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:2">Ps. cxliii. 2</A>),

 <I>remember not my transgressions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:7">Ps. xxv. 7</A>),

 in which he appeals to God's mercy; but, as to his offences against 
 Saul, he appeals to God's justice and begs of him to judge for him, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:1">Ps. xliii. 1</A>.

 Or thus: he cannot justify himself against the charge of sin; he owns 
 his iniquity is great and he is undone if God, in his infinite mercy, 
 do not forgive him; but he can justify himself against the charge of 
 hypocrisy, and has reason to hope that, according to the tenour of the 
 covenant of grace, he is one of those that may expect to find favour 
 with God. Thus holy Job often owns he has sinned and yet he holds fast 
 his integrity. Note, It is a comfort to those who are falsely accused 
 that there is a righteous God, who, sooner or later, will clear up 
 their innocency, and a comfort to all who are sincere in religion that 
 God himself is a witness to their sincerity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He submits to his unerring search 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Examine me, O Lord!  and prove me,</I> as gold is proved, whether it 
 be standard. God knows every man's true character, for he knows the 
 thoughts and intents of the heart, as sees through every disguise.  
 David prays, <I>Lord, examine me,</I> which intimates that he was well 
 pleased that God did know him and truly desirous that he would discover 
 him to himself and discover him to all the world. So sincere was he in 
 his devotion to his God and his loyalty to his prince (in both which he 
 was suspected to be a pretender) that he wished he had a window in his 
 bosom, that whoever would might look into his heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He solemnly protests his sincerity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>I have walked in my integrity;</I> my conversation had agreed with 
 my profession, and one part of it has been of a piece with another." It 
 is vain to boast of our integrity unless we can make it out that by the 
 grace of God we have walked in our integrity, and that our conversation 
 in the world has been in simplicity and godly sincerity. He produces 
 here several proofs of his integrity, which encouraged him to trust in 
 the Lord as his righteous Judge, who would patronise and plead his 
 righteous cause, with an assurance that he should come off with 
 reputation (<I>therefore I shall not slide</I>), and that those should 
 not prevail who consulted to cast him down from his excellency, to 
 shake his faith, blemish his name, and prevent his coming to the crown, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:4">Ps. lxii. 4</A>.

 Those that are sincere in religion may trust in God that they shall not 
 slide, that is, that they shall not apostasize from their religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had a constant regard to God and to his grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) He aimed at God's good favour as his end and chief good: <I>Thy 
 loving-kindness is before my eyes.</I> This will be a good evidence of 
 our sincerity, if what we do in religion we do from a principle of love 
 to God, and good thoughts of him as the best of beings and the best of 
 friends and benefactors, and from a grateful sense of God's goodness to 
 us in particular, which we have had the experience of all our days. If 
 we set God's loving-kindness before us as our pattern, to which we 
 endeavour to conform ourselves, being <I>followers of him that is 
 good,</I> in his goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:13">1 Pet. iii. 13</A>),

 --if we set it before us as our great engagement and encouragement to
 our duty, and are afraid of doing any thing to forfeit God's favour and 
 in care by all means to keep ourselves in his love,--this will not only 
 be a good evidence of our integrity, but will have a great influence 
 upon our perseverance in it.  

 (2.) He governed himself by the word of God as his rule: "<I>I have 
 walked in thy truth,</I> that is, according to thy law, for thy law is 
 truth." Note, Those only may expect the benefit of God's 
 loving-kindness that live up to his truths, and his laws that are 
 grounded upon them. Some understand it of his conforming himself to 
 God's example in truth and faithfulness, as well as in goodness and 
 loving-kindness. Those certainly walk well that are followers of God as 
 dear children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, nor with 
 the workers of those works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 By this it appeared he was truly loyal to his prince that he never 
 associated with those that were disaffected to his government, with any 
 of those <I>sons of Belial that despised him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:27">1 Sam. x. 27</A>.

 He was in none of their cabals, nor joined with them in any of their
 intrigues; he cursed not the king, no, not in his heart. And this also 
 was an evidence of his faithfulness to his God, that he never 
 associated with those who he had any reason to think were disaffected 
 to religion, or were open enemies, or false friends, to its interests. 
 Note, Great care to avoid bad company is both a good evidence of our 
 integrity and a good means to preserve us in it. Now observe here, 

 (1.) That this part of his protestation looks both backward upon the 
 care he had hitherto taken in this matter, and forward upon the care he 
 would still take: "<I>I have not sat with them,</I> and I <I>will not 
 go in with them.</I>" Note, Our good practices hitherto are then 
 evidence of our integrity when they are accompanied with resolutions, 
 in God's strength, to persevere in them to the end, and not to draw 
 back; and our good resolutions for the future we may then take the 
 comfort of when they are the continuation of our good practices 
 hitherto. 

 (2.) That David shunned the company, not only of wicked persons, but of 
 vain persons, that were wholly addicted to mirth and gaiety and had 
 nothing solid or serious in them.  The company of such may perhaps be 
 the more pernicious of the two to a good man because he will not be so 
 ready to stand upon his guard against the contagion of vanity as 
 against that of downright wickedness. 

 (3.) That the company of dissemblers is as dangerous company as any,
 and as much to be shunned, in prudence as well as piety. Evil-doers
 pretend friendship to those whom they would decoy into their snares,
 but they dissemble.  <I>When they speak fair, believe them not.</I>

 (4.) Though sometimes he could not avoid being in the company of bad
 people, yet he would not <I>go in with them,</I> he would not choose
 such for his companions nor seek an opportunity of acquaintance and
 converse with them. He might fall in with them, but he would not, by
 appointment and assignation, go in with them. Or, if he happened to be
 with them, he would not sit with them, he would not continue with them;
 he would be in their company no longer than his business made it
 necessary: he would not concur with them, not say as they said, nor do
 as they did, as those that <I>sit in the seat of the scornful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1">Ps. i. 1</A>.

 He would not sit in counsel with them upon ways and means to do
 mischief, nor sit in judgment with them to condemn the generation of 
 the righteous. 

 (5.) We must not only in our practice avoid bad company, but in our
 principles and affections we must have an aversion to it.  David here
 says, not only "I have shunned it," but, "<I>I have hated it,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:21">Ps. cxxxix. 21</A>.

 (6.) The congregation of evil-doers, the club, the confederacy of them, 
 is in a special manner hateful to good people. I have hated 
 <I>ecclesiam malignantium--the church of the malignant;</I> so the 
 vulgar Latin reads its. As good men, in concert, make one another 
 better, and are enabled to do so much the more good, so bad men, in 
 combination, make one another worse, and do so much the more mischief.  
 In all this David was a type of Christ, who, though he received sinners 
 and ate with them, to instruct them and do them good, yet, otherwise, 
 was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners, particularly 
 from the Pharisees, those dissemblers. He was also an example to 
 Christians, when they join themselves to Christ, to <I>save themselves 
 from this untoward generation,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David mentions, as further evidence of his integrity, the sincere 
 affection he had to the ordinances of God, the constant care he took 
 about them, and the pleasure he took in them. Hypocrites and 
 dissemblers may indeed be found attending on God's ordinances, as the 
 proud Pharisee went up to the temple to pray with the penitent 
 publican; but it is a good sign of sincerity if we attend upon them as 
 David here tells us he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6-8"><I>v.</I>  6-8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was very careful and conscientious in his preparation for holy 
 ordinances: <I>I will wash my hands in innocency.</I> He not only 
 refrained from the society of sinners, but kept himself clean from the 
 pollutions of sin, and this with an eye to the place he had among those 
 that compassed God's altar. "I will wash, and so will I compass the 
 altar, knowing that otherwise I shall not be welcome." This is like 
 that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:28">1 Cor. xi. 28</A>),

 <I>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat,</I> so prepared. This
 denotes, 

 (1.) Habitual preparation: "<I>I will wash my hands in innocency;</I> I 
 will carefully watch against all sin, and keep my conscience pure from 
 those dead works which defile it and forbid my drawing nigh to God." 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:3,4">Ps. xxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 (2.) Actual preparation. It alludes to the ceremony of the priests'
 washing when they went in to minister,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:20,21">Exod. xxx. 20, 21</A>.

 Though David was no priest, yet, as every worshipper ought, he would
 look to the substance of that which the priests were enjoined the
 shadow of. In our preparation for solemn ordinances we must not only be
 able to clear ourselves from the charge of reigning infidelity or
 hypocrisy, and to protest our innocency of that (which was signified by
 <I>washing the hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:6">Deut. xxi. 6</A>),

 but we must take pains to cleanse ourselves from the spots of remaining
 iniquity by renewing our repentance, and making fresh application of 
 the blood of Christ to our consciences for the purifying and pacifying 
 of them. He that is washed (that is, in a justified state) has need 
 thus to <I>wash his feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10">John xiii. 10</A>),

 to wash his hands, to wash them in innocency; he that is penitent is
 <I>pene innocens--almost innocent;</I> and he that is pardoned is so 
 far innocent that his sins shall not be mentioned against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was very diligent and serious in his attendance upon them: <I>I 
 will compass thy altar,</I> alluding to the custom of the priests, who, 
 while the sacrifice was in offering, walked round the altar, and 
 probably the offerers likewise did so at some distance, denoting a 
 diligent regard to what was done and a dutiful attendance in the 
 service. "<I>I will compass it;</I> I will be among the crowds that do 
 compass it, among the thickest of them." David, a man of honour, a man 
 of business, a man of war, thought it not below him to attend with the 
 multitude on God's altars and could find time for that attendance. 
 Note, 

 (1.) All God's people will be sure to wait on God's altar, in obedience 
 to his commands and in pursuance of his favour. Christ is our altar, 
 not as the altar in the Jewish church, which was fed by them, but an 
 altar that we eat of and <I>live upon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10">Heb. xiii. 10</A>.

 (2.) It is a pleasant sight to see God's altar compassed and to see
 ourselves among those that compass it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In all his attendance on God's ordinances he aimed at the glory of 
 God and was much in the thankful praise and adoration of him. He had an 
 eye to the place of worship as the place where God's honor dwelt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and therefore made it his business there to honour God and to give him 
 the glory due to his name, to publish with the voice of thanksgiving 
 all God's wondrous works. God's gracious works, which call for 
 thanksgiving, are all wondrous works, which call for our admiration. We 
 ought to publish them, and tell of them, for his glory, and the 
 excitement of others to praise him; and we ought to do it with the 
 voice of thanksgiving, as those that are sensible of our obligations, 
 by all ways possible, to acknowledge with gratitude the favours we have 
 received from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He did this with delight and from a principle of true affection to 
 God and his institutions. Touching this he appeals to God: 
 "<I>Lord,</I> thou knowest how dearly <I>I have loved the habitation of 
 thy house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 the tabernacle where thou art pleased to manifest thy residence among 
 thy people and receive their homage, <I>the place where thy honour 
 dwells.</I>" David was sometimes forced by persecution into the 
 countries of idolaters and was hindered from attending God's altars, 
 which perhaps his persecutors, that laid him under that restraint, did 
 themselves upbraid him with as his crime. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:27">1 Sam. xx. 27</A>.

 "But, Lord," says he, "though I cannot come to the habitation of thy
 house, I love it; my heart is there, and it is my greatest trouble that 
 I am not there." Note, All that truly love God truly love the 
 ordinances of God, and <I>therefore</I> love them because in them he 
 manifests his honour and they have an opportunity of honoring him. Our 
 Lord Jesus loved his Father's honour, and made it his business to 
 glorify him; he loved the habitation of his house, his church among 
 men, loved it and gave himself for it, that he might build and 
 consecrate it. Those who love communion with God, and delight in 
 approaching him, find it to be a constant pleasure, a comfortable 
 evidence of their integrity, and a comfortable earnest of their endless 
 felicity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David, having given proofs of his integrity, earnestly prays, with 
 a humble confidence towards God (such as those have whose hearts 
 condemn them not), that he might not fall under the doom of the wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>).

 <I>Gather not my soul with sinners,</I> Here, 

 1. David describes these sinners, whom he looked upon to be in a
 miserable condition, so miserable that he could not wish the worst 
 enemy he had in the world to be in a worse. "They are <I>bloody 
 men,</I> that thirst after blood and lie under a great deal of the 
 guilt of blood. They do mischief, and mischief is always in their 
 hands. Though they get by their wickedness (for <I>their right hand is 
 full of bribes</I> which they have taken to pervert justice), yet that 
 will make their case never the better; for <I>what is a man profited if 
 he gain the world and lose his soul?</I>" 

 2. He dread having his lot with them. He never loved them, nor 
 associated with them, in this world, and therefore could in faith pray 
 that he might not have his lot with them in the other world. Our souls 
 must shortly be gathered, to return to God that gave them and will call 
 for them again. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:14">Job xxxiv. 14</A>.

 It concerns us to consider whether our souls will then be gathered with
 saints or with sinners, whether bound in the bundle of life with the 
 Lord for ever, as the souls of the faithful are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:29">1 Sam. xxv. 29</A>),

 or bound in the bundle of tares for the fire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:30">Matt. xiii. 30</A>.

 Death gathers us to our people, to those that are our people while we
 live, whom we choose to associate with, and with whom we cast in our 
 lot, to those death will gather us, and with them we must take our lot, 
 to eternity. Balaam desired to die the death of the righteous; David 
 dreaded dying the death of the wicked; so that both sides were of that 
 mind, which if we be of, and will live up to it, we are happy for ever. 
 Those that will not be companions with sinners in their mirth, nor eat 
 of their dainties, may in faith pray not to be companions with them in 
 their misery, nor to drink of their cup, their cup of trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David, with a holy humble confidence, commits himself to the grace 
 of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 1. He promises that by the grace of God he would persevere in his duty: 
 "<I>As for me,</I> whatever others do, <I>I will walk in my 
 integrity.</I>" Note, When the testimony of our consciences for us that 
 we have walked in our integrity is comfortable to us this should 
 confirm our resolutions to continue therein. 

 2. He prays for the divine grace both to enable him to do so and to 
 give him the comfort of it: "<I>Redeem me</I> out of the hands of my 
 enemies, <I>and be merciful to me,</I> living and dying." Be we ever so 
 confident of our integrity, yet still we must rely upon God's mercy and 
 the great redemption Christ has wrought out, and pray for the benefit 
 of them. 

 3.  He pleases himself with his steadiness: "<I>My foot stands in an
 even place,</I> where I shall not stumble and whence I shall not fall." 
 This he speaks as one that found his resolutions fixed for God and 
 godliness, not to be shaken by the temptations of the world, and his 
 comforts firm in God and his grace, not to be disturbed by the crosses 
 and troubles of the world. 

 4. He promises himself that he should yet have occasion to praise the 
 Lord, that he should be furnished with matter for praise, that he 
 should have a heart for praises, and that, though he was now perhaps 
 banished from public ordinances, yet he should again have an 
 opportunity of blessing God in the congregation of his people. Those 
 that hate the congregation of evil-doers shall be joined to the 
 congregation of the righteous and join with them in praising God; and

 the more like heaven.</P>
