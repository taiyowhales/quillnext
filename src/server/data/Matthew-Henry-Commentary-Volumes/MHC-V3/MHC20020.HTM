 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Wine <I>is</I> a mocker, strong drink <I>is</I> raging: and whosoever
 is deceived thereby is not wise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The mischief of drunkenness: <I>Wine is a mocker; strong drink is
 raging.</I> It is so to the sinner himself; it mocks him, makes a fool 
 of him, promises him that satisfaction which it can never give him. It 
 smiles upon him at first, but <I>at the last it bites.</I> In 
 reflection upon it, it rages in his conscience. It is raging in the 
 body, puts the humours into a ferment. <I>When the wine is in the wit 
 is out,</I> and then the man, according as his natural temper is, 
 either mocks like a fool or rages like a madman. Drunkenness, which 
 pretends to be a sociable thing, renders men unfit for society, for it 
 makes them abusive with their tongues and outrageous in their passions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:29"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 29</A>.

 2. The folly of drunkards is easily inferred thence. He that <I>is
 deceived thereby,</I> that suffers himself to be drawn into this sin 
 when he is so plainly warned of the consequences of it, <I>is not 
 wise;</I> he shows that he has no right sense or consideration of 
 things; and not only so, but he renders himself incapable of getting 
 wisdom; for it is a sin that infatuates and besots men, and takes away 
 their heart. A drunkard is a fool, and a fool he is likely to be.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  The fear of a king <I>is</I> as the roaring of a lion: <I>whoso</I>
 provoketh him to anger sinneth <I>against</I> his own soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How formidable kings are, and what a terror they strike upon those 
 they are angry with. Their <I>fear,</I> with which (especially when 
 they are absolute and their will is a law) they keep their subjects in 
 awe, <I>is as the roaring of a lion,</I> which is very dreadful to the 
 creatures he preys upon, and makes them tremble so that they cannot 
 escape from him. Those princes that rule by wisdom and love rule like 
 God himself, and bear his image; but those that rule merely by terror, 
 and with a high hand, do but rule like a lion in the forest, with a 
 brutal power. <I>Oderint, dum metuant</I>--<I>Let them hate, provided 
 they fear.</I> 

 2. How unwise therefore those are that quarrel with them, that are 
 angry at them, and so <I>provoke them to anger.</I> They <I>sin against 
 their own lives.</I> Much more do those do so that provoke the King of 
 kings to anger. <I>Nemo me impune lacesset</I>--<I>No one shall provoke 
 me with impunity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  <I>It is</I> an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every
 fool will be meddling.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is designed to rectify men's mistakes concerning strife. 

 1. Men think it is their wisdom to engage in quarrels; whereas it is 
 the greatest folly that can be. He thinks himself a wise man that is 
 quick in resenting affronts, that stands upon every nicety of honour 
 and right, and will not abate an ace of either, that prescribes, and 
 imposes, and gives law, to every body; but he that thus meddles is a 
 fool, and creates a great deal of needless vexation to himself. 

 2. Men think, when they are engaged in quarrels, that it would be a 
 shame to them to go back and let fall the weapon; whereas really <I>it 
 is an honour for a man to cease from strife,</I> an honour to withdraw 
 an action, to drop a controversy, to forgive an injury, and to be 
 friends with those that we have fallen out with. It is the honour of a 
 man, a wise man, a man of spirit, to show the command he has of himself 
 by <I>ceasing from strife,</I> yielding, and stooping, and receding 
 from his just demands, for peace-sake, as Abraham, the better man, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:8">Gen. xiii. 8</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; <I>therefore</I>
 shall he beg in harvest, and <I>have</I> nothing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here the evil of slothfulness and the love of ease. 

 1. It keeps men from the most necessary business, from ploughing and 
 sowing when the season is: <I>The sluggard</I> has ground to occupy, 
 and has ability for it; he can plough, but he <I>will not;</I> some 
 excuse or other he has to shift it off, but the true reason is that it 
 is <I>cold</I> weather. Though ploughing time is not in the depth of 
 winter, it is in the borders of winter, when he thinks it too cold for 
 him to be abroad. Those are scandalously sluggish who, in the way of
 their business, cannot find in their hearts to undergo so little toil 
 as that of ploughing and so little hardship as that of a cold blast. 
 Thus careless are many in the affairs of their souls; a trifling 
 difficulty will frighten them from the most important duty; but good 
 soldiers must endure hardness. 

 2. Thereby it deprives them of the most necessary supports: Those that 
 <I>will not plough</I> in seed-time cannot expect to reap in harvest; 
 and therefore they must beg their bread with astonishment when the 
 diligent are bringing home their sheaves with joy. He that will not 
 submit to the labour of ploughing must submit to the shame of begging. 
 They <I>shall beg in harvest, and</I> yet <I>have nothing;</I> no, not 
 then when there is great plenty. Though it may be charity to relieve 
 sluggards, yet a man may, in justice, not relieve them; they deserve to 
 be left to starve. Those that would not provide oil in their vessels 
 begged when the bridegroom came, and were denied.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Counsel in the heart of man <I>is like</I> deep water; but a man
 of understanding will draw it out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A man's wisdom is here said to be of use to him for the pumping of 
 other people, and diving into them, 

 1. To get the knowledge of them. Though men's counsels and designs are
 ever so carefully concealed by them, so that they are as <I>deep 
 water</I> which one cannot fathom, yet there are those who by sly 
 insinuations, and questions that seem foreign, will get out of them 
 both what they have done and what they intend to do. Those therefore 
 who would keep counsel must not only put on resolution, but stand upon 
 their guard. 

 2. To get knowledge by them. Some are very able and fit to give
 counsel, having an excellent faculty of cleaving a hair, hitting the 
 joint of a difficulty, and advising pertinently, but they are modest, 
 and reserved, and not communicative; they have a great deal in them, 
 but it is loth to come out. In such a case <I>a man of understanding 
 will draw it out,</I> as wine out of a vessel. We lose the benefit we 
 might have by the conversation of wise men for want of the art of being 
 inquisitive.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
 faithful man who can find?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is easy to find those that will pretend to be kind and liberal. 
 Many a man will call himself a man of mercy, will boast what good he 
 has done and what good he designs to do, or, at least, what an 
 affection he has to well-doing. Most men will talk a great deal of 
 their charity, generosity, hospitality, and piety, will sound a trumpet 
 to themselves, as the Pharisees, and what little goodness they have 
 will proclaim it and make a mighty matter of it. 

 2. But it is hard to find those that really are kind and liberal, that 
 have done and will do more than either they speak of or care to hear 
 spoken of, that will be true friends in a strait; such a one as one may 
 trust to is like a black swan.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The just <I>man</I> walketh in his integrity: his children <I>are</I>
 blessed after him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here observed to the honour of a good man, 

 1. That he does well for himself. He has a certain rule, which with an 
 even steady hand he governs himself by: He <I>walks in his 
 integrity;</I> he keeps good conscience, and he has the comfort of it, 
 for <I>it is his rejoicing.</I> He is not liable to those uneasinesses, 
 either in contriving what he shall do or reflecting on what he has 
 done, which those are liable to that walk in deceit. 

 2. That he does well for his family: <I>His children are blessed after 
 him,</I> and fare the better for his sake. God has mercy in store for 
 the seed of the faithful.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
 all evil with his eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The character of a good governor: He is <I>a king</I> that deserves 
 to be called so who <I>sits in the throne,</I> not as a throne of 
 honour, to take his ease, and take state upon him, and oblige men to 
 keep their distance, but as a <I>throne of judgment,</I> that he may do 
 justice, give redress to the injured and punish the injurious, who 
 makes his business his delight and loves no pleasure comparably to it, 
 who does not devolve the whole care and trouble upon others, but takes 
 cognizance of affairs himself and sees with his own eyes as much as may 
 be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:9">1 Kings x. 9</A>.

 2. The happy effect of a good government. The presence of the prince 
 goes far towards the putting of wickedness out of countenance; if he 
 inspect his affairs himself, those that are employed under him will be 
 kept in awe and restrained from doing wrong. If great men be good men, 
 and will use their power as they may and ought, what good may they do 
 and what evil may they prevent!</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
 sin?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This question is not only a challenge to any man in the world to prove 
 himself sinless, whatever he pretends, but a lamentation of the 
 corruption of mankind, even that which remains in the best. Alas! 
 <I>Who can say,</I> "I am sinless?" Observe, 

 1. Who the persons are that are excluded from these pretensions--all,
 one as well as another. Here, in this imperfect state, no person
 whatsoever can pretend to be without sin. Adam could say so in 
 innocency, and saints can say so in heaven, but none in this life. 
 Those that think themselves as good as they should be cannot, nay, and 
 those that are really good will not, dare not, say this. 

 2. What the pretension is that is excluded. We cannot say, We <I>have 
 made our hearts clean.</I> Though we can say, through grace, "We are 
 cleaner than we have been," yet we cannot say, "We are clean and pure 
 from all remainders of sin." Or, though we are clean from the gross 
 acts of sin, yet we cannot say, "Our hearts are clean." Or, though we 
 are washed and cleansed, yet we cannot say, "We ourselves made our own 
 hearts clean;" it was the work of the Spirit. Or, though we are pure
 from the sins of many others, yet we cannot say, "We are <I>pure from 
 our sin, the sin that easily besets us,</I> the <I>body of death</I> 
 which Paul complained of,"

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Divers weights, <I>and</I> divers measures, both of them <I>are</I>
 alike abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The various arts of deceiving that men have, all which evils the 
 <I>love of money</I> is the root of. In paying and receiving money, 
 which was then commonly done by the scale, they had <I>divers 
 weights,</I> an under-weight for what they paid and an over-weight for 
 what they received; in delivering out and taking in goods they had 
 <I>divers measures,</I> a scanty measure to sell by and a large measure 
 to buy by. This was done wrong with plot and contrivance, and under 
 colour of doing right. Under these is included all manner of fraud and 
 deceit in commerce and trade. 

 2. The displeasure of God against them. Whether they be about the
 money or the goods, in the buyer or in the seller, they are all 
 <I>alike an abomination to the Lord.</I> He will not prosper the trade 
 that is thus driven, nor bless what is thus got. He hates those that
 thus break the common faith by which justice is maintained, and will be 
 <I>the avenger of all such.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work <I>be</I>
 pure, and whether <I>it be</I> right.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The tree is known by its fruits, a man <I>by his doings,</I> even a 
 young tree by its first fruits, <I>a child by his</I> childish things, 
 <I>whether his work be clean</I> only, appearing good (the word is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>),

 or <I>whether it be right,</I> that is, really good. This intimates,

 1. That children will discover themselves. One may soon see what their 
 temper is, and which way their inclination leads them, according as 
 their constitution is. Children have not learned the art of dissembling 
 and concealing their bent as grown people have. 

 2. That parents should observe their children, that they may discover 
 their disposition and genius, and both manage and dispose of them 
 accordingly, drive the nail that will go and draw out that which goes 
 amiss. <I>Wisdom is</I> herein <I>profitable to direct.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath made even
 both of them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. God is the God of nature, and all the powers and faculties of nature 
 are derived from him and depend upon him, and therefore are to be 
 employed for him. It was he that <I>formed the eye</I> and <I>planted 
 the ear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:9">Ps. xciv. 9</A>),

 and the structure of both is admirable; and it is he that preserves to 
 us the use of both; to his providence we owe it that our eyes are 
 <I>seeing eyes</I> and our ears <I>hearing ears.</I> Hearing and seeing 
 are the learning senses, and must particularly own God's goodness in 
 them.

 2. God is the God of grace. It is he that gives the ear that hears 
 God's voice, the eye that sees his beauty, for it is he that opens the
 understanding.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr20_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
 <I>and</I> thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that indulge themselves in their ease may expect to want 
 necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 
 "Therefore, though thou must sleep (nature requires it), yet <I>love 
 not sleep,</I> as those do that hate business. Love not sleep for its
 own sake, but only as it fits for further work. Love not much sleep, 
 but rather grudge the time that is spent in it, and wish thou couldst 
 live without it, that thou mightest always be employed in some good 
 exercise." We must allow it to our bodies as men allow it to their 
 servants, because they cannot help it and otherwise they shall have no 
 good of them. Those that love sleep are likely to <I>come to 
 poverty,</I> not only because they lose the time they spend in excess 
 of sleep, but because they contract a listless careless disposition, 
 and are still half asleep, never well awake. 

 2. Those that stir up themselves to their business may expect to have 
 conveniences: "<I>Open thy eyes,</I> awake and shake off sleep, see how 
 far in the day it is, how thy work wants thee, and how busy others are 
 about thee! And, when thou art awake, look up, look to thy advantages, 
 and do not let slip thy opportunities; apply thy mind closely to thy 
 business and be in care about it. It is the easy condition of a great 
 advantage: <I>Open thy eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread;</I> 
 if thou dost not grow rich, yet thou shalt have enough, and that is
 as good as a feast."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  <I>It is</I> naught, <I>it is</I> naught, saith the buyer: but when he
 is gone his way, then he boasteth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here 

 1. What arts men use to get a good bargain and to buy cheap. They not 
 only cheapen carelessly, as if they had no need, no mind for the 
 commodity, when perhaps they cannot go without it (there may be 
 prudence in that), but they vilify and run down that which yet they 
 know to be of value; they cry, "<I>It is naught, it is naught;</I> it 
 has this and the other fault, or perhaps may have; it is not good of 
 the sort; and it is too dear; we can have better and cheaper elsewhere, 
 or have bought better and cheaper." This is the common way of dealing; 
 and after all, it may be, they know the contrary of what they affirm; 
 but the buyer, who may think he has no other way of being even with the 
 seller, does as extravagantly commend his goods and justify the price 
 he sets on them, and so there is a fault on both sides; whereas the 
 bargain would be made every jot as well if both buyer and seller would 
 be modest and speak as they think. 

 2. What pride and pleasure men take in a good bargain when they have 
 got it, though therein they contradict themselves, and own they 
 dissembled when they were driving the bargain. When the buyer has
 beaten down the seller, who was content to lower his price rather than 
 lose a customer (as many poor tradesmen are forced to do--small profit 
 is better than none), then he goes his way, and boasts what excellent 
 goods he has got at his own price, and takes it as an affront and a 
 reflection upon his judgment if any body disparages his bargain. 
 Perhaps he knew the worth of the good better than the seller himself 
 did and knows how to get a great deal by them. See how apt men are to 
 be pleased with their gettings and proud of their tricks; whereas a 
 fraud and a lie are what a man ought to be ashamed of, though he have 
 gained ever so much by them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
 knowledge <I>are</I> a precious jewel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>lips of knowledge</I> (a good understanding to guide the lips 
 and a good elocution to diffuse the knowledge) are to be preferred far 
 before gold, and pearl, and rubies; for, 

 1. They are more rare in themselves, more scarce and hard to be got.
 <I>There is gold</I> in many a man's pocket that has no grace in his 
 heart. In Solomon's time there was plenty of gold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:21">1 Kings x. 21</A>)

 and <I>abundance of rubies;</I> every body wore them; they were to be 
 bought in every town. But wisdom is a rare thing, a precious jewel; few 
 have it so as to do good with it, nor is it to be purchased of the 
 merchants.

 2. They are more enriching to us and more adorning. They make us rich 
 towards God, rich in good works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9,10">1 Tim. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 Most people are fond of gold, and a ruby or two will not serve, they 
 must have a multitude of them, a cabinet of jewels; but he that has the 
 lips of knowledge despises these, because he knows and possesses better 
 things.</P>

 Two sorts of persons are here spoken of that are ruining their own 
 estates, and will be beggars shortly, and therefore are not to be 
 trusted with any good security:--

 1. Those that will be bound for any body that will ask them, that 
 entangle themselves in rash suretiship to oblige their idle companions; 
 they will break at last, nay, they cannot hold out long; these waste by 
 wholesale. 

 2. Those that are in league with abandoned women, that treat them, and 
 court them, and keep company with them. They will be beggars in a 
 little time; never give them credit without good pledge. Strange women 
 have strange ways of impoverishing men to enrich themselves.</P>

 Note, 

 1. Sin may possibly be pleasant in the commission: <I>Bread of 
 deceit,</I> wealth gotten by fraud, by lying and oppression, may be 
 <I>sweet to a man,</I> and the more sweet for its being ill-gotten, 
 such pleasure does the carnal mind take in the success of its wicked 
 projects. All the pleasures and profits of sin are <I>bread of 
 deceit.</I> They are stolen, for they are forbidden fruit; and they 
 will deceive men, for they are not what they promise. For a time, 
 however, they are <I>rolled under the tongue as a sweet morsel,</I> and 
 the sinner blesses himself in them. But, 

 2. It will be bitter in reflection. Afterwards the sinner's <I>mouth 
 shall be filled with gravel.</I> When his conscience is awakened, when 
 he sees himself cheated, and becomes apprehensive of the wrath of God 
 against him for his sin, how painful and uneasy then is the thought of 
 it! The pleasures of sin are but for a season, and are succeeded with 
 sorrow. Some nations have punished malefactors by mingling gravel with
 their bread.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  <I>Every</I> purpose is established by counsel: and with good
 advice make war.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is good in every thing to act with deliberation, and to consult 
 with ourselves at least, and, in matters of moment, with our friends, 
 too, before we determine, but especially to ask counsel of God, and beg 
 direction from him, and observe the guidance of this eye. This is the
 way to have both our minds and our purposes established, and to succeed 
 well in our affairs; whereas what is done hastily and with 
 precipitation is repented of at leisure. Take time, and you will have 
 done the sooner. <I>Deliberandum est diu, quod statuendum est
 semel</I>--<I>A final decision should be preceded by mature 
 deliberation.</I> 

 2. It is especially our wisdom to be cautious in making war. Consider, 
 and take advice, whether the war should be begun or no, whether it be 
 just, whether it be prudent, whether we be a match for the enemy, and 
 able to carry it on when it is too late to retreat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:31">Luke xiv. 31</A>);

 and, when it is begun, consider how and by what arts it may be 
 prosecuted, for management is as necessary as courage. Going to law is 
 a kind of going to war, and therefore must be done with good advice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:8">Prov. xxv. 8</A>.

 The rule among the Romans was <I>nec sequi bellum, nec

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  He that goeth about <I>as</I> a talebearer revealeth secrets:
 therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two sorts of people are dangerous to be conversed with:--

 1. Tale-bearers, though they are commonly flatterers, and by fair
 speeches insinuate themselves into men's acquaintance. Those are 
 unprincipled people that go about carrying stories, that make mischief 
 among neighbours and relations, that sow in the minds of people 
 jealousies of their governors, of their ministers, and of one another, 
 that reveal secrets which they are entrusted with or which by unfair 
 means they come to the knowledge of, under pretence of guessing at 
 men's thoughts and intentions, tell that of them which is really false. 
 "Be not familiar with such; do not give them the hearing when they tell 
 their tales and reveal secrets, for you may be sure that they will 
 betray your secrets too and tell tales of you." 

 2. Flatterers, for they are commonly tale-bearers. If a man fawn upon 
 you, compliment and commend you, suspect him to have some design upon 
 you, and stand upon your guard; he would pick that out of you which 
 will serve him to make a story of to somebody else to your prejudice; 
 therefore <I>meddle not with him that flatters with his lips.</I> Those 
 too dearly love, and too dearly buy, their own praise, that will put 
 confidence in a man and trust him with a secret or business because he 
 flatters them.</P>

 Here is, 

 1. An undutiful child become very wicked by degrees. He began with 
 despising his father and mother, slighting their instructions, 
 disobeying their commands, and raging at their rebukes, but at length 
 he arrives at such a pitch of impudence and impiety as to curse them, 
 to give them scurrilous and opprobrious language, and to wish mischief 
 to those that were instruments of his being and have taken so much care 
 and pains about him, and this in defiance of God and his law, which had 
 made this a capital crime 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:17,Mt+15:4">Exod. xxi. 17, Matt. xv. 4</A>),

 and in violation of all the bonds of duty, natural affection, and 
 gratitude.

 2. An undutiful child become very miserable at last: <I>His lamp shall 
 be put out in obscure darkness;</I> all his honour shall be laid in the 
 dust, and he shall for ever lose his reputation. Let him never expect 
 any peace or comfort in his own mind, no, nor to prosper in this world. 
 His days shall be shortened, and the lamp of his life extinguished, 
 according to the reverse of the promise of the fifth commandment. His 
 family shall be cut off and his posterity be a curse to him. And it 
 will be his eternal ruin; the lamp of his happiness shall be <I>put out 
 in the blackness of darkness</I> (so the word is), even that which is

 Note, 

 1. It is possible that an estate may be suddenly raised. There are 
 those that will be rich, by right or wrong, who make no conscience of 
 what they say or do if they can but get money by it, who, when it is in 
 their power, will cheat their own father, and who sordidly spare and 
 hoard up what they get, grudging themselves and their families food 
 convenient and thinking all lost but what they buy land with or put out 
 to interest. By such ways as these a man may grow rich, may grow very 
 rich, in a little time, at his first setting out. 

 2. An estate that is suddenly raised is often as suddenly ruined. It 
 was raised hastily, but, not being raised honestly, it proves <I>soon 
 ripe and soon rotten: The end thereof shall not be blessed</I> of God, 
 and, if he do not bless it, it can neither be comfortable nor of any 
 continuance; so that he who got it at the end will be a fool. He had 
 better have taken time and built firmly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that live in this world must expect to have injuries done them, 
 affronts given them, and trouble wrongfully created them, for we dwell 
 among briers. Now here we are told what to do when we have wrong done 
 us. 

 1. We must not avenge ourselves, no, nor so much as think of revenge, 
 or design it: "<I>Say not thou,</I> no, not in thy heart, <I>I will 
 recompense evil</I> for evil. Do not please thyself with the thought 
 that some time or other thou shalt have an opportunity of being quits 
 with him. Do not wish revenge, or hope for it, much less resolve upon 
 it, no, not when the injury is fresh and the resentment of it most 
 deep. Never say that thou wilt do a thing which thou canst not in faith
 pray to God to assist thee in, and <I>that</I> thou canst not do in 
 mediating revenge." 

 2. We must refer ourselves to God, and leave it to him to plead our 
 cause, to maintain our right, and reckon with those that do us wrong in 
 such a way and manner as he thinks fit and in his own due time: 
 "<I>Wait on the Lord,</I> and attend his pleasure, acquiesce in his 
 will, and he does not say that he will punish him that has injured thee 
 (instead of desiring that thou must forgive him and pray for him), but 
 <I>he will save thee,</I> and that is enough. He will protect thee, so 
 that thy passing by one injury shall not (as is commonly feared) expose 
 thee to another; nay, he will recompense good to thee, to balance thy 
 trouble and encourage thy patience," as David hoped, when Shimei cursed 
 him,

 This is to the same purport with what was said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 1. It is here repeated, because it is a sin that God doubly hates (as 
 lying, which is of the same nature with this sin, is mentioned twice 
 among the seven things that God hates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:17,19"><I>ch.</I> vi. 17, 19</A>),

 and because it was probably a sin very much practised at that time in 
 Israel, and therefore made light of as if there were no harm in it, 
 under pretence that, being commonly used, there was no trading without 
 it.

 2. It is here added, <I>A false balance is not good,</I> to intimate 
 that it is not only abominable to God, but unprofitable to the sinner 
 himself; there is really no good to be got by it, no, not a good 
 bargain, for a bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the

 understand his own way?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught that in all our affairs, 

 1. We have a necessary and constant dependence upon God. All our 
 natural actions depend upon his providence, all our spiritual actions 
 upon his grace. The best man is no better than God makes him; and every 
 creature is that to us which it is the will of God that it should be. 
 Our enterprises succeed, not as we desire and design, but as God 
 directs and disposes. The goings even of a strong man (so the word 
 signifies) <I>are of the Lord,</I> for his strength is weakness without 
 God, nor is the battle always to the strong. 

 2. We have no foresight of future events, and therefore know not how to 
 forecast for them: <I>How can a man understand his own way?</I> How can 
 he tell what will befal him, since God's counsels concerning him are 
 secret, and therefore how can he of himself contrive what to do without 
 divine direction? We so little understand our own way that we know not 
 what is good for ourselves, and therefore we must make a virtue of 
 necessity, and commit our way unto the Lord, in whose hand it is, 
 follow the guidance and submit to the disposal of Providence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  <I>It is</I> a snare to the man <I>who</I> devoureth <I>that which is</I>
 holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things, by which God is greatly affronted, men are here said to be 
 ensnared by, and entangled not only in guilt, but in trouble and ruin 
 at length:--

 1. Sacrilege, men's alienating holy things and converting them to their 
 own use, which is here called <I>devouring</I> them. What is devoted in 
 any way to the service and honour of God, for the support of religion 
 and divine worship or the relief of the poor, ought to be 
 conscientiously preserved to the purposes designed; and those that 
 directly or indirectly embezzle it, or defeat the purpose for which it 
 was given, will have a great deal to answer for. <I>Will a man rob God 
 in tithes and offerings?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8">Mal. iii. 8</A>.

 Those that hurry over religious offices (their praying and preaching) 
 and huddle them up in haste, as being impatient to get done, may be 
 said to <I>devour that which is holy.</I>

 2. Covenant-breaking. <I>It is a snare to a man, after</I> he has made 
 <I>vows</I> to God, to <I>enquire</I> how he may evade them or get 
 dispensed with, and to contrive excuses for the violating of them. If
 the matter of them was doubtful, and the expressions were ambiguous, 
 that was his fault; he should have made them with more caution and 
 consideration, for it will involve his conscience (if it be tender) in 
 great perplexities, if he be to enquire concerning them afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccl. v. 6</A>);

 for, when we have opened our mouth to the Lord, it is too late to think 
 of going back,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What is the business of magistrates. They are to be a terror to 
 evil-doers. They must <I>scatter the wicked,</I> who are linked in 
 confederacies to assist and embolden one another in doing mischief; and 
 there is no doing this but by <I>bringing the wheel over them,</I> that 
 is, putting the laws in execution against them, crushing their power 
 and quashing their projects. Severity must sometimes be used to rid the 
 country of those that are openly vicious and mischievous, debauched and 
 debauching. 

 2. What is the qualification of magistrates, which is necessary in 
 order to do this. They have need to be both pious and prudent, for it 
 is the wise king, who is both religious and discreet, that is likely to 
 effect the suppression of vice and reformation of manners.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  The spirit of man <I>is</I> the candle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, searching all

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the dignity of the soul, the great soul of man, that light 
 which lighteth every man. 

 1. It is a divine light; it is the <I>candle of the Lord,</I> a candle 
 of his lighting, for it is <I>the inspiration of the Almighty</I> that 
 <I>gives us understanding.</I> He <I>forms the spirit of man within 
 him.</I> It is after the image of God that man is created in knowledge. 
 Conscience, that noble faculty, is God's deputy in the soul; it is a 
 candle not only lighted by him, but lighted for him. The Father of 
 spirits is therefore called the <I>Father of lights.</I> 

 2. It is a discovering light. By the help of reason we come to know 
 men, to judge of their characters, and dive into their designs; by the 
 help of conscience we come to know ourselves. The spirit of a man has a 
 self-consciousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:11">1 Cor. ii. 11</A>);

 it searches into the dispositions and affections of the soul, praises 
 what is good, condemns what is otherwise, and judges of the thoughts 
 and intents of the heart. This is the office, this the power, of
 conscience, which we are therefore concerned to get rightly informed 
 and to keep void of offence.</P>

 Here we have, 

 1. The virtues of a good king. Those are <I>mercy and truth,</I> 
 especially mercy, for that is mentioned twice here. He must be strictly 
 faithful to his word, must be sincere, and abhor all dissimulation, 
 must religiously discharge all the trusts reposed in him, must support 
 and countenance truth. He must likewise rule with clemency, and by all 
 acts of compassion gain the affections of his people. <I>Mercy and 
 truth</I> are the glories of God's throne, and kings are called 
 <I>gods.</I> 

 2. The advantages he gains thereby. These virtues will preserve his
 person and support his government, will make him easy and safe, beloved 
 by his own people and feared by his enemies, if it be possible that he 
 should have any.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  The glory of young men <I>is</I> their strength: and the beauty

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that both young and old have their advantages, and therefore 
 must each of them be, according to their capacities, serviceable to the 
 public, and neither of them despise nor envy the other. 

 1. Let not old people despise the young, for they are strong and fit 
 for action, able to go through business and break through difficulties, 
 which the aged and weak cannot grapple with. The <I>glory of young men 
 is their strength,</I> provided they use it well (in the service of God 
 and their country, not of their lusts), and that they be not proud of 
 it nor trust to it. 

 2. Let not young people despise the old, for they are grave, and fit 
 for counsel, and, though they have not the strength that young men 
 have, yet they have more wisdom and experience. <I>Juniores ad
 labores, seniores ad honores</I>--<I>Labour is for the young, honour 
 for the aged.</I> God has put honour upon the old man; for his <I>gray 
 head</I> is his beauty. See

 the inward parts of the belly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Many need severe rebukes. Some children are so obstinate that their 
 parents can do no good with them without sharp correction; some 
 criminals must feel the rigour of the law and public justice; gentle 
 methods will not work upon them; they must be beaten black and blue. 
 And the wise God sees that his own children sometimes need very sharp 
 afflictions. 

 2. Severe rebukes sometimes do a great deal of good, as corrosives 
 contribute to the cure of a wound, eating out the proud flesh. The rod 
 drives out even that foolishness which was bound up in the heart, and 
 cleanses away the evil there. 

 3. Frequently those that most need severe rebukes can worse bear them.
 Such is the corruption of nature that men are as loth to be rebuked 
 sharply for their sins as to be beaten till their bones ache. 
 <I>Correction is grievous to him that forsakes the way,</I> and yet it 
 is good for him,
