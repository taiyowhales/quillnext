 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm was penned, as is supposed, not upon occasion of any
 particular providence, but for the solemnity of a particular ordinance,
 either that of the new-moon in general or that of the feast of trumpets
 on the new moon of the seventh month, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:24,Nu+29:1">Lev.  xxiii. 24; Num. xxix. 1</A>.

 When David, by the Spirit, introduced the singing of psalms into the
 temple-service this psalm was intended for that day, to excite and 
 assist the proper devotions of it. All the psalms are profitable; but, 
 if one psalm be more suitable than another to the day and observances 
 of it, we should choose that. The two great intentions of our religious 
 assemblies, and which we ought to have in our eye in our attendance on 
 them, are answered in this psalm, which are, to give glory to God and 
 to receive instruction from God, to "behold the beauty of the Lord and 
 to enquire in his temple;" accordingly by this psalm we are assisted on 
 our solemn feast days,

 I. In praising God for what he is to his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),

 and has done for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 II. In teaching and admonishing one another concerning the obligations
 we lie under to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),

 the danger of revolting from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>),

 and the happiness we should have if we would but keep close to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 This, though spoken primarily of Israel of old, is written for our 
 learning, and is therefore to be sung with application.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Gittith. <I>A psalm</I> of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise 
 unto the God of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 2  Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
 with the psaltery.
 &nbsp; 3  Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed,
 on our solemn feast day.
 &nbsp; 4  For this <I>was</I> a statute for Israel, <I>and</I> a law of the God
 of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 5  This he ordained in Joseph <I>for</I> a testimony, when he went
 out through the land of Egypt: <I>where</I> I heard a language <I>that</I>
 I understood not.
 &nbsp; 6  I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
 delivered from the pots.
 &nbsp; 7  Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
 thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters
 of Meribah. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the people of God were gathered together in <I>the solemn day, the 
 day of the feast of the Lord,</I> they must be told that they had 
 business to do, for we do not go to church to sleep nor to be idle; no, 
 there is that which the duty of every day requires, work of the day, 
 which is to be done in its day. And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The worshippers of God are excited to their work, and are taught, by 
 singing this psalm, to stir up both themselves and one another to it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 Our errand is, to give unto God the glory due unto his name, and in all
 our religious assemblies we must mind this as our business.

 1. In doing this we must eye God as <I>our strength,</I> and as <I>the 
 God of Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He is the strength of Israel, as a people; for he is a God in covenant
 with them, who will powerfully protect, support, and deliver them, who 
 fights their battles and makes them do valiantly and victoriously. He 
 is the strength of every Israelite; by his grace we are enabled to go 
 through all our services, sufferings, and conflicts; and to him, as our 
 strength, we must pray, and we must sing praise to him as the God of 
 all the wrestling seed of Jacob, with whom we have a spiritual 
 communion. 

 2. We must do this by all the expressions of holy joy and triumph. It 
 was then to be done by musical instruments, the <I>timbrel, harp, and 
 psaltery;</I> and by blowing <I>the trumpet,</I> some think in 
 remembrance of the sound of the trumpet on Mount Sinai, which waxed 
 louder and louder. It was then and is now to be done by singing psalms, 
 singing <I>aloud,</I> and making <I>a joyful noise.</I> The 
 pleasantness of the harp and the awfulness of the trumpet intimate to 
 us that God is to be worshipped with cheerfulness and joy with 
 reverence and godly fear. Singing aloud and making a noise intimate 
 that we must be warm and affectionate in praising God, that we must 
 with a hearty good-will show forth his praise, as those that are not 
 ashamed to own our dependence on him and obligations to him, and that 
 we should join many together in this work; the more the better; it is 
 the more like heaven. 

 3.  This must be done in the time appointed. No time is amiss for
 praising God (<I>Seven times a day will I praise thee;</I> nay, <I>at 
 midnight will I rise and give thanks unto thee</I>); but some are times 
 appointed, not for God to meet us (he is always ready), but for us to 
 meet one another, that we may join together in praising Do. The solemn 
 feast-day must be a day of praise; when we are receiving the gifts of 
 God's bounty, and rejoicing in them, then it is proper to sing his 
 praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are here directed in their work. 

 1. They must look up to the divine institution which it is the
 observation of. In all religious worship we must have an eye to the 
 command 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>This was a statute for Israel,</I> for the keeping up of a face of 
 religion among them; it was <I>a law of the God of Jacob,</I> which all 
 the seed of Jacob are bound by, and must be subject to. Note, Praising 
 God is not only a good thing, which we do well to do, but it is our 
 indispensable duty, which we are obliged to do; it is at our peril if 
 we neglect it; and in all religious exercises we must have an eye to 
 the institution as our warrant and rule: "This I do because God has 
 commanded me; and therefore I hope he will accept me;" then it is done 
 in faith.

 2.  They must look back upon those operations of divine Providence 
 which it is the memorial of. This solemn service was <I>ordained for a 
 testimony</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 a standing traditional evidence, for the attesting of the matters of 
 fact. It was a testimony to Israel, that they might know and remember 
 what God had done for their fathers, and would be a testimony against 
 them if they should be ignorant of them and forget them.

 (1.) The psalmist, in the people's name, puts himself in mind of the 
 general work of God on Israel's behalf, which was kept in remembrance 
 by this and other solemnities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When God went out against the land of Egypt, to lay it waste, that he
 might force Pharaoh to let Israel go, then he ordained solemn 
 feast-days to be observed by a statute for ever in their generations, 
 as a memorial of it, particularly the passover, which perhaps is meant 
 by the <I>solemn feast-day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);
 
 that was appointed just then when God went out through the land of 
 Egypt to destroy the first-born, and passed over the houses of the 
 Israelites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:23,24">Exod. xii. 23, 24</A>.

 By it that work of wonder was to be kept in perpetual remembrance, that
 all ages might in it behold the goodness and severity of God. The 
 psalmist, speaking for his people, takes notice of this aggravating 
 circumstance of their slavery in Egypt that there they heard a language 
 that they understood not; there they were strangers in a strange land. 
 The Egyptians and the Hebrews understood not one another's language; 
 for Joseph spoke to his brethren by an interpreter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:23">Gen. xlii. 23</A>),

 and the Egyptians are said to be to the house of Jacob <I>a people of a 
 strange language,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:1">Ps.  cxiv. 1</A>.

 To make a deliverance appear the more gracious, the more glorious, it
 is good to observe every thing that makes the trouble we are delivered 
 from appear the more grievous. 

 (2.) The psalmist, in God's name, puts the people in mind of some of 
 the particulars of their deliverance.  Here he changes the person, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God speaks by him, saying, <I>I removed the shoulder from the
 burden.</I> Let him remember this on the feast-day,

 [1.] That God had brought them out of the house of bondage, had removed 
 their shoulder from the burden of oppression under which they were 
 ready to sink, <I>had delivered their hands from the pots,</I> or 
 panniers, or baskets, in which they carried clay or bricks. Deliverance 
 out of slavery is a very sensible mercy and one which ought to be had 
 in everlasting remembrance. But this was not all.  

 [2.] God had delivered them at the Red Sea; then they called in 
 trouble, and he rescued them and disappointed the designs of their 
 enemies against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:10">Exod. xiv. 10</A>.

 Then he answered them with a real answer, out of <I>the secret place of
 thunder;</I> that is, out of the pillar of fire, through which God 
 looked upon the host of the Egyptians and troubled it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:24,25">Exod. xiv. 24, 25</A>.

 Or it may be meant of the giving of the law at Mount Sinai, which was
 the secret place, for it was death to gaze

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:21">Exod. xix. 21</A>),

 and it was in thunder that God then spoke. Even the terrors of Sinai
 were favours to Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33">Deut. iv. 33</A>.

 [3.] God had borne their manners in the wilderness: "<I>I proved thee
 at the waters of Meribah;</I> thou didst there show thy temper, what an 
 unbelieving murmuring people thou wast, and yet I continued my favour 
 to thee." <I>Selah--Mark that;</I> compare God's goodness and man's 
 badness, and they will serve as foils to each other. Now if they, on 
 their solemn feast-days, were thus to call to mind their redemption out 
 of Egypt, much more ought we, on the Christian sabbath, to call to mind 
 a more glorious redemption wrought out for us by Jesus Christ from 
 worse than Egyptian bondage, and the many gracious answers he has given 
 to us, notwithstanding our manifold provocations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
 thou wilt hearken unto me;
 &nbsp; 9  There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
 worship any strange god.
 &nbsp; 10  I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which brought thee out of the land
 of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
 &nbsp; 11  But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel
 would none of me.
 &nbsp; 12  So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: <I>and</I> they
 walked in their own counsels.
 &nbsp; 13  Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <I>and</I> Israel had
 walked in my ways!
 &nbsp; 14  I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
 against their adversaries.
 &nbsp; 15  The haters of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> should have submitted themselves unto
 him: but their time should have endured for ever.
 &nbsp; 16  He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat:
 and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, by the psalmist, here speaks to Israel, and in them to us, on whom 
 the ends of the world are come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He demands their diligent and serious attention to what he was about 
 to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Hear, O my people!</I> and who should hear me if my people will 
 not? I have heard and answered thee; now wilt thou hear me?  Hear what 
 is said with the greatest solemnity and the most unquestionable 
 certainty, for it is what <I>I will testify unto thee.</I> Do not only 
 give me the hearing, but <I>hearken unto me,</I> that is, be advised by 
 me, be ruled by me." Nothing could be more reasonably nor more justly 
 expected, and yet God puts an <I>if</I> upon it: "<I>If thou wilt 
 hearken unto me.</I> It is thy interest to do so, and yet it is 
 questionable whether thou wilt or no; for thy neck is an iron 
 sinew."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts them in mind of their obligation to him as the Lord their 
 God and Redeemer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of 
 Egypt;</I> this is the preface to the ten commandments, and a powerful 
 reason for the keeping of them, showing that we are bound to it in 
 duty, interest, and gratitude, all which bonds we break asunder if we 
 be disobedient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives them an abstract both of the precepts and of the promises 
 which he gave them, as the Lord and their God, upon their coming out of 
 Egypt. 

 1. The great command was that they should have no other gods before him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>There shall no strange god be in thee,</I> none besides thy own God. 
 Other gods might well be called strange gods, for it was very strange 
 that ever any people who had the true and living God for their God 
 should hanker after any other. God is jealous in this matter, for he 
 will not suffer his glory to be given to another; and therefore in this 
 matter they must be circumspect,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:13">Exod. xxiii. 13</A>.

 2. The great promise was that God himself, as a God all-sufficient,
 would be nigh unto them in all that which they called upon him for
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>),

 that, if they would adhere to him as their powerful protector and
 ruler, they should always find him their bountiful benefactor: "<I>Open 
 thy mouth wide and I will fill it,</I> as the young ravens that cry 
 open their mouths wide and the old ones fill them." See here, 

 (1.) What is our duty--to raise our expectations from God and enlarge 
 our desires towards him. We cannot look for too little from the 
 creature nor too much from the Creator. We are not straitened in him; 
 why therefore should we be straitened in our own bosoms? 

 (2.) What is God's promise.  I will fill thy mouth with good things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:5">Ps. ciii. 5</A>.

 There is <I>enough in God to fill our treasures</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov.  viii. 21</A>),

 to <I>replenish every hungry soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:25">Jer. xxxi. 25</A>),

 to supply all our wants, to answer all our desires, and to make us
 completely happy. The pleasures of sense will surfeit and never satisfy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2">Isa.  lv. 2</A>);

 divine pleasures will satisfy and never surfeit. And we may have enough
 from God if we pray for it in faith. <I>Ask, and it shall be given 
 you.</I> He <I>gives liberally, and upbraids not.</I> God assured his 
 people Israel that it would be their own fault if he did not do as 
 great and kind things for them as he had done for their fathers.  
 Nothing should be thought too good, too much, to give them, if they 
 would but keep close to God. He <I>would moreover have given them such 
 and such things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:8">2 Sam. xii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He charges them with a high contempt of his authority as their 
 lawgiver and his grace and favour as their benefactor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He had done much for them, and designed to do more; but all in vain:
 "<I>My people would not hearken to my voice,</I> but turned a deaf ear 
 to all I said." Two things he complains of:--

 1. Their disobedience to his commands. They did hear his voice, so as
 never any people did; but they would not hearken to it, they would not 
 be ruled by it, neither by the law nor by the reason of it.

 2. Their dislike of his covenant-relation to them: <I>They would none 
 of me. They acquiesced not in my word</I> (so the Chaldee); God was 
 willing to be to them a God, but they were not willing to be to him a 
 people; they did not like his terms.  "I would have gathered them, but 
 they would not." They had none of him; and why had they not? It was not 
 because they might not; they were fairly invited into covenant with 
 God. It was not because they could not; for the word was nigh them, 
 even in their mouth and in their heart. But it was purely because they 
 would not. God calls them hi people, for they were bought by him, bound 
 to him, his by a thousand ties, and yet even they had not hearkened, 
 had not obeyed. "Israel, the seed of Jacob my friend, set me at nought, 
 and <I>would</I> have <I>none of me.</I>" Note, All the wickedness of 
 the wicked world is owing to the wilfulness of the wicked will. The 
 reason why people are not religious is because they will not be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He justifies himself with this in the spiritual judgments he had 
 brought upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lusts,</I> which would be 
 more dangerous enemies and more mischievous oppressors to them than any 
 of the neighbouring nations ever were. God withdrew his Spirit from 
 them, took off the bridle of restraining grace, left them to 
 themselves, and justly; they will do as they will, and therefore let 
 them do as they will. <I>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</I> 
 It is a righteous thing with God to give those up to their own hearts' 
 lusts that indulge them, and give up themselves to be led by them; for 
 why should his Spirit always strive? His grace is his own, and he is 
 debtor to no man, and yet, as he never gave his grace to any that could 
 say they deserved it, so he never took it away from any but such as had 
 first forfeited it: <I>They would none of me, so I gave them up;</I> 
 let them take their course. And see what follows: <I>They walked in 
 their own counsels,</I> in the way of their heart and in the sight of 
 their eye, both in their worships and in their conversations.  "I left 
 them to do as they would, and then they did all that was ill;" they 
 walked in their own counsels, and not according to the counsels of God 
 and his advice. God therefore was not the author of their sin; he left 
 them to the lusts of their own hearts and the counsels of their own 
 heads; if they do not well, the blame must lie upon their own hearts 
 and the blood upon their own heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He testifies his good-will to them in wishing they had done well 
 for themselves. He saw how sad their case was, and how sure their ruin, 
 when they were delivered up to their own lusts; that is worse than 
 being given up to Satan, which may be in order to reformation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:20">1 Tim. i. 20</A>)

 and to salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5">1 Cor. v. 5</A>);

 but to be delivered up to their own hearts' lusts is to be sealed under
 condemnation. <I>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</I> What
 fatal precipices will not these hurry a man to!  Now here God looks
 upon them with pity, and shows that it was with reluctance that he thus
 abandoned them to their folly and fate. <I>How shall I give thee up,
 Ephraim?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,9">Hos. xi. 8, 9</A>.

 So here, <I>O that my people had hearkened!</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:18">Isa. xlviii. 18</A>.

 Thus Christ lamented the obstinacy of Jerusalem. <I>If thou hadst 
 known,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:42">Luke  xix. 42</A>.
 
 The expressions here are very affecting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>),

 designed to show how unwilling God is that any should perish and 
 desirous that all should come to repentance (he delights not in the 
 ruin of sinful persons or nations), and also what enemies sinners are 
 to themselves and what an aggravation it will be of their misery that 
 they might have been happy upon such easy terms. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great mercy God had in store for his people, and which he would 
 have wrought for them if they had been obedient. 

 (1.) He would have given them victory over their enemies and would soon 
 have completed the reduction of them. They should not only have kept 
 their ground, but have gained their point, against the remaining 
 Canaanites, and their encroaching vexatious neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I should have subdued their enemies;</I> and it is God only that is 
 to be depended on for the subduing of our enemies. Not would had have 
 put them to the expense and fatigue of a tedious war: he would 
 <I>soon</I> have done it; for he would have <I>turned his hand against 
 their adversaries,</I> and then they would not have been able to stand 
 before them. It intimates how easily he would have done it and without 
 any difficulty. With the turn of a hand, nay, <I>with the breath of his 
 mouth, shall he slay the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4">Isa. xi. 4</A>.

 If he but turn his hand, the <I>haters of the Lord will submit
 themselves to him</I>

 and, though they are not brought to love him, yet they shall be made to 
 fear him and to confess that he is too hard for them and that it is in 
 vain to contend with him. God is honoured, and so is his Israel, by the 
 submission of those that have been in rebellion against them, though it 
 be but a forced and feigned submission.

 (2.) He would have confirmed and perpetuated their posterity, and 
 established it upon sure and lasting foundations. In spite of all the 
 attempts of their enemies against them, <I>their time should have 
 endured for ever,</I> and they should never have been disturbed in the 
 possession of the good land God had given them, much less evicted and 
 turned out of possession. 

 (3.) He would have given them great plenty of all good things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>He should have fed them with the finest of the wheat,</I> with the
 best grain and the best of the kind. Wheat was the staple commodity of 
 Canaan, and they exported a great deal of it,

 He would not only have provided for them the best sort of bread, but
 <I>with honey out of the rock would he have satisfied them.</I> Besides 
 the precious products of the fruitful soil, that there might not be a 
 barren spot in all their land, even the clefts of the rock should serve 
 for bee-hives and in them they should find honey in abundance. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13,14">Deut. xxxii. 13, 14</A>.

 In short, God designed to make them every way easy and happy.</P>

 2. The duty God required from them as the condition of all this mercy. 
 He expected no more than that they should <I>hearken to him,</I> as a 
 scholar to his teacher, to receive his instructions--as a servant to his
 master, to receive his commands; and that they should <I>walk in his 
 ways,</I> those ways of the Lord which are right and pleasant, that 
 they should observe the institutions of his ordinances and attend the 
 intimations of his providence. There was nothing unreasonable in 
 this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Observe how the reason of the withholding of the mercy is laid in 
 their neglect of the duty: If they had <I>hearkened to me, I would soon 
 have subdued their enemies.</I> National sin or disobedience is the 
 great and only thing that retards and obstructs national deliverance. 
 <I>When I would have healed Israel,</I> and set every thing to-rights
 among them, then <I>the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered,</I> and so 
 a stop was put to the cure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1">Hos. vii. 1</A>.

 We are apt to say, "If such a method had been taken, such an instrument
 employed, we should soon have subdued our enemies:" but we mistake; if 
 we had hearkened to God, and kept to our duty, the thing would have 
 been done, but it is sin that makes our troubles long and salvation 
 slow. And this is that which God himself complains of, and wishes it 
 had been otherwise. Note, <I>Therefore</I> God would have us do our 
 duty to him, that we may be qualified to receive favour from him. He 
 delights in our serving him, not because he is the better for it, but 
 because we shall be.</P>
