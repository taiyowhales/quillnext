 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though David penned this psalm upon a very particular occasion, yet, it 
 is of as general use as any of David's psalms; it is the most eminent 
 of the penitential psalms, and most expressive of the cares and desires 
 of a repenting sinner. It is a pity indeed that in our devout addresses 
 to God we should have any thing else to do than to praise God, for that 
 is the work of heaven; but we make other work for ourselves by our own 
 sins and follies: we must come to the throne of grace in the posture of 
 penitents, to confess our sins and sue for the grace of God; and, if 
 therein we would take with us words, we can nowhere find any more 
 apposite than in this psalm, which is the record of David's repentance 
 for his sin in the matter of Uriah, which was the greatest blemish upon 
 his character: all the rest of his faults were nothing to this; it is 
 said of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:5">1 Kings xv. 5</A>),

 That "he turned not aside from the commandment of the Lord all the days
 of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." In this 
 psalm,

 I. He confesses his sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 II. He prays earnestly for the pardon of his sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1,2,7,9">ver. 1, 2, 7, 9</A>.

 III. For peace of conscience,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8,12">ver. 8, 12</A>.

 IV. For grace to go and sin no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:10,11,14">ver. 10, 11, 14</A>.

 V. For liberty of access to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:15">ver. 15</A>.

 IV. He promises to do what he could for the good of the souls of
 others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:13">
 ver. 13</A>)

 and for the glory of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:16,17,19">ver. 16, 17, 19</A>.

 And, lastly, concludes with a prayer for Zion and Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:18">ver. 18</A>.
 
 Those whose consciences charge them with any gross sin should, with a 
 believing regard to Jesus Christ, the Mediator, again and again pray 
 over this psalm; nay, though we have not been guilty of adultery and 
 murder, or any the like enormous crime, yet in singing it, and praying 
 over it, we may very sensibly apply it all to ourselves, which if we do 
 with suitable affections we shall, through Christ, find mercy to pardon 
 and grace for seasonable help.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet
 <BR>came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Have
 mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according
 unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
 transgressions.
 &nbsp; 2  Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
 sin.
 &nbsp; 3  For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin <I>is</I> ever
 before me.
 &nbsp; 4  Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done <I>this</I> evil
 in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
 <I>and</I> be clear when thou judgest.
 &nbsp; 5  Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
 conceive me.
 &nbsp; 6  Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
 hidden <I>part</I> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title has reference to a very sad story, that of David's fall. But, 
 though he fell, he was not utterly cast down, for God graciously upheld 
 him and raised him up. 

 1. The sin which, in this psalm, he laments, was the folly and
 wickedness he committed with his neighbour's wife, a sin not to be 
 spoken of, nor thought of, without detestation. His debauching of 
 Bathsheba was the inlet to all the other sins that followed; it was as 
 the letting forth of water. This sin of David's is recorded for warning 
 to all, that he who thinks he stands may take heed lest he fall. 

 2. The repentance which, in this psalm, he expresses, he was brought to
 by the ministry of Nathan, who was sent of God to convince him of his 
 sin, after he had continued above nine months (for aught that appears) 
 without any particular expressions of remorse and sorrow for it. But 
 though God may suffer his people to fall into sin, and to lie a great 
 while in it, yet he will, by some means or other, recover them to 
 repentance, bring them to himself and to their right mind again.
 Herein, generally, he uses the ministry of the word, which yet he is 
 not tied to. But those that have been overtaken in any fault ought to 
 reckon a faithful reproof the greatest kindness that can be done them
 and a wise reprover their best friend. <I>Let the righteous smite me, 
 and it shall be excellent oil.</I> 

 3. David, being convinced of his sin, poured out his soul to God in 
 prayer for mercy and grace. Whither should backsliding children
 return, but to the Lord their God, from whom they have backslidden, and 
 who alone can heal their backslidings?

 4. He drew up, by divine inspiration, the workings of his heart towards
 God, upon this occasion, into a psalm, that it might be often repeated, 
 and long after reviewed; and this he committed to the chief musician, 
 to be sung in the public service of the church.

 (1.) As a profession of his own repentance, which he would have to be 
 generally taken notice of, his sin having been notorious, that the 
 plaster might be as wide as the wound. Those that truly repent of their 
 sins will not be ashamed to own their repentance; but, having lost the 
 honour of innocents, they will rather covet the honour of penitents. 
 
 (2.) As a pattern to others, both to bring them to repentance by his
 example and to instruct them in their repentance what to do and what to
 say. Being converted himself, he thus <I>strengthens his brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>),
 
 and <I>for this cause he obtained mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:16">1 Tim. i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David's humble petition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 His prayer is much the same with that which our Saviour puts into the
 mouth of his penitent publican in the parable: <I>God be merciful to me 
 a sinner!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Luke xviii. 13</A>.

 David was, upon many accounts, a man of great merit; he had not only
 done much, but suffered much, in the cause of God; and yet, when he is 
 convinced of sin, he does not offer to balance his evil deeds with his 
 good deeds, nor can he think that his services will atone for his 
 offences; but he flies to God's infinite mercy, and depends upon that 
 only for pardon and peace: <I>Have mercy upon me, O God!</I> He owns 
 himself obnoxious to God's justice, and therefore casts himself upon 
 his mercy; and it is certain that the best man in the world will be 
 undone if God be not merciful to him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his plea is for this mercy: "<I>have mercy upon me, O God!</I> 
 not according to the dignity of my birth, as descended from the prince 
 of the tribe of Judah, not according to my public services as Israel's 
 champion, or my public honours as Israel's king;" his plea is not, 
 <I>Lord, remember David and all his afflictions, how he vowed to build 
 a place for the ark</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:1,2">Ps. cxxxii. 1, 2</A>);

 a true penitent will make no mention of any such thing; but "Have mercy
 upon me for mercy's sake. I have nothing to plead with thee but," 

 (1.) "The freeness of thy mercy, according to thy lovingkindness, thy 
 clemency, the goodness of thy nature, which inclines thee to pity the 
 miserable." 

 (2.) "The fulness of thy mercy. There are in thee not only 
 lovingkindness and tender mercies, but abundance of them, a multitude 
 of tender mercies for the forgiveness of many sinners, of many sins, to 
 multiply pardons as we multiply transgressions."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the particular mercy that he begs--the pardon of sin. <I>Blot
 out my transgressions,</I> as a debt is blotted or crossed out of the 
 book, when either the debtor has paid it or the creditor has remitted 
 it. "Wipe out my transgressions, that they may not appear to demand 
 judgment against me, nor stare me in the face to my confusion and 
 terror." The blood of Christ, sprinkled upon the conscience, to purify 
 and pacify that, blots out the transgression, and, having reconciled us 
 to God, reconciles up to ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "<I>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity;</I> wash my soul from the
 guilt and stain of my sin by thy mercy and grace, for it is only from a 
 ceremonial pollution that the water of separation will avail to cleanse 
 me. Multiple to wash me; the stain is deep, for I have lain long 
 soaking in the guilt, so that it will not easily be got out. O wash me 
 much, wash me thoroughly. <I>Cleanse me from my sin.</I>" Sin defiles
 us, renders us odious in the sight of the holy God, and uneasy to 
 ourselves; it unfits us for communion with God in grace or glory. When 
 God pardons sin he cleanses us from it, so that we become acceptable to 
 him, easy to ourselves, and have liberty of access to him. Nathan had 
 assured David, upon his first profession of repentance, that his win 
 was pardoned. <I>The Lord has taken away thy sin; thou shalt not 
 die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:13">2 Sam. xii. 13</A>.

 Yet he prays, <I>Wash me, cleanse, blot out my transgressions;</I> for
 God will be sought unto even for that which he has promised; and those 
 whose sins are pardoned must pray that the pardon may be more and more 
 cleared up to them. God had forgiven him, but he could not forgive 
 himself; and therefore he is thus importunate for pardon, as one that 
 thought himself unworthy of it and knew how to value it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's penitential confessions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was very free to own his guilt before God: <I>I acknowledge my 
 transgressions;</I> this he had formerly found the only way of easing 
 his conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:4,5">Ps. xxxii. 4, 5</A>.

 Nathan said, <I>Thou art the man. I am,</I> says David; <I>I have
 sinned.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had such a deep sense of it that the was continually thinking of 
 it with sorrow and shame. His contrition for his sin was not a slight 
 sudden passion, but an abiding grief: "<I>My sin is ever before me,</I> 
 to humble me and mortify me, and make me continually blush and tremble. 
 It is <I>ever against me</I>" (so some); "I see it before me as an 
 enemy, accusing and threatening me." David was, upon all occasions, put 
 in mind of his sin, and was willing to be so, for his further abasement.
 He never walked on the roof of his house without a penitent reflection 
 on his unhappy walk there when thence he saw Bathsheba; he never lay 
 down to sleep without a sorrowful thought of the bed of his 
 uncleanness, never sat down to meat, never sent his servant on an 
 errand, or took his pen in hand, but it put him in mind of his making 
 Uriah drunk, the treacherous message he sent by him, and the fatal 
 warrant he wrote and signed for his execution. Note, The acts of 
 repentance, even for the same sin, must be often repeated. It will be 
 of good use for us to have our sins ever before us, that by the 
 remembrance of our past sins we may be kept humble, may be armed 
 against temptation, quickened to duty, and made patient under the 
 cross.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He confesses his actual transgressions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned.</I> David was a very great 
 man, and yet, having done amiss, submits to the discipline of a 
 penitent, and thinks not his royal dignity will excuse him from it. 
 Rich and poor must here meet together; there is one law of repentance 
 for both; the greatest must be judged shortly, and therefore must judge 
 themselves now. David was a very good man, and yet, having sinned, he 
 willingly accommodates himself to the place and posture of a penitent. 
 The best men, if they sin, should give the best example of repentance.

 [1.] His confession is particular; "<I>I have done this evil,</I> this 
 that I am now reproved for, this that my own conscience now upbraids me 
 with." Note, It is good to be particular in the confession of sin, that 
 we may be the more express in praying for pardon, and so may have the 
 more comfort in it. We ought to reflect upon the particular heads of
 our sins of infirmity and the particular circumstances of our gross 
 sins. 

 [2.] He aggravates the sin which he confesses and lays a load upon 
 himself for it: <I>Against thee, and in thy sight.</I> Hence our 
 Saviour seems to borrow the confession which he puts into the mouth of 
 the returning prodigal: <I>I have sinned against heaven, and before 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:18">Luke xv. 18</A>.

 Two things David laments in his sin:--<I>First,</I> That it was
 committed against God. To him the affront is given, and he is the party
 wronged. It is his truth that by wilful sin we deny, his conduct that
 we despise, his command that we disobey, his promise that we distrust,
 his name that we dishonour, and it is with him that we deal deceitfully
 and disingenuously. From this topic Joseph fetched the great argument
 against sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:9">Gen. xxxix. 9</A>),

 and David here the great aggravation of it: <I>Against thee only.</I>
 Some make this to intimate the prerogative of his crown, that, as a 
 king, he was not accountable to any but God; but it is more agreeable 
 to his present temper to suppose that it expresses the deep contrition 
 of his soul for his sin, and that it was upon right grounds. He here 
 sinned against Bathsheba and Uriah, against his own soul, and body, and 
 family, against his kingdom, and against the church of God, and all 
 this helped to humble him; but none of these were sinned against so as 
 God was, and therefore this he lays the most sorrowful accent upon: 
 <I>Against thee only have I sinned. Secondly,</I> That it was
 committed in God's sight. "This not only proves it upon me, but renders 
 it exceedingly sinful." This should greatly humble us for all our sins, 
 that they have been committed under the eye of God, which argues either 
 a disbelief of his omniscience or a contempt of his justice. 

 [3.] He justifies God in the sentence passed upon him--that <I>the 
 sword should never depart from his house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:10">2 Sam. xii. 10, 11</A>.

 He is very forward to own his sin, and aggravate it, not only that he
 might obtain the pardon of it himself, but that by his confession he 
 might give honour to God. <I>First,</I> That God might be justified in 
 the threatenings he had spoken by Nathan. "Lord, I have nothing to say 
 against the justice of them; I deserve what is threatened, and a 
 thousand times worse." Thus Eli acquiesced in the like threatenings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:18">1 Sam. iii. 18</A>),
 
 <I>It is the Lord.</I> And Hezekiah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:19">2 Kings xx. 19</A>),

 <I>Good is the word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken. Secondly,</I>
 That God might be clear when he judged, that is, when he executed those 
 threatenings. David published his confession of sin that when hereafter 
 he should come into trouble none might say God had done him any wrong; 
 for he owns the Lord is righteous: thus will all true penitents justify 
 God by condemning themselves. <I>Thou art just in all that is brought 
 upon us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He confesses his original corruption 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity.</I> He does not call upon God to 
 behold it, but upon himself. "Come, my soul, look unto the rock out of 
 which I was hewn, and thou wilt find I was shapen in iniquity. Had I 
 duly considered this before, I find I should not have made so bold with 
 the temptation, nor have ventured among the sparks with such tinder in 
 my heart; and so the sin might have been prevented. Let me consider it 
 now, not to excuse or extenuate the sin--<I>Lord, I did so; but indeed 
 I could not help it, my inclination led me to it</I>" (for as that plea 
 is false, with due care and watchfulness, and improvement of the grace 
 of God, he might have helped it, so it is what a true penitent never 
 offers to put in), "but let me consider it rather as an aggravation of 
 the sin: Lord, I have not only been guilty of adultery and murder, but 
 I have an adulterous murderous nature; therefore I abhor myself." David 
 elsewhere speaks of the admirable structure of his body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:14,15">Ps. cxxxix. 14, 15</A>);

 it was <I>curiously wrought;</I> and yet here he says it was shapen in
 iniquity, sin was twisted in with it; not as it came out of God's 
 hands, but as it comes through our parents' loins. He elsewhere speaks 
 of the piety of his mother, that she was God's handmaid, and he pleads 
 his relation to her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16,86:16">Ps. cxvi. 16, lxxxvi. 16</A>),

 and yet here he says <I>she conceived him in sin;</I> for though she
 was, by grace, a child of God, she was, by nature, a daughter of Eve, 
 and not excepted from the common character. Note, It is to be sadly 
 lamented by every one of us that we brought into the world with us a 
 corrupt nature, wretchedly degenerated from its primitive purity and 
 rectitude; we have from our birth the snares of sin in our bodies, the 
 seeds of sin in our souls, and a stain of sin upon both. This is what 
 we call <I>original sin,</I> because it is as ancient as our original, 
 and because it is the original of all our actual transgressions. This 
 is that foolishness which is bound in the heart of a child, that 
 proneness of evil and backwardness to good which is the burden of the 
 regenerate and the ruin of the unregenerate; it is a bent to backslide 
 from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David's acknowledgment of the grace of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 both his good-will towards us ("<I>thou desirest truth in the inward 
 parts,</I> thou wouldst have us all honest and sincere, and true to our 
 profession") and his good work in us--"<I>In the hidden part thou hast
 made,</I>" or shalt make, "<I>me to know wisdom.</I>" Note,

 1. Truth and wisdom will go very far towards making a man a good man. A
 clear head and a sound heart (prudence and sincerity) bespeak the man 
 of God perfect. 

 2. What God requires of us he himself works in us, and he works it in
 the regular way, enlightening the mind, and so gaining the will. But 
 how does this come in here?

 (1.) God is hereby justified and cleared: "Lord, thou was not the 
 author of my sin; there is no blame to be laid upon thee; but I alone 
 must bear it; for thou has many a time admonished me to be sincere, and 
 hast made me to know that which, if I had duly considered it, would 
 have prevented my falling into this sin; had I improved the grace thou 
 hast given me, I should have kept my integrity." 

 (2.) The sin is hereby aggravated: "Lord, thou desirest truth; but 
 where was it when I dissembled with Uriah? <I>Thou hast made me to know 
 wisdom;</I> but I have not lived up to what I have known." 

 (3.) He is hereby encouraged, in his repentance, to hope that God would 
 graciously accept him; for,

 [1.] God had made him sincere in his resolutions never to return to 
 folly again: <I>Thou desirest truth in the inward part;</I> this is 
 that which God has an eye to in a returning sinner, that <I>in his 
 spirit there be no guile,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:2">Ps. xxxii. 2</A>.

 David was conscious to himself of the uprightness of his heart towards
 God in his repentance, and therefore doubted not but God would accept 
 him. 

 [2.] He hoped that God would enable him to make good his resolutions, 
 that in the hidden part, in the new man, which is called the <I>hidden 
 man of the heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>),

 he would make him to know wisdom, so as to discern and avoid the
 designs of the tempter another time. Some read it as a prayer: "Lord, 
 in this instance, I have done foolishly; for the future make me to know 
 wisdom." Where there is truth God will give wisdom; those that 
 sincerely endeavour to do their duty shall be taught their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here what David prays for. Many excellent petitions he here puts 
 up, to which if we do but add, "for Christ's sake," they are as 
 evangelical as any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays that God would cleanse him from his sins and the defilement 
 he had contracted by them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Purge me with hyssop;</I> that is, pardon my sins, and let me know 
 that they are pardoned, that I may be restored to those privileges 
 which by sin I have forfeited and lost." The expression here alludes to 
 a ceremonial distinction, that of cleansing the leper, or those that 
 were unclean by the touch of a body by sprinkling water, or blood, or 
 both upon them with a bunch of hyssop, by which they were, at length, 
 discharged from the restraints they were laid under by their pollution. 
 "Lord, let me be as well assured of my restoration to thy favour, and 
 to the privilege of communion with thee, as they were thereby assured 
 of their re-admission to their former privileges." But it is founded 
 upon gospel-grace: <I>Purge me with hyssop,</I> that is, with the blood 
 of Christ applied to my soul by a lively faith, as water of 
 purification was sprinkled with a bunch of hyssop. It is the blood of 
 Christ (which is therefore called <I>the blood of sprinkling,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>),

 that purges the conscience from dead works, from that guilt of sin and
 dread of God which shut us out of communion with him, as the touch of a 
 dead body, under the law, shut a man out from the courts of God's 
 house. If this blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin, cleanse us 
 from our sin, then we shall be clean indeed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:2">Heb. x. 2</A>.

 If we be washed in this fountain opened, we shall be whiter than snow,
 not only acquitted but accepted; so those are that are justified.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>,

 <I>Though your sins have been as scarlet, they shall be white as 
 snow.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prays that, his sins being pardoned, he might have the comfort of 
 that pardon. He asks not to be comforted till first he is cleansed; but 
 if sin, the bitter root of sorrow, be taken away, he can pray in faith, 
 "<I>Make me to hear joy and gladness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that is, let me have a well-grounded peace, of thy creating, thy 
 speaking, so that the bones which thou hast broken by convictions and 
 threatenings may rejoice, may not only be set again, and eased from the 
 pain, but may be sensibly comforted, and, as the prophet speaks, may 
 flourish as a herb." Note,

 (1.) The pain of a heart truly broken for sin may well be compared to 
 that of a broken bone; and it is the same Spirit who as a Spirit of 
 bondage smites and wounds and as a Spirit of adoption heals and binds 
 up. 

 (2.) The comfort and joy that arise from a sealed pardon to a penitent 
 sinner are as refreshing as perfect ease from the most exquisite pain. 
 
 (3.) It is God's work, not only to speak this joy and gladness, but to 
 make us hear it and take the comfort of it. He earnestly desires that 
 God would lift up the light of his countenance upon him, and so put 
 gladness into his heart, that he would not only be reconciled to him, 
 but, which is a further act of grace, let him know that he was so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He prays for a complete and effectual pardon. This is that which he 
 is most earnest for as the foundation of his comfort 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Hide thy face from my sins,</I> that is, be not provoked by them to 
 deal with me as I deserve; they are ever before me, let them be cast 
 behind thy back. <I>Blot out all my iniquities</I> out of the book of 
 thy account; blot them out, as a cloud is blotted out and dispelled by 
 the beams of the sun,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22">Isa. xliv. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He prays for sanctifying grace; and this every true penitent is as 
 earnest for as for pardon and peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He does not pray, "Lord, preserve me my reputation," as Saul, <I>I have
 sinned, yet honour me before this people.</I> No; his great concern is 
 to get his corrupt nature changed: the sin he had been guilty of was,

 (1.) An evidence of its impurity, and therefore he prays, <I>Create in 
 me a clean heart, O God!</I> He now saw, more than ever, what an 
 unclean heart he had, and sadly laments it, but sees it is not in his 
 own power to amend it, and therefore begs of God (whose prerogative it 
 is to create) that he would create in him a clean heart. He only that 
 made the heart can new-make it; and to his power nothing is impossible. 
 He created the world by the word of his power as the God of nature, and 
 it is by the word of his power as the God of grace that <I>we are 
 clean</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3">John xv. 3</A>),

 that we <I>are sanctified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John xvii. 17</A>.

 (2.) It was the cause of its disorder, and undid much of the good work
 that had been wrought in him; and therefore he prays, "<I>Lord, renew a 
 right spirit within me;</I> repair the decays of spiritual strength 
 which this sin has been the cause of, and set me to rights again." 
 Renew a <I>constant</I> spirit within me, so some. He had, in this 
 matter, discovered much inconstancy and inconsistency with himself, and 
 therefore he prays, "Lord, fix me for the time to come, that I may 
 never in like manner depart from thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He prays for the continuance of God's good-will towards him and the
 progress of his good work in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (1.) That he might never be shut out from God's favour: "<I>Cast me not 
 away from thy presence,</I> as one whom thou abhorrest and canst not 
 endure to look upon." He prays that he might not be thrown out of God's 
 protection, but that wherever he went, he might have the divine 
 presence with him, might be under the guidance of his wisdom and in the 
 custody of his power, and that he might not be forbidden communion with 
 God: "Let me not be banished thy courts, but always have liberty of 
 access to thee by prayer." He does not deprecate the temporal judgments 
 which God by Nathan had threatened to bring upon him. "God's will be 
 done; but, Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath. If the sword come into my
 house never to depart from it, yet let me have a God to go to in my 
 distresses, and all shall be well." 

 (2.) That he might never be deprived of God's grace: <I>Take not thy 
 Holy Spirit from me.</I> He knew he had by his sin grieved the Spirit 
 and provoked him to withdraw, and that because he also was flesh God
 might justly have said that his Spirit should no more strive with him 
 nor work upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 This he dreads more than any thing. We are undone if God take his Holy
 Spirit from us. Saul was a sad instance of this. How exceedingly 
 sinful, how exceedingly miserable, was he, when the Spirit of the Lord 
 had departed from him! David knew it, and therefore begs thus 
 earnestly: "Lord, whatever thou take from me, my children, my crown, my 
 life, yet <I>take not thy Holy Spirit from me</I>" (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:15">2 Sam. vii. 15</A>),

 "but continue thy Holy Spirit with me, to perfect the work of my
 repentance, to prevent my relapse into sin, and to enable me to 
 discharge my duty both as a prince and as a psalmist."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He prays for the restoration of divine comforts and the perpetual
 communications of divine grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 David finds two ill effects of his sin:--

 (1.) It had made him sad, and therefore he prays, <I>Restore unto me 
 the joy of thy salvation.</I> A child of God knows no true nor solid 
 joy but the joy of God's salvation, joy in God his Saviour and in the 
 hope of eternal life. By wilful sin we forfeit this joy and deprive 
 ourselves of it; our evidences cannot but be clouded and our hopes 
 shaken. When we give ourselves so much cause to doubt of our interest 
 in the salvation, how can we expect the joy of it? But, when we truly 
 repent, we may pray and hope that God will restore to us those joys.
 Those that sow in penitential tears shall reap in the joys of God's 
 salvation when the times of refreshing shall come. 

 (2.) It had made him weak, and therefore he prays, "<I>Uphold me with 
 the free Spirit:</I> I am ready to fall, either into sin or into 
 despair; Lord, sustain me; my own spirit" (though the spirit of a man 
 will go far towards the sustaining of his infirmity) "is not 
 sufficient; if I be left to myself, I shall certainly sink; therefore 
 uphold me with thy Spirit, let him counterwork the evil spirit that 
 would cast me down from my excellency. Thy Spirit is a free spirit, a 
 free agent himself, working freely" (and that makes those free whom he
 works upon, for where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty)--"thy 
 ingenuous princely Spirit." He was conscious to himself of having 
 acted, in the matter of Uriah, very disingenuously and unlike a prince; 
 his behaviour was base and paltry: "Lord," says he, "let thy Spirit 
 inspire my soul with noble and generous principles, that I may always 
 act as becomes me." A free spirit will be a firm and fixed spirit, and 
 will uphold us. The more cheerful we are in our duty the more constant 
 we shall be to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See what David here promises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What good work he promises to do: <I>I will teach transgressors thy 
 ways.</I> David had been himself a transgressor, and therefore could 
 speak experimentally to transgressors, and resolves, having himself 
 found mercy with God in the way of repentance, to teach others God's 
 ways, that is, 

 (1.) Our way to God by repentance; he would teach others that had 
 sinned to take the same course that he had taken, to humble themselves, 
 to confess their sins, and seek God's face; and, 

 (2.) God's way towards us in pardoning mercy; how ready he is to 
 receive those that return to him. He taught the former by his own 
 example, for the direction of sinners in repenting; he taught the 
 latter by his own experience, for their encouragement. By this psalm he 
 is, and will be to the world's end, teaching transgressors, telling 
 them what God had done for his soul. Note, Penitents should be 
 preachers. Solomon was so, and blessed Paul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What good effect he promises himself from his doing this: 
 "<I>Sinners shall be converted unto thee,</I> and shall neither persist 
 in their wanderings from thee, nor despair of finding mercy in their 
 returns to thee." The great thing to be aimed at in teaching 
 transgressors is their conversion to God; that is a happy point gained, 
 and happy are those that are instrumental to contribute towards it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David prays against the guilt of sin, and prays for the grace of 
 God, enforcing both petitions from a plea taken from the glory of God, 
 which he promises with thankfulness to show forth. 

 1. He prays against the guilt of sin, that he might be delivered from
 that, and promises that then he would praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The particular sin he prays against is blood-guiltiness, the sin he had
 now been guilty of, having slain Uriah with the sword of the children 
 of Ammon. Hitherto perhaps he had stopped the mouth of conscience with
 that frivolous excuse, that he did not kill him himself; but now he was 
 convinced that he was the murderer, and, hearing the blood cry to God 
 for vengeance, he cries to God for mercy: "<I>Deliver me from 
 blood-guiltiness;</I> let me not lie under the guilt of this kind which 
 I have contracted, but let it be pardoned to me, and let me never be 
 left to myself to contract the like guilt again." Note, It concerns us 
 all to pray earnestly against the guilt of blood. In this prayer he 
 eyes God as the God of salvation. Note, Those to whom God is the God
 of salvation he will deliver from guilt; for the salvation he is the 
 God of is salvation from sin. We may therefore plead this with him, 
 "Lord, thou art the God of my salvation, therefore deliver me from the 
 dominion of sin." He promises that, if God would deliver him, <I>his 
 tongue should sing aloud of his righteousness;</I> God should have the 
 glory both of pardoning mercy and of preventing grace. God's 
 righteousness is often put for his grace, especially in the great 
 business of justification and sanctification. This he would comfort 
 himself in and therefore sing of; and this he would endeavour both to 
 acquaint and to affect others with; he would <I>sing aloud</I> of it.
 This all those should do that have had the benefit of it, and owe their 
 all to it.

 2. He prays for the grace of God and promises to improve that grace to
 his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>O Lord! open thou my lips,</I> not only that I may teach and 
 instruct sinners" (which the best preacher cannot do to any purpose 
 unless God give him the opening of the mouth, and the tongue of the 
 learned), "but <I>that my mouth may show forth thy praise,</I> not only 
 that I may have abundant matter for praise, but a heart enlarged in 
 praise." Guilt had closed his lips, had gone near to stop the mouth of 
 prayer; he could not for shame, he could not for fear, come into the 
 presence of that God whom he knew he had offended, much less speak to 
 him; his heart condemned him, and therefore he had little confidence 
 towards God. It cast a damp particularly upon his praises; when he had 
 lost the joys of his salvation his harp was hung upon the willow-trees; 
 therefore he prays, "<I>Lord, open my life,</I> put my heart in tune 
 for praise again." To those that are tongue-tied by reason of guilt the 
 assurance of the forgiveness of their sins says effectually, 
 <I>Ephphatha--Be opened;</I> and, when the lips are opened, what should 
 they speak but the praises of God, as Zacharias did?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:64">Luke i. 64</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David offers the sacrifice of a penitent contrite heart, as that 
 which he knew God would be pleased with. 

 1. He knew well that the sacrificing of beasts was in itself of no
 account with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Thou desirest not sacrifice (else would I give it</I> with all my 
 heart to obtain pardon and peace); <I>thou delightest not in 
 burnt-offering.</I> Here see how glad David would have been to give 
 thousands of rams to make atonement for sin. Those that are thoroughly 
 convinced of their misery and danger by reason of sin would spare no 
 cost to obtain the remission of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7">Mic. vi. 6, 7</A>.

 But see how little God valued this. As trials of obedience, and types 
 of Christ, he did indeed require sacrifices to be offered; but he had 
 no delight in them for any intrinsic worth or value they had. 
 <I>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not.</I> As they cannot make 
 satisfaction for sin, so God cannot take any satisfaction in them, any 
 otherwise than as the offering of them is expressive of love and duty 
 to him.

 2. He knew also how acceptable true repentance is to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.</I> See here,

 (1.) What the good work is that is wrought in every true penitent--a 
 broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart. It is a work wrought upon 
 the heart; that is it that God looks at, and requires, in all religious 
 exercises, particularly in the exercises of repentance. It is a sharp 
 work wrought there, no less than the breaking of the heart; not in 
 despair (as we say, when a man is undone, His heart is broken), but in 
 necessary humiliation and sorrow for sin. It is a heart breaking with 
 itself, and breaking from its sin; it is a heart pliable to the word of 
 God, and patient under the rod of God, a heart subdued and brought into 
 obedience; it is a heart that is tender, like Josiah's, and trembles at 
 God's word. Oh that there were such a heart in us! 

 (2.) How graciously God is pleased to accept of this. It is <I>the 
 sacrifices of God,</I> not one, but many; it is instead of all 
 burnt-offering and sacrifice. The breaking of Christ's body for sin is
 the only sacrifice of atonement, for no sacrifice but that could take 
 away sin; but the breaking of our hearts for sin is a sacrifice of 
 acknowledgment, a sacrifice of God, for to him it is offered up; he 
 requires it, he prepares it (he provides this lamb for a 
 burnt-offering), and he will accept of it. That which pleased God was 
 not the feeding of a beast, and making much of it, but killing it; so 
 it is not the pampering of our flesh, but the mortifying of it, that 
 God will accept. The sacrifice was bound, was bled, was burnt; so the 
 penitent heart is bound by convictions, bleeds in contrition, and then 
 burns in holy zeal against sin and for God. The sacrifice was offered 
 upon the altar that sanctified the gift; so the broken heart is 
 acceptable to God only through Jesus Christ; there is no true 
 repentance without faith in him; and this is the sacrifice which he 
 will not despise. Men despise that which is broken, but God will not. 
 He despised the sacrifice of torn and broken beasts, but he will not 
 despise that of a torn and broken heart. He will not overlook it; he 
 will not refuse or reject it; though it make God no satisfaction for 
 the wrong done him by sin, yet he does not despise it. The proud 
 Pharisee despised the broken-hearted publican, and he thought very 
 meanly of himself; but God did not despise him. More is implied than is 
 expressed; the great God overlooks heaven and earth, to look with 
 favour upon a <I>broken and contrite heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1,Isa+57:15">Isa. lxvi. 1, 2; lvii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David intercedes for Zion and Jerusalem, with an eye to the honour 
 of God. See what a concern he had,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the good of the church of God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion,</I> that is,

 (1.) "To all the particular worshippers in Zion, to all that love and 
 fear thy name; keep them from falling into such wounding wasting sins 
 as these of mine; defend and succour all that fear thy name." Those 
 that have been in spiritual troubles themselves know how to pity and 
 pray for those that are in like manner afflicted. Or, 

 (2.) To the public interests of Israel. David was sensible of the
 wrong he had done to Judah and Jerusalem by his sin, how it had 
 weakened the hands and saddened the hearts of good people, and opened 
 the mouths of their adversaries; he was likewise afraid lest, he being 
 a public person, his sin should bring judgments upon the city and 
 kingdom, and therefore he prays to God to secure and advance those 
 public interests which he had damaged and endangered. He prays that God 
 would prevent those national judgments which his sin had deserved, that 
 he would continue those blessings, and carry on that good work, which 
 it had threatened to retard and put a stop to. He prays, not only that 
 God would do good to Zion, as he did to other places, by his 
 providence, but that he would do it in his <I>good pleasure,</I> with 
 the peculiar favour he bore to that place which he had chosen to put 
 his name there, that the walls of Jerusalem, which perhaps were now in 
 the building, might be built up, and that good work finished. Note,

 [1.] When we have most business of our own, and of greatest importance 
 at the throne of grace, yet then we must not forget to pray for the 
 church of God; nay, our Master has taught us in our daily prayers to
 begin with that, <I>Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come.</I> 

 [2.] The consideration of the prejudice we have done to the public 
 interests by our sins should engage us to do them all the service we 
 can, particularly by our prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For the honour of the churches of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 If God would show himself reconciled to him and his people, as he had
 prayed, then they should go on with the public services of his house,

 (1.) Cheerfully to themselves. The sense of God's goodness to them 
 would enlarge their hearts in all the instances and expressions of 
 thankfulness and obedience. They will then come to his tabernacle with 
 burnt-offerings, with whole burnt-offerings, which were intended purely 
 for the glory of God, and they shall offer, not lambs and rams only, 
 but bullocks, the costliest sacrifices, upon his altar. 

 (2.) Acceptably to God: "<I>Thou shalt be pleased with them,</I> that 
 is, we shall have reason to hope so when we perceive the sin taken away 
 which threatened to hinder thy acceptance." Note, It is a great comfort 
 to a good man to think of the communion that is between God and his 
 people in their public assemblies, how he is honoured by their humble 
 attendance on him and they are happy in his gracious acceptance of 
 it.</P>
