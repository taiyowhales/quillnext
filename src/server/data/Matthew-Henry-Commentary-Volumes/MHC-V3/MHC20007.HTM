 The scope of this chapter is, as of several before, to warn young men 
 against the lusts of the flesh. Solomon remembered of what ill 
 consequence it was to his father, perhaps found himself, and perceived 
 his son, addicted to it, or at least had observed how many hopeful 
 young men among his subjects had been ruined by those lusts; and 
 therefore he thought he could never say enough to dissuade men from 
 them, that "every one may possess his vessel in sanctification and 
 honour, and not in the lusts of uncleanness." In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. A general exhortation to get our minds principled and governed by
 the word of God, as a sovereign antidote against this sin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. A particular representation of the great danger which unwary young
 men are in of being inveigled into this snare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:6-23">ver. 6-23</A>.

 III. A serious caution inferred thence, in the close, to take heed of
 all approaches towards this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 We should all pray, "Lord, lead us not into this temptation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
 &nbsp; 2  Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
 thine eye.
 &nbsp; 3  Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of
 thine heart.
 &nbsp; 4  Say unto wisdom, Thou <I>art</I> my sister; and call understanding
 <I>thy</I> kinswoman:
 &nbsp; 5  That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
 stranger <I>which</I> flattereth with her words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses are an introduction to his warning against fleshly lusts,
 much the same with that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:20"><I>ch.</I> vi. 20</A>,

 &c., and ending

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 as that did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>To keep thee from the strange woman;</I> that is it he aims at; only
 there he had said, <I>Keep thy father's commandment,</I> here (which 
 comes all to one), <I>Keep my commandments,</I> for he speaks to us as 
 unto sons. He speaks in God's name; for it is God's <I>commandments</I> 
 that we are to <I>keep,</I> his <I>words,</I> his <I>law.</I> The word 
 of God must be to us, 

 1. As that which we are most careful of. We must keep it as our
 treasure; we must <I>lay up God's</I> commandments with us, lay them up 
 safely, that we may not be robbed of them by the wicked one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We must keep it as our life: <I>Keep my commandments and live</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not only, "Keep them, and you shall live;" but, "Keep them as you would
 your life, as those that cannot live without them." It would be death 
 to a good man to be deprived of the word of God, for by it he lives, 
 and not <I>by bread alone.</I> 

 2. As that which we are most tender of: Keep <I>my law as the apple of 
 thy eye.</I> A little thing offends the eye, and therefore nature has 
 so well guarded it. We pray, with David, that God would keep us as the 
 apple of his eye

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:8">Ps.  xvii. 8</A>),

 that our lives and comforts may be precious in his sight; and they 
 shall be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:8">Zech. ii. 8</A>)

 if we be in like manner tender of his law and afraid of the least 
 violation of it.  Those who reproach strict and circumspect walking, as 
 needless preciseness, consider not that the law is to be kept as the 
 apple of the eye, for indeed it is the <I>apple of our eye;</I> the law 
 is light; the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. 

 3. As that which we are proud of and would be ever mindful of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>):

 "<I>Bind them upon thy fingers;</I> let them be precious to thee; look 
 upon them as an ornament, as a diamond-ring, as the <I>signet on thy 
 right hand;</I> wear them continually as thy wedding-ring, the badge of 
 thy espousals to God. Look upon the word of God as putting an honour 
 upon thee, as an ensign of thy dignity.  <I>Bind them on thy 
 fingers,</I> that they may be constant memorandums to thee of thy duty, 
 that thou mayest have them always in view, as that which is <I>graven 
 upon the palms of thy hands.</I>" 

 4. As that which we are fond of and are ever thinking of: <I>Write them 
 upon the table of thy heart,</I> as the names of the friends we dearly 
 love, we say, are written in our hearts. <I>Let the word of God dwell
 richly in us,</I> and be written there where it will be always at hand 
 to be read. Where sin was written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1">Jer. xvii. 1</A>)

 let the word of God be written.  It is the matter of a promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:10">Heb. viii. 10</A>,

 <I>I will write my law in their hearts</I>), which makes the precept 
 practicable and easy. 

 5. As that which we are intimately acquainted and conversant with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister,</I> whom I dearly love and 
 take delight in; <I>and call understanding thy kinswoman,</I> to whom 
 thou art nearly allied, and for whom thou hast a pure affection; call 
 her thy friend, whom thou courtest." We must make the word of God 
 familiar to us, consult it, and consult its honour, and take a pleasure 
 in conversing with it. 

 6. As that which we make use of for our defence and armour, to keep us 
 <I>from the strange woman,</I> from sin, that flattering but destroying 
 thing, that adulteress; particularly from the sin of uncleanness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Let the word of God confirm our dread of that sin and our resolutions 
 against it; let it discover to us its fallacies and suggest to us 
 answers to all its flatteries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
 &nbsp; 7  And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
 youths, a young man void of understanding,
 &nbsp; 8  Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
 way to her house,
 &nbsp; 9  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
 &nbsp; 10  And, behold, there met him a woman <I>with</I> the attire of an
 harlot, and subtil of heart.
 &nbsp; 11  (She <I>is</I> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her
 house:
 &nbsp; 12  Now <I>is she</I> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait
 at every corner.)
 &nbsp; 13  So she caught him, and kissed him, <I>and</I> with an impudent
 face said unto him,
 &nbsp; 14  <I>I have</I> peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my
 vows.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
 face, and I have found thee.
 &nbsp; 16  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
 <I>works,</I> with fine linen of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 17  I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
 &nbsp; 18  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
 solace ourselves with loves.
 &nbsp; 19  For the goodman <I>is</I> not at home, he is gone a long journey:
 &nbsp; 20  He hath taken a bag of money with him, <I>and</I> will come home
 at the day appointed.
 &nbsp; 21  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
 flattering of her lips she forced him.
 &nbsp; 22  He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
 slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
 &nbsp; 23  Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to
 the snare, and knoweth not that it <I>is</I> for his life.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here, to enforce the caution he had given against the sin of 
 whoredom, tells a story of a young man that was ruined to all intents 
 and purposes by the enticements of an adulterous woman. Such a story as 
 this would serve the lewd profane poets of our age to make a play of, 
 and the harlot with them would be a heroine; nothing would be so 
 entertaining to the audience, nor give them so much diversion, as her 
 arts of beguiling the young gentleman and drawing in the country 
 squire; her conquests would be celebrated as the triumphs of wit and 
 love, and the comedy would conclude very pleasantly; and every young 
 man that saw it acted would covet to be so picked up. Thus <I>fools 
 make a mock at sin.</I> But Solomon here relates it, and all wise and 
 good men read it, as a very melancholy story. The impudence of the 
 adulterous woman is very justly looked upon, by all that have any 
 sparks of virtue in them, with the highest indignation, and the 
 easiness of the young man with the tenderest compassion; and the story 
 concludes with sad reflections, enough to make all that read and hear 
 it afraid of the snares of fleshly lusts and careful to keep at the 
 utmost distance from them. It is supposed to be a parable, or imagined 
 case, but I doubt it was too true, and, which is worse, that 
 notwithstanding the warning it gives of the fatal consequences of such 
 wicked courses it is still too often true, and the agents for hell are 
 still playing the same game and with similar success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon was a magistrate, and, as such, inspected the manners of his 
 subjects, looked often through his casement, that he might see with his 
 own eyes, and made remarks upon those who little thought his eye was 
 upon them, that he might know the better how to make the sword he bore 
 a terror to evil-doers. But here he writes as a minister, a prophet, 
 who is by office a watchman, to give warning of the approach of the 
 enemies, and especially where they lie in ambush, that we may not be 
 ignorant of Satan's devices, but may know where to double our guard. 
 This Solomon does here, where we may observe the account he gives,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the person tempted, and how he laid himself open to the 
 temptation, and therefore must thank himself if it end in his 
 destruction. 
 
 1. He was a <I>young man,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Fleshly lusts are called <I>youthful lusts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:22">2 Tim. ii. 22</A>),

 not to extenuate them as tricks of youth, and therefore excusable, but 
 rather to aggravate them, as robbing God of the first and best of our 
 time, and, by debauching the mind when it is tender, laying a 
 foundation for a bad life ever after, and to intimate that young people 
 ought in a special manner to fortify their resolutions against this 
 sin. 

 2. He was a young man <I>void of understanding,</I> that went abroad 
 into the world, not principled as he ought to have been with wisdom and 
 the fear of God, and so ventured to sea without ballast, without pilot, 
 cord, or compass; he knew not how to depart from evil, which is the 
 best understanding,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>.

 Those become an easy prey to Satan who, when they have arrived to the 
 stature of men, have scarcely the understanding of children. 

 3. He kept bad company. He was a <I>young man among the youths,</I> a
 silly young man <I>among the simple</I> ones. If, being conscious of 
 his own weakness, he had associated with those that were older and 
 wiser than himself, there would have been hopes of him. Christ, at 
 twelve years old, conversed with the doctors, to set young people an 
 example of this. But, if those that are simple choose such for their 
 companions as are like themselves, simple they will still be, and 
 hardened in their simplicity. 

 4. He was sauntering, and had nothing to do, but <I>passed through the 
 street</I> as one that knew not how to dispose of himself.  One of the 
 sins of filthy Sodom was <I>abundance of idleness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>.

 He went in a starched stately manner, so (it is said) the word 
 signifies. He appeared to be a nice formal fop, the top of whose 
 accomplishments was to dress well and walk with a good air; fit game 
 for that bird of prey to fly at. 

 5. He was a night-walker, that hated and scorned the business that is
 to be done by day-light, from which the evening calls men in to their 
 repose; and, having fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, 
 he begins to move <I>in the twilight in the evening,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 And he chooses <I>the black and dark night</I> as fittest for his 
 purpose, not the moonlight nights, when he might be discovered. 

 6. He steered his course towards the house of one that he thought would 
 entertain him, and that he might be merry with; he went <I>near her 
 corner,</I> the <I>way to her house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 contrary to Solomon's advice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>),

 <I>Come not night the door of her house.</I> Perhaps he did not know it
 was the way to an infamous house, but, however, it was a way that he 
 had no business in; and when we have nothing to do the devil will 
 quickly find us something to do. We must take heed, not only of idle 
 days, but of idle evenings, lest they prove inlets to temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the person tempting, not a common prostitute, for she was a 
 married wife 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and, for aught that appears, lived in reputation among her neighbours,
 not suspected of any such wickedness, and yet, in the <I>twilight of 
 the evening,</I> when her husband was abroad, abominably impudent. She 
 is here described, 

 1. By her dress. She had the <I>attire of a harlot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 gaudy and flaunting, to set her off as a beauty; perhaps she was
 painted as Jezebel, and went with her neck and breasts bare, loose, and 
 <I>en deshabille.</I> The purity of the heart will show itself in the 
 modesty of the dress, which <I>becomes women professing godliness.</I> 

 2. By her craft and management. She is <I>subtle of heart,</I> mistress 
 of all the arts of wheedling, and knowing how by all her caresses to 
 serve her own base purposes. 

 3. By her temper and carriage. <I>She is loud and stubborn,</I>
 talkative and self-willed, noisy and troublesome, wilful and 
 headstrong, all tongue, and will have her saying, right or wrong, 
 impatient of check and control, and cannot bear to be counselled, much 
 less reproved, by husband or parents, ministers or friends. She is a 
 <I>daughter of Belial,</I> that will endure no yoke. 

 4. By her place, not her own house; she hates the confinement and 
 employment of that; her <I>feet abide not there</I> any longer than 
 needs must. She is all for gadding abroad, changing place and company.  
 <I>Now is she without</I> in the country, under pretence of taking the 
 air, now <I>in the streets</I> of the city, under pretence of seeing 
 how the market goes. She is here, and there, and every where but where 
 she should be.  She <I>lies in wait at every corner,</I> to pick up 
 such as she can make a prey of. Virtue is a penance to those to whom 
 home is a prison.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the temptation itself and the management of it. She met the 
 young spark. Perhaps she knew him; however she knew by his fashions 
 that he was such a one as she wished for; so she <I>caught him 
 about</I> the neck and <I>kissed</I> him, contrary to all the rules of 
 modesty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and waited not for his compliments or courtship, but <I>with an
 impudent face</I> invited him not only to <I>her house,</I> but to 
 <I>her bed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She courted him to sup with her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):

 <I>I have peace-offerings with me.</I> Hereby she gives him to 
 understand, 

 (1.) Her prosperity, that she was compassed about with so many 
 blessings that she had occasion to offer peace-offerings, in token of 
 joy and thankfulness; she was before-hand in the world, so that he 
 needed not fear having his pocket picked.

 (2.) Her profession of piety.  She had been to-day at the temple, and 
 was as well respected there as any that worshipped in the courts of the 
 Lord. She had paid her vows, and, as she thought, made all even with 
 God Almighty, and therefore might venture upon a new score of sins. 
 Note, The external performances of religion, if they do not harden men 
 against sin, harden them in it, and embolden carnal hearts to venture 
 upon it, in hopes that when they come to count and discount with God he 
 will be found as much in debt to them for their peace-offerings and 
 their vows as they to him for their sins.  But it is sad that a show of 
 piety should become the shelter of iniquity (which really doubles the 
 shame of it, and makes it more exceedingly sinful) and that men should 
 baffle their consciences with those very things that should startle 
 them. The Pharisees made long prayers, that they might the more 
 plausibly carry on their covetous and mischievous provisions. The 
 greatest part of the flesh of the peace-offerings was by the law 
 returned back to the offerers, to feast upon with their friends, which 
 (if they were peace-offerings of thanksgiving) was to be all eaten 
 <I>the same day</I> and <I>none of it left until the morning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:15">Lev. vii. 15</A>.

 This law of charity and generosity is abused to be a colour for 
 gluttony and excess: "Come," says she, "come home with me, for I have 
 good cheer enough, and only want good company to help me off with it." 
 It was a pity that the peace-offerings should thus become, in a bad 
 sense, sin-offerings, and that what was designed for the honour of God 
 should become the food and fuel of a base lust. But this is not all. 
 
 (4.) To strengthen the temptation,

 [1.] She pretends to have a very great affection for him above any man: 
 "<I>Therefore,</I> because I have a good supper upon the table, <I>I 
 came forth to meet thee,</I> for no friend in the world shall be so 
 welcome to it as thou shalt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Thou art he whom I came on purpose to seek, to <I>seek diligently,</I> 
 came myself, and would not send a servant." Surely he cannot deny her 
 his company when she put such a value upon it, and would take all this 
 pains to obtain the favour of it. Sinners take pains to do mischief, 
 and are as the roaring lion himself; they <I>go about seeking to 
 devour,</I> and yet pretend they are seeking to oblige. 

 [2.] She would have it thought that Providence itself countenanced her 
 choice of him for her companion; for how quickly had she found him whom 
 she sought!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She courted him to lie with her. They will sit down to eat and 
 drink, and then rise up to play, to play the wanton, and there is a bed 
 ready for them, where he shall find that which will be in all respects 
 agreeable to him. To please his eye, it is <I>decked with coverings of 
 tapestry</I> and <I>carved works,</I> exquisitely fine; he never saw 
 the like. To please his touch, the sheets are not of home-spun cloth; 
 they are far-fetched and dear bought; they are of <I>fine linen of 
 Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 To gratify his smell, it is <I>perfumed</I> with the sweetest scents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Come, therefore, and <I>let us take our fill of love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Of <I>love,</I> does she say? Of <I>lust</I> she means, brutish lust; 
 but it is a pity that the name of love should be thus abused. True love 
 is from heaven; this is from hell. How can those pretend to solace 
 themselves and love one another who are really ruining themselves and 
 one another?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She anticipated the objection which he might make of the danger of 
 it. Is she not another man's wife, and what if her husband should catch 
 them in adultery, in the very act? he will make them pay dearly for 
 their sport, and where will the solace of their love be then? "Never 
 fear," says she, "the <I>good man is not at home</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 she does not call him her <I>husband,</I> for she <I>forsakes the guide
 of her youth</I> and <I>forgets the covenant of her God;</I> but "the 
 <I>good man</I> of the house, whom I am weary of." Thus Potiphar's 
 wife, when she spoke of her husband, would not call him so, but 
 <I>he,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:14">Gen. xxxix. 14</A>.

 It is therefore with good reason taken notice of, to Sarah's praise, 
 that she spoke respectfully of her husband, calling him <I>lord.</I> 
 She pleases herself with this that he is not at home, and therefore she 
 is melancholy if she have not some company, and therefore whatever 
 company she has she may be free with them, for she is from under his 
 eye, and he shall never know.  But will he not return quickly? No: "he 
 has <I>gone a long journey,</I> and cannot return on a sudden; he 
 <I>appointed the day</I> of his return, and he never comes home sooner 
 than he says he will. <I>He has taken a bag of money with him,</I> 
 either," 

 (1.) "To trade with, to buy goods with and he will not return till he 
 has laid it all out. It is a pity that an honest industrious man should 
 be thus abused, and advantage taken of his absence, when it is upon 
 business, for the good of his family." Or,

 (2.) "To spend and revel with." Whether justly or not, she insinuates 
 that he was a bad husband; so she would represent him, because she was 
 resolved to be a bad wife, and must have that for an excuse; it is 
 often groundlessly suggested, but is never a sufficient excuse. "He 
 follows his pleasures, and wastes his estate abroad" (says she), "and 
 why should not I do the same at home?"</P>

 IV. Of the success of the temptation. Promising the young man every 
 thing that was pleasant, and impunity in the enjoyment, she gained her 
 point, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It should seem, the youth, though very simple, had no ill design, else 
 a word, a beck, a wink, would have served, and there would have been no 
 need of all this harangue; but though he did not intend any such thing, 
 nay, had something in his conscience that opposed it, yet <I>with her 
 much fair speech she caused him to yield.</I> His corruptions at length 
 triumphed over his convictions, and his resolutions were not strong 
 enough to hold out against such artful attacks as these, but <I>with 
 the flattery of her lips she forced him;</I> he could not stop his ear 
 against such a charmer, but surrendered himself her captive. Wisdom's 
 maidens, who plead her cause, and have reason on their side, and true 
 and divine pleasures to invite men to, have a deaf ear turned to them, 
 and with all their rhetoric cannot compel men to come in, but such is 
 the dominion of sin in the hearts of men that its allurements soon 
 prevail by falsehood and flattery. With what pity does Solomon here 
 look upon this foolish young man, when he sees him follow the 
 adulterous woman! 

 (1.) He gives him up for gone; alas! he is undone. He goes to the
 slaughter (for houses of uncleanness are slaughter-houses to precious 
 souls); a dart will presently <I>strike through his liver;</I> going 
 without his breast-plate, he will receive his death's wound,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It is his life, his precious life, that is thus irrecoverably thrown 
 away, he is perfectly lost to all good; his conscience is debauched; a 
 door is opened to all other vices, and this will certainly end in his 
 endless damnation. 

 (2.) That which makes his case the more piteous is that he is not 
 himself aware of his misery and danger; he goes blindfold, nay, he goes 
 laughing to his ruin. The ox thinks he is led to the pasture when he is 
 led to the slaughter; <I>the fool</I> (that is, the drunkard, for, of 
 all sinners, drunkards are the greatest fools) is led <I>to the 
 correction of the stocks,</I> and is not sensible of the shame of it, 
 but goes to it as if he were going to a play. The <I>bird</I> that 
 <I>hastes to the snare</I> looks only at the bait, and promises herself 
 a good bit from that, and considers not that <I>it is for her life.</I> 
 Thus this unthinking unwary young man dreams of nothing but the 
 pleasures he shall have in the embraces of the harlot, while really he 
 is running headlong upon his ruin. Though Solomon does not here tell us 
 that he put the law in execution against this base harlot, yet we have 
 no reason to think but that he did, he was himself so affected with the 
 mischief she did and had such an indignation at it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
 the words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 25  Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in
 her paths.
 &nbsp; 26  For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <I>men</I>
 have been slain by her.
 &nbsp; 27  Her house <I>is</I> the way to hell, going down to the chambers
 of death.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the application of the foregoing story: "<I>Hearken to me 
 therefore,</I> and not to such seducers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 give ear to a father, and not to an enemy." 

 1. "Take good counsel when it is given you.  <I>Let not thy heart
 decline to her ways</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 never leave the paths of virtue, though strait and narrow, solitary and
 up-hill, for the way of the adulteress, though green, and broad, and 
 crowded with company. Do not only keep thy feet from those ways, but 
 let not so much as thy heart incline to them; never harbour a 
 disposition this way, nor think otherwise than with abhorrence of such 
 wicked practices as these.  Let reason, and conscience, and the fear of 
 God ruling in the heart, check the inclinations of the sensual 
 appetite. If thou goest in her paths, in any of the paths that lead to 
 this sin, thou goest astray, thou art out of the right way, the safe 
 way; therefore take heed, <I>go not astray,</I> lest thou wander 
 endlessly." 
 
 2. "Take fair warning when it is given you."

 (1.) "Look back, and see what mischief this sin has done. The 
 adulteress has been the ruin not of here and there one, but she has 
 <I>cast down many wounded.</I>" Thousands have been undone, now and for 
 ever, by this sin; and those not only the weak and simple youths, such 
 as he was of whom he had now spoken, but <I>many strong men have been 
 slain by her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Herein, perhaps, he has an eye especially to Samson, who was slain by 
 this sin, and perhaps to David too, who by this sin entailed a sword 
 upon his house, though so far the Lord took it away that he himself 
 should not die. These were men not only of great bodily strength, but 
 of eminent wisdom and courage, and yet their fleshly lusts prevailed 
 over them. <I>Howl, fir-trees, if the cedars be shaken.  Let him that 
 thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.</I> 

 (2.) "Look forward with an eye of faith, and see what will be in the 
 end of it,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Her house, though richly decked and furnished, and called a <I>house of 
 pleasure,</I> is the <I>way to hell;</I> and her chambers are the 
 stair-case that goes down to the <I>chambers of death</I> and 
 everlasting darkness. The cup of fornication must shortly be exchanged 
 for the cup of trembling; and the flames of lust, if not quenched by 
 repentance and mortification, will burn to the lowest hell. Therefore 
 <I>stand in awe and sin not.</I></P>
