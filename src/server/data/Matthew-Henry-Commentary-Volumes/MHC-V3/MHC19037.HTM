 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is a sermon, and an excellent useful sermon it is, 
 calculated not (as most of the psalms) for our devotion, but for our 
 conversation; there is nothing in it of prayer or praise, but it is all 
 instruction; it is "Maschil--a teaching psalm;" it is an exposition of
 some of the hardest chapters in the book of Providence, the advancement 
 of the wicked and the disgrace of the righteous, a solution of the 
 difficulties that arise thereupon, and an exhortation to conduct 
 ourselves as becomes us under such dark dispensations. The work of the 
 prophets (and David was one) was to explain the law. Now the law of 
 Moses had promised temporal blessings to the obedient, and denounced 
 temporal miseries against the disobedient, which principally referred 
 to the body of the people, the nation as a nation; for, when they came 
 to be applied to particular persons, many instances occurred of sinners 
 in prosperity and saints in adversity; to reconcile those instances 
 with the word that God had spoken is the scope of the prophet in this 
 psalm, in which, 

 I. He forbids us to fret at the prosperity of the wicked in their
 wicked ways, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1,7,8">ver. 1, 7, 8</A>.

 II. He gives very good reasons why we should not fret at it. 

 1. Because of the scandalous character of the wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:12,14,21,32">ver. 12, 14, 21, 32</A>)

 notwithstanding their prosperity, and the honourable character of the
 righteous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:21,26,30,31">ver. 21, 26, 30, 31</A>.

 2. Because of the destruction and ruin which the wicked are nigh to 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:2,9,10,20,35,36,38">ver. 2, 9, 10, 20, 35, 36, 38</A>)

 and the salvation and protection which the righteous are sure of from
 all the malicious designs of the wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13,15,17,28,33,39,40">ver. 13, 15, 17, 28, 33, 39, 40</A>.

 3.  Because of the particular mercy God has in store for all good
 people and the favour he shows them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:11,16,18,19,22-25,28,29,37">ver. 11, 16, 18, 19, 22-25, 28, 29, 37</A>.

 III. He prescribes very good remedies against this sin of envying the
 prosperity of the wicked, and great encouragement to use those remedies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3-6,27,34">ver. 3-6, 27, 34</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must teach and admonish one another rightly to
 understand the providence of God and to accommodate ourselves to it, at
 all times carefully to do our duty and then patiently to leave the
 event with God and to believe that, how black soever things may look 
 for the present, it shall be "well with those that fear God, that fear 
 before him."</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Fret not thyself because of
 evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of
 iniquity.
 &nbsp; 2  For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
 the green herb.
 &nbsp; 3  Trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and do good; <I>so</I> shalt thou dwell in the
 land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
 &nbsp; 4  Delight thyself also in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and he shall give thee the
 desires of thine heart.
 &nbsp; 5  Commit thy way unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; trust also in him; and he shall
 bring <I>it</I> to pass.
 &nbsp; 6  And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
 thy judgment as the noonday.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The instructions here given are very plain; much need not be said for 
 the exposition of them, but there is a great deal to be done for the 
 reducing of them to practice, and there they will look best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here cautioned against discontent at the prosperity and 
 success of evil-doers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Fret not thyself, neither be thou envious.</I> We may suppose that
 David speaks this to himself first, and preaches it to his own heart 
 (in his communing with that upon his bed), for the suppressing of those 
 corrupt passions which he found working there, and then leaves it in 
 writing for instruction to others that might be in similar temptation. 
 That is preached best, and with most probability of success, to others, 
 which is first preached to ourselves. Now,

 1. When we look abroad we see the world full of evil-doers and workers
 of iniquity, that flourish and prosper, that have what they will and do 
 what they will, that live in ease and pomp themselves and have power in 
 their hands to do mischief to those about them. So it was in David's 
 time; and therefore, if it is so still, let us not marvel at the 
 matter, as though it were some new or strange thing. 

 2. When we look within we find ourselves tempted to fret at this, and 
 to be envious against these scandals and burdens, these blemishes and 
 common nuisances, of this earth. We are apt to fret at God, as if he 
 were unkind to the world and unkind to his church in permitting such 
 men to live, and prosper, and prevail, as they do. We are apt to fret 
 ourselves with vexation at their success in their evil projects. We are 
 apt to envy them the liberty they take in getting wealth, and perhaps 
 by unlawful means, and in the indulgence of their lusts, and to wish 
 that we could shake off the restraints of conscience and do so too. We 
 are tempted to think them the only happy people, and to incline to 
 imitate them, and to join ourselves with them, that we may share in 
 their gains and eat of their dainties; and this is that which we are 
 warned against: <I>Fret not thyself, neither be thou envious.</I> 
 Fretfulness and envy are sins that are their own punishments; they are 
 the uneasiness of the spirit and the rottenness of the bones; it is 
 therefore in kindness to ourselves that we are warned against them. Yet 
 that is not all; for, 

 3. When we look forward with an eye of faith we shall see no reason to
 envy wicked people their prosperity, for their ruin is at the door and 
 they are ripening apace for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They flourish, but as the grass, and as the green herb, which nobody 
 envies nor frets at. The flourishing of a godly man is like that of a 
 fruitful tree

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3">Ps. i. 3</A>),

 but that of the wicked man is like grass and herbs, which are very
 short-lived. 

 (1.) They will soon wither of themselves. Outward prosperity is a 
 fading thing, and so is the life itself to which it is confined. 

 (2.) They will sooner be cut down by the judgments of God.  Their 
 triumphing is short, but their weeping and wailing will be 
 everlasting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here counselled to live a life on confidence and complacency 
 in God, and that will keep us from fretting at the prosperity of 
 evil-doers; if we do well for our own souls, we shall see little reason 
 to envy those that do so ill for theirs.  Here are three excellent 
 precepts, which we are to be ruled by, and, to enforce them, three 
 precious promises, which we may rely upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must make God our hope in the way of duty and then we shall have 
 a comfortable subsistence in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) It is required that we <I>trust in the Lord and do good,</I> that 
 we confide in God and conform to him. The life of religion lies much in 
 a believing reliance on God, his favour, his providence, his promise, 
 his grace, and a diligent care to serve him and our generation, 
 according to his will.  We must not think to trust in God and then live 
 as we list. No; it is not trusting God, but tempting him, if we do not 
 make conscience of our duty to him. Nor must we think to do good, and 
 then to trust to ourselves, and our own righteousness and strength. No; 
 we must both trust in the Lord and do good. And then, 

 (2.) It is promised that we shall be well provided for in this world: 
 <I>So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</I> 
 He does not say, "So shalt thou get preferment, dwell in a palace, and 
 be feasted." This is not necessary; a man's life consists not in the 
 abundance of these things; but, "Thou shalt have a place to live in, 
 and that in the land, in Canaan, the valley of vision, and thou shalt 
 have food convenient for thee." This is more than we deserve; it is as 
 much as a good man will stipulate for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:20">Gen.  xxviii. 20</A>)

 and it is enough for one that is going to heaven. "Thou shalt have a
 settlement, a quiet settlement, and a maintenance, a comfortable 
 maintenance: <I>Verily thou shalt be fed.</I>" Some read it, <I>Thou 
 shalt be fed by faith,</I> as the just are said to live by faith, and 
 it is good living, good feeding, upon the promises. "<I>Verily thou 
 shalt be fed,</I> as Elijah in the famine, with what is needful for 
 thee." God himself is a shepherd, a feeder, to all those that trust in 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1">Ps.  xxiii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must make God our heart's delight and then we shall have our 
 heart's desire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We must not only depend upon God, but solace ourselves in him. We must 
 be well pleased that there is a God, that he is such a one as he has 
 revealed himself to be, and that he is our God in covenant. We must 
 delight ourselves in his beauty, bounty, and benignity; our souls must 
 return to him, and repose in him, as their rest, and their portion for 
 ever. Being satisfied of his loving-kindness, we must be satisfied with 
 it, and make that our exceeding joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4">Ps. xliii. 4</A>.

 We were commanded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 to do good, and then follows this command to delight in God, which is
 as much a privilege as a duty. If we make conscience of obedience to 
 God, we may then take the comfort of a complacency in him. And even 
 this pleasant duty of delighting in God has a promise annexed to it, 
 which is very full and precious, enough to recompense the hardest 
 services: <I>He shall give thee the desires of thy heart.</I> He has 
 not promised to gratify all the appetites of the body and the humours 
 of the fancy, but to grant all the desires of the heart, all the 
 cravings of the renewed sanctified soul. What is the desire of the 
 heart of a good man? It is this, to know, and love, and live to God, to 
 please him and to be pleased in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must make God our guide, and submit in every thing to his 
 guidance and disposal; and then all our affairs, even those that seem 
 most intricate and perplexed, shall be made to issue well and to our 
 satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 (1.) The duty is very easy; and, if we do it aright, it will make us 
 easy: <I>Commit thy way unto the Lord; roll thy way upon the Lord</I> 
 (so the margin reads it),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:3,Ps+55:22">Prov. xvi. 3; Ps. lv. 22</A>.

 <I>Cast thy burden upon the Lord,</I> the burden of thy care, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:7">1 Pet. v. 7</A>.

 We must roll it off ourselves, so as not to afflict and perplex
 ourselves with thoughts about future events 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>),

 not to cumber and trouble ourselves either with the contrivance of the
 means or with expectation of the end, but refer it to God, leave it to 
 him by his wise and good providence to order and dispose of all our 
 concerns as he pleases. <I>Retreat thy way unto the Lord</I> (so the 
 LXX.), that is, "By prayer spread thy case, and all thy cares about it, 
 before the Lord" (as Jephthah <I>uttered all his words before the Lord 
 in Mizpeh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:11">Judg. xi. 11</A>),

 "and then trust in him to bring it to a good issue, with a full
 satisfaction that all is well that God does." We must do our duty (that 
 must be our care) and then leave the event with God. <I>Sit still, and 
 see how the matter will fall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:18">Ruth iii. 18</A>.

 We must follow Providence, and not force it, subscribe to Infinite 
 Wisdom and not prescribe. 
 
 (2.) The promise is very sweet. 

 [1.] In general, "<I>He shall bring that to pass,</I> whatever it is, 
 which thou hast committed to him, if not to thy contrivance, yet to thy 
 content. He will find means to extricate thee out of thy straits, to 
 prevent thy fears, and bring about thy purposes, to thy satisfaction." 
 
 [2.] In particular, "He will take care of thy reputation, and bring 
 thee out of thy difficulties, not only with comfort, but with credit 
 and honour: <I>He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and 
 thy judgment as the noon-day.</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>),

 that is, "he shall make it to appear that thou art an honest man, and
 that is honour enough." <I>First,</I> It is implied that the 
 righteousness and judgment of good people may, for a time, be clouded 
 and eclipsed, either by remarkable rebukes of Providence (Job's great 
 afflictions darkened his righteousness) or by the malicious censures 
 and reproaches of men, who give them bad names which they no way 
 deserve, and lay to their charge things which they know not.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is promised that God will, in due time, roll away 
 the reproach they are under, clear up their innocency, and bring forth 
 their righteousness, to their honour, perhaps in this world, at 
 furthest in the great day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:43">Matt. xiii. 43</A>.

 Note, If we take care to keep a good conscience, we may leave it to God
 to take care of our good name.</P>

 <I>shall be</I> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The foregoing precepts inculcated; for we are so apt to disquiet 
 ourselves with needless fruitless discontents and distrusts that it is 
 necessary there should be precept upon precept, and line upon line, to 
 suppress them and arm us against them.

 1.  Let us compose ourselves by believing in God: "<I>Rest in the Lord,
 and wait patiently for him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, be well reconciled to all he does and acquiesce in it, for
 that is best that is, because it is what God has appointed; and be well 
 satisfied that he will still make all to work for good to us, though we 
 know not how or which way." <I>Be silent to the Lord</I> (so the word 
 is), not with a sullen, but a submissive silence. A patient bearing of 
 what is laid upon us, with a patient expectation of what is further 
 appointed for us, is as much our interest as it is our duty, for it 
 will make us always easy; and there is a great deal of reason for it, 
 for it is making a virtue of necessity.

 2. Let us not discompose ourselves at what we see in this world: 
 "<I>Fret not thyself because of him who prospers in his wicked way,</I> 
 who, though he is a bad man, yet thrives and grows rich and great in 
 the world; no, nor because of him who does mischief with his power and 
 wealth, and brings wicked devices to pass against those that are 
 virtuous and good, who seems to have gained his point and to have run 
 them down. If thy heart begins to rise at it, stroke down thy folly, 
 and <I>cease from anger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 check the first stirrings of discontent and envy, and do not harbour
 any hard thoughts of God and his providence upon this account. Be not 
 angry at any thing that God does, but forsake that wrath; it is the 
 worst kind of wrath that can be. <I>Fret not thyself in any wise to do 
 evil;</I> do not envy them their prosperity, lest thou be tempted to 
 fall in with them and to take the same evil course that they take to 
 enrich and advance themselves or some desperate course to avoid them 
 and their power." Note, A fretful discontented spirit lies open to many 
 temptations; and those that indulge it are in danger of doing evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The foregoing reasons, taken from the approaching ruin of the 
 wicked notwithstanding their prosperity, and the real happiness of the 
 righteous notwithstanding their troubles, are here much enlarged upon
 and the same things repeated in a pleasing variety of expression. We
 were cautioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 not to envy the wicked either worldly prosperity or the success of
 their plots against the righteous, and the reasons here given respect 
 these two temptations severally:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Good people have no reason to envy the worldly prosperity of wicked 
 people, nor to grieve or be uneasy at it, 

 (1.) Because the prosperity of the wicked will soon be at an end 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:9"><I>v.</I>  9</A>):

 <I>Evil-doers shall be cut off</I> by some sudden stroke of divine
 justice in the midst of their prosperity; what they have got by sin 
 will not only flow away from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:28">Job xx. 28</A>),

 but they shall be carried away with it. See the end of these men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>),

 how dear their ill-got gain will cost them, and you will be far from
 envying them or from being willing to espouse their lot, for better, 
 for worse. Their ruin is sure, and it is very near 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be</I> what they now
 are; <I>they are brought into desolation in a moment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:19">Ps. lxxiii. 19</A>.
 
 Have a little patience, for <I>the Judge stands before the
 door,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:8,9">Jam. v. 8, 9</A>.

 Moderate your passion, <I>for the Lord is at hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:5">Phil. iv. 5</A>.

 And when their ruin comes it will be an utter ruin; he and his shall be
 extirpated; the day that comes shall <I>leave him neither root nor 
 branch</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt diligently consider his place,</I> where but the other
 day he made a mighty figure, but <I>it shall not be,</I> you will not 
 find it; he shall leave nothing valuable, nothing honourable, behind. 
 him. To the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>The wicked shall perish;</I> their death is their perdition, because
 it is the termination of all their joy and a passage to endless misery. 
 <I>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord;</I> but undone, for ever 
 undone, are the dead that die in their sins. The wicked are the enemies 
 of the Lord; such those make themselves who will not have him to reign 
 over them, and as such he will reckon with them: <I>They shall consume 
 as the fat of lambs, they shall consume into smoke.</I> Their 
 prosperity, which gratifies their sensuality, is like the fat of lambs, 
 not solid or substantial, but loose and washy; and, when their ruin 
 comes, they shall fall as sacrifices to the justice of God and be 
 consumed as the fat of the sacrifices was upon the altar, whence it 
 ascended in smoke. The day of God's vengeance on the wicked is 
 represented as a <I>sacrifice of the fat of the kidneys of rams</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:6">Isa. xxxiv. 6</A>);

 for he will be honoured by the ruin of his enemies, as he was by the
 sacrifices. Damned sinners are sacrifices,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:49">Mark ix. 49</A>.

 This is a good reason why we should not envy them their prosperity;
 while they are fed to the full, they are but in the fattening for the 
 day of sacrifice, <I>like a lamb in a large place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16">Hos. iv. 16</A>),

 and the more they prosper the more will God be glorified in their ruin.

 (2.) Because the condition of the righteous, even in this life, is 
 every way better and more desirable than that of the wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 In general, <I>a little that a righteous man has</I> of the honour,
 wealth, and pleasure of this world, <I>is better than the riches of 
 many wicked.</I> Observe,

 [1.] The wealth of the world is so dispensed by the divine Providence 
 that it is often the lot of good people to have but a little of it, and 
 of wicked people to have abundance of it; for thus God would show us 
 that the things of this world are not the best things, for, if they 
 were, those would have most that are best and dearest to God. 

 [2.] That a godly man's little is really better than a wicked man's 
 estate, though ever so much; for it comes from a better hand, from a 
 hand of special love and not merely from a hand of common 
 providence,--it is enjoyed by a better title (God gives it to them by 
 promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:18">Gal.  iii. 18</A>),

 --it is theirs by virtue of their relation to Christ, who is the heir
 of all things,--and it is put to better use; it is sanctified to them 
 by the blessing of God. <I>Unto the pure all things are pure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 A little wherewith God is served and honoured is better than a great
 deal prepared for Baal or for a base lust. The promises here made to
 the righteous secure them such a happiness that they need not envy the
 prosperity of evil-doers. Let them know to their comfort, <I>First,</I>
 That <I>they shall inherit the earth,</I> as much of it as Infinite
 Wisdom sees good for them; they have the promise of the <I>life that
 now is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8">1 Tim. iv. 8</A>.

 If all the earth were necessary to make them happy, they should have
 it.  All is theirs, even <I>the world,</I> and <I>things present,</I> 
 as well as <I>things to come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:21,22">1 Cor. iii. 21, 22</A>.

 They have it by inheritance, a safe and honourable title, not by
 permission only and connivance. When evil-doers are cut off the 
 righteous sometimes inherit what they gathered.  <I>The wealth of the 
 sinner is laid up for the just,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:17,Pr+13:22">Job xxvii. 17; Prov. xiii. 22</A>.

 This promise is here made, 

 1. To those that live a life of faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:9"><I>v.</I>  9</A>);

 <I>Those that wait upon the Lord,</I> as dependents on him, expectants
 from him, and suppliants to him, <I>shall inherit the earth,</I> as a 
 token of his present favour to them and an earnest of better things 
 intended for them in the other world. God is a good Master, that 
 provides plentifully and well, not only for his working servants, but 
 for his waiting servants.

 2. To those that live a quiet and peaceable life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The meek shall inherit the earth.</I> They are in least danger of
 being injured and disturbed in the possession of what they have and 
 they have most satisfaction in themselves and consequently the sweetest 
 relish of their creature-comforts. Our Saviour has made this a gospel 
 promise, and a confirmation of the blessings he pronounced on the meek,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:5">Matt. v. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That they <I>shall delight themselves in the abundance
 of peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Perhaps they have not abundance of wealth to delight in; but they have
 that which is better, abundance of peace, inward peace and tranquility 
 of mind, peace with God, and then peace in God, that great peace which 
 those have that love God's law, whom <I>nothing shall offend</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:165">Ps.  cxix. 165</A>),

 that abundance of peace which is in the kingdom of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:7">Ps. lxxii. 7</A>),

 that peace which the world cannot give

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27">John xiv. 27</A>),

 and which the wicked cannot have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:21">Isa.  lvii. 21</A>.

 This they shall delight themselves in, and in it they shall have a
 continual feast; while those that have abundance of wealth do but 
 cumber and perplex themselves with it and have little delight in it.  
 <I>Thirdly,</I> That God <I>knows their days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He takes particular notice of them, of all they do and of all that
 happens to them. He keeps account of the days of their service, and not 
 one day's work shall go unrewarded, and of the days of their suffering, 
 that for those also they may receive a recompence. He knows their 
 bright days, and has pleasure in their prosperity; he knows their 
 cloudy and dark days, the days of their affliction, and as the day is 
 so shall the strength be.  <I>Fourthly,</I> That <I>their inheritance 
 shall be for ever;</I> not their inheritance in the earth, but that 
 incorruptible indefeasible one which is laid up for them in heaven. 
 Those that are sure of an everlasting inheritance in the other world 
 have no reason to envy the wicked their transitory possessions and 
 pleasures in this world.  <I>Fifthly,</I> That in the worst of times it 
 shall go well with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They shall not be ashamed</I> of their hope and confidence in God,
 nor of the profession they have made of religion; for the comfort of 
 that will stand them in stead, and be a real support to them, in evil 
 times. When others droop they shall lift up their heads with joy and 
 confidence: Even <I>in the days of famine,</I> when others are dying 
 for hunger round about them, <I>they shall be satisfied,</I> as Elijah 
 was; in some way or other God will provide food convenient for them, or 
 give them hearts to be satisfied and content without it, so that, if 
 they should be hardly bestead and hungry, they shall not (as the wicked 
 do) <I>fret themselves and curse their king and their God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:21">Isa.  vii. 21</A>),

 but rejoice in God as the God of their salvation even when <I>the
 fig-tree does not blossom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Good people have no reason to fret at the occasional success of the 
 designs of the wicked against the just. Though they do bring some of 
 their wicked devices to pass, which makes us fear they will gain their 
 point and bring them all to pass, yet let us cease from anger, and not 
 fret ourselves so as to think of giving up the cause.  For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their plots will be their shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 It is true <I>the wicked plotteth against the just;</I> there is a
 rooted enmity in the seed of the wicked one against the righteous seed; 
 their aim is, if they can, to destroy their righteousness, or, if that 
 fail, then to destroy them. With this end in view they have acted with 
 a great deal both of cursed policy and contrivance (they plot, they 
 practice, against the just), and of cursed zeal and fury--<I>they gnash 
 upon them with their teeth,</I> so desirous are they, if they could get 
 it into their power, to eat them up, and so full of rage and 
 indignation are they because it is not in their power; but by all this 
 they do but make themselves ridiculous. <I>The Lord shall laugh at 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4,5">Ps. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 They are proud and insolent, but God shall pour contempt upon them. He
 is not only displeased with them, but he despises them and all their 
 attempts as vain and ineffectual, and their malice as impotent and in a 
 chain; <I>for he sees that his day is coming,</I> that is, 

 [1.] The day of God's reckoning, the day of the revelation of his 
 righteousness, which now seems clouded and eclipsed. Men have their day 
 now. <I>This is your hour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:53">Luke xxii. 53</A>.

 But God will have his day shortly, a day of recompences, a day which
 will set all to rights, and render that ridiculous which now passes for 
 glorious. <I>It is a small thing to be judged of man's judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3">1 Cor. iv. 3</A>.

 God's day will give a decisive judgment. 

 [2.] The day of their ruin.  The wicked man's day, the day set for his 
 fall, that day <I>is coming,</I> which denotes delay; it has not yet 
 come, but certainly it will come. The believing prospect of that day 
 will enable the virgin, the daughter of Zion, to despise the rage of 
 her enemies and <I>laugh them to scorn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their attempts will be their destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 See here,
 
 [1.] How cruel they are in their designs against good people. They 
 prepare instruments of death, <I>the sword</I> and <I>the bow,</I> no 
 less will serve; they hunt for the precious life. That which they 
 design is <I>to cast down and slay;</I> it is the blood of the saints 
 they thirst after. They carry on the design very far, and it is near to 
 be put in execution: They <I>have drawn the sword, and bent the 
 bow;</I> and all these military preparations are made against the 
 helpless, <I>the poor and needy</I> (which proves them to be very 
 cowardly), and against the guiltless, <I>such as are of upright 
 conversation,</I> that never gave them any provocation, nor offered 
 injury to them or any other person, which proves them to be very 
 wicked. Uprightness itself will be no fence against their malice. But, 
 
 [2.] How justly their malice recoils upon themselves: <I>Their sword 
 shall turn into their own heart,</I> which implies the preservation of 
 the righteous from their malice and the filling up of the measure of 
 their own iniquity by it. Sometimes that very thing proves to be their 
 own destruction which they projected against their harmless neighbours; 
 however, God's sword, which their provocations have drawn against them, 
 will give them their death's wound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Those that are not suddenly cut off shall yet be so disabled for 
 doing any further mischief that the interests of the church shall be 
 effectually secured: <I>Their bows shall be broken</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 the instruments of their cruelty shall fail them and they shall lose
 those whom they had made tools of to serve their bloody purposes with;
 nay, <I>their arms shall be broken,</I> so that they shall not be able 
 to go on with their enterprises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>But the Lord upholds the righteous,</I> so that they neither sink
 under the weight of their afflictions nor are crushed by the violence 
 of their enemies. He upholds them both in their integrity and in their 
 prosperity; and those that are so upheld by the rock of ages have no 
 reason to envy the wicked the support of their broken reeds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses are much to the same purport with the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1-20">foregoing verses</A>

 of this psalm, for it is a subject worthy to be dwelt upon. Observe
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is required of us as the way to our happiness, which we may 
 learn both from the characters here laid down and from the directions 
 here given. If we would be blessed of God, 

 1. We must make conscience of giving every body his own; for <I>the
 wicked borrows and pays not again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is the first thing which the Lord our God requires of us, that we do
 justly, and render to all their due. It is not only a shameful paltry 
 thing, but a sinful wicked thing, not to repay what we have borrowed.  
 Some make this an instance, not so much of the wickedness of the wicked 
 as of the misery and poverty to which they are reduced by the just 
 judgment of God, that they shall be necessitated to borrow for their 
 supply and then be in no capacity to repay it again, and so lie at the 
 mercy of their creditors.  Whatever some men seem to think of it, as it 
 is a great sin for those that are able to deny the payment of their 
 just debts, so it is a great misery not to be able to pay them.

 2. We must be ready to all acts of charity and beneficence; for, as it 
 is an instance of God's goodness to the righteous that he puts it into 
 the power of his hand to be kind and to do good (and so some understand 
 it, God's blessing increases his little to such a degree that he has 
 abundance to spare for the relief of others), so it is an instance of 
 the goodness of the righteous man that he has a heart proportionable to 
 his estate: <I>He shows mercy, and gives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>He is ever merciful,</I> or every day, or all the day, merciful,
 <I>and lends,</I> and sometimes there is as true charity in lending as 
 in giving; and giving and lending are acceptable to God when they 
 proceed from a merciful disposition in the heart, which, if it be 
 sincere, will be constant, and will keep us from being weary of 
 well-doing. He that is truly merciful will be ever merciful.

 3. We must leave our sins, and engage in the practice of serious
 godliness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:27"><I>v.</I>  27</A>):

 <I>Depart from evil and do good.</I> Cease to do evil and abhor it;
 learn to do well and cleave to it; this is true religion.

 4. We must abound in good discourse, and with our tongues must glorify 
 God and edify others. It is part of the character of a righteous man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:30"><I>v.</I>  30</A>)

 that his <I>mouth speaketh wisdom;</I> not only he speaks wisely, but
 he speaks wisdom, like Solomon himself, for the instruction of those 
 about him. <I>His tongue talks</I> not of things idle and impertinent, 
 but <I>of judgment,</I> that is, of the word and providence of God and 
 the rules of wisdom for the right ordering of the conversation. Out of 
 the abundance of a good heart will the mouth speak that which is good 
 and to the use of edifying.

 5. We must have our wills brought into an entire subjection to the will
 and word of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:31"><I>v.</I>  31</A>):

 <I>The law of God,</I> of his God, <I>is in his heart;</I> and in vain
 do we pretend that God is our God if we do not receive his law into our 
 hearts and resign ourselves to the government of it. It is but a jest 
 and a mockery to speak wisdom, and to talk of judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 unless we have the law in our hearts, and we think as we speak. The law
 of God must be a commanding ruling principle in the heart; it must be a 
 light there, a spring there, and then the conversation will be regular 
 and uniform: <I>None of his steps will slide;</I> it will effectually 
 prevent backsliding into sin, and the uneasiness that follows from 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is assured to us, as instances of our happiness and comfort, 
 upon these conditions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we shall have the blessing of God, and that blessing shall be 
 the spring, and sweetness, and security of all our temporal comforts 
 and enjoyments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Such as are blessed of God,</I> as all the righteous are, with a
 Father's blessing, by virtue of that <I>shall inherit the earth,</I> or
 <I>the land</I> (for so the same word is translated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 the land of Canaan, that glory of all lands. Our creature-comforts are
 comforts indeed to us when we see them flowing from the blessing of 
 God, we are sure not to want any thing that is good for us in this 
 world. <I>The earth shall yield us her increase</I> if God, as <I>our 
 own God, give us his blessing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6">Ps. lxvii. 6</A>.

 And as <I>those whom God blesses are</I> thus <I>blessed indeed (for
 they shall inherit the land</I>), so <I>those whom he curses are cursed 
 indeed;</I> they <I>shall be cut off</I> and rooted out, and their 
 extirpation by the divine curse will set off the establishment of the 
 righteous by the divine blessing and be a foil to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God will direct and dispose of our actions and affairs so as 
 may be most for his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.</I> By his grace
 and Holy Spirit he directs the thoughts, affections, and designs of 
 good men.  He has all hearts in his hand, but theirs by their own 
 consent. By his providence he overrules the events that concern them, 
 so as to make their way plain before them, both what they should do and 
 what they may expect.  Observe, God orders the steps of a good man; not 
 only his way in general, by his written word, but his particular steps, 
 by the whispers of conscience, saying, <I>This is the way, walk in 
 it.</I> He does not always show him his way at a distance, but leads 
 him step by step, as children are led, and so keeps him in a continual 
 dependence upon his guidance; and this,

 (1.) Because <I>he delights in his way,</I> and is well pleased with 
 the paths of righteousness wherein he walks. <I>The Lord knows the way 
 of the righteous</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">Ps. i. 6</A>),

 knows it with favour, and therefore directs it. 

 (2.) That he may delight in his way.  Because God orders his way 
 according to his own will, therefore he delights in it; for, as he 
 loves his own image upon us, so he is well pleased with what we do 
 under his guidance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God will keep us from being ruined by our falls either into sin
 or into trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down.</I>

 (1.) A good man may be overtaken in a fault, but the grace of God shall 
 recover him to repentance, so that he shall not be utterly cast down. 
 Though he may, for a time, lose the joys of God's salvation, yet they 
 shall be restored to him; for God shall uphold him with his hand, 
 uphold him with his free Spirit. The root shall be kept alive, though 
 the leaf wither; and there will come a spring after the winter. 

 (2.) A good man may be in distress, his affairs embarrassed, his 
 spirits sunk, but he shall not be utterly cast down; God will be the 
 strength of his heart when his flesh and heart fail, and will uphold 
 him with his comforts, so that the spirit he has made shall not fail 
 before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That we shall not want the necessary supports of this life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>I have been young and now am old,</I> and, among all the changes I
 have seen in men's outward condition and the observations I have made 
 upon them, <I>I never saw the righteous forsaken</I> of God and man, as 
 I have sometimes seen wicked people abandoned both by heaven and earth; 
 nor do I ever remember to have seen the seed of the righteous reduced 
 to such an extremity as to beg their bread." David had himself begged 
 his bread of Abimelech the priest, but it was when Saul hunted him; and 
 our Saviour has taught us to except the case of persecution for 
 righteousness' sake out of all the temporal promises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:30">Mark x. 30</A>),

 because that has such peculiar honours and comforts attending it as 
 make it rather a gift (as the apostle reckons it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>)

 than a loss or grievance. But there are very few instances of good men,
 or their families, that are reduced to such extreme poverty as many 
 wicked people bring themselves to by their wickedness. He had not 
 <I>seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread. 
 Forsaken</I> (so some expound it); if they do want God will raise them 
 up friends to supply them, without a scandalous exposing of themselves 
 to the reproach of common beggars; or, if they go from door to door for 
 meat, it shall not be with despair, as the wicked man <I>that wanders 
 abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:23">Job xv. 23</A>.

 Nor shall he be denied, as the prodigal, that <I>would fain have filled
 his belly, but no man gave unto him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:16">Luke xv. 16</A>.

 Nor shall he grudge if he be not satisfied, as David's enemies, when
 they <I>wandered up and down for meat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:15">Ps. lix. 15</A>.

 Some make this promise relate especially to those that are charitable
 and liberal to the poor, and to intimate that David never observed any
 that brought themselves to poverty by their charity.  It is
 <I>withholding more than is meet that tends to poverty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:24">Prov. xi. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That God will not desert us, but graciously protect us in our 
 difficulties and straits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>The Lord loves judgment;</I> he delights in doing justice himself
 and he delights in those that do justice; and therefore he forsakes not 
 his saints in affliction when others make themselves strange to them 
 and become shy of them, but he takes care that they be <I>preserved for 
 ever,</I> that is, that the saint in every age be taken under his 
 protection, that the succession be preserved to the end of time, and 
 that particular saints be preserved from all the temptations and 
 through all the trials of this present time, to that happiness which 
 shall be for ever. He will <I>preserve them to his heavenly 
 kingdom;</I> that is a preservation for ever,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2Ti+4:18,Ps+12:7">2 Tim.  iv. 18; Ps. xii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That we shall have a comfortable settlement in this world, and in a 
 better when we leave this. That we shall <I>dwell for evermore</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and not be <I>cut off</I> as the <I>seed of the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 Those shall not be tossed that make God their rest and are at home in
 him. But on this earth there is no dwelling for ever, no continuing 
 city; it is in heaven only, that city which has foundations, that the 
 righteous shall dwell for ever; that will be their everlasting 
 habitation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That we shall not become a prey to our adversaries, who seek our 
 ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 There is an adversary that takes all opportunities to do us a mischief,
 a wicked one that watches the righteous (as a roaring lion watches his 
 prey) and seeks to slay him. There are wicked men that do so, that are 
 very subtle (they watch the righteous, that they may have an 
 opportunity to do them a mischief effectually and may have a pretence 
 wherewith to justify themselves in the doing of it), and very spiteful, 
 for they seek to slay him. But it may very well be applied to the 
 wicked one, the devil, that old serpent, who has his wiles to entrap 
 the righteous, his devices which we should not be ignorant of,--that 
 great red dragon, who seeks to slay them,--that roaring lion, who goes 
 about continually, restless and raging, and seeking whom he may devour. 
 But it is here promised that he shall not prevail, neither Satan nor 
 his instruments.

 (1.) He shall not prevail as a field-adversary: <I>The Lord will not 
 leave him in his hand;</I> he will not permit Satan to do what he 
 would, nor will he withdraw his strength and grace from his people, but 
 will enable them to resist and overcome him, and <I>their faith shall 
 not fail,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31,32">Luke xxii. 31, 32</A>.

 A good man may fall into the hands of a messenger of Satan, and be
 sorely buffeted, but God will not leave him in his hands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.

 (2.) He shall not prevail as a law-adversary: <I>God will not condemn
 him when he is judged,</I> though urged to do it by the accuser of the 
 brethren, who <I>accuses them before our God day and night.</I> His 
 false accusations will be thrown out, as those exhibited against Joshua 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:1,2">Zech.  iii. 1, 2</A>),

 <I>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan! It is God that justifies,</I> and
 then <I>who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  Wait on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee
 to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
 <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 35  I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
 like a green bay tree.
 &nbsp; 36  Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <I>was</I> not: yea, I sought
 him, but he could not be found.
 &nbsp; 37  Mark the perfect <I>man,</I> and behold the upright: for the end
 of <I>that</I> man <I>is</I> peace.
 &nbsp; 38  But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end
 of the wicked shall be cut off.

 deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust
 in him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist's conclusion of this sermon (for that is the nature of 
 this poem) is of the same purport with the whole, and inculcates the 
 same things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duty here pressed upon us is still the same 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Wait on the Lord and keep his way.</I> Duty is ours, and we must
 mind it and make conscience of it, keep God's way and never turn out of 
 it nor loiter in it, keep close, keep going; but events are God's and 
 we must refer ourselves to him for the disposal of them; we must wait 
 on the Lord, attend the motions of his providence, carefully observe 
 them, and conscientiously accommodate ourselves to them. If we make 
 conscience of <I>keeping God's way,</I> we may with cheerfulness wait 
 on him and commit to him our way; and we shall find him a good Master 
 both to his working servants and to his waiting servants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons to enforce this duty are much the same too, taken from 
 the certain destruction of the wicked and the certain salvation of the 
 righteous. This good man, being tempted to envy the prosperity of the 
 wicked, that he might fortify himself against the temptation, <I>goes 
 into the sanctuary of God</I> and leads us thither 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>);

 there he understands their end, and thence gives us to understand it,
 and, by comparing that with the end of the righteous, baffles the 
 temptation and puts it to silence. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The misery of the wicked at last, however they may prosper awhile: 
 <I>The end of the wicked shall be cut off</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>);

 and that cannot be well that will undoubtedly end so ill. The wicked,
 in their end, will be cut off from all good and all hopes of it; a 
 final period will be put to all their joys, and they will be for ever 
 separated from the fountain of life to all evil.

 (1.) Some instances of the remarkable ruin of wicked people David had 
 himself observed in this world--that the pomp and prosperity of sinners 
 would not secure them from the judgments of God when their day should 
 come to fall 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:36,35"><I>v.</I> 36, 35</A>):

 <I>I have seen a wicked man</I> (the word is singular), suppose Saul or
 Ahithophel (for David was an old man when he penned this psalm), <I>in
 great power, formidable</I> (so some render it), <I>the terror of the
 mighty in the land of the living,</I> carrying all before him with a
 high hand, and seeming to be firmly fixed and finely flourishing,
 <I>spreading himself like a green bay-tree,</I> which produces all
 leaves and no fruit; like a native home-born Israelite (so Dr.
 Hammond), likely to take root. But what became of him? Eliphaz, long
 before, had learned, when he saw the foolish taking root, to curse his
 habitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3">Job v. 3</A>.

 And David saw cause for it; for this bay-tree withered away as soon as
 the fig-tree.  Christ cursed: <I>He passed away as a dream,</I> as a 
 shadow, such was he and all the pomp and power he was so proud of. He 
 was gone in an instant: <I>He was not; I sought him</I> with wonder, 
 <I>but he could not be found.</I> He had acted his part and then 
 quitted the stage, and there was no miss of him.

 (2.) The total and final ruin of sinners, of all sinners, will shortly 
 be made as much a spectacle to the saints as they are now sometimes 
 made a spectacle to the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>When the wicked are cut off</I> (and cut off they certainly will be)
 <I>thou shalt see it,</I> with awful adorations of the divine justice. 
 <I>The transgressors shall be destroyed together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 In this world God singles out here one sinner and there another, out of
 many, to be made an example <I>in terrorem--as a warning;</I> but in 
 the day of judgment there will be a general destruction of all the 
 transgressors, and not one shall escape.  Those that have sinned 
 together shall be damned together. <I>Bind them in bundles, to burn 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The blessedness of the righteous, at last. Let us see what will be 
 the end of God's poor despised people. 

 (1.) Preferment. There have been times the iniquity of which has been 
 such that men's piety has hindered their preferment in this world, and 
 put them quite out of the way of raising estates; but those that keep 
 God's way may be assured that in due time he will <I>exalt them, to 
 inherit the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 he will advance them to a place in the heavenly mansions, to dignity,
 and honour, and true wealth, in the New Jerusalem, to inherit that good 
 land, that land of promise, of which Canaan was a type; he will exalt 
 them above all contempt and danger.

 (2.) Peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Let all people <I>mark the perfect man, and behold the upright;</I>
 take notice of him to admire him and imitate him, keep your eye upon 
 him to observe what comes of him, and you will find that <I>the end of 
 that man is peace.</I> Sometimes the latter end of his days proves more 
 comfortable to him than the beginning was; the storms blow over, and he 
 is comforted again, after the time that he was afflicted. However, if 
 all his days continue dark and cloudy, perhaps his dying day may prove 
 comfortable to him and his sun may set in brightness; or, if it should 
 set under a cloud, yet his future state will be peace, everlasting 
 peace. Those that walk in their uprightness while they live shall enter 
 into peace when they die,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:2">Isa. lvii. 2</A>.

 A peaceful death has concluded the troublesome life of many a good man;
 and all is well that thus ends everlastingly well. Balaam himself
 wished that his death and his last end might be like that of the
 righteous 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:10">Num. xxiii. 10</A>.

 (3.) Salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:39,40"><I>v.</I>  39, 40</A>.

 <I>The salvation of the righteous</I> (which may be applied to the
 great salvation of which <I>the prophets enquired and searched 
 diligently,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>)

 <I>is of the Lord;</I> it will be the Lord's doing. The eternal
 salvation, that salvation of God which those shall see that <I>order 
 their conversation aright</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">Ps. l. 23</A>),

 is likewise of the Lord.  And he that intends Christ and heaven for
 them will be a God all-sufficient to them: <I>He is their strength in 
 time of trouble,</I> to support them under it and carry them through 
 it.  <I>He shall help them and deliver them,</I> help them to do their 
 duties, to bear their burdens, and to maintain their spiritual 
 conflicts, help them to bear their troubles well and get good by them, 
 and, in due time, shall deliver them out of their troubles. He shall 
 deliver them from the wicked that would overwhelm them and swallow them 
 up, shall secure them there, where the wicked cease from troubling. He 
 shall <I>save them,</I> not only keep them safe, but make them happy, 
 <I>because they trust in him,</I> not because they have merited it from 
 him, but because they have committed themselves to him and reposed a 
 confidence in him, and have thereby honoured him.</P>
