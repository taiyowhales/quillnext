 Poor Job's wound's were yet bleeding, his sore still runs and ceases 
 not, but none of his friends bring him any oil, any balm; Zophar, the 
 third, pours into them as much vinegar as the two former had done. 

 I.  He exhibits a very high charge against Job, as proud and false in
 justifying himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He appeals to God for his conviction, and begs that God would take
 him to task

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:5">ver. 5</A>)

 and that Job might be made sensible, 

 1. Of God's unerring wisdom and his inviolable justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:6">ver. 6</A>.

 2. Of his unsearchable perfections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 3. Of his incontestable sovereignty and uncontrollable power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:10">ver. 10</A>.
 
 4. Of the cognizance he takes of the children of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 III.  He assures him that, upon his repentance and reformation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>),

 God would restore him to his former prosperity and safety

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>);

 but that, if he were wicked it was in vain to expect it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:20">ver. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
 man full of talk be justified?
 &nbsp; 3  Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
 mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
 &nbsp; 4  For thou hast said, My doctrine <I>is</I> pure, and I am clean in
 thine eyes.
 &nbsp; 5  But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
 &nbsp; 6  And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that <I>they
 are</I> double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of
 thee <I>less</I> than thine iniquity <I>deserveth.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is sad to see what intemperate passions even wise and good men are 
 sometimes betrayed into by the heat of disputation, of which Zophar 
 here is an instance. Eliphaz began with a very modest preface, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>.

 Bildad was a little more rough upon Job, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:2"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2</A>.

 But Zophar falls upon him without mercy, and gives him very bad
 language: <I>Should a man full of talk be justified? And should thy 
 lies make men hold their peace?</I> Is this the way to comfort Job? No, 
 nor to convince him neither. Does this become one that appears as an 
 advocate for God and his justice? <I>Tant&aelig;ne animis coelestibus
 ir&aelig;?--In heavenly breasts can such resentment dwell?</I> Those that
 engage in controversy will find it very hard to keep their temper. All 
 the wisdom, caution, and resolution they have will be little enough to 
 prevent their breaking out into such indecencies as we here find Zophar 
 guilty of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He represents Job otherwise than what he was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He would have him thought idle and impertinent in his discourse, and
 one that loved to hear himself talk; he gives him the lie, and calls 
 him <I>a mocker;</I> and all this that it might be looked upon as a 
 piece of justice to chastise him. Those that have a mind to fall out 
 with their brethren, and to fall foul upon them, find it necessary to 
 put the worst colours they can upon them and their performances, and, 
 right or wrong, to make them odious. We have read and considered Job's 
 discourses in the foregoing chapters, and have found them full of good 
 sense and much to the purpose, that his principles are right, his 
 reasonings strong, many of his expressions weighty and very 
 considerable, and that what there is in them of heat and passion a 
 little candour and charity will excuse and overlook; and yet Zophar 
 here invidiously represents him,

 1. As a man that never considered what he said, but uttered what came 
 uppermost, only to make a noise with the multitude of words, hoping by 
 that means to carry his cause and run down his reprovers: <I>Should not 
 the multitude of words be answered?</I> Truly, sometimes it is no great 
 matter whether it be or no; silence perhaps is the best confutation of 
 impertinence and puts the greatest contempt upon it. <I>Answer not a 
 fool according to his folly.</I> But, if it be answered, let reason and 
 grace have the answering of it, not pride and passion. <I>Should a man 
 full of talk</I> (margin, <I>a man of lips,</I> that is all tongue, 
 <I>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil--mere voice</I>) <I>be justified?</I> Should
 he be justified in his loquacity, as in effect he is if he be not 
 reproved for it? No, for <I>in the multitude of words there wanteth not 
 sin.</I> Should he be justified by it? Shall many words pass for valid 
 pleas?  Shall he carry the day with the flourishes of language? No, he 
 shall not be accepted with God, or any wise men, <I>for his much 
 speaking,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:7">Matt. vi. 7</A>.

 2. As a man that made no conscience of what he said--a liar, and one
 that hoped by the impudence of lies to silence his adversaries 
 (<I>should thy lies make men hold their peace?</I>)--a mocker, one that 
 bantered all mankind, and knew how to put false colours upon any thing, 
 and was not ashamed to impose upon every one that talked with him: 
 <I>When thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed?</I> Is it not time 
 to speak, to stem such a violent tide as this? Job was not mad, but 
 spoke the words of truth and soberness, and yet was thus 
 misrepresented. Eliphaz and Bildad had answered him, and said what they 
 could to make him ashamed; it was therefore no instance of Zophar's 
 generosity to set upon a man so violently who was already thus 
 harassed. Here were three matched against one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charges Job with saying that which he had not said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Thou hast said, My doctrine is pure.</I> And what if he had said so? 
 It was true that Job was sound in the faith, and orthodox in his 
 judgment, and spoke better of God than his friends did. If he had 
 expressed himself unwarily, yet it did not therefore follow but that 
 his doctrine was true. But he charges him with saying, <I>I am clean in 
 thy eyes.</I> Job had not said so: he had indeed said, <I>Thou knowest 
 that I am not wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:7"><I>ch.</I> x. 7</A>);

 but he had also said, <I>I have sinned,</I> and never pretended to a
 spotless perfection. He had indeed maintained that he was not a 
 hypocrite as they charged him; but to infer thence that he would not 
 own himself a sinner was an unfair insinuation. We ought to put the 
 best construction on the words and actions of our brethren that they 
 will bear; but contenders are tempted to put the worst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He appeals to God, and wishes him to appear against Job. So very 
 confident is he that Job is in the wrong that nothing will serve him 
 but that God must immediately appear to silence and condemn him. We are 
 commonly ready with too much assurance to interest God in our quarrels, 
 and to conclude that, if he would but speak, he would take our part and 
 speak for us, as Zophar here: <I>O that God would speak!</I> for he 
 would certainly <I>open his lips against thee;</I> whereas, when God 
 did speak, he opened his lips for Job against his three friends. We 
 ought indeed to leave all controversies to be determined by the 
 judgment of God, which we are sure <I>is according to truth;</I> but 
 those are not always in the right who are most forward to appeal to 
 that judgment and prejudge it against their antagonists. Zophar 
 despairs to convince Job himself, and therefore desires God would 
 convince him of two things which it is good for every one of us duly to 
 consider, and under all our afflictions cheerfully to confess:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The unsearchable depth of God's counsels. Zophar cannot pretend to 
 do it, but he desires that God himself would show Job so much of the 
 secrets of the divine wisdom as might convince him that <I>they are at 
 least double to that which is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) There are secrets in the divine wisdom, <I>arcana 
 imperii--state-secrets.</I> God's way is in the sea. Clouds and 
 darkness are round about him. He has reasons of state which we cannot 
 fathom and must not pry into. 

 (2.) What we know of God is nothing to what we cannot know. What is 
 hidden is more than double to what appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9">Eph. iii. 9</A>.

 (3.) By employing ourselves in adoring the depth of those divine 
 counsels of which we cannot find the bottom we shall very much 
 tranquilize our minds under the afflicting hand of God. 

 (4.) God knows a great deal more evil of us than we do of ourselves; so 
 some understand it. When God gave David a sight and sense of sin he 
 said that he had <I>in the hidden part made him to know wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:6">Ps. li. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The unexceptionable justice of his proceedings. "Know therefore 
 that, how sore soever the correction is that thou art under, <I>God 
 exacteth of thee less than thy iniquity deserves,</I>" or (as some read 
 it), "he <I>remits thee part of thy iniquity,</I> and does not deal 
 with thee according to the full demerit of it." Note, 

 (1.) When the debt of duty is not paid it is justice to insist upon the 
 debt of punishment. 

 (2.) Whatever punishment is inflicted upon us in this world we must own 
 that it is less than our iniquities deserve, and therefore, instead of 
 complaining of our troubles, we must be thankful that we are out of 
 hell,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
 Almighty unto perfection?
 &nbsp; 8  <I>It is</I> as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
 hell; what canst thou know?
 &nbsp; 9  The measure thereof <I>is</I> longer than the earth, and broader
 than the sea.
 &nbsp; 10  If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
 hinder him?
 &nbsp; 11  For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he
 not then consider <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 12  For vain man would be wise, though man be born <I>like</I> a wild
 ass's colt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Zophar here speaks very good things concerning God and his greatness 
 and glory, concerning man and his vanity and folly: these two compared 
 together, and duly considered, will have a powerful influence upon our 
 submission to all the dispensations of the divine Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here what God is, and let him be adored.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is an incomprehensible Being, infinite and immense, whose nature 
 and perfections our finite understandings cannot possibly form any 
 adequate conceptions of, and whose counsels and actings we cannot 
 therefore, without the greatest presumption, pass a judgment upon. We 
 that are so little acquainted with the divine nature are incompetent 
 judges of the divine providence; and, when we censure the dispensations 
 of it, we talk of things that we do not understand. We cannot find out 
 God; how dare we then find fault with him? Zophar here shows, 

 (1.) That God's nature infinitely exceeds the capacities of our 
 understandings: "<I>Canst thou find out God, find him out to 
 perfection?</I> No, <I>What canst thou do? What canst thou know?</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Thou, a poor, weak, short-sighted creature, a worm of the earth, that
 art but of yesterday? Thou, though ever so inquisitive after him, ever 
 so desirous and industrious to find him out, yet darest thou attempt 
 the search, or canst thou hope to speed in it? We may, by searching 
 find God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27">Acts xvii. 27</A>),

 but we cannot find him out in any thing he is pleased to conceal; we
 may apprehend him, but we cannot comprehend him; we may know that he 
 is, but cannot know what he is. The eye can see the ocean but not see 
 over it.  We may, by a humble, diligent, and believing search, find out 
 something of God, but cannot find him out to perfection; we may know, 
 but cannot know fully, what God is, nor find out his work <I>from the 
 beginning to the end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 11</A>.

 Note, God is unsearchable. The ages of his eternity cannot be numbered,
 nor the spaces of his immensity measured; the depths of his wisdom 
 cannot be fathomed, nor the reaches of his power bounded; the 
 brightness of his glory can never be described, nor the treasures of 
 his goodness reckoned up. This is a good reason why we should always 
 speak of God with humility and caution and never prescribe to him nor 
 quarrel with him, why we should be thankful for what he has revealed of 
 himself and long to be where we shall see him as he is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:9,10">1 Cor. xiii. 9, 10</A>.

 (2.) That it infinitely exceeds the limits of the whole creation: <I>It
 is higher than heaven</I> (so some read it), <I>deeper than hell,</I> 
 the great abyss, <I>longer than the earth, and broader than the 
 sea,</I> many parts of which are to this day undiscovered, and more 
 were then. It is quite out of our reach to comprehend God's nature. 
 <I>Such knowledge is too wonderful for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:6">Ps. cxxxix. 6</A>.

 We cannot fathom God's designs, nor find out the reasons of his
 proceedings. His judgments are a great deep. Paul attributes such 
 immeasurable dimensions to the divine love as Zophar here attributes to 
 the divine wisdom, and yet recommends it to our acquaintance. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:18,19">Eph. iii. 18, 19</A>,

 <I>That you may know the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, of
 the love of Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God is a sovereign Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>If he cut off</I> by death (margin, <I>If he make a change,</I> for 
 death is a change; if he make a change in nations, in families, in the 
 posture of our affairs),--if he <I>shut up</I> in prison, or in the net 
 of affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:11">Ps. lxvi. 11</A>),--

 if he seize any creature as a hunter his prey, he will gather it (so
 bishop Patrick) and who shall force him to restore? or if he <I>gather 
 together,</I> as tares for the fire, or <I>if he gather to himself 
 man's spirit and breath</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:14"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 14</A>),

 <I>then who can hinder him?</I> Who can either arrest the sentence or
 oppose the execution?  Who can control his power or arraign his wisdom 
 and justice? If he that made all out of nothing think fit to reduce all 
 to nothing, or to their first chaos again,--if he that separated between
 light and darkness, dry land and sea, at first, please to gather them 
 together again,--if he that made unmakes, <I>who can turn him away,</I>
 alter his mind or stay his hand, impede or impeach his proceedings?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God is a strict and just observer of the children of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He knows vain men.</I> We know little of him, but he knows us 
 perfectly: <I>He sees wickedness also,</I> not to approve it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13">Hab. i. 13</A>),

 but to animadvert upon it.

 (1.) He observes vain men. Such all are (<I>every man, at his best 
 estate, is altogether vanity</I>), and he considers it in his dealings 
 with them. He knows what the projects and hopes of vain men are, and 
 can blast and defeat them, the workings of their foolish fancies; he 
 sits in heaven, and laughs at them. He takes knowledge of the vanity of 
 men (that is, their little sins; so some) their vain thoughts and vain 
 words, and unsteadiness in that which is good. 

 (2.) He observes bad men: <I>He sees</I> gross <I>wickedness also,</I> 
 though committed ever so secretly and ever so artfully palliated and 
 disguised. All the wickedness of the wicked is naked and open before 
 the all-seeing eye of God: <I>Will he not then consider it?</I> Yes, 
 certainly he will, and will reckon for it, though for a time he seem to 
 keep silence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See here what man is, and let him be humbled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 God sees this concerning vain man that he <I>would be wise,</I> would
 be thought so, <I>though he is born like a wild ass's colt,</I> so 
 sottish and foolish, unteachable and untameable. See what man is.

 1. He is a vain creature--<I>empty;</I> so the word is. God made him 
 full, but he emptied himself, impoverished himself, and now he is 
 <I>raca,</I> a creature that has nothing in him. 

 2. He is a foolish creature, has become <I>like the beasts that
 perish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:20,73:22">Ps. xlix. 20, lxxiii. 22</A>),

 an idiot, born like an ass, the most stupid animal, an ass's colt, not
 yet brought to any service. If ever he come to be good for any thing, 
 it is owing to the grace of Christ, who once, in the day of his 
 triumph, served himself by an ass's colt.

 3. He is a wilful ungovernable creature. An ass's colt may be made good 
 for something, but the wild ass's colt will never be reclaimed, nor 
 regards the crying of the driver. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:5-7">Job xxxix. 5-7</A>.

 Man thinks himself as much at liberty, and his own master, as the wild
 ass's colt does, that is <I>used to the wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:24">Jer. ii. 24</A>),

 eager to gratify his own appetites and passions.

 4. Yet he is a proud creature and self-conceited. He <I>would be
 wise,</I> would he thought so, values himself upon the honour of 
 wisdom, though he will not submit to the laws of wisdom. He would be 
 wise, that is, he reaches after forbidden wisdom, and, like his first 
 parents, aiming to be wise above what is written, loses the tree of 
 life for the tree of knowledge. Now is such a creature as this fit to 
 contend with God or call him to an account?  Did we but better know God 
 and ourselves, we should better know how to conduct ourselves towards 
 God.</P>

 wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
 &nbsp; 15  For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
 shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
 &nbsp; 16  Because thou shalt forget <I>thy</I> misery, <I>and</I> remember <I>it</I>
 as waters <I>that</I> pass away:
 &nbsp; 17  And <I>thine</I> age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Zophar, as the other two, here encourages Job to hope for better times 
 if he would but come to a better temper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives him good counsel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),
 
 as Eliphaz did
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>),

 and Bildad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:5"><I>ch.</I> viii. 5</A>.

 He would have him repent and return to God.  Observe the steps of that
 return. 

 1. He must look within, and get his mind changed and the tree made 
 good. He must <I>prepare his heart;</I> there the work of conversion 
 and reformation must begin. The heart that wandered from God must be 
 reduced--that was defiled with sin and put into disorder must be 
 cleansed and put in order again--that was wavering and unfixed must be 
 settled and established; so the word here signifies. The heart is then 
 prepared to seek God when it is determined and fully resolved to make a 
 business of it and to go through with it.  

 2. He must look up, and <I>stretch out his hands towards God,</I> that
 is, must stir up himself to take hold on God, must pray to him with 
 earnestness and importunity, striving in prayer, and with expectation 
 to receive mercy and grace from him. To <I>give the hand to the 
 Lord</I> signifies to yield ourselves to him and to covenant with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:8">2 Chron. xxx. 8</A>.

 This Job must do, and, for the doing of it, must prepare his heart. Job
 had prayed, but Zophar would have him to pray in a better manner, not 
 as an appellant, but as a petitioner and humble suppliant. 

 3. He must amend what was amiss in his own conversation, else his 
 prayers would be ineffectual 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>If iniquity be in thy hand</I> (that is, if there be any sin which 
 thou dost yet live in the practice of) <I>put it far away,</I> forsake 
 it with detestation and a holy indignation, stedfastly resolving not to 
 return to it, nor ever to have any thing more to do with it.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:31,Ho+14:9,Isa+30:22">Ezek. xviii. 31;
 Hos. xiv. 9; Isa. xxx. 22</A>.

 If any of the gains of iniquity, any goods gotten by fraud or
 oppression, be in thy hand, make restitution thereof" (as Zaccheus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:8">Luke xix. 8</A>),

 "and <I>shake thy hands from holding them,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 The guilt of sin is not removed if the gain of sin be not restored.

 4. He must do his utmost to reform his family too: "<I>Let not
 wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles;</I> let not thy house harbour or 
 shelter any wicked persons, any wicked practices, or any wealth gotten 
 by wickedness." He suspected that Job's great household had been 
 ill-governed, and that, where there were many, there were many wicked, 
 and the ruin of his family was the punishment of the wickedness of it; 
 and therefore, if he expected God should return to him, he must reform 
 what was amiss there, and, though wickedness might come into his 
 tabernacles, he must not suffer it to dwell there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3-8">
 Ps. ci. 3</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assures him of comfort if he took this counsel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:15-20"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 &c. If he
 would repent and reform, he should, without doubt, be easy and happy, 
 and all would be well. Perhaps Zophar might insinuate that, unless God 
 did speedily make such a change as this in his condition, he and his 
 friends would be confirmed in their opinion of him as a hypocrite and a 
 dissembler with God. A great truth, however, is conveyed, That, <I>the 
 work of righteousness will be peace, and the effect of righteousness 
 quietness and assurance for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17">Isa. xxxii. 17</A>.

 Those that sincerely turn to God may expect,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A holy confidence towards God: "<I>Then shalt thou lift up thy face 
 towards heaven</I> without spot; thou mayest come boldly to the throne 
 of grace, and not with that terror and amazement expressed," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:34"><I>ch.</I> ix. 34</A>.

 If our hearts condemn us not for hypocrisy and impenitency, then have
 we confidence in our approaches to God and expectations from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21">1 John iii. 21</A>.

 If we are looked upon in the face of the anointed, our faces, that were
 dejected, may be lifted up--that were polluted, being washed with the 
 blood of Christ, may be lifted up without spot. We may <I>draw near in 
 full assurance of faith</I> when we are <I>sprinkled from an evil 
 conscience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>.

 Some understand this of the clearing up of his credit before men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.

 If we make our peace with God, we may with cheerfulness look our
 friends in the face.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A holy composedness in themselves: <I>Thou shalt be stedfast, and 
 shalt not fear,</I> not <I>be afraid of evil tidings,</I> thy heart 
 being fixed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7">Ps. cxii. 7</A>.

 Job was now full of confusion
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:15"><I>ch.</I> x. 15</A>),

 while he looked upon God as his enemy and quarrelled with him; but
 Zophar assures him that, if he would submit and humble himself, his 
 mind would be composed, and he would be freed from those frightful 
 apprehensions he had of God, which put him into such an agitation. The 
 less we are frightened the more we are fixed, and consequently the more 
 fit we are for our services and for our sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A comfortable reflection upon their past troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt forget thy misery,</I> as the mother forgets her 
 travailing pains, for joy that the child is born; thou shalt be 
 perfectly freed from the impressions it makes upon thee, and <I>thou 
 shalt remember it as waters that pass away,</I> or are poured out of a 
 vessel, which leave no taste or tincture behind them, as other liquors 
 do. The wounds of thy present affliction shall be perfectly healed, not 
 only without a remaining scar, but without a remaining pain." Job had 
 endeavoured to forget his complaint

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:27"><I>ch.</I> ix. 27</A>),

 but found he could not; his soul <I>had still in remembrance the
 wormwood and the gall:</I> but here Zophar puts him in a way to forget 
 it; let him by faith and prayer bring his griefs and cares to God, an 
 leave them with him, and then he shall forget them. Where sin sits 
 heavily affliction sits lightly. If we duly remember our sins, we 
 shall, in comparison with them, forget our misery, much more if we 
 obtain the comfort of a sealed pardon and a settled peace. He whose 
 iniquity is forgiven shall <I>not say, I am sick,</I> but shall forget 
 his sickness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:24">Isa. xxxiii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. A comfortable prospect of their future peace. This Zophar here 
 thinks to please Job with, in answer to the many despairing expressions 
 he had used, as if it were to no purpose for him to hope ever to see 
 good days again in this world: "Yea, but thou mayest" (says Zophar) 
 "and good nights too." A blessed change he here puts him in hopes 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That though now his light was eclipsed it should shine out again, 
 and more brightly than ever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),--

 that even his setting sun should out-shine his noon-day sun, and his 
 evening be fair and clear as the morning, in respect both of honour and 
 pleasure.--that his light should shine <I>out of obscurity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:10">Isa. lviii. 10</A>),

 and the thick and dark cloud, from behind which his sun should break
 forth, would serve as a foil to its lustre,--that it should shine even 
 in old age, and those evil days should be good days to him. Note, Those 
 that truly turn to God then begin to shine forth; their path is as the 
 shining light which increases, the period of their day will be the 
 perfection of it, and their evening to this world will be their morning 
 to a better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That, though now he was in a continual fear and terror, he should 
 live in a holy rest and security, and find himself continually safe and 
 easy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be secure, because there is hope.</I> Note, Those who 
 have a good hope, through grace, in God, and of heaven, are certainly 
 safe, and have reason to be secure, how difficult soever the times are 
 through which they pass in this world. He that walks uprightly may thus 
 walk surely, because, though there are trouble and danger, yet there is 
 hope that all will be well at last. Hope is <I>an anchor of the 
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:19">Heb. vi. 19</A>.

 "<I>Thou shalt dig about thee,</I>" that is, "Thou shalt be as safe as
 an army in its entrenchments." Those that submit to God's government 
 shall be taken under his protection, and then they are safe both day 
 and night.

 [1.] By day, when they employ themselves abroad: "<I>Thou shalt dig in 
 safety,</I> thou and thy servants for thee, and not be again set upon 
 by the plunderers, who fell upon thy servants at plough,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:14,15"><I>ch.</I> i. 14, 15</A>.

 It is no part of the promised prosperity that he should live in
 idleness, but that he should have a calling and follow it, and, when he 
 was about the business of it, should be under the divine protection. 
 Thou shalt dig and be safe, not rob and be safe, revel and be safe. The 
 way of duty is the way of safety. 

 [2.] By night, when they repose themselves at home: <I>Thou shalt take 
 thy rest</I> (and <I>the sleep of the labouring man is sweet</I>) <I>in 
 safety,</I> notwithstanding the dangers of the darkness. The pillar of 
 cloud by day shall be a pillar of fire by night: "<I>Thou shalt lie 
 down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 not forced to wander where there is no place to lay thy head on, nor 
 forced to watch and sit up in expectation of assaults; but thou shalt 
 go to bed at bedtime, and not only shall non hurt thee, but none shall 
 make thee afraid nor so much as give thee an alarm." Note, It is a 
 great mercy to have quiet nights and undisturbed sleeps; those say so 
 that are within the hearing of the noise of war. And the way to be 
 quiet is to seek unto God and keep ourselves in his love.  Nothing 
 needs make those afraid who <I>return to God as their rest</I> and take 
 him for their habitation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That, though now he was slighted, yet he should be courted: 
 "<I>Many shall make suit to thee,</I> and think it their interest to 
 secure thy friendship." Suit is made to those that are eminently wise 
 or reputed to be so, that are very rich or in power. Zophar knew Job so 
 well that he foresaw that, how low soever this present ebb was, if once 
 the tide turned, it would flow as high as ever; and he would be again 
 the darling of his country. Those that rightly make suit to God will 
 probably see the day when others will make suit to them, as the foolish 
 virgins to the wise, <I>Give us of your oil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Zophar concludes with a brief account of the doom of wicked people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.</I> It should seem, he 
 suspected that Job would not take his counsel, and here tells him what 
 would then come of it, setting death as well as life before him.  See 
 what will become of those who persist in their wickedness, and will not 
 be reformed.

 1. They shall not reach the good they flatter themselves with the hopes 
 of in this world and in the other.  Disappointments will be their doom, 
 their shame, their endless torment.  Their eyes shall fail with 
 expecting that which will never come.  <I>When a wicked man dies his 
 expectation perishes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:7">Prov. xi. 7</A>.

 <I>Their hope shall be as a puff of breath</I> (margin), vanished and
 gone past recall. Or their hope will perish and expire as a man does 
 when he gives up the ghost; it will fail them when they have most need 
 of it and when they expected the accomplishment of it; it will die 
 away, and leave them in utter confusion.

 2. They shall not avoid the evil which sometimes they frighten
 themselves with the apprehensions of. They shall not escape the 
 execution of the sentence passed upon them, can neither out-brave it 
 nor outrun it. Those that will not fly to God will find it in vain to 
 think of flying from him.</P>
