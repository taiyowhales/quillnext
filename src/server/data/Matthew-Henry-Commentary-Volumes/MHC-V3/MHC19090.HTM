 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing psalm is supposed to have been penned as late as the
 captivity in Babylon; this, it is plain, was penned as early as the
 deliverance out of Egypt, and yet they are put close together in this
 collection of divine songs. This psalm was penned by Moses (as appears
 by the title), the most ancient penman of sacred writ. We have upon
 record a praising song of his

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-21">Exod. xv.</A>,

 which is alluded to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:3">Rev. xv. 3</A>),
 
 and an instructing song of his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1-47">Deut. xxxii.</A>

 But this is of a different nature from both, for it is called a prayer.
 It is supposed that this psalm was penned upon occasion of the sentence 
 passed upon Israel in the wilderness for their unbelief, murmuring, and 
 rebellion, that their carcases should fall in the wilderness, that they 
 should be wasted away by a series of miseries for thirty-eight years 
 together, and that none of them that were then of age should enter 
 Canaan. This was calculated for their wanderings in the wilderness, as 
 that other song of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:19,21">Deut. xxxi. 19, 21</A>)

 was for their settlement in Canaan. We have the story to which this
 psalm seems to refer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1-45">Num. xiv.</A>

 Probably Moses penned this prayer to be daily used, either by the
 people in their tents, or, at lest, by the priests in the 
 tabernacle-service, during their tedious fatigue in the wilderness. In 
 it,

 I. Moses comforts himself and his people with the eternity of God and 
 their interest in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He humbles himself and his people with the consideration of the
 frailty of man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:3-6">ver.  3-6</A>.

 III. He submits himself and his people to the righteous sentence of God
 passed upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 IV. He commits himself and his people to God by prayer for divine mercy 
 and grace, and the return of God's favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:12-17">ver.  12-17</A>.

 Though it seems to have been penned upon this particular occasion, yet 
 it is very applicable to the frailty of human life in general, and, in 
 singing it, we may easily apply it to the years of our passage through 
 the wilderness of this world, and it furnishes us with meditations and 
 prayers very suitable to the solemnity of a funeral.</P>

 <P>A Prayer of Moses the man of God.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Lord, thou hast been
 our dwelling place in all generations.
 &nbsp; 2  Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
 formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
 everlasting, thou <I>art</I> God.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
 children of men.
 &nbsp; 4  For a thousand years in thy sight <I>are but</I> as yesterday when
 it is past, and <I>as</I> a watch in the night.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are <I>as</I> a
 sleep: in the morning <I>they are</I> like grass <I>which</I> groweth up.
 &nbsp; 6  In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
 it is cut down, and withereth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is entitled <I>a prayer of Moses.</I> Where, and in what 
 volume, it was preserved from Moses's time till the collection of 
 psalms was begun to be made, is uncertain; but, being divinely 
 inspired, it was under a special protection: perhaps it was written in 
 the book of Jasher, or the book of the wars of the Lord. Moses taught 
 the people of Israel to pray, and put words into their mouths which 
 they might make use of in turning to the Lord. Moses is here called 
 <I>the man of God,</I> because he was a prophet, the father of 
 prophets, and an eminent type of the great prophet. In these verses we 
 are taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To give God the praise of his care concerning his people at all 
 times, and concerning us in our days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Lord, thou hast been to us a habitation,</I> or <I>dwelling-place, a 
 refuge</I> or <I>help, in all generations.</I> Now that they had fallen 
 under God's displeasure, and he threatened to abandon them, they plead 
 his former kindnesses to their ancestors. Canaan was a land of 
 pilgrimage to their fathers the patriarchs, who dwelt there in 
 tabernacles; but then God was their habitation, and, wherever they 
 went, they were at home, at rest, in him. Egypt had been a land of 
 bondage to them for many years, but even then God was their refuge; and 
 in him that poor oppressed people lived and were kept in being. Note, 
 True believers are at home in God, and that is their comfort in 
 reference to all the toils and tribulations they meet with in this 
 world. In him we may repose and shelter ourselves as in our 
 dwelling-place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To give God the glory of his eternity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Before the mountains were brought forth, before he made the highest
 part of the dust of the world</I> (as it is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:26">Prov. viii. 26</A>),
 
 <I>before the earth fell in travail,</I> or, as we may read it, 
 <I>before thou hadst formed the earth and the world</I> (that is, 
 before the beginning of time) thou hadst a being; <I>even from 
 everlasting to everlasting thou art God,</I> an eternal God, whose 
 existence has neither its commencement nor its period with time, nor is 
 measured by the successions and revolutions of it, but who art <I>the 
 same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,</I> without beginning of days, or 
 end of life, or change of time. Note, Against all the grievances that 
 arise from our own mortality, and the mortality of our friends, we may 
 take comfort from God's immortality. We are dying creatures, and all 
 our comforts in the world are dying comforts, but God is an everliving 
 God, and those shall find him so who have him for theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To own God's absolute sovereign dominion over man, and his 
 irresistible incontestable power to dispose of him as he pleases 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>):

 <I>Thou turnest man to destruction,</I> with a word's speaking, when 
 thou pleasest, to the destruction of the body, of the earthly house; 
 <I>and</I> thou <I>sayest, Return, you children of men.</I> 

 1.  When God is, by sickness or other afflictions, turning men to 
 destruction, he does thereby call men to return unto him, that is, to 
 repent of their sins and live a new life. This God <I>speaketh once, 
 yea, twice.  "Return unto me,</I> from whom you have revolted," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:1">Jer. iv. 1</A>.

 2. When God is threatening to <I>turn men to destruction,</I> to bring 
 them to death, and they have received a sentence of death within 
 themselves, sometimes he wonderfully restores them, and says, as the 
 old translation reads it, <I>Again thou sayest, Return</I> to life and 
 health again. For God kills and makes alive again, brings down to the 
 grave and brings up. 

 3. When God turns men to destruction, it is according to the general
 sentence passed upon all, which is this, "<I>Return, you children of 
 men,</I> one, as well as another, return to your first principles; let 
 the body return to the earth as it was (<I>dust to dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>)
 
 and let the soul <I>return to God who gave it,</I>"
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>.

 4.  Though God turns all men to destruction, yet he will again say, 
 <I>Return, you children of men,</I> at the general resurrection, when, 
 though a man dies, yet he shall live again; and "<I>then shalt thou 
 call and I will answer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:14,15">Job xiv. 14, 15</A>);

 thou shalt bid me return, and I shall return." The body, the soul,
 shall both return and unite again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To acknowledge the infinite disproportion there is between God and 
 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Some of the patriarchs lived nearly a thousand years; Moses knew this 
 very well, and had recorded it: but what is their long life to God's 
 eternal life? "A thousand years, to us, are a long period, which we 
 cannot expect to survive; or, if we could, it is what we could not 
 retain the remembrance of; but it is, <I>in thy sight, as 
 yesterday,</I> as one day, as that which is freshest in mind; nay, it 
 is but as a <I>watch of the night,</I>" which was but three hours. 

 1. A thousand years are nothing to God's eternity; they are less than a 
 day, than an hour, to a thousand years. Betwixt a minute and a million 
 of years there is some proportion, but betwixt time and eternity there 
 is none. The long lives of the patriarchs were nothing to God, not so 
 much as the life of a child (that is born and dies the same day) is to 
 theirs. 

 2. All the events of a thousand years, whether past or to come, are as 
 present to the Eternal Mind as what was done yesterday, or the last 
 hour, is to us, and more so. God will say, at the great day, to those 
 whom he has <I>turned to destruction, Return--Arise you dead.</I> But 
 it might be objected against the doctrine of the resurrection that it 
 is a long time since it was expected and it has not yet come. Let that 
 be no difficulty, for a thousand years, in God's sight, are but as one 
 day. <I>Nullum tempus occurrit regi--To the king all periods are 
 alike.</I> To this purport these words are quoted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8">2 Pet.  iii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. To see the frailty of man, and his vanity even at his best estate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 look upon all the children of men, and we shall see, 

 1. That their life is a dying life: <I>Thou carriest them away as with 
 a flood,</I> that is, they are continually gliding down the stream of 
 time into the ocean of eternity. The flood is continually flowing, and 
 they are carried away with it; as soon as we are born we begin to die, 
 and every day of our life carries us so much nearer death; or we are 
 carried away violently and irresistibly, as with a flood of waters, as 
 with an inundation, which sweeps away all before it; or as the old 
 world was carried away with Noah's flood. Though God promised not so to 
 drown the world again, yet death is a constant deluge. 

 2. That it is a dreaming life. Men are carried away as with a flood and 
 yet <I>they are as a sleep;</I> they consider not their own frailty, 
 nor are aware how near they approach to an awful eternity. Like men 
 asleep, they imagine great things to themselves, till death wakes them, 
 and puts an end to the pleasing dream. Time passes unobserved by us, as 
 it does with men asleep; and, when it is over, it is as nothing. 

 3.  That it is a short and transient life, like that of the grass which
 grows up and flourishes, in the morning looks green and pleasant, but 
 in the evening the mower cuts it down, and it immediately withers, 
 changes its colour, and loses all its beauty. Death will change us 
 shortly, perhaps suddenly; and it is a great change that death will 
 make with us in a little time. Man, in his prime, does but flourish as 
 the grass, which is weak, and low, and tender, and exposed, and which, 
 when the winter of old age comes, will wither of itself: but he may be 
 mown down by disease or disaster, as the grass is, in the midst of 
 summer. <I>All flesh is as grass.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
 troubled.
 &nbsp; 8  Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret <I>sins</I>
 in the light of thy countenance.

 years as a tale <I>that is told.</I>

 away.
 &nbsp; 11  Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
 fear, <I>so is</I> thy wrath.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses had, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps_90:1-6">foregoing verses</A>, 

 lamented the frailty of human life in general; the children of men 
 <I>are as a sleep and as the grass.</I> But here he teaches the people 
 of Israel to confess before God that righteous sentence of death which 
 they were under in a special manner, and which by their sins they had 
 brought upon themselves. Their share in the common lot of mortality was 
 not enough, but they are, and must live and die, under peculiar tokens 
 of God's displeasure. Here they speak of themselves: <I>We</I> 
 Israelites <I>are consumed and troubled,</I> and <I>our days have 
 passed away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are here taught to acknowledge the wrath of God to be the cause 
 of all their miseries. <I>We are consumed, we are troubled,</I> and it 
 is <I>by thy anger,</I> by <I>thy wrath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 <I>our days have passed away in thy wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The afflictions of the saints often come purely from God's love, as 
 Job's; but the rebukes of sinners, and of good men for their sins, must 
 be seen coming from the anger of God, who takes notice of, and is much 
 displeased with, the sins of Israel.  We are too apt to look upon death 
 as no more than a debt owing to nature; whereas it is not so; if the 
 nature of man had continued in its primitive purity and rectitude, 
 there would have been no such debt owing to it. It is a debt to the 
 justice of God, a debt to the law.  <I>Sin entered into the world, and 
 death by sin.</I> Are we consumed by decays of nature, the infirmities 
 of age, or any chronic disease? We must ascribe it to God's anger. Are 
 we troubled by any sudden or surprising stroke? That also is the fruit 
 of God's wrath, which is thus revealed from heaven against the 
 <I>ungodliness</I> and <I>unrighteousness of men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are taught to confess their sins, which had provoked the wrath 
 of God against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, even our secret sins.</I> 
 It was not without cause that God was angry with them. He had said, 
 <I>Provoke me not, and I will do you no hurt;</I> but they had provoked 
 him, and will own that, in passing this severe sentence upon them, he 
 justly punished them, 

 1. For their open contempts of him and the daring affronts they had 
 given him: <I>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee.</I> God had 
 herein an eye to their unbelief and murmuring, their distrusting his 
 power and their despising the pleasant land: these he set before them 
 when he passed that sentence on them; these kindled the fire of God's 
 wrath against them and kept good things from them. 

 2. For their more secret departures from him: "<I>Thou hast set our 
 secret sins</I> (those which go no further than the heart, and which 
 are at the bottom of all the overt acts) <I>in the light of thy 
 countenance;</I> that is, thou hast discovered these, and brought these 
 also to the account, and made us to see them, who before overlooked 
 them." Secret sins are known to God and shall be reckoned for. Those 
 who in heart return into Egypt, who set up idols in their heart, shall 
 be dealt with as revolters or idolaters.  See the folly of those who go 
 about to cover their sins, for they cannot cover them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are taught to look upon themselves as dying and passing away, 
 and not to think either of a long life or of a pleasant one; for the 
 decree gone forth against them was irreversible 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>All our days are</I> likely to be <I>passed away in thy wrath,</I> 
 under the tokens of thy displeasure; and, though we are not quite 
 deprived of the residue of our years, yet we are likely to <I>spend</I> 
 them <I>as a tale that is told.</I> The thirty-eight years which, after 
 this, they wore away in the wilderness, were not the subject of the 
 sacred history; for little or nothing is recorded of that which 
 happened to them from the second year to the fortieth. After they came 
 out of Egypt their time was perfectly trifled away, and was not worthy 
 to be the subject of a history, but only of <I>a tale that is told;</I> 
 for it was only to pass away time, like telling stories, that they 
 spent those years in the wilderness; all that while they were in the 
 consuming, and another generation was in the raising.  When they came 
 out of Egypt <I>there was not one feeble person among their tribes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:37">Ps. cv. 37</A>);

 but now they were feeble. Their joyful prospect of a prosperous
 glorious life in Canaan was turned into the melancholy prospect of a 
 tedious inglorious death in the wilderness; so that their whole life 
 was now as impertinent a thing as ever any winter-tale was. That is 
 applicable to the state of every one of us in the wilderness of this 
 world: <I>We spend our years, we bring them to an end,</I> each year, 
 and all at last, <I>as a tale that is told--as the breath of our mouth 
 in winter</I> (so some), which soon disappears--<I>as a thought</I> (so 
 some), than which nothing more quick--<I>as a word,</I> which is soon 
 spoken, and then vanishes into air--or <I>as a tale that is told.</I> 
 The spending of our years is like the telling of a tale. A year, when 
 it past, is like a tale when it is told. Some of our years are a 
 pleasant story, others as a tragical one, most mixed, but all short and 
 transient: that which was long in the doing may be told in a short 
 time. Our years, when they are gone, can no more be recalled than the 
 word that we have spoken can. The loss and waste of our time, which are 
 our fault and folly, may be thus complained of: we should spend our 
 years like the despatch of business, with care and industry; but, alas!  
 we do spend them like the telling of a tale, idle, and to little 
 purpose, carelessly, and without regard. Every year passed <I>as a tale 
 that is told;</I> but what was the number of them?  As they were vain, 
 so they were few 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 seventy or eighty at most, which may be understood either, 

 1. Of the lives of the Israelites in the wilderness; all those that 
 were numbered when they came out of Egypt, above twenty years old, were 
 to die within thirty-eight years; they numbered those only that <I>were 
 able to go forth to war,</I> most of whom, we may suppose, were between 
 twenty and forty, who therefore must have all died before eighty years 
 old, and many before sixty, and perhaps much sooner, which was far 
 short of the years of the lives of their fathers.  And those that lived 
 to seventy or eighty, yet, being under a sentence of consumption and a 
 melancholy despair of ever seeing through this wilderness-state, their 
 strength, their life, was nothing but <I>labour and sorrow,</I> which 
 otherwise would have been made a new life by the joys of Canaan. See 
 what work sin made. Or, 

 2. Of the lives of men in general, ever since the days of Moses. Before 
 the time of Moses it was usual for men to live about 100 years, or 
 nearly 150; but, since, seventy or eighty is the common stint, which 
 few exceed and multitudes never come near. We reckon those to have 
 lived to the age of man, and to have had as large a share of life as 
 they had reason to expect, who live to be seventy years old; and how 
 short a time is that compared with eternity! Moses was the first that 
 committed divine revelation to writing, which, before, had been 
 transmitted by tradition; now also both the world and the church were 
 pretty well peopled, and therefore there were not now the same reasons 
 for men's living long that there had been. If, by reason of a strong 
 constitution, some reach to eighty years, yet their strength then is 
 what they have little joy of; it does but serve to prolong their 
 misery, and make their death the more tedious; for even <I>their 
 strength then is labour and sorrow,</I> much more their weakness; for 
 the years have come which they have no pleasure in. Or it may be taken 
 thus: <I>Our years are seventy, and the years of some, by reason of 
 strength, are eighty; but the breadth of our years</I> (for so the 
 latter word signifies, rather than strength), <I>the whole extent of 
 them, from infancy to old age, is but labour and sorrow.</I> In the 
 sweat of our face we must eat bread; our whole life is toilsome and 
 troublesome; and perhaps, in the midst of the years we count upon, 
 <I>it is soon cut off, and we fly away,</I> and do not live out half 
 our days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are taught by all this to stand in awe of the wrath of God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>):

 <I>Who knows the power of thy anger?</I> 

 1. None can perfectly comprehend it. The psalmist speaks as one afraid 
 of God's anger, and amazed at the greatness of the power of it; who 
 knows how far the power of God's anger can reach and how deeply it can 
 wound? The angels that sinned knew experimentally the power of God's 
 anger; damned sinners in hell know it; but which of us can fully 
 comprehend or describe it? 

 2.  Few do seriously consider it as they ought. <I>Who knows it,</I> so 
 as to improve the knowledge of it? Those who make a mock at sin, and 
 make light of Christ, surely do not know the power of God's anger. For, 
 <I>according to thy fear, so is thy wrath;</I> God's wrath is equal to 
 the apprehensions which the most thoughtful serious people have of it; 
 let men have ever so great a dread upon them of the wrath of God, it is 
 not greater than there is cause for and than the nature of the thing 
 deserves. God has not in his word represented his wrath as more 
 terrible than really it is; nay, what is felt in the other world is 
 infinitely worse than what is feared in this world.  <I>Who among us 
 can dwell with that devouring fire?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  So teach <I>us</I> to number our days, that we may apply <I>our</I>
 hearts unto wisdom.
 &nbsp; 13  Return, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
 thy servants.
 &nbsp; 14  O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and
 be glad all our days.
 &nbsp; 15  Make us glad according to the days <I>wherein</I> thou hast
 afflicted us, <I>and</I> the years <I>wherein</I> we have seen evil.
 &nbsp; 16  Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
 their children.
 &nbsp; 17  And let the beauty of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God be upon us: and
 establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
 our hands establish thou it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are the petitions of this prayer, grounded upon the foregoing 
 meditations and acknowledgments. <I>Is any afflicted? Let him</I> learn 
 thus to <I>pray.</I> Four things they are here directed to pray 
 for:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For a sanctified use of the sad dispensation they were now under. 
 Being condemned to have our days shortened, "<I>Lord, teach us to 
 number our days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 Lord, give us grace duly to consider how few they are, and how little a 
 while we have to live in this world." Note, 

 1. It is an excellent art rightly <I>to number our days,</I> so as not 
 to be out in our calculation, as he was who counted upon many years to 
 come when, that night, his soul was required of him. We must live under 
 a constant apprehension of the shortness and uncertainty of life and 
 the near approach of death and eternity. We must so number our days as 
 to compare our work with them, and mind it accordingly with a double 
 diligence, as those that have no time to trifle. 

 2. Those that would learn this arithmetic must pray for divine 
 instruction, must go to God, and beg of him to teach them by his 
 Spirit, to put them upon considering and to give them a good 
 understanding. 

 3. We then number our days to good purpose when thereby our hearts are
 inclined and engaged to true wisdom, that is, to the practice of 
 serious godliness.  To be religious is to be wise; this is a thing to 
 which it is necessary that we apply our hearts, and the matter requires 
 and deserves a close application, to which frequent thoughts of the 
 uncertainty of our continuance here, and the certainty of our removal 
 hence, will very much contribute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the turning away of God's anger from them, that though the 
 decree had gone forth, and was past revocation, there was no remedy, 
 but they must die in the wilderness: "<I>Yet return, O Lord!</I> be 
 thou reconciled to us, and <I>let it repent thee concerning thy 
 servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 send us tidings of peace to comfort us again after these heavy tidings. 
 How long must we look upon ourselves as under thy wrath, and when shall 
 we have some token given us of our restoration to thy favour? <I>We are 
 thy servants, thy people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:9">Isa. lxiv. 9</A>);

 when wilt thou change thy way toward us?" In answer to this prayer, and 
 upon their profession of repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:39,40">Num. xiv. 39, 40</A>),

 God, in the next chapter, proceeding with the laws concerning
 sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:1-31">Num. xv. 1</A>,

 &c.), which was a token that it repented him concerning his servants;
 for, <I>if the Lord had been pleased to kill them, he would not have 
 shown them such things as these.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For comfort and joy in the returns of God's favour to them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 They pray for the mercy of God; for they pretend not to plead any merit 
 of their own. <I>Have mercy upon us, O God!</I> is a prayer we are all 
 concerned to say <I>Amen</I> to.  Let us pray for early mercy, the 
 seasonable communications of divine mercy, that God's <I>tender mercies 
 may speedily prevent us, early in the morning</I> of our days, when we 
 are young and flourishing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let us pray for the true satisfaction and happiness which are to be had 
 only in the favour and mercy of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 A gracious soul, if it may but be satisfied of God's lovingkindness,
 will be satisfied with it, abundantly satisfied, will take up with 
 that, and will take up with nothing short of it. Two things are pleaded 
 to enforce this petition for God's mercy:--

 1. That it would be a full fountain of future joys: "<I>O satisfy us 
 with thy mercy,</I> not only that we may be easy and at rest within 
 ourselves, which we can never be while we lie under thy wrath, but that 
 we <I>may rejoice and be glad,</I> not only for a time, upon the first 
 indications of thy favour, but <I>all our days,</I> though we are to 
 spend them in the wilderness." With respect to those that make God 
 their chief joy, as their joy may be full 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4">1 John i. 4</A>),

 so it may be constant, even in this vale of tears; it is their own
 fault if they are not glad all their days, for his mercy will furnish
 them with joy in tribulation and nothing can separate them from it. 

 2.  That it would be a sufficient balance to their former griefs: 
 "<I>Make us glad according to the days wherein thou has afflicted 
 us;</I> let the days of our joy in thy favour be as many as the days of 
 our pain for thy displeasure have been and as pleasant as those have 
 been gloomy. <I>Lord, thou usest to set the one over-against the 
 other</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>);

 do so in our case. Let it suffice that we have drunk so long of the cup
 of trembling; now put into our hands the cup of salvation." God's 
 people reckon the returns of God's lovingkindness a sufficient 
 recompence for all their troubles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. For the progress of the work of God among them notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 1. That he would manifest himself in carrying it on: "<I>Let thy work 
 appear upon thy servants;</I> let it appear that thou hast wrought upon 
 us, to bring us home to thyself and to fit us for thyself." God's 
 servants cannot work for him unless he work upon them, and work in them 
 both to will and to do; and then we may hope the operations of God's 
 providence will be apparent for us when the operations of his grace are 
 apparent upon us. "Let thy work appear, and in it thy glory will appear 
 to us and those that shall come after us." In praying for God's grace 
 God's glory must be our end; and we must therein have an eye to our 
 children as well as to ourselves, that they also may experience God's 
 glory appearing upon them, so as to change them into the same image, 
 from glory to glory. Perhaps, in this prayer, they distinguish between 
 themselves and their children, for so God distinguished in his late 
 message to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:31">Num.  xiv. 31</A>,

 <I>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness, but your little ones I
 will bring into Canaan</I>): "Lord," say they, "let <I>thy work appear 
 upon us,</I> to reform us, and bring us to a better temper, and then 
 <I>let thy glory appear to our children,</I> in performing the promise 
 to them which we have forfeited the benefit of."

 2. That he would countenance and strengthen them in carrying it on, in 
 doing their part towards it.  

 (1.) That he would smile upon them in it: <I>Let the beauty of the Lord 
 our God be upon us;</I> let it appear that God favours us. Let us have 
 God's ordinances kept up among us and the tokens of God's presence with 
 his ordinances; so some. We may apply this petition both to our 
 sanctification and to our consolation.  Holiness is <I>the beauty of 
 the Lord our God;</I> let that be upon us in all we say and do; let the 
 grace of God in us, and the light of our good works, make our faces to 
 shine (that is the comeliness God puts upon us, and those are comely 
 indeed who are so beautified), and then let divine consolations put 
 gladness into our hearts, and a lustre upon our countenances, and that 
 also will be the beauty of the Lord upon us, as our God. 

 (2.) That he would prosper them in it: <I>Establish thou the work of 
 our hands upon us.</I> God's working upon us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 does not discharge us from using our utmost endeavours in serving him 
 and working out our salvation.  But, when we have done all, we must 
 wait upon God for the success, and beg of him to <I>prosper our handy 
 works,</I> to give us to compass what we aim at for his glory. We are 
 so unworthy of divine assistance, and yet so utterly insufficient to 
 bring any thing to pass without it, that we have need to be earnest for 
 it and to repeat the request: <I>Yea, the work of our hands, establish 
 thou it,</I> and, in order to that, establish us in it.</P>
