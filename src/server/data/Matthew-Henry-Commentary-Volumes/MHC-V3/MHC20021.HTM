 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The king's heart <I>is</I> in the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>as</I> the
 rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Even the <I>hearts</I> of men are in God's hand, and not only their
 <I>goings,</I> as he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:24"><I>ch.</I> xx. 24</A>.

 God can change men's minds, can, by a powerful insensible operation 
 under their spirits, turn them from that which they seemed most intent 
 upon, and incline them to that which they seemed most averse to, as the 
 husbandman, by canals and gutters, turns the water through his grounds 
 as he pleases, which does not alter the nature of the water, nor put 
 any force upon it, any more than God's providence does upon the native 
 freedom of man's will, but directs the course of it to serve his own 
 purpose.

 2. Even kings' hearts are so, notwithstanding their powers and
 prerogatives, as much as the hearts of common persons. The <I>hearts of 
 kings are unsearchable</I> to us, much more unmanageable by us; as they 
 have their <I>arcana imperii</I>--<I>state secrets,</I> so that they 
 have great prerogatives of their crown; but the great God has them not 
 only under his eye, but in his hand. Kings are what he makes them.
 Those that are most absolute are under God's government; he <I>puts 
 things into their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:17,Ezr+7:27">Rev. xvii. 17; Ezra vii. 27</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Every way of a man <I>is</I> right in his own eyes: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 pondereth the hearts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. We are all apt to be partial in judging of ourselves and our own 
 actions, and to think too favourably of our own character, as if there 
 was nothing amiss in it: <I>Every way of a man,</I> even his by-way, 
 <I>is right in his own eyes.</I> The proud heart is very ingenious in 
 putting a fair face upon a foul matter, and in making that appear right 
 to itself which is far from being so, to stop the mouth of conscience. 
 
 2. We are sure that the judgment of God concerning us is according to 
 truth. Whatever our judgment is concerning ourselves, <I>the Lord
 ponders the heart.</I> God looks at the heart, and judges of men 
 according to that, of their actions according to their principles and 
 intentions; and his judgment of that is as exact as ours is of that 
 which we ponder most, and more so; he weighs it in an unerring balance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  To do justice and judgment <I>is</I> more acceptable to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 than sacrifice.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. It is implied that many deceive themselves with a conceit that, if 
 they offer sacrifice, that will excuse them from doing justice, and 
 procure them a dispensation for their unrighteousness; and this makes 
 their way <I>seem right,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 <I>We have fasted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3">Isa. lviii. 3</A>.

 <I>I have peace-offerings with me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:14">Prov. vii. 14</A>.

 2. It is plainly declared that living a good life (doing justly and 
 loving mercy) is more pleasing to God than the most pompous and 
 expensive instances of devotion. Sacrifices were of divine
 institution, and were acceptable to God if they were offered in faith 
 and with repentance, otherwise not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>,

 &c. But even then moral duties were preferred before them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22">1 Sam. xv. 22</A>),

 which intimates that their excellency was not innate nor the obligation
 to them perpetual, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6-8">Mic. vi. 6-8</A>.

 Much of religion lies in doing judgment and justice from a principle of 
 duty to God, contempt of the world, and love to our neighbour; and this 
 is more pleasing to God than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:33">Mark xii. 33</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  An high look, and a proud heart, <I>and</I> the plowing of the
 wicked, <I>is</I> sin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This may be taken as showing us, 

 1. The marks of a wicked man. He that has a <I>high look and a proud 
 heart,</I> that carries himself insolently and scornfully towards both 
 God and man, and that is always ploughing and plotting, designing and 
 devising some mischief or other, is indeed a wicked man. <I>The light 
 of the wicked is sin.</I> Sin is <I>the pride, the ambition, the glory 
 and joy,</I> and <I>the business of wicked men.</I> 

 2. The miseries of wicked man. His raised expectations, his high 
 designs, and most elaborate contrivances and projects, are sin to him; 
 he contracts guilt in them and so prepares trouble for himself. The 
 very business of all wicked men, as well as their pleasure, is nothing 
 but sin; so Bishop Patrick. They do all to serve their lusts, and have 
 no regard to the glory of God in it, and therefore <I>their ploughing 
 is sin,</I> and no marvel when their sacrificing is so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8"><I>ch.</I> xv. 8</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  The thoughts of the diligent <I>tend</I> only to plenteousness;
 but of every one <I>that is</I> hasty only to want.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The way to be rich. If we would live plentifully and comfortably in 
 the world, we must be diligent in our business, and not shrink from the 
 toil and trouble of it, but prosecute it closely, improving all 
 advantages and opportunities for it, and doing what we do with all our 
 might; yet we must not be hasty in it, nor hurry ourselves and others 
 with it, but keep doing fair and softly, which, we say, goes far in a 
 day. With diligence there must be contrivance. The <I>thoughts of the 
 diligent</I> are as necessary as the hand of the diligent. Forecast is
 as good as work. Seest thou a man thus prudent and diligent? He will 
 have enough to live on. 

 2. The way to be poor. Those that are hasty, that are rash and 
 inconsiderate in their affairs, and will not take time to think, that 
 are greedy of gain, by right or wrong, and make haste to be rich by 
 unjust practices or unwise projects, are in the ready road to poverty. 
 Their thoughts and contrivances, by which they hope to raise 
 themselves, will ruin them.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  The getting of treasures by a lying tongue <I>is</I> a vanity
 tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows the folly of those that hope to enrich themselves by 
 dishonest practices, by oppressing and over-reaching those with whom 
 they deal, by false-witness-bearing, or by fraudulent contracts, of 
 those that make no scruples of lying when there is any thing to be got 
 by it. They may perhaps heap up treasures by these means, that which 
 they make their treasure; but, 

 1. They will not meet with the satisfaction they expect. It is a 
 <I>vanity tossed to and fro;</I> it will be disappointment and vexation 
 of spirit to them; they will not have the comfort of it, nor can they 
 put any confidence in it, but will be perpetually uneasy. It will be 
 <I>tossed to and fro</I> by their own consciences, and by the censures 
 of men; let them expect to be in a constant hurry. 

 2. They will meet with destruction they do not expect. While they are
 seeking wealth by such unlawful practices they are really seeking 
 death; they lay themselves open to the envy and ill-will of men by the 
 treasures they get, and to the wrath and curse of God, by the lying 
 tongue wherewith they get them, which he will make to fall upon 
 themselves and sink them to hell.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
 refuse to do judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The nature of injustice. Getting money by lying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 is no better than downright robbery. Cheating is stealing; you might as
 well pick a man's pocket as impose upon him by a lie in making a 
 bargain, which he had no fence against but by not believing you; and it 
 will be no excuse from the guilt of robbery to say that he might choose 
 whether he would believe you, for that is a debt we should owe to all 
 men.

 2. The cause of injustice. Men <I>refuse to do judgment;</I> they will 
 not render to all their due, but withhold it, and omissions make way 
 for commissions; they come at length to robbery itself. Those that 
 refuse to do justice will choose to do wrong. 

 3. The effects of injustice; it will return upon the sinner's own head.
 The robbery of the wicked will <I>terrify them</I> (so some); their 
 consciences will be filled with horror and amazement, will cut them, 
 will <I>saw them asunder</I> (so others); it will <I>destroy them</I> 
 here and for ever, therefore he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>They seek death.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The way of man <I>is</I> froward and strange: but <I>as for</I> the
 pure, his work <I>is</I> right.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that as men are so is their way. 

 1. Evil men have evil ways. If the man be <I>froward,</I> his way also
 is <I>strange;</I> and this is the way of most men, such is the general 
 corruption of mankind. <I>They have all gone aside</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:2,3">Ps. xiv. 2, 3</A>);

 all flesh have perverted their way. But the froward man, the man of 
 deceit, that acts by craft and trick in all he does, his way is 
 strange, contrary to all the rules of honour and honesty. It is 
 strange, for you know not where to find him nor when you have him; it 
 is strange, for it is alienated from all good and estranges men from 
 God and his favour. It is what he behold afar off, and so do all honest 
 men. 

 2. Men that are pure are proved to be such by their work, for it <I>is 
 right,</I> it is just and regular; and they are accepted of God and 
 approved of men. The way of mankind in their apostasy is froward and 
 strange; but as for the pure, those that by the grace of God are 
 recovered out of that state, of which there is here and there one, 
 <I>their work is right,</I> as Noah's was in the old world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1">Gen. vii. 1</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  <I>It is</I> better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than
 with a brawling woman in a wide house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What a great affliction it is to a man to have a brawling scolding
 woman for his wife, who upon every occasion, and often upon no 
 occasion, breaks out into a passion, and chides either him or those 
 about her, is fretful to herself and furious to her children and 
 servants, and, in both, vexatious to her husband. If a man has a wide 
 house, spacious and pompous, this will embitter the comfort of it to 
 him--<I>a house of society</I> (so the word is), in which a man may be 
 sociable, and entertain his friends; this will make both him and his 
 house unsociable, and unfit for enjoyments of true friendship. It makes 
 a man ashamed of his choice and his management, and disturbs his 
 company. 

 2. What many a man is forced to do under such an affliction. He cannot
 keep up his authority. He finds it to no purpose to contradict the most 
 unreasonable passion, for it is unruly and rages so much the more; and 
 his wisdom and grace will not suffer him to render railing for railing, 
 nor his conjugal affection to use any severity, and therefore he finds 
 it his best way to retire <I>into a corner of the house-top,</I> and 
 sit alone there, out of the hearing of her clamour; and if he employ 
 himself well there, as he may do, it is the wisest course he can take.
 Better do so than quit the house, and go into bad company, for 
 diversion, as many, who, like Adam, make their wife's sin the excuse of 
 their own.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth
 no favour in his eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here the character of a very wicked man. 

 1. The strong inclination he has to do mischief. His very <I>soul 
 desires evil,</I> desires that evil may be done and that he may have 
 the pleasure, not only of seeing it, but of having a hand in it. The 
 root of wickedness lies in the soul; the desire that men have to do 
 evil, that is the lust which conceives and brings forth sin. 

 2. The strong aversion he has to do good: <I>His neighbour,</I> his 
 friend, his nearest relation, <I>finds no favour in his eyes,</I> 
 cannot gain from him the least kindness, though he be in the greatest 
 need of it. And, when he is in the pursuit of the evil his heart is so
 much upon, he will spare no man that stands in his way; his next 
 neighbour shall be used no better than a stranger, than an enemy.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
 when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:25"><I>ch.</I> xix. 25</A>),

 and it shows that there are two ways by which the simple may be made 
 wise:--

 1. By the punishments that are inflicted on those that are incorrigibly 
 wicked. Let the law be executed upon a scorner, and even he that is 
 simple will be awakened and alarmed by it, and will discern, more than 
 he did, the evil of sin, and will take warning by it and take heed. 

 2. By the instructions that are given to those that are wise and
 willing to be taught: <I>When the wise is instructed</I> by the 
 preaching of the word <I>he</I> (not only the wise himself, but the 
 simple that stands by) <I>receives knowledge.</I> It is no injustice at 
 all to take a good lesson to ourselves which was designed for 
 another.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The righteous <I>man</I> wisely considereth the house of the
 wicked: <I>but God</I> overthroweth the wicked for <I>their</I> wickedness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As we read this verse, it shows why good men, when they come to 
 understand things aright, will not envy the prosperity of evil-doers. 
 When they see <I>the house of the wicked,</I> how full it is perhaps of 
 all the good things of this life, they are tempted to envy; but when 
 they <I>wisely consider</I> it, when they look upon it with an eye of 
 faith, when they see <I>God overthrowing the wicked for their 
 wickedness,</I> that there is a curse upon their habitation which will 
 certainly be the ruin of it ere long, they see more reason to despise 
 them, or pity them, than to fear or envy them. 

 2. Some give another sense of it: <I>The righteous man</I> (the judge 
 or magistrate, that is entrusted with the execution of justice, and the 
 preservation of public peace) <I>examines the house of the wicked,</I> 
 searches it for arms or for stolen goods, makes a diligent enquiry 
 concerning his family and the characters of those about him, that he 
 may by his power <I>overthrow the wicked for their wickedness</I> and 
 prevent their doing any further mischief, that he may fire the nests 
 where the birds of prey are harboured or the unclean birds.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also
 shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the description and doom of an uncharitable man. 

 1. His description: He <I>stops his ears at the cry of the poor,</I> at 
 the cry of their wants and miseries (he resolves to take no cognizance 
 of them), at the cry of their requests and supplications--he resolves 
 he will not so much as give them the hearing, turns them away from his 
 door, and forbids them to come near him, or, if he cannot avoid hearing 
 them, he will not need them, nor be moved by their complaints, not be
 prevailed with by their importunities; he <I>shuts up the bowels of his 
 compassion,</I> and that is equivalent to the stopping of his ears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:57">Acts vii. 57</A>.

 2. His doom. He shall himself be reduced to straits, which will make 
 him <I>cry,</I> and then <I>he shall not be heard.</I> Men will not 
 hear him, but reward him as he has rewarded others. God will not hear 
 him; for he that <I>showed no mercy shall have judgment without 
 mercy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13">Jam. ii. 13</A>),

 and he that on earth denied a crumb of bread in hell was denied a drop 
 of water. God will be deaf to the prayers of those who are deaf to the 
 cries of the poor, which, if they be not heard by us, will be heard 
 against us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:23">Exod. xxii. 23</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
 strong wrath.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The power that is commonly found to be in gifts. Nothing is more 
 violent than <I>anger.</I> O the force of <I>strong wrath!</I> And yet 
 a handsome present, prudently managed, will turn away some men's wrath 
 when it seemed implacable, and disarm the keenest and most passionate 
 resentments. Covetousness is commonly a master-sin and has the command 
 of other lusts. <I>Pecuni&aelig; obediunt omnia</I>--<I>Money commands
 all things.</I> Thus Jacob pacified Esau and Abigail David.

 2. The policy that is commonly used in giving and receiving bribes. It
 must be a <I>gift in secret and a reward in the bosom,</I> for he that 
 takes it would not be thought to covet it, nor known to receive it, nor 
 would he willingly be beholden to him whom he has been offended with; 
 but, if it be done privately, all is well. No man should be too open in 
 giving any gift, nor boast of the presents he sends; but, if it be a 
 bribe to pervert justice, that is so scandalous that those who are fond 
 of it are ashamed of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  <I>It is</I> joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction
 <I>shall be</I> to the workers of iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is a pleasure and satisfaction to good men both to see justice 
 administered by the government they live under, right taking place and 
 iniquity suppressed, and also to practise it themselves, according as 
 their sphere is. They not only do justice, but do it with pleasure, not
 only for fear of shame, but for love of virtue. 

 2. It is a terror to wicked men to see the laws put in execution 
 against vice and profaneness. It is destruction to them; as it is also 
 a vexation to them to be forced, either for the support of their credit 
 or for fear of punishment, <I>to do judgment</I> themselves. Or, if we 
 take it as we read it, the meaning is, There is true pleasure in the 
 practice of religion, but certain destruction at the end of all vicious 
 courses.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr21_16"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
 remain in the congregation of the dead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The sinner upon his ramble: He <I>wanders out of the way of 
 understanding,</I> and when once he has left that good way he wanders 
 endlessly. The way of religion is <I>the way of understanding;</I> 
 those that are not truly pious are not truly intelligent; those <I>that 
 wander out of this way</I> break the hedge which God has set, and 
 follow the conduct of the world and the flesh; and they go astray like 
 lost sheep. 

 2. The sinner at his rest, or rather his ruin: He <I>shall remain</I> 
 (<I>quiescet</I>--<I>he shall rest,</I> but not <I>in pace</I>--<I>in 
 peace</I>) <I>in the congregation of the giants,</I> the sinners of the 
 old world, that were swept away by the deluge; to that destruction the 
 damnation of sinners is compared, as sometimes to the destruction of 
 Sodom, when they are said to have their portion in fire and brimstone. 
 Or <I>in the congregation of the damned,</I> that are under the power 
 of the second death. There is a vast congregation of damned sinners, 
 bound in bundles for the fire, and in that those shall remain, remain 
 for ever, who are shut out from the congregation of the righteous. He 
 that forsakes the way to heaven, if he return not to it, will certainly 
 sink into the depths of hell.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  He that loveth pleasure <I>shall be</I> a poor man: he that
 loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an argument against a voluptuous luxurious life, taken from the 
 ruin it brings upon men's temporal interests. Here is 

 1. The description of an epicure: <I>He loves pleasure.</I> God allows 
 us to use the delights of sense soberly and temperately, <I>wine to 
 make glad the heart</I> and put vigour into the spirits, and <I>oil to 
 make the face to shine</I> and beautify the countenance; but he that 
 loves these, that sets his heart upon them, covets them earnestly, is 
 solicitous to have all the delights of sense wound up to the height of 
 pleasurableness, is impatient of every thing that crosses him in his 
 pleasures, relishes these as the best pleasures, and has his mouth by 
 them put out of taste for spiritual delights, he is an epicure, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:4">2 Tim. iii. 4</A>.

 2. The punishment of an epicure in this world: <I>He shall be a poor 
 man;</I> for the lusts of sensuality are not maintained but at great 
 expense, and there are instances of those who want necessaries, and 
 live upon alms, who once could not live without dainties and varieties. 
 Many a beau becomes a beggar.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  The wicked <I>shall be</I> a ransom for the righteous, and the
 transgressor for the upright.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This intimates, 

 1. What should be done by the justice of men: <I>The wicked,</I> that 
 are the troublers of a land, ought to be punished, for the preventing 
 and turning away of those national judgments which otherwise will be 
 inflicted and in which even the righteous are many times involved. Thus 
 when Achan was stoned he was <I>a ransom for the</I> camp of

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  <I>It is</I> better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
 contentious and an angry woman.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Unbridled passions embitter and spoil the comfort of all relations. 
 A peevish angry wife makes her husband's life uneasy, to whom she 
 should be a comfort and a meet help. Those cannot dwell in peace and 
 happiness that cannot dwell in peace and love. Even those that are one 
 flesh, if they be not withal one spirit, have no joy of their union. 

 2. It is better to have no company than bad company. The wife of thy
 covenant is thy companion, and yet, if she be peevish and provoking, 
 <I>it is better to dwell in</I> a solitary <I>wilderness,</I> exposed 
 to wind and weather, than in company with her. A man may better enjoy 
 God and himself in a wilderness than among quarrelsome relations and 
 neighbours. See

 the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that are wise will increase what they have and live 
 plentifully; their wisdom will teach them to proportion their expenses 
 to their income and to lay up for hereafter; so that <I>there is a 
 treasure</I> of things <I>to be desired,</I> and as much as needs be 
 desired, a good stock of all things convenient, laid up in season, and 
 particularly of <I>oil,</I> one of the staple commodities of Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:8">Deut. viii. 8</A>.

 This is <I>in the habitation,</I> or cottage, <I>of the wise;</I> and 
 it is better to have an old-fashioned house, and have it well 
 furnished, than a fine modern one, with sorry housekeeping. God blesses 
 the endeavors of the wise and then their houses are replenished.

 2. Those that are foolish will misspend what they have upon their 
 lusts, and so bring the stock they have to nothing. Those manage 
 wretchedly that are in haste to spend what they had, but not in care 
 which way to get more. Foolish children spend what their wise parents 
 have laid up. <I>One sinner destroys much good,</I> as the prodigal

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth
 life, righteousness, and honour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What it is to make religion our business; it is to <I>follow after 
 righteousness and mercy,</I> not to content ourselves with easy 
 performances, but to do our duty with the utmost care and pains, as 
 those that are pressing forward and in fear of coming short. We must
 both do justly and love mercy, and must proceed and persevere therein; 
 and, though we cannot attain to perfection, yet it will be a comfort to 
 us if we aim at it and follow after it. 

 2. What will be the advantage of doing so: Those that do <I>follow 
 after righteousness</I> shall <I>find righteousness;</I> God will give 
 them grace to do good, and they shall have the pleasure and comfort of 
 doing it; those that make conscience of being just to others shall have 
 the pleasure and comfort of doing it; those that make conscience of 
 being just to others shall be justly dealt with by others and others 
 shall be kind to them. The Jews <I>followed after righteousness,</I>
 and did not find it, because they sought amiss,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31">Rom. ix. 31</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that have power are apt to promise themselves great things 
 from their power. <I>The city of the mighty</I> thinks itself 
 impregnable, and therefore its strength is <I>the confidence 
 thereof,</I> what it boasts of and trusts in, bidding defiance to
 danger. 

 2. Those that have wisdom, though they are so modest as not to promise 
 much, often perform great things, even against those that are so 
 confident of their strength, by their wisdom. Good conduct will go far 
 even against great force; and a stratagem, well managed, may 
 effectually <I>scale the city of the mighty and cast down the 
 strength</I> it had such a confidence in. <I>A wise man</I> will gain 
 upon the affections of people and conquer them by strength of reason, 
 which is a more noble conquest than that obtained by strength of arms.
 Those that understand their interest will willingly submit themselves 
 to a wise and good man, and the strongest walls shall not hold out 
 against him.</P>

 Note,

 entangled in snares and perplexities, and disquieted with troubles, 
 that we may preserve the possession and enjoyment of ourselves and that 
 our souls may be in frame for the service of God. 

 2. Those that would keep their souls must keep a watch before the door 
 of their lips, must <I>keep the mouth</I> by temperance, that no 
 forbidden fruit go into it, no stolen waters, that nothing be eaten or 
 drunk to excess; they must <I>keep the tongue</I> also, that no 
 forbidden word go out of the door of the lips, no corrupt 
 communication. By a constant watchfulness over our words we shall 
 prevent abundance of mischiefs which an ungoverned tongue runs men

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here the mischief of pride and haughtiness. 

 1. It exposes men to sin; it makes them passionate, and kindles in them 
 the fire of <I>proud wrath.</I> They are continually dealing in it, as 
 if it were their trade to be angry, and they had nothing so much to do 
 as to barter passions and exchange bitter words. Most of the wrath that 
 inflames the spirits and societies of men is <I>proud wrath.</I> Men 
 cannot bear the least slight, nor in any thing to be crossed or 
 contradicted, but they are out of humour, nay, in a heat, immediately. 
 It likewise makes them scornful when they are angry, very abusive with 
 their tongues, insolent towards those above them and imperious towards 
 all about them. <I>Only by pride</I> comes all this. 

 2. It exposes men to shame. They get a bad name by it, and every one
 calls them <I>proud and haughty scorners,</I> and therefore nobody 
 cares for having any thing to do with them. If men would but consult 
 their reputation a little and the credit of their profession, which 
 suffers with it, they would not indulge their pride and passion as they 
 do.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
 to labour.
 &nbsp; 26  He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
 giveth and spareth not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. The miseries of the slothful, whose <I>hands refuse to labour</I> in 
 an honest calling, by which they might get an honest livelihood. They 
 are as fit for labour as other men, and business offers itself, to 
 which they might lay their hands and apply their minds, but they will 
 not; herein they fondly think they do well for themselves, see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:16"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 16</A>.

 <I>Soul, take thy ease.</I> But really they are enemies to themselves; 
 for, besides that their slothfulness starves them, depriving them of 
 their necessary supports, their desires at the same time stab them. 
 Though their hands refuse to labour, their hearts cease not to covet 
 riches, and pleasures, and honours, which yet cannot be obtained 
 without labour. Their desires are impetuous and insatiable; they 
 <I>covet greedily all the day long,</I> and cry, <I>Give, give;</I> 
 they expect every body should do for them, though they will do nothing 
 for themselves, much less for any body else. Now these <I>desires kill 
 them;</I> they are a perpetual vexation to them, fret them to death, 
 and perhaps put them upon such dangerous courses for the satisfying of 
 their craving lusts as hasten them to an untimely end. Many that must
 have money with which to make provision for the flesh, and would not be 
 at the pains to get it honestly, have turned highwaymen, and that has 
 killed them. Those that are slothful in the affairs of their souls, and 
 yet have desires towards that which would be the happiness of their 
 souls, those <I>desires kill them,</I> will aggravate their 
 condemnation and be witnesses against them that were convinced of the 
 worth of spiritual blessings, but refused to be at the pains that were 
 necessary to the obtaining of them.

 2. The honours of the honest and diligent. The righteous and 
 industrious have their desires satisfied, and enjoy not only that 
 satisfaction, but the further satisfaction of doing good to others. The 
 slothful are always craving and gaping to receive, <I>but the 
 righteous</I> are always full and contriving to give; and <I>it is more 
 blessed to give than to receive.</I> They <I>give and spare not,</I> 
 give liberally and upbraid not; they <I>give a portion to seven and 
 also to eight,</I> and do not spare for fear of wanting.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  The sacrifice of the wicked <I>is</I> abomination: how much more,
 <I>when</I> he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Sacrifices were of divine institution; and when they were offered in 
 faith, and with repentance and reformation, God was greatly honoured by 
 them and well-pleased in them. But they were often not only 
 unacceptable, but an <I>abomination,</I> to God, and he declared so, 
 which was an indication both that they were not required for their own 
 sakes and that there were better things, and for effectual, in reserve, 
 when sacrifice and offering should be done away. They were an 
 <I>abomination,</I> 

 1. When they were brought by wicked men, who did not, according to the 
 true intent and meaning of sacrificing, repent of their sins, mortify 
 their lusts, and amend their lives. Cain brought his offering. Even 
 wicked men may be found in the external performances of religious 
 worship. Many can freely give God their beasts, their lips, their 
 knees, who would not give him their hearts; the Pharisees gave alms. 
 But when the person is an <I>abomination,</I> as every wicked man is to 
 God, the performance cannot but be so; <I>even when he brings it 
 diligently;</I> so some read the latter part of the verse. Though
 their offerings are continually before God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8">Ps. l. 8</A>),

 yet they are an abomination to him.

 2. <I>Much more when</I> they were brought with <I>wicked minds,</I> 
 when their sacrifices were made, not only consistent with, but 
 serviceable to, their wickedness, as Absalom's vow, Jezebel's fast, and 
 the Pharisees' long prayers. When men make a show of devotion, that 
 they may the more easily and effectually compass some covetous or 
 malicious design, when holiness is pretended, but some wickedness 
 intended, then especially the performance is an abomination,

 speaketh constantly.

 Here is, 

 1. The doom of <I>a false witness.</I> He who, for favour to one side 
 or malice to the other, gives in a false evidence, or makes an 
 affidavit of that which he knows to be false, or at least does not know 
 to be true, if it be discovered, his reputation will be ruined. A man 
 may tell a lie perhaps in his haste; but he that gives a false 
 testimony does it with deliberation and solemnity, and it cannot but be 
 a presumptuous sin, and a forfeiture of man's credit. But, though he 
 should not be discovered, he himself shall be ruined; the vengeance he 
 imprecated upon himself, when he took the false oath, will come upon 
 him. 

 2. The praise of him that is conscientious: He <I>who hears</I> (that 
 is, obeys) the command of God, which is to <I>speak every man truth 
 with his neighbour,</I> he who testifies nothing but what he has heard 
 and knows to be true, <I>speaks constantly</I> (that is, consistently 
 with himself); he is always in the same story; he speaks <I>in 
 finem</I>--<I>to the end;</I> people will give credit to him and hear 
 him out; he speaks unto victory; he carries the cause, which the 
 <I>false witness</I> shall lose; he shall speak to eternity. What is 
 true is true eternally. <I>The lip of truth is established for 
 ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The presumption and impudence of a wicked man: He <I>hardens his 
 face</I>--brazens it, that he may not blush--steels it, that he may not 
 tremble when he commits the greatest crimes; he bids defiance to the 
 terrors of the law and the checks of his own conscience, the reproofs

 nothing shall hinder him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17">Isa. lvii. 17</A>.

 2. The caution and circumspection of a good man: <I>As for the 
 upright,</I> he does not say, What <I>would</I> I do? What have I a 
 mind to? and that will I have; but, What <I>should</I> I do? What does 
 God require of me? What is duty? What is prudence? What is for
 edification? And so he does not force his way, but <I>direct his 
 way</I> by a safe and certain rule.</P>

 The designing busy part of mankind are directed, in all their counsels 
 and undertakings, to have their eye to God, and to believe, 

 1. That there can be no success against God, and therefore they must 
 never act in opposition to him, in contempt of his commands, or in 
 contradiction to his counsels. Though they think they have 
 <I>wisdom,</I> and <I>understanding,</I> and <I>counsel,</I> the best 
 politics and politicians, on their side, yet, if it be <I>against the 
 Lord,</I> it cannot prosper long; it shall not prevail at last. He that 
 sits in heaven laughs at men's projects against him and his anointed, 
 and will carry his point in spite of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-6">Ps. ii. 1-6</A>.

 Those that fight against God are preparing shame and ruin for 
 themselves; whoever <I>make war with the Lamb,</I> he will certainly 
 <I>overcome them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:14">Rev. xvii. 14</A>.

 2. That there can be no success without God, and therefore they must 
 never act but in dependence on him. Be the cause ever so good, and the 
 patrons of it ever so strong, and wise, and faithful, and the means of 
 carrying it on, and gaining the point, ever so probable, still they 
 must acknowledge God and take him along with them. Means indeed are to 
 be used; <I>the horse</I> must be <I>prepared against the day of 
 battle,</I> and the foot too; they must be armed and disciplined. In 
 Solomon's time even Israel's kings used horses in war, though they were 
 forbidden to multiply them. <I>But,</I> after all, <I>safety</I> and 
 salvation <I>are of the Lord;</I> he can save without armies, but 
 armies cannot save without him; and therefore he must be sought to and 
 trusted in for success, and when success is obtained he must have all 
 the glory. When we are preparing for <I>the day of battle</I> our great 
 concern must be to make God our friend and secure his favour.</P>
