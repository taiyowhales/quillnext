 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This and divers of the psalms that follow it seem to have been penned 
 by David for the service of the church in their solemn feasts, and not 
 upon any particular occasion. This is a psalm of praise. The title of 
 it is "Hallelujah--Praise you the Lord," intimating that we must address
 ourselves to the use of this psalm with hearts disposed to praise God. 
 It is composed alphabetically, each sentence beginning with a several 
 letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order exactly, two sentences to each 
 verse, and three a piece to the last two. The psalmist, exhorting to 
 praise God, 
 
 I. Sets himself for an example, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Furnishes us with matter for praise from the works of God. 

 1. The greatness of his works and the glory of them. 

 2. The righteousness of them. 
 
 3. The goodness of them. 

 4. The power of them.

 5. The conformity of them to his word of promise. 

 6. The perpetuity of them. These observations are intermixed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>.

 III. He recommends the holy fear of God, and conscientious obedience to 
 his commands, as the most acceptable way of praising God,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. I will praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with <I>my</I> whole
 heart, in the assembly of the upright, and <I>in</I> the congregation.

 <I>is</I> gracious and full of compassion.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of the psalm being <I>Hallelujah,</I> the psalmist (as every 
 author ought to have) has an eye to his title, and keeps to his 
 text.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He resolves to praise God himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 What duty we call others to we must oblige and excite ourselves to;
 nay, whatever others do, whether they will praise God or no, we and our 
 houses must determine to do it, we and our hearts; for such is the 
 psalmist's resolution here: <I>I will praise the Lord with my whole 
 heart.</I> My heart, my whole heart, being devoted to his honour, shall 
 be employed in this work; and this <I>in the assembly,</I> or secret, 
 <I>of the upright,</I> in the cabinet-council, <I>and in the 
 congregation</I> of Israelites. Note, We must praise God both in 
 private and in public, in less and greater assemblies, in our own 
 families and in the courts of the Lord's house; but in both it is most 
 comfortable to do it in concert with the upright, who will heartily 
 join in it. Private meetings for devotion should be kept up as well as 
 more public and promiscuous assemblies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He recommends to us the <I>works of the Lord</I> as the proper 
 subject of our meditations when we are praising him--the dispensations
 of his providence towards the world, towards the church, and towards 
 particular persons. 

 1. God's works are very magnificent, great like himself; there is
 nothing in them that is mean or trifling: they are the products of 
 infinite wisdom and power, and we must say this upon the first view of 
 them, before we come to enquire more particularly into them, that the 
 <I>works of the Lord are great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 There is something in them surprising, and that strikes an awe upon us. 
 All the <I>works of the Lord</I> are spoken of as one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 it is <I>his work,</I> such is the beauty and harmony of Providence and 
 so admirably do all its dispensations centre in one design; it was 
 cried to <I>the wheels, O wheel!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:13">Ezek. x. 13</A>.

 Take all together, and it is <I>honourable and glorious,</I> and such 
 as becomes him. 

 2. They are entertaining and exercising to the inquisitive--<I>sought 
 out of all those that have pleasure therein.</I> Note,

 (1.) All that truly love God have pleasure in his works, and reckon all 
 well that he does; nor do their thoughts dwell upon any subject with 
 more delight than on the works of God, which the more they are looked 
 into the more they give us of a pleasing surprise. 

 (2.) Those that have pleasure in the works of God will not take up with 
 a superficial transient view of them, but will diligently search into 
 them and observe them. In studying both natural and political history 
 we should have this in our eye, to discover the greatness and glory of 
 God's works. 

 (3.) These works of God, that are humbly and diligently sought into, 
 shall be <I>sought out;</I> those that <I>seek shall find</I> (so some 
 read); <I>they are found of all those that have pleasure in them,</I> 
 or found in all their parts, designs, purposes, and several 
 concernments (so Dr. Hammond), for the <I>secret of the Lord is with
 those that fear him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>.

 3. They are all justly and holy; <I>His righteousness endures for 
 ever.</I> Whatever he does, he never did, nor ever will do, any wrong 
 to any of his creatures; and <I>therefore</I> his works <I>endure for 
 ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>)

 because the righteousness of them endures. 

 4. They are admirable and memorable, fit to be registered and kept on
 record. Much that we do is so trifling that it is not fit to be spoken 
 of or told again; the greatest kindness is to forget it. But notice is 
 to be taken of God's works, and an account to be kept of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>).
 
 <I>He has made his wonderful works to be remembered;</I> he has done
 that which is worthy to be remembered, which cannot but be remembered, 
 and he has instituted ways and means for the keeping of some of them in 
 remembrance, as the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt by the passover.
 <I>He has made himself a memorial by his wonderful works</I> (so some 
 read it); see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10">Isa. lxiii. 10</A>.

 By that which God did with his <I>glorious arm he made himself an 
 everlasting name.</I> 

 5. They are very kind. In them the Lord shows that he is <I>gracious
 and full of compassion.</I> As of the works of creation, so of the 
 works of providence, we must say, They are not only all very great, but 
 all very good. Dr. Hammond takes this to be the name which God has made 
 to himself by his wonderful works, the same with that which he 
 proclaimed to Moses, <I>The Lord God is gracious and merciful,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:6">Exod. xxiv. 6</A>.

 God's pardoning sin is the most wonderful of all his works and which 
 ought to be remembered to his glory. It is a further instance of his 
 grace and compassion that <I>he has given meat to those that fear 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He gives them their daily bread, food convenient for them; so he does
 to others by common providence, but to those that fear him he gives it 
 by covenant and in pursuance of the promise, for it follows, <I>He will 
 be ever mindful of his covenant;</I> so that they can taste 
 covenant-love even in common mercies. Some refer this to the manna with 
 which God fed his people Israel in the wilderness, others to the spoil 
 they got from the Egyptians when they came out with great substance, 
 according to the promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:14">Gen. xv. 14</A>.

 When God <I>broke the heads of leviathan</I> he gave him to be <I>meat 
 to his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>.

 <I>He has given</I> prey <I>to those that fear him</I> (so the margin 
 has it), not only fed them, but enriched them, and given their enemies 
 to be a prey to them. 

 6. They are earnests of what he will do, according to his promise:
 <I>He will ever be mindful of his covenant,</I> for he has ever been 
 so; and, as he never did, so he never will, let one jot or tittle of it 
 fall to the ground. Though God's people have their infirmities, and are 
 often unmindful of his commands, yet he <I>will ever be mindful of his 
 covenant.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  He hath showed his people the power of his works, that he may
 give them the heritage of the heathen.
 &nbsp; 7  The works of his hands <I>are</I> verity and judgment; all his
 commandments <I>are</I> sure.
 &nbsp; 8  They stand fast for ever and ever, <I>and are</I> done in truth
 and uprightness.
 &nbsp; 9  He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
 covenant for ever: holy and reverend <I>is</I> his name.
 &nbsp; 10  The fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the beginning of wisdom: a good
 understanding have all they that do <I>his commandments:</I> his
 praise endureth for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught to give glory to God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For the great things he has done for his people, for his people 
 Israel, of old and of late: <I>He has shown his people the power of his 
 works</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 in what he has wrought for them; many a time he has given proofs of his 
 omnipotence, and shown them what he can do, and that there is nothing 
 too hard for him to do. Two things are specified to show <I>the power 
 of his works:</I>--

 1. The possession God gave to Israel in the land of Canaan, <I>that he 
 might give them,</I> or in giving them, <I>the heritage of the 
 heathen.</I> This he did in Joshua's time, when the seven nations were 
 subdued, and in David's time, when the neighbouring nations were many 
 of them brought into subjection to Israel and became tributaries to 
 David. Herein God showed his sovereignty, in disposing of kingdoms as 
 he pleases, and his might, in making good his disposals. If God will
 make the heritage of the heathen to be the heritage of Israel, who can 
 either arraign his counsel or stay his hand?

 2. The many deliverances which he wrought for his people when by their 
 iniquities they had sold themselves into the hand of their enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He sent redemption unto his people,</I> not only out of Egypt at 
 first, but often afterwards; and these redemptions were typical of the 
 great redemption which in the fulness of time was to be wrought out by 
 the Lord Jesus, that redemption in Jerusalem which so many waited 
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the stability both of his word and of his works, which assure 
 us of the great things he will do for them. 

 1. What God has done shall never be undone. He will not undo it
 himself, and men and devils cannot

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The works of his hand are verity and judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that is, they <I>are done in truth and uprightness;</I> all he does is 
 consonant to the eternal rules and reasons of equity, all according to 
 the counsel of his wisdom and the purpose of his will, all well done 
 and therefore there is nothing to be altered or amended, but his works 
 are firm and unchangeable. Upon the beginning of his works we may 
 depend for the perfecting of them; work that is done properly will 
 last, will neither go to decay nor sink under the stress that is laid 
 upon it.

 2. What God has said shall never be unsaid: <I>All his commandments
 are sure,</I> all straight and therefore all steady. His purposes, the 
 rule of his actions, shall all have their accomplishment: <I>Has he 
 spoken, and will he not make it good?</I> No doubt he will; whether he 
 commands light or darkness, it is done as he commands. His precepts, 
 the rule of our actions, are unquestionably just and good, and 
 therefore unchangeable and not to be repealed; his promises and 
 threatenings are all sure, and will be made good; nor shall the 
 unbelief of man make either the one or the other of no effect. They are 
 established, and therefore <I>they stand fast for ever and ever,</I> 
 and the scripture cannot be broken. The wise God is never put upon new 
 counsels, nor obliged to take new measures, either in his laws or in 
 his providences. All is said, as all is done, in truth and
 uprightness, and therefore it is immutable. Men's folly and falsehood 
 make them <I>unstable in all their ways,</I> but infinite wisdom and 
 truth for ever exclude retraction and revocation: <I>He has commanded 
 his covenant for ever.</I> God's covenant is commanded, for he has made 
 it as one that has an incontestable authority to prescribe both what we 
 must do and what we must expect, and an unquestionable ability to 
 perform both what he has promised in the blessings of the covenant and 
 what he has threatened in the curses of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8">Ps. cv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For the setting up and establishing of religion among men. Because 
 <I>holy and reverend is his name, and the fear of</I> him <I>is the 
 beginning of wisdom,</I> therefore <I>his praise endureth for ever,</I> 
 that is, he is to be everlastingly praised. 

 1. Because the discoveries of religion tend so much to his honour.
 Review what he has made known of himself in his word and in his works, 
 and you will see, and say, that God is great and greatly to be feared; 
 for his name is holy, his infinite purity and rectitude appear in all 
 that whereby he has made himself known, and because it is holy 
 therefore it is reverend, and to be thought of and mentioned with a 
 holy awe. Note, What is holy is reverend; the angels have an eye to 
 God's holiness when they cover their faces before him, and nothing is 
 more man's honour than his sanctification. It is in his holy places 
 that God appears most terrible,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:35,Le+10:3">Ps. lxviii. 35; Lev. x. 3</A>.

 2. Because the dictates of religion tend so much to man's happiness. We 
 have reason to praise God that the matter is so well contrived that our 
 reverence of him and obedience to him are as much our interest as they 
 are our duty. 

 (1.) Our reverence of him is so: <I>The fear of the Lord is the 
 beginning of wisdom.</I> It is not only reasonable that we should fear 
 God, because his name is reverend and his nature is holy, but it is 
 advantageous to us. It is wisdom; it will direct us to speak and act as 
 becomes us, in a consistency with ourselves, and for our own benefit. 
 It is the head of wisdom, that is (as we read it), it <I>is the 
 beginning of wisdom.</I> Men can never begin to be wise till they begin 
 to fear God; all true wisdom takes its rise from true religion, and has 
 its foundation in it. Or, as some understand it, it is the chief
 wisdom, and the most excellent, the first in dignity. It is the 
 principal wisdom, and the principal of wisdom, to worship God and give 
 honour to him as our Father and Master. Those manage well who always 
 act under the government of his holy fear. 

 (2.) Our obedience to him is so: <I>A good understanding have all those 
 that do his commandments.</I> Where the fear of the Lord rules in the 
 heart there will be a constant conscientious care to keep his 
 commandments, not to talk of them, but to do them; and such have a good 
 understanding, that is,

 [1.] They are well understood; their obedience is graciously accepted 
 as a plain indication of their mind that they do indeed fear God. 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:4">Prov. iii. 4</A>,

 <I>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding.</I> God and man 
 will look upon those as meaning well, and approve of them, who make 
 conscience of their duty, though they have their mistakes. What is 
 honestly intended shall be well taken.

 [2.] They understand well. <I>First,</I> It is a sign that they do
 understand well. The most obedient are accepted as the most
 intelligent; those understand themselves and their interest best that 
 make God's law their rule and are in every thing ruled by it. A great 
 understanding those have that know God's commandments and can discourse 
 learnedly of them, but a good understanding have those that do them and 
 walk according to them. <I>Secondly,</I> It is the way to understand
 better: <I>A good understanding are they to all that do them;</I> the 
 fear of the Lord and the laws of that give men a good understanding, 
 and are able to make them <I>wise unto salvation. If any man will do 
 his will, he shall know</I> more and more clearly of the doctrine of 
 Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.
 
 <I>Good success have all those that do them</I> (so the margin), 
 according to what was promised to Joshua if he would observe to do 
 according to the law. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:8">Josh. i. 8</A>,

 <I>Then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and shalt have good 
 success.</I> We have reason to praise God, to praise him for ever, for 
 putting man into such a fair way to happiness. Some apply the last 
 words rather to the good man who fears the Lord than to the good God: 
 <I>His praise endures for ever.</I> It is <I>not of men</I> perhaps, 
 <I>but</I> it is <I>of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>),

 and that praise which is of God endures for ever when the praise of men 
 is withered and gone.</P>
