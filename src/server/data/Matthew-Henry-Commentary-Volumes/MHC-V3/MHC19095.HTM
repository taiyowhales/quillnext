 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the expounding of this psalm we may borrow a great deal of light
 from the apostle's discourse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:1-4:16">Heb. iii. and iv.</A>,

 where it appears both to have been penned by David and to have been
 calculated for the days of the Messiah; for it is there said expressly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:7">Heb. iv. 7</A>)

 that the day here spoken of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7">ver. 7</A>)

 is to be understood of the gospel day, in which God speaks to us by his
 Son in a voice which we are concerned to hear, and proposes to us a
 rest besides that of Canaan. In singing psalms it is intended,

 I. That we should "make melody unto the Lord;" this we are here
 excited to do, and assisted in doing, being called upon to praise God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>)

 as a great God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>)

 and as our gracious benefactor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. That we should teach and admonish ourselves and one another; and we 
 are here taught and warned to hear God's voice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7">ver. 7</A>),

 and not to harden our hearts, as the Israelites in the wilderness did 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 lest we fall under God's wrath and fall short of his rest, as they did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 This psalm must be sung with a holy reverence of God's majesty and a
 dread of his justice, with a desire to please him and a fear to offend
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O come, let us sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: let us make a joyful noise
 to the rock of our salvation.
 &nbsp; 2  Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
 joyful noise unto him with psalms.
 &nbsp; 3  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> a great God, and a great King above all
 gods.
 &nbsp; 4  In his hand <I>are</I> the deep places of the earth: the strength
 of the hills <I>is</I> his also.
 &nbsp; 5  The sea <I>is</I> his, and he made it: and his hands formed the
 dry <I>land.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our maker.
 &nbsp; 7  For he <I>is</I> our God; and we <I>are</I> the people of his
 pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here, as often elsewhere, stirs up himself and others to 
 praise God; for it is a duty which ought to be performed with the most 
 lively affections, and which we have great need to be excited to, being 
 very often backward to it and cold in it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God is to be praised. 

 1. With holy joy and delight in him. The praising song must be <I>a
 joyful noise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>

 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Spiritual joy is the heart and soul of thankful praise. It is the will
 of God (such is the condescension of his grace) that when we give glory 
 to him as a being infinitely perfect and blessed we should, at the same 
 time, <I>rejoice in him</I> as our Father and King, and a God in 
 covenant with us. 

 2. With humble reverence, and a holy awe of him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Let us worship, and bow down, and kneel before him,</I> as becomes
 those who know what an infinite distance there is between us and God, 
 how much we are in danger of his wrath and in need of his mercy." 
 Though <I>bodily exercise,</I> alone, <I>profits little,</I> yet 
 certainly it is our duty to glorify God with our bodies by the outward 
 expressions of reverence, seriousness, and humility, in the duties of 
 religious worship.

 3. We must praise God with our voice; we must speak forth, sing forth,
 his praises out of the abundance of a heart filled with love, and joy, 
 and thankfulness--<I>Sing to the Lord; make a noise, a joyful noise to 
 him, with psalms</I>--as those who are ourselves much affected with his 
 greatness and goodness, are forward to own ourselves so, are desirous 
 to be more and more affected therewith, and would willingly be 
 instrumental to kindle and inflame the same pious and devout affection 
 in others also. 

 4. We must praise God in concert, in the solemn assemblies: "<I>Come, 
 let us sing;</I> let us join in singing to the Lord; not others without 
 me, nor I alone, but others with me. <I>Let us come</I> together 
 <I>before his presence,</I> in the courts of his house, where his 
 people are wont to attend him and to expect his manifestations of 
 himself." Whenever we come into God's presence we must come with 
 thanksgiving that we are admitted to such a favour; and, whenever we 
 have thanks to give, we must <I>come before God's presence,</I> set 
 ourselves before him, and present ourselves to him in the ordinances 
 which he has appointed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Why God is to be praised and what must be the matter of our praise. 
 We do not want matter; it were well if we did not want a heart. We must 
 praise God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because he is <I>a great God,</I> and sovereign Lord of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 He is great, and therefore <I>greatly to be praised.</I> He is infinite
 and immense, and has all perfection in himself. 

 (1.) He has great power: <I>He is a great King above all gods,</I> 
 above all deputed deities, all magistrates, to whom he said, <I>You are 
 gods</I> (he manages them all, and serves his own purposes by them, and 
 to him they are all accountable), above all counterfeit deities, all 
 pretenders, all usurpers; he can do that which none of them can do; he 
 can, and will, famish and vanquish them all. 

 (2.) He has great possessions. This lower world is here particularly 
 specified. We reckon those great men who have large territories, which 
 they call their own against all the world, which yet are a very 
 inconsiderable part of the universe: how great then is that God whose 
 <I>the whole earth is, and the fulness thereof,</I> not only under 
 whose feet it is, as he has an incontestable dominion over all the 
 creatures and a propriety in them, but in whose hand it is, as he has 
 the actual directing and disposing of all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 even <I>the deep places of the earth,</I> which are out of our sight,
 subterraneous springs and mines, <I>are in his hand;</I> and <I>the 
 height of the hills</I> which are out of our reach, whatever grows or 
 feeds upon them, <I>is his also.</I> This may be taken figuratively: 
 the meanest of the children of men, who are as the low places of the 
 earth, are not beneath his cognizance; and the greatest, who are as the 
 strength of the hills, are not above his control. Whatever strength is
 in any creature it is derived from God and employed for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The sea is his,</I> and all that is in it (the waves fulfil his
 word); it is his, for <I>he made it,</I> gathered its waters and fixed 
 its shores; <I>the dry land,</I> though given to the children of men, 
 is his too, for he still reserved the property to himself; it is his, 
 for <I>his hands formed</I> it, when his word made <I>the dry land</I> 
 appear. His being the Creator of all makes him, without dispute, the 
 owner of all. This being a gospel psalm, we may very well suppose that
 it is the Lord Jesus whom we are here taught to praise. He <I>is a 
 great God;</I> the mighty God is one of his titles, and <I>God over 
 all, blessed for evermore.</I> As Mediator, he is <I>a great King above 
 all gods;</I> by him kings reign; and angels, principalities, and 
 powers, are subject to him; <I>by him,</I> as the eternal Word, <I>all 
 things were made</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3">John i. 3</A>),

 and it was fit he should be the restorer and reconciler of all who was
 the Creator of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:16,20">Col. i. 16, 20</A>.

 To him all power is given both in heaven and in earth, and into his
 hand all things are delivered. It is he that sets one foot on the sea
 and the other on the earth, as sovereign Lord of both 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:2">Rev. x. 2</A>),

 and therefore to him we must sing our songs of praise, and before him
 we must <I>worship and bow down.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because he is our God, not only has a dominion over us, as he has 
 over all the creatures, but stands in special relation to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>He is our God,</I> and therefore it is expected we should praise
 him; who will, if we do not? What else did he make us for but that we 
 should <I>be to him for a name and a praise?</I> 

 (1.) He is our Creator, and the author of our being; we must <I>kneel 
 before the Lord our Maker,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Idolaters kneel before gods which they themselves made; we kneel before 
 a God who made us and all the world and who is therefore our rightful 
 proprietor; for his we are, and not our own.

 (2.) He is our Saviour, and the author of our blessedness. He is here 
 called <I>the rock of our salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only the founder, but the very foundation, of that work of wonder,
 on whom it is built. <I>That rock is Christ;</I> to him therefore we
 must sing our songs of praises, <I>to him that sits upon the throne and 
 to the Lamb.</I>

 (3.) We are therefore his, under all possible obligations: <I>We are 
 the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.</I> All the 
 children of men are so; they are fed and led by his Providence, which 
 cares for them, and conducts them, as the shepherd the sheep. We must 
 praise him, not only because he made us, but because he preserves and 
 maintains us, and our breath and ways are in his hand. All the
 church's children are in a special manner so; Israel <I>are the people 
 of his pasture and the sheep of his hand;</I> and therefore he demands 
 their homage in a special manner. The gospel church is his flock. 
 Christ is the great and good Shepherd of it. We, as Christians, are led 
 by his hand into the green pastures, by him we are protected and well 
 provided for, to his honour and service we are entirely devoted as a 
 peculiar people, and therefore to him must be <I>glory in the 
 churches</I> (whether it be in the world or no) <I>throughout all 
 ages,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7--To day if ye will hear his voice,
 &nbsp; 8  Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, <I>and</I> as <I>in</I>
 the day of temptation in the wilderness:
 &nbsp; 9  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
 &nbsp; 10  Forty years long was I grieved with <I>this</I> generation, and
 said, It <I>is</I> a people that do err in their heart, and they have

 into my rest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The latter part of this psalm, which begins in the middle of a verse, 
 is an exhortation to those who sing gospel psalms to live gospel lives, 
 and to hear the voice of God's word; otherwise, how can they expect 
 that he should hear the voice of their prayers and praises? 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duty required of all those that <I>are the people of</I> 
 Christ's <I>pasture and the sheep of his hand.</I> He expects that they 
 <I>hear his voice,</I> for he has said, <I>My sheep hear my voice,</I> 
 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:27">John x. 27</A>.

 <I>We are his people,</I> say they. Are you so? Then <I>hear his
 voice.</I> If you call him <I>Master,</I> or <I>Lord,</I> then <I>do 
 the things which he says,</I> and be his willing obedient people. Hear
 the voice of his doctrine, of his law, and, in both, of his Spirit; 
 hear and heed; hear and yield. <I>Hear his voice,</I> and not the 
 <I>voice of a stranger. If you will hear his voice;</I> some take it as 
 a wish, <I>O that you would hear his voice!</I> that you would be so 
 wise, and do so well for yourselves; like that, <I>If thou hadst 
 known</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:42">Luke xix. 42</A>),

 that is, O that thou hadst known! Christ's voice must be heard
 <I>to-day;</I> this the apostle lays much stress upon, applying it to 
 the gospel day. While he is speaking to you see that you attend to him, 
 for this day of your opportunities will not last always; improve it, 
 therefore, <I>while it is called to-day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:13,15">Heb. iii. 13, 15</A>.

 Hearing the voice of Christ is the same with believing. <I>To-day,</I>
 if by faith you accept the gospel offer, well and good, but to-morrow 
 it may be too late. In a matter of such vast importance nothing is more 
 dangerous than delay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sin they are warned against, as inconsistent with the believing 
 obedient ear required, and that is hardness of heart. <I>If you will 
 hear his voice,</I> and profit by what you hear, then do <I>not harden 
 your hearts;</I> for the seed sown on the rock never brought any fruit 
 to perfection. The Jews <I>therefore</I> believed not the gospel of 
 Christ because <I>their hearts were hardened;</I> they were not 
 convinced of the evil of sin, and of their danger by reason of sin, and 
 therefore they regarded not the offer of salvation; they would not bend 
 to the yoke of Christ, nor yield to his demands; and, if the sinner's 
 heart be hardened, it is his own act and deed (he hardening it himself) 
 and he alone shall bear the blame for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The example they are warned by, which is that of the Israelites in 
 the wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "Take heed of sinning as they did, lest you be shut out of the 
 everlasting rest as they were out of Canaan." <I>Be not, as your 
 fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:8">Ps. lxxxviii. 8</A>.

 Thus here, <I>Harden not your heart as</I> you did (that is, your 
 ancestors) <I>in the provocation,</I> or in <I>Meribah,</I> the place 
 where they quarrelled with God and Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2-7">Exod. xvii. 2-7</A>),

 <I>and in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 So often did they provoke God by their distrusts and murmurings that
 the whole time of their continuance in the wilderness might be called a 
 <I>day of temptation,</I> or <I>Massah,</I> the other name given to 
 that place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7">Exod. xvii. 7</A>),

 because they tempted the Lord, saying, <I>Is the Lord among us or is he
 not?</I> This was in the wilderness, where they could not help 
 themselves, but lay at God's mercy, and where God wonderfully helped 
 them and gave them such sensible proofs of his power and tokens of his 
 favour as never any people had before or since. Note, 

 (1.) Days of temptation are days of provocation. Nothing is more 
 offensive to God than disbelief of his promise and despair of the 
 performance of it because of some difficulties that seem to lie in the 
 way. 

 (2.) The more experience we have had of the power and goodness of God 
 the greater is our sin if we distrust him. What, to tempt him in the 
 wilderness, where we live upon him! This is as ungrateful as it is 
 absurd and unreasonable. 

 (3.) Hardness of heart is at the bottom of all our distrusts of God and 
 quarrels with him. That is a hard heart which receives not the 
 impressions of divine discoveries and conforms not to the intentions of 
 the divine will, which will not melt, which will not bend. 

 (4.) The sins of others ought to be warnings to us not to tread in 
 their steps. The murmurings of Israel <I>were written for our
 admonition,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The charge drawn up, in God's name, against the unbelieving 
 Israelites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 God here, many ages after, complains of their ill conduct towards him,
 with the expressions of high resentment.

 [1.] Their sin was unbelief: they <I>tempted</I> God and <I>proved</I> 
 him; they questioned whether they might take his word, and insisted 
 upon further security before they would go forward to Canaan, by 
 sending spies; and, when those discouraged them, they protested against 
 the sufficiency of the divine power and promise, and would make a 
 captain and return into Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:3,4">Num. xiv. 3, 4</A>.

 This is called <I>rebellion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:26,32">Deut. i. 26, 32</A>.

 [2.] The aggravation of this sin was that they <I>saw God's work;</I>
 they saw what he had done for them in bringing them out of Egypt, nay, 
 what he was now doing for them every day, this day, in the bread he 
 rained from heaven for them and the water out of the rock that followed 
 them, than which they could not have more unquestionable evidences of 
 God's presence with them. With them even seeing was not believing, 
 because they <I>hardened their hearts,</I> though they had seen what 
 Pharaoh got by hardening his heart. 

 [3.] The causes of their sin. See what God imputed it to: <I>It is a 
 people that do err in their hearts, and they have not known my 
 ways.</I> Men's unbelief and distrust of God, their murmurings and 
 quarrels with him, are the effect of their ignorance and mistake. 
 <I>First,</I> Of their ignorance: <I>They have not known my ways.</I> 
 They saw his work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 and he <I>made known his acts to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:7">Ps. ciii. 7</A>);

 and yet they <I>did not know his ways,</I> the ways of his providence,
 in which he walked towards them, or the ways of his commandments, in 
 which he would have them to walk towards him: they did not know, they 
 did not rightly understand and therefore did not approve of these. 
 Note, The reason why people slight and forsake the ways of God is 
 because they do not know them. <I>Secondly,</I> Of their mistake:
 <I>They do err in their heart;</I> they wander out of the way; in heart 
 they turn back. Note, Sins are errors, practical errors, errors in 
 heart; such there are, and as fatal as errors in the head. When the
 corrupt affections pervert the judgment, and so lead the soul out of 
 the ways of duty and obedience, there is an error of the heart.

 [4.] God's resentment of their sin: <I>Forty years long was I grieved 
 with this generation.</I> Note, The sins of God's professing people do
 not only anger him, but grieve him, especially their distrust of him; 
 and God keeps an account how often 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:22">Num. xiv. 22</A>)

 and how long they grieve him. See the patience of God towards provoking
 sinners; he was grieved with them forty years, and yet those years 
 ended in a triumphant entrance into Canaan made by the next generation. 
 If our sins have grieved God, surely they should grieve us, and nothing 
 in sin should grieve us so much as that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sentence passed upon them for their sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Unto whom I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my
 rest,</I> then say I am changeable and untrue:" see the sentence at 
 large,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:21">Num. xiv. 21</A>,

 &c. Observe,

 [1.] Whence this sentence came--from the wrath of God. He <I>swore
 solemnly in his wrath,</I> his just and holy wrath; but let not men 
 therefore swear profanely in their wrath, their sinful brutish wrath. 
 God is not subject to such passions as we are; but he is said to be 
 angry, very angry, at sin and sinners, to show the malignity of sin and 
 the justice of God's government. That is certainly an evil thing which 
 deserves such a recompence of revenge as may be expected from a 
 provoked Deity. 

 [2.] What it was: <I>That they should not enter into his rest,</I> the 
 rest which he had prepared and designed for them, a settlement for them 
 and theirs, that none of those who were enrolled when they came out of 
 Egypt should be found written in the roll of the living at their 
 entering into Canaan, but Caleb and Joshua.

 [3.] How it was ratified: <I>I swore it.</I> It was not only a purpose, 
 but a decree; the oath showed the <I>immutability of his counsel; the 
 Lord swore, and will not repent.</I> It cut off the thought of any 
 reserve of mercy. God's threatenings are as sure as his promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this case of Israel may be applied to those of their posterity that 
 lived in David's time, when this psalm was penned; let them hear God's 
 voice, and not harden their hearts as their fathers did, lest, if they 
 were stiffnecked like them, God should be provoked to forbid them the 
 privileges of his temple at Jerusalem, of which he had said, <I>This is 
 my rest.</I> But it must be applied to us Christians, because so the 
 apostle applies it. There is a spiritual and eternal rest set before
 us, and promised to us, of which Canaan was a type; we are all (in 
 profession, at least) bound for this rest; yet many that seem to be so 
 come short and shall never enter into it. And what is it that puts a 
 bar in their door? It is sin; it is unbelief, that sin against the 
 remedy, against our appeal. Those that, like Israel, distrust God, and 
 his power and goodness, and prefer the garlick and onions of Egypt 
 before the milk and honey of Canaan, will justly be shut out from his 
 rest: so shall their doom be; they themselves have decided it. <I>Let 
 us therefore fear,</I>
