 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is another psalm of praise. Some think it was penned after the
 return of the Jews from their captivity; but it is so much of a piece
 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:1-21">Ps. cxlv.</A>

 that I rather think it was penned by David, and what is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:2,13">ver. 2, 13</A>)

 may well enough be applied to the first building and fortifying of
 Jerusalem in his time, and the gathering in of those that had been
 out-casts in Saul's time. The Septuagint divides it into two; and we
 may divide it into the first and second part, but both of the same
 import.

 I. We are called upon to praise God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:1,7,12">ver. 1, 7, 12</A>.

 II. We are furnished with matter for praise, for God is to be
 glorified, 

 1. As the God of nature, and so he is very great, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:4,5,8,9,15-18">ver. 4, 5, 8, 9, 15-18</A>.

 2. As the God of grace, comforting his people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:3,6,10,11">ver. 3, 6, 10, 11</A>.

 3. As the God of Israel, Jerusalem, and Zion, settling their civil 
 state 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:2,13,14">ver. 2, 13, 14</A>),

 and especially settling religion among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 It is easy, in singing this psalm, to apply it to ourselves, both as to 
 personal and national mercies, were it but as easy to do so with 
 suitable affections.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for <I>it is</I> good to sing praises unto our
 God; for <I>it is</I> pleasant; <I>and</I> praise is comely.

 not pleasure in the legs of a man.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The duty of praise is recommended to us. It is not without reason
 that we are thus called to it again and again: <I>Praise you the 
 Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and again 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving, sing praise upon the harp to 
 our God</I> (let all our praises be directed to him and centre in him), 
 <I>for it is good</I> to do so; it is our duty, and therefore good in 
 itself; it is our interest, and therefore good for us. It is acceptable 
 to our Creator and it answers the end of our creation. The law for it 
 is holy, just, and good; the practice of it will turn to a good 
 account. It is good, for 

 1. It is pleasant. Holy joy or delight are required as the principle of 
 it, and that is pleasant to us as men; giving glory to God is the 
 design and business of it, and that is pleasant to us as saints that 
 are devoted to his honour. Praising God is work that is its own wages; 
 it is heaven upon earth; it is what we should be in as in our element. 
 
 2. It is comely; it is that which becomes us as reasonable creatures,
 much more as people in covenant with God. In giving honour to God we
 really do ourselves a great deal of honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God is recommended to us as the proper object of our most exalted 
 and enlarged praises, upon several accounts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The care he takes of his chosen people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Is Jerusalem to be raised out of small beginnings? Is it to be 
 recovered out of its ruins? In both cases, <I>The Lord builds up
 Jerusalem.</I> The gospel-church, the Jerusalem that is from above, is 
 of this building. He framed the model of it in his own counsels; he 
 founded it by the preaching of his gospel; he adds to it daily such as 
 shall be saved, and so increases it. He will build it up unto 
 perfection, build it up as high as heaven. Are any of his people
 outcasts? Have they made themselves so by their own folly? He gathers 
 them by giving them repentance and bringing them again into the 
 communion of saints. Have they been forced out by war, famine, or 
 persecution? He opens a door for their return; many that were missing, 
 and thought to be lost, are brought back, and those that were scattered 
 in the cloudy and dark day are gathered together again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The comforts he has laid up for true penitents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They are <I>broken in heart,</I> and wounded, humbled, and troubled, 
 for sin, inwardly pained at the remembrance of it, as a man is that is 
 sorely wounded. Their very hearts are not only pricked, but rent, under 
 the sense of the dishonour they have done to God and the injury they 
 have done to themselves by sin. To those whom God heals with the 
 consolations of his Spirit he speaks peace, assures them that their 
 sins are pardoned and that he is reconciled to them, and so makes them 
 easy, pours the balm of Gilead into the bleeding wounds, and then binds 
 them up, and makes them to rejoice. Those who have had experience of 
 this need not be called upon to praise the Lord; for when he brought 
 them <I>out of the horrible pit,</I> and <I>set their feet upon a 
 rock,</I> he <I>put a new song into their mouths,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:2,3">Ps. xl. 2, 3</A>.

 And for this let others praise him also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The sovereign dominion he has over the lights of heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 The stars are innumerable, many of them being scarcely discernible with 
 the naked eye, and yet he counts them, and knows the exact number of 
 them, for they are all the work of his hands and the instruments of his 
 providence. Their bulk and power are very great; but <I>he calleth them 
 all by their names,</I> which shows his dominion over them and the 
 command he has them at, to make what use of them he pleases. They are 
 his servants, his soldiers; he musters them, he marshals them; they 
 come and go at his bidding, and all their motions are under his 
 direction. He mentions this as one instance of many, to show that 
 <I>great is our Lord and of great power</I> (he can do what he 
 pleases), and of <I>his understanding there is no computation,</I> so 
 that he can contrive every thing for the best. Man's knowledge is soon 
 drained, and you have his utmost length; hitherto his wisdom can reach 
 and no further. But God's knowledge is a depth that can never be 
 fathomed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The pleasure he takes in humbling the proud and exalting those of 
 low degree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The Lord lifts up the meek,</I> who abase themselves before him, and 
 whom men trample on; but <I>the wicked,</I> who conduct themselves 
 insolently towards God and scornfully towards all mankind, who lift up 
 themselves in pride and folly, he <I>casteth down to the ground,</I> 
 sometimes by very humbling providences in this world, at furthest in 
 the day when their faces shall be <I>filled with everlasting shame.</I> 
 God proves himself to be God by <I>looking on the proud and abasing 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The provision he makes for the inferior creatures. Though he is so 
 great as to command the stars, he is so good as not to forget even the 
 fowls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 Observe in what method he feeds man and beast.

 (1.) <I>He covereth the heaven with clouds,</I> which darken the air 
 and intercept the beams of the sun, and yet in them he <I>prepareth</I> 
 that <I>rain for the earth</I> which is necessary to its fruitfulness.
 Clouds look melancholy, and yet without them we could have no rain and 
 consequently no fruit. Thus afflictions, for the present, look black, 
 and dark, and unpleasant, and we are in heaviness because of them, as 
 sometimes when the sky is overcast it makes us dull; but they are 
 necessary, for from these clouds of affliction come those showers that 
 make the harvest to <I>yield the peaceable fruits of righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:11">Heb. xii. 11</A>),

 which should help to reconcile us to them. Observe the necessary 
 dependence which the earth has upon the heavens, which directs us on 
 earth to depend on God in heaven. All the rain with which the earth is
 watered is of God's preparing. 

 (2.) By the rain which distils on the earth he <I>makes grass to grow 
 upon the mountains,</I> even the high mountains, which man neither 
 takes care of nor reaps the benefit of. The mountains, which are not
 watered with the springs and rivers, as the valleys are, are yet 
 watered so that they are not barren. 

 (3.) This grass he <I>gives</I> to <I>the beast</I> for <I>his 
 food,</I> the beast of the mountains which runs wild, which man makes 
 no provision for. And even the <I>young ravens,</I> which, being 
 forsaken by their old ones, <I>cry,</I> are heard by him, and ways are 
 found to feed them, so that they are kept from perishing in the 
 nest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The complacency he takes in his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 In times when great things are doing, and there are great expectations 
 of the success of them, it concerns us to know (since the issue 
 proceeds from the Lord) whom, and what, God will delight to honour and 
 crown with victory. It is not the strength of armies, but the strength 
 of grace, that God is pleased to own.

 (1.) Not the strength of armies--not in the cavalry, <I>for he 
 delighteth not in the strength of the horse,</I> the war-horse, noted 
 for his courage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:19">Job xxxix. 19</A>,

 &c.)--nor in the infantry, for he <I>taketh no pleasure in the legs of a
 man;</I> he does not mean the swiftness of them for flight, to quit the 
 field, but the steadiness of them for charging, to stand the ground. If 
 one king, making war with another king, goes to God to pray for 
 success, it will not avail him to plead, "Lord, I have a gallant army, 
 the horse and foot in good order; it is a pity that they should suffer 
 any disgrace;" for that is no argument with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps. xx. 7</A>.
 
 Jehoshaphat's was much better: <I>Lord, we have no might,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:12">2 Chron. xx. 12</A>.

 But, 

 (2.) God is pleased to own the strength of grace. A serious and 
 suitable regard to God is that which is, in the sight of God, of great 
 price in such a case. The Lord accepts and <I>takes pleasure</I> in 
 those that <I>fear him and that hope in his mercy.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] A holy fear of God and hope in God not only may consist, but must 
 concur. In the same heart, at the same time, there must be both a
 reverence of his majesty and a complacency in his goodness, both a 
 believing dread of his wrath and a believing expectation of his favour; 
 not that we must hang in suspense between hope and fear, but we must 
 act under the gracious influences of hope and fear. Our fear must save 
 our hope from swelling into presumption, and our hope must save our 
 fear from sinking into despair; thus must we take our work before us.

 [2.] We must <I>hope in God's mercy,</I> his general mercy, even when 
 we cannot find a particular promise to stay ourselves upon. A humble 
 confidence in the goodness of God's nature is very pleasing to him, as 
 that which turns to the glory of that attribute in which he most 
 glories. Every man of honour loves to be trusted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
 &nbsp; 13  For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
 blessed thy children within thee.
 &nbsp; 14  He maketh peace <I>in</I> thy borders, <I>and</I> filleth thee with
 the finest of the wheat.
 &nbsp; 15  He sendeth forth his commandment <I>upon</I> earth: his word
 runneth very swiftly.
 &nbsp; 16  He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
 ashes.
 &nbsp; 17  He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
 his cold?
 &nbsp; 18  He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his
 wind to blow, <I>and</I> the waters flow.
 &nbsp; 19  He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his
 judgments unto Israel.
 &nbsp; 20  He hath not dealt so with any nation: and <I>as for his</I>
 judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jerusalem, and Zion, the holy city, the holy hill, are here called upon 
 to <I>praise God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 For where should praise be offered up to God but where his altar is? 
 Where may we expect that glory should be given to him but in the beauty 
 of holiness? Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem praise the Lord in their 
 own houses; let the priests and Levites, who attend in Zion, the city 
 of their solemnities, in a special manner praise the Lord. They have 
 more cause to do it than others, and they lie under greater obligations 
 to do it than others; for it is their business, it is their profession. 
 "<I>Praise thy God, O Zion!</I> he is thine, and therefore thou art 
 bound to praise him; his being thine includes all happiness, so that 
 thou canst never want matter for praise." Jerusalem and Zion must 
 praise God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For the prosperity and flourishing state of their civil interests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 1. For their common safety. They had gates, and kept their gates barred 
 in times of danger; but that would not have been an effectual security 
 to them if God had not <I>strengthened the bars of their gates</I> and 
 fortified their fortifications. The most probable means we can devise 
 for our own preservation will not answer the end, unless God give his 
 blessing with them; we must therefore in the careful and diligent use 
 of those means, depend upon him for that blessing, and attribute the 
 undisturbed repose of our land more to the wall of fire than to the 
 wall of water round about us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5">Zech. ii. 5</A>.

 2. For the increase of their people. This strengthens the bars of the
 gates as much as any thing: <I>He hath blessed thy children within
 thee,</I> with that first and great blessing, <I>Be fruitful, and 
 multiply, and replenish the land.</I> It is a comfort to parents to see 
 their children blessed of the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9">Isa. lxi. 9</A>),

 and a comfort to the generation that is going off to see the rising 
 generation numerous and hopeful, for which blessing God must be 
 blessed. 

 3. For the public tranquillity, that they were delivered from the
 terrors and desolations of war: <I>He makes peace in thy borders,</I> 
 by putting an end to the wars that were, and preventing the wars that 
 were threatened and feared. <I>He makes peace within thy borders,</I> 
 that is, in all parts of the country, by composing differences among 
 neighbours, that there may be no intestine broils and animosities, and 
 <I>upon thy borders,</I> that they may not be attacked by invasions 
 from abroad. If there be trouble any where, it is in the borders, the 
 marches of a country; the frontier-towns lie most exposed, so that, if 
 there be peace in the borders, there is a universal peace, a mercy we 
 can never be sufficiently thankful for. 

 4. For great plenty, the common effect of peace: He <I>filleth thee
 with the finest of the wheat</I>--wheat, the most valuable grain, the 
 fat, the finest of that, and a fulness thereof. What would they more? 
 Canaan abounded with the best wheat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14">Deut. xxxii. 14</A>)

 and exported it to the countries abroad, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>.

 The land of Israel was not enriched with precious stones nor spices, 
 but with <I>the finest of the wheat,</I> with bread, which strengthens 
 man's heart. This made it the glory of all lands, and for this God was 
 praised in Zion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the wonderful instances of his power in the weather, 
 particularly the winter-weather. He that protects Zion and Jerusalem is 
 that God of power from whom all the powers of nature are derived and on 
 whom they depend, and who produces all the changes of the seasons, 
 which, if they were not common, would astonish us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, whatever alterations there are in this lower world (and 
 it is that world that is subject to continual changes) they are 
 produced by the will, and power, and providence of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth,</I> as one that has an 
 incontestable authority to give orders, and innumerable attendants 
 ready to carry his orders and put them in execution. As the world was 
 at first made, so it is still upheld and governed, by a word of 
 almighty power. <I>God speaks and it is done,</I> for all are his 
 servants. That word takes effect, not only surely, but speedily. <I>His 
 word runneth very swiftly,</I> for nothing can oppose or retard it. As 
 the lightning, which passes through the air in an instant, such is the 
 word of God's providence, and such the word of his grace, when it is 
 sent forth with commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:24">Luke xvii. 24</A>.

 Angels, who carry his word and fulfil it, <I>fly swiftly,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In particular, frosts and thaws are both of them wonderful changes, 
 and in both we must acknowledge the word of his power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Frosts are from God. With him are the <I>treasures of the snow and 
 the hail</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>),

 and out of these treasures he draws as he pleases. 

 [1.] <I>He giveth snow like wool.</I> It is compared to wool for its 
 whiteness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>),

 and its softness; it falls silently, and makes no more noise than the 
 fall of a lock of wool; it covers the earth, and keeps it warm like a 
 fleece of wool, and so promotes its fruitfulness. See how God can work
 by contraries, and bring meat out of the eater, can warm the earth with 
 cold snow. 

 [2.] <I>He scatters the hoar-frost,</I> which is dew congealed, as the 
 snow and hail are rain congealed. This looks like ashes scattered upon 
 the grass, and is sometimes prejudicial to the products of the earth 
 and blasts them as if it were hot ashes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:47">Ps. lxxviii. 47</A>.

 [3.] <I>He casts forth his ice like morsels,</I> which may be
 understood either of large hail-stones, which are as ice in the air, or 
 of the ice which covers the face of the waters, and when it is broken, 
 though naturally it was as drops of drink, it is as morsels of meat, or 
 crusts of bread. 

 [4.] When we see the frost, and snow, and ice, we feel it in the air: 
 <I>Who can stand before his cold?</I> The beasts cannot; they retire 
 into dens

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:8">Job xxxvii. 8</A>);

 they are easily conquered then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:20">2 Sam. xxiii. 20</A>.

 Men cannot, but are forced to protect themselves by fires, or furs, or 
 both, and all little enough where and when the cold is in extremity. We 
 see not the causes when we feel the effects; and therefore we must call 
 it <I>his cold;</I> it is of his sending, and therefore we must bear it 
 patiently, and be thankful for warm houses, and clothes, and beds, to 
 relieve us against the rigour of the season, and must give him the 
 glory of his wisdom and sovereignty, his power and faithfulness, which 
 shall not cease any more than summer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:22">Gen. viii. 22</A>.

 And let us also infer from it, If we cannot stand before the cold of 
 his frosts, how can we stand before the heat of his wrath?</P>

 (2.) Thaws are from God. When he pleases 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 <I>he sends out his word and melts them;</I> the frost, the snow, the 
 ice, are all dissolved quickly, in order to which he <I>causes the 
 wind,</I> the <I>south wind, to blow,</I> and <I>the waters,</I> which 
 were frozen, <I>flow</I> again as they did before. We are soon sensible 
 of the change, but we see not the causes of it, but must resolve it 
 into the will of the First Cause. And in it we must take notice not 
 only of the power of God, that he can so suddenly, so insensibly, make 
 such a great and universal alteration in the temper of the air and the 
 face of the earth (what cannot he do that does this every winter, 
 perhaps often every winter?) but also of the goodness of God. Hard 
 weather does not always continue; it would be sad if it should. He does 
 not <I>contend for ever,</I> but <I>renews the face of the earth.</I> 
 As he remembered Noah, and released him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:1">Gen. viii. 1</A>),

 so he remembers the earth, and his covenant with the earth, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:11,12">Cant. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 This thawing word may represent the gospel of Christ, and this thawing 
 wind the Spirit of Christ (for the Spirit is compared to the wind, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:8">John iii. 8</A>);

 both are sent for the melting of frozen souls. Converting grace, like
 the thaw, softens the heart that was hard, moistens it, and melts it 
 into tears of repentance; it warms good affections, and makes them to 
 flow, which, before, were chilled and stopped up. The change which the 
 thaw makes is universal and yet gradual; it is very evident, and yet 
 how it is done is unaccountable: such is the change wrought in the 
 conversion of a soul, when God's word and Spirit are sent to melt it 
 and restore it to itself.</P>

 III. For his distinguishing favour to Israel, in giving them his word 
 and ordinances, a much more valuable blessing than their peace and 
 plenty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 as much as the soul is more excellent than the body. Jacob and Israel
 had God's statutes and judgments among them. They were under his 
 peculiar government; the municipal laws of their nation were of his 
 framing and enacting, and their constitution was a theocracy. They had
 the benefit of divine revelation; the great things of God's law were 
 written to them. They had a priesthood of divine institution for all 
 things pertaining to God, and prophets for all extraordinary occasions. 
 No people besides went upon sure grounds in their religion. Now this
 was, 

 1. A preventing mercy. They did not find out God's statutes and 
 judgments of themselves, but <I>God showed his word unto Jacob,</I> and 
 by that word he made known to them his <I>statutes and judgments.</I> 
 It is a great mercy to any people to have the word of God among them; 
 for <I>faith comes by hearing</I> and reading that word, that faith 
 without which it is impossible to please God. 

 2. A distinguishing mercy, and upon that account the more obliging:
 "<I>He hath not dealt so with every nation,</I> not with <I>any</I> 
 nation; and, <I>as for his judgments, they have not known them,</I> nor 
 are likely to know them till the Messiah shall come and take down the 
 partition-wall between Jew and Gentile, that the gospel may be preached 
 to every creature." Other nations had plenty of outward good things; 
 some nations were very rich, others had pompous powerful princes and 
 polite literature, but none were blessed with God's statutes and 
 judgments as Israel were. Let <I>Israel</I> therefore <I>praise the 
 Lord</I> in the observance of these statutes. <I>Lord, how is it that 
 thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world! Even so, 
 Father, because it seemed good in thy eyes.</I></P>
