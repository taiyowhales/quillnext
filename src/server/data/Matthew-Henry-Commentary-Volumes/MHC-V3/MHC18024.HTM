 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job having by his complaints in the foregoing chapter given vent to his
 passion, and thereby gained some ease, breaks them off abruptly, and
 now applies himself to a further discussion of the doctrinal
 controversy between him and his friends concerning the prosperity of
 wicked people. That many live at ease who yet are ungodly and profane,
 and despise all the exercises of devotion, he had shown,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:1-34"><I>ch.</I> xxi.</A>

 Now here he goes further, and shows that many who are mischievous to
 mankind, and live in open defiance to all the laws of justice and
 common honesty, yet thrive and succeed in their unrighteous practices;
 and we do not see them reckoned with in this world. What he had said
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:6"><I>ch.</I> xii. 6</A>),

 "The tabernacles of robbers prosper," he here enlarges upon.  He lays
 down his general proposition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:1">ver. 1</A>),

 that the punishment of wicked people is not so visible and apparent as
 his friends supposed, and then proves it by an induction of 
 particulars.

 I.  Those that openly do wrong to their poor neighbours are not 
 reckoned with, nor the injured righted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:2-12">ver. 2-12</A>),

 though the former are very barbarous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 II. Those that secretly practise mischief often go undiscovered and
 unpunished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 III. That God punished such by secret judgments and reserves them for
 future judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:18-20,23-25">ver. 18-20, and 23-25</A>),

 so that, upon the whole matter, we cannot say that all who are in
 trouble are wicked; for it is certain that all who are in prosperity 
 are not righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
 that know him not see his days?
 &nbsp; 2  <I>Some</I> remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
 and feed <I>thereof.</I>
 &nbsp; 3  They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
 widow's ox for a pledge.
 &nbsp; 4  They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth
 hide themselves together.
 &nbsp; 5  Behold, <I>as</I> wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
 work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness <I>yieldeth</I> food
 for them <I>and</I> for <I>their</I> children.
 &nbsp; 6  They reap <I>every one</I> his corn in the field: and they gather
 the vintage of the wicked.
 &nbsp; 7  They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that <I>they
 have</I> no covering in the cold.
 &nbsp; 8  They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
 the rock for want of a shelter.
 &nbsp; 9  They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
 of the poor.
 &nbsp; 10  They cause <I>him</I> to go naked without clothing, and they take
 away the sheaf <I>from</I> the hungry;
 &nbsp; 11  <I>Which</I> make oil within their walls, <I>and</I> tread <I>their</I>
 winepresses, and suffer thirst.
 &nbsp; 12  Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
 crieth out: yet God layeth not folly <I>to them.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job's friends had been very positive in it that they should soon see 
 the fall of wicked people, how much soever they might prosper for a 
 while. By no means, says Job; <I>though times are not hidden from the 
 Almighty,</I> yet <I>those that know him do not presently see his 
 day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. He takes it for granted that times are not hidden from the Almighty;
 past times are not hidden from his judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:15">Eccl. iii. 15</A>),

 present times are not hidden from his providence
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:29">Matt. x. 29</A>),

 future times are not hidden from his prescience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18">Acts xv. 18</A>.

 God governs the world, and therefore we may be sure he takes cognizance
 of it. Bad times are not hidden from him, though the bad men that make 
 the times bad say one to another, He has <I>forsaken the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:6,7">Ps. xciv. 6, 7</A>.

 Every man's times are in his hand, and under his eye, and therefore it
 is in his power to make the times of wicked men in this world 
 miserable. He foresees the time of every man's death, and therefore, if 
 wicked men die before they are punished for their wickedness, we cannot 
 say, "They escaped him by surprise;" he foresaw it, nay, he ordered it. 
 Before Job will enquire into the reasons of the prosperity of wicked 
 men he asserts God's omniscience, as one prophet, in a similar case, 
 asserts his righteousness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1">Jer. xii. 1</A>),

 another his holiness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13">Hab. i. 13</A>),

 another his goodness to his own people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1">Ps. lxxiii. 1</A>.

 General truths must be held fast, though we may find it difficult to
 reconcile them to particular events. 

 2. He yet asserts that those who know him (that is, wise and good 
 people who are acquainted with him, and with whom his secret is) <I>do 
 not see his day,</I>--the day of his judging for them; this was the 
 thing he complained of in his own case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8</A>),

 that he could not see God appearing on his behalf to plead his
 cause,--the day of his judging against open and notorious sinners, that
 is called <I>his day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 We believe that day will come, but we do not see it, because it is
 future, and its presages are secret.

 3.  Though this is a mystery of Providence, yet there is a reason for
 it, and we shall shortly know why the judgment is deferred; even the 
 wisest, and those who know God best, do not yet see it. God will 
 exercise their faith and patience, and excite their prayers for the 
 coming of his kingdom, for which they are to <I>cry day and night to 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:7">Luke xviii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the proof of this, that wicked people prosper, Job specifies two 
 sorts of unrighteous ones, whom all the world saw thriving in their 
 iniquity:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tyrants, and those that do wrong under pretence of law and 
 authority. It is a melancholy sight which has often been <I>seen under 
 the sun, wickedness in the place of judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>),

 the unregarded <I>tears of the oppressed,</I> while <I>on the side of
 the oppressors there was power</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>),

 the <I>violent perverting of justice and judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>.

 1.  They disseize their neighbours of their real estates, which came to
 them by descent from their ancestors. They <I>remove the 
 land-marks,</I> under pretence that they were misplaced

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and so they encroach upon their neighbours' rights and think they
 effectually secure that to their posterity which they have got 
 wrongfully, by making that to be an evidence for them which should have 
 been an evidence for the rightful owner. This was forbidden by the law 
 of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:14">Deut. xix. 14</A>),
 
 under a curse,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:17">Deut. xxvii. 17</A>.

 Forging or destroying deeds is now a crime equivalent to this. 

 2. They dispossess them of their personal estates, under colour of
 justice.  <I>They violently take away flocks,</I> pretending they are 
 forfeited, <I>and feed thereof;</I> as the rich man took the poor man's 
 ewe lamb,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:4">2 Sam. xii. 4</A>.

 If a poor fatherless child has but an ass of his own to get a little
 money with, they find some colour or other to take it away, because the 
 owner is not able to contest with them. It is all one if a widow has 
 but an ox for what little husbandry she has; under pretence of 
 distraining for some small debt, or arrears of rent, this ox shall be 
 taken for a pledge, though perhaps it is the widow's all. God has taken 
 it among the titles of his honour to be a <I>Father of the fatherless 
 and a judge of the widows;</I> and therefore those will not be reckoned 
 his friends that do not to their utmost protect and help them; but 
 those he will certainly reckon with as his enemies that vex and oppress 
 them. 

 3. They take all occasions to offer personal abuses to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:4"><I>v.</I>  4</A>.
 
 They will mislead them if they can when they meet them on the high-way,
 so that the poor and needy are forced to hide themselves from them, 
 having no other way to secure themselves from them. They love in their 
 hearts to banter people, and to make fools of them, and do them a 
 mischief if they can, especially to triumph over poor people, whom they 
 turn out of the way of getting relief, threaten to punish them as 
 vagabonds, and so force them to abscond, and laugh at them when they 
 have done. Some understand those barbarous actions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:9,10"><I>v.</I>  9, 10</A>)

 to be done by those oppressors that pretend law for what they do:
 <I>They pluck the fatherless from the breast;</I> that is, having made 
 poor infants fatherless, they make them motherless too; having taken 
 away the father's life, they break the mother's heart, and so starve 
 the children and leave them to perish. Pharaoh and Herod plucked 
 children from the breast to the sword; and we read of <I>children 
 brought forth to the murderers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13">Hos. ix. 13</A>.

 Those are inhuman murderers indeed that can with so much pleasure suck
 innocent blood.  <I>They take a pledge of the poor,</I> and so they rob 
 the spital; nay, they take the poor themselves for a pledge (as some 
 read it), and probably it was under this pretence that they <I>plucked 
 the fatherless from the breast,</I> distraining them for slaves, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:5">Neh. v. 5</A>.

 Cruelty to the poor is great wickedness and cries aloud for vengeance.
 Those who show no mercy to such as lie at their mercy shall themselves 
 have judgment without mercy. Another instance of their barbarous 
 treatment of those they have advantage against is that they take from 
 them even their necessary food and raiment; they squeeze them so with 
 their extortion that they <I>cause them to go naked without 
 clothing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 and so catch their death. And if a poor hungry family has gleaned a
 sheaf of corn, to make a little cake of, that they may eat it and die, 
 even that they take away from them, being well pleased to see them 
 perish for want, while they themselves are fed to the full. 

 4. They are very oppressive to the labourers they employ in their
 service. They not only give them no wages, though the labourer is 
 worthy of his hire (and this is a crying sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>),

 but they will not so much as give them meat and drink: <I>Those that
 carry their sheaves are hungry;</I> so some read it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and it agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 that those who <I>make oil within their walls,</I> and with a great
 deal of toil labour at the wine-presses, yet suffer thirst, which was 
 worse than muzzling the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Those 
 masters forget that they have a Master in heaven who will not allow the 
 necessary supports of life to their servants and labourers, not caring 
 whether they can live by their labour or no.

 5. It is not only among the poor country people, but in the cities
 also, that we see the tears of the oppressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Men groan from out of the city,</I> where the rich merchants and
 traders are as cruel with their poor debtors as the landlords in the 
 country are with their poor tenants. In cities such cruel actions as 
 these are more observed than in obscure corners of the country and the 
 wronged have easier access to justice to right themselves; and yet the 
 oppressors there fear neither the restraints of the law nor the just 
 censures of their neighbours, but the oppressed groan and cry out like 
 wounded men, and can no more ease and help themselves, for the 
 oppressors are inexorable and deaf to their groans.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He speaks of robbers, and those that do wrong by downright force, 
 as the bands of the Sabeans and Chaldeans, which had lately plundered 
 him. He does not mention them particularly, lest he should seem partial 
 to his own cause, and to judge of men (as we are apt to do) by what 
 they are to us; but among the Arabians, the children of the east (Job's 
 country), there were those that lived by spoil and rapine, making 
 incursions upon their neighbours, and robbing travellers. See how they 
 are described here, and what mischief they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.

 1. Their character is that they are <I>as wild asses in the desert,</I>
 untamed, untractable, unreasonable, Ishmael's character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12">Gen. xvi. 12</A>),

 fierce and furious, and under no restraint of law or government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23,24">Jer. ii. 23, 24</A>.

 They choose the deserts for their dwelling, that they may be lawless
 and unsociable, and that they may have opportunity of doing the more 
 mischief. The desert is indeed the fittest place for such wild people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:6"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 6</A>.

 But no desert can set men out of the reach of God's eye and hand. 

 2.  Their trade is to steal, and to make a prey of all about them.
 They have chosen it as their trade; it is their work, because there is 
 more to be got by it, and it is got more easily, than by an honest 
 calling.  They follow it as their trade; they follow it closely; 
 <I>they go forth to</I> it as <I>their work,</I> as man goes forth to 
 his labour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:23">Ps. civ. 23</A>.

 They are diligent and take pains at it: They <I>rise betimes for a
 prey.</I> If a traveller be out early, they will be out as soon to rob 
 him. They live by it as a man lives by his trade: <I>The wilderness</I> 
 (not the grounds there but the roads there) <I>yieldeth food for them 
 and for their children;</I> they maintain themselves and their families 
 by robbing on the high-way, and bless themselves in it without any 
 remorse of compassion or conscience, and with as much security as if it 
 were honestly got; as Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:7,8">Hos. xii. 7, 8</A>.

 3. See the mischief they do to the country. They not only rob
 travellers, but they make incursions upon their neighbours, and <I>reap 
 every one his corn in the field</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that is, they enter upon other people's ground, cut their corn, and
 carry it away as freely as if it were their own. Even <I>the wicked 
 gather the vintage,</I> and it is their wickedness; or, as we read it, 
 They gather the vintage of the wicked, and so one wicked man is made a 
 scourge to another. What the wicked got by extortion (which is their 
 way of stealing) these robbers get from them in their way of stealing; 
 thus oftentimes are the spoilers spoiled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>.

 4. The misery of those that fall into their hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>They cause the naked,</I> whom they have stripped, not leaving them
 the clothes to their backs, <I>to lodge,</I> in the cold nights, 
 <I>without clothing,</I> so that <I>they are wet with the showers of 
 the mountains, and, for want of a</I> better <I>shelter, embrace the 
 rock,</I> and are glad of a cave or den in it to preserve them from the 
 injuries of the weather. Eliphaz had charged Job with such inhumanity 
 as this, concluding that Providence would not thus have stripped him if 
 he had not first <I>stripped the naked of their clothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 6</A>.

 Job here tells him there were those that were really guilty of those
 crimes with which he was unjustly charged and yet prospered and had 
 success in their villanies, the curse they laid themselves under 
 working invisibly; and Job thinks it more just to argue as he did, from 
 an open notorious course of wickedness inferring a secret and future 
 punishment, than to argue as Eliphaz did, who from nothing but present 
 trouble inferred a course of past secret iniquity.  The impunity of 
 these oppressors and spoilers is expressed in one word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Yet God layeth not folly to them,</I> that is, he does not
 immediately prosecute them with his judgments for these crimes, nor 
 make them examples, and so evince their folly to all the world. He that 
 <I>gets riches, and not by right, at his end shall be a fool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11">Jer. xvii. 11</A>.

 But while he prospers he passes for a wise man, and God lays not folly
 to him until he saith, <I>Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be 
 required of thee,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses describe another sort of sinners who <I>therefore</I> go 
 unpunished, because they go undiscovered. <I>They rebel against the 
 light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Some understand it figuratively: they sin against the light of nature,
 the light of God's law, and that of their own consciences; they profess 
 to know God, but they rebel against the knowledge they have of him, and 
 will not be guided and governed, commanded and controlled, by it. 
 Others understand it literally: they have the day-light and choose the 
 night as the most advantageous season for their wickedness. Sinful 
 works are <I>therefore</I> called <I>works of darkness,</I> because he 
 <I>that does evil hates the light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20">John iii. 20</A>),

 <I>knows not the ways thereof,</I> that is, keeps out of the way of it,
 or, if he happen to be seen, abides not where he thinks he is known. So 
 that he here describes the worst of sinners,--those that sin wilfully, 
 and against the convictions of their own consciences, whereby they add 
 rebellion to their sin,--those that sin deliberately, and with a great 
 deal of plot and contrivance, using a thousand arts to conceal their 
 villanies, fondly imagining that, if they can but hide them from the 
 eye of men, they are safe, but forgetting that <I>there is no darkness 
 or shadow of death</I> in which <I>the workers of iniquity can hide 
 themselves</I> from God's eye,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:22"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 22</A>.

 In this paragraph Job specifies three sorts of sinners that shun the
 light:--

 1. Murderers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>.

 They <I>rise with the light,</I> as soon as ever the day breaks, to
 kill the poor travellers that are up early and abroad about their 
 business, going to market with a little money or goods; and though it 
 is so little that they are really to be called poor and needy, who with 
 much ado get a sorry livelihood by their marketings, yet, to get it, 
 the murderer will both take his neighbour's life and venture his own, 
 will rather play at such small game than not play at all; nay, he kills 
 for killing sake, thirsting more for blood than for booty. See what 
 care and pains wicked men take to compass their wicked designs, and let 
 the sight shame us out of our negligence and slothfulness in doing 
 good.</P>

 2. Adulterers. <I>The eyes</I> that are <I>full of adultery</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>),

 the unclean and wanton eyes, <I>wait for the twilight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>.

 The eye of the adulteress did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:9">Prov. vii. 9</A>.

 Adultery hides its head for shame. The sinners themselves, even the
 most impudent, do what they can to hide their sin: <I>si non caste, 
 tamen caute--if not chastely, yet cautiously;</I> and after all the 
 wretched endeavours of the factors for hell to take away the reproach 
 of it, it is and ever will be a <I>shame even to speak of those things 
 which are done of them in secret,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:12">Eph. v. 12</A>.

 It hides its head also for fear, knowing that <I>jealousy is the rage
 of a husband,</I> who <I>will not spare in the day of vengeance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:24,25">Prov. vi. 24, 25</A>.

 See what pains those take that make provision for the flesh to fulfil
 the lusts of it, pains to compass, and then to conceal, that provision 
 which, after all, will be death and hell at last. Less pains would 
 serve to mortify and crucify the flesh, which would be life and heaven 
 at last. Let the sinner change his heart, and then he needs not 
 disguise his face, but may lift it up without spot.

 3.  House-breakers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These <I>mark houses in the day-time,</I> mark the avenues of a house,
 and on which side they can most easily force their entrance, and then, 
 in the night, dig through them, either to kill, or steal, or commit 
 adultery. The night favours the assault, and makes the defence the more 
 difficult; for the <I>good man of the house knows not what hour the 
 thief will come</I> and therefore is asleep

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:39">Luke xii. 39</A>)

 and he and his lie exposed. For this reason our law makes burglary,
 which is the breaking and entering of a dwelling-house in the night 
 time with a felonious intent, to be felony without benefit of 
 clergy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And, <I>lastly,</I> Job observes (and perhaps observes it as part of 
 the present, though secret, punishment of such sinners as these) that 
 they are in a continual terror for fear of being discovered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>The morning is to them even as the shadow of death.</I> The light of
 the day, which is welcome to honest people, is a terror to bad people. 
 They curse the sun, not as the Moors, because it scorches them, but 
 because it discovers them. <I>If one know them,</I> their consciences 
 fly in their faces, and they are ready to become their own accusers; 
 for <I>they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</I> Shame came 
 in with sin, and everlasting shame is at the end of it. See the misery 
 of sinners--they are exposed to continual frights; and yet see their
 folly--they are afraid of coming under the eye of men, but have no dread
 of God's eye, which is always upon them: they are not afraid of doing 
 that which yet they are so terribly afraid of being known to do.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  He <I>is</I> swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
 earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
 &nbsp; 19  Drought and heat consume the snow waters: <I>so doth</I> the

 &nbsp; 20  The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on

 broken as a tree.
 &nbsp; 21  He evil entreateth the barren <I>that</I> beareth not: and doeth
 not good to the widow.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job here, in the conclusion of his discourse,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Gives some further instances of the wickedness of these cruel bloody 
 men. 

 1. Some are pirates and robbers at sea. To this many learned 
 interpreters apply those difficult expressions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>He is swift upon the waters.</I> Privateers choose those ships that
 are the best sailors. In these swift ships they cruise from one channel 
 to another, to pick up prizes; and this brings them in so much wealth 
 that their <I>portion is cursed in the earth,</I> and they <I>behold 
 not the way of the vineyards,</I> that is (as bishop Patrick explains 
 it), they despise the employment of those who till the ground and plant 
 vineyards as poor and unprofitable. But others make this a further 
 description of the conduct of those sinners that are afraid of the 
 light: if they be discovered, they get away as fast as they can, and 
 choose to lurk, not in the vineyards, for fear of being discovered, but 
 in some cursed portion, a lonely and desolate place, which nobody looks 
 after. 

 2. Some are abusive to those that are in trouble, and add affliction to
 the afflicted. Barrenness was looked upon as a great reproach, and 
 those that fall under that affliction they upbraid with it, as Peninnah 
 did Hannah, on purpose to vex them and make them to fret, which is a 
 barbarous thing.  This is <I>evil entreating the barren that beareth 
 not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 or those that are childless, and so want the arrows others have in
 their quiver, which enable them to deal with their enemy in the gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>.

 They take that advantage against and are oppressive to them.  As the
 fatherless, so the childless, are in some degree helpless. For the same 
 reason it is a cruel thing to hurt the widow, to whom we ought to do 
 good; and not doing good, when it is in our power, is doing hurt.

 3. There are those who, by inuring themselves to cruelty, come at last
 to be so exceedingly boisterous that they are <I>the terror of the 
 mighty in the land of the living</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 "<I>He draws the mighty</I> into a snare with his power; even the
 greatest are not able to stand before him when he is in his mad fits: 
 <I>he rises up</I> in his passion, and lays about him with so much fury 
 that <I>no man is sure of his life;</I> nor can he at the same time be 
 sure of his own, for <I>his hand is against every man</I> and <I>every 
 man's hand against him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12">Gen. xvi. 12</A>.

 One would wonder how any man can take pleasure in making all about him
 afraid of him, yet there are those that do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows that these daring sinners prosper, and are at ease for a 
 while, nay, and often end their days in peace, as Ishmael, who, though 
 he was a man of such a character as is here given, yet both <I>lived 
 and died in the presence of all his brethren,</I> as we are told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12,25:18">Gen. xvi. 12; xxv. 18</A>:

 Of these sinners here it is said,

 1. That it is <I>given them to be in safety,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They seem to be under the special protection of the divine Providence;
 and one would wonder how they escape with life through so many dangers 
 as they run themselves into.

 2. That they rest upon this, that is, they rely upon this as sufficient
 to warrant all their violences. <I>Because sentence against their evil 
 works is not executed speedily</I> they think that there is no great 
 evil in them, and that God is not displeased with them, nor will ever 
 call them to an account. Their prosperity is their security. 

 3. That <I>they are exalted for a while.</I> They seem to be the
 favourites of heaven, and value themselves as making the best figure on 
 earth. They are set up in honour, set up (as they think) out of the 
 reach of danger, and lifted up in the pride of their own spirits. 

 4.  That, at length, they are carried out of the world very silently
 and gently, and without any remarkable disgrace or terror.  "They go 
 down to the grave as easily as snow-water sinks into the dry ground 
 when it is melted by the sun;" so bishop Patrick explains 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 To the same purport he paraphrases 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 <I>The womb shall forget him,</I> &c.  "God sets no such mark of his
 displeasure upon him but that his mother may soon forget him. The hand 
 of justice does not hang him on a gibbet for the birds to feed on; but 
 he is carried to his grave like other men, to be the sweet food of 
 worms. There he lies quietly, and neither he nor his wickedness is any 
 more remembered than a tree which is broken to shivers." And

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 <I>They are taken out of the way as all others,</I> that is, "they are
 shut up in their graves like all other men; nay, they die as easily 
 (without those tedious pains which some endure) as an ear of corn is 
 cropped with your hand." Compare this with Solomon's observation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:10">Eccl. viii. 10</A>),

 <I>I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the
 holy, and they were forgotten.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foresees their fall however, and that their death, though they 
 die in ease and honour, will be their ruin. God's <I>eyes are upon 
 their ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Though he keep silence, and seem to connive at them, yet he takes
 notice, and keeps account of all their wickedness, and will make it to 
 appear shortly that their most secret sins, which they thought <I>no 
 eye should see</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 were under his eye and will be called over again. Here is no mention of
 the punishment of these sinners in the other world, but it is intimated 
 in the particular notice taken of the consequences of their death. 

 1.  The consumption of the body in the grave, though common to all, yet 
 to them is in the nature of a punishment for their sin. The <I>grave 
 shall consume those that have sinned;</I> that land of darkness will be 
 the lot of those that <I>love darkness rather than light.</I> The 
 bodies they pampered shall be a feast for worms, which shall feed as 
 sweetly on them as ever they fed on the pleasures and gains of their 
 sins. 

 2.  Though they thought to make themselves a great name by their
 wealth, and power, and mighty achievements, yet <I>their memorial 
 perished with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:6">Ps. ix. 6</A>.

 He that made himself so much talked of <I>shall,</I> when he is dead,
 <I>be no more remembered</I> with honour; his <I>name shall rot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:7">Prov. x. 7</A>.

 Those that durst not give him his due character while he lived shall
 not spare him when he is dead; so that the womb that bore him, his own 
 mother, shall forget him, that is, shall avoid making mention of him, 
 and shall think <I>that</I> the greatest kindness she can do him, since 
 no good can be said of him. That honour which is got by sin will soon 
 turn into shame.

 3. The wickedness they thought to establish in their families shall be
 broken as a tree; all their wicked projects shall be blasted, and all 
 their wicked hopes dashed and buried with them. 

 4. Their pride shall be brought down and laid in the dust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 and, in mercy to the world, they shall be taken out of the way, and all
 their power and prosperity shall be cut off. You may seek them, and 
 they shall not be found. Job owns that wicked people will be miserable 
 at last, miserable on the other side death, but utterly denies what his 
 friends asserted, that ordinarily they are miserable in this life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He concludes with a bold challenge to all that were present to
 disprove what he had said if they could

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>If it be not so now,</I> as I have declared, and if it do not
 thence follow that I am unjustly condemned and censured, let those that 
 can undertake to prove that my discourse is either, 

 1. False in itself, and then they prove me a liar; or, 

 2. Foreign, and nothing to the purpose, and then they prove my speech
 frivolous and nothing worth." That indeed which is false is nothing 
 worth; where there is not truth, how can there be goodness? But those 
 that speak the words of truth and soberness need not fear having what 
 they say brought to the test, but can cheerfully submit it to a fair 
 examination, as Job does here.</P>
