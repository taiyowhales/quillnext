 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is a most solemn and earnest call to all the creatures,
 according to their capacity, to praise their Creator, and to show forth
 his eternal power and Godhead, the invisible things of which are
 manifested in the things that are seen. Thereby the psalmist designs to
 express his great affection to the duty of praise; he is highly
 satisfied that God is praised, is very desirous that he may be more
 praised, and therefore does all he can to engage all about him in this
 pleasant work, yea, and all who shall come after him, whose hearts must
 be very dead and cold if they be not raised and enlarged, in praising
 God, by the lofty flights of divine poetry which we find in this psalm.

 I. He calls upon the higher house, the creatures that are placed in the
 upper world, to praise the Lord, both those that are intellectual
 beings, and are capable of doing it actively 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 and those that are not, and are therefore capable of doing it only
 objectively,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 II. He calls upon the lower house, the creatures of this lower world,
 both those that can only minister matter of praise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>)

 and those that, being endued with reason, are capable of offering up
 this sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>),

 especially his own people, who have more cause to do it, and are more
 concerned to do it, than any other,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> from the heavens:
 praise him in the heights.
 &nbsp; 2  Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
 &nbsp; 3  Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
 light.
 &nbsp; 4  Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that <I>be</I>
 above the heavens.
 &nbsp; 5  Let them praise the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for he commanded, and
 they were created.
 &nbsp; 6  He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made
 a decree which shall not pass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We, in this dark and depressed world, know but little of the world of 
 light and exaltation, and, conversing within narrow confines, can 
 scarcely admit any tolerable conceptions of the vast regions above. But 
 this we know,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That there is above us a world of blessed angels by whom God is 
 praised, an innumerable company of them. <I>Thousand thousands minister 
 unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before him;</I> and 
 it is his glory that he has such attendants, but much more his glory 
 that he neither needs them, nor is, nor can be, any way benefited by 
 them. To that bright and happy world the psalmist has an eye here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 In general, to <I>the heavens,</I> to <I>the heights.</I> The heavens 
 are the heights, and therefore we must lift up our souls above the 
 world unto God in <I>the heavens,</I> and <I>on things above</I> we 
 must <I>set our affections.</I> It is his desire that God may be 
 praised <I>from the heavens,</I> that thence a praising frame may be 
 transmitted to this world in which we live, that while we are so cold, 
 and low, and flat, in praising God, there are those above who are doing 
 it in a better manner, and that while we are so often interrupted in 
 this work they rest not day nor night from it. In particular, he had an 
 eye to God's <I>angels,</I> to <I>his hosts,</I> and calls upon them to 
 praise God. That God's angels are his hosts is plain enough; as soon as 
 they were made they were enlisted, armed, and disciplined; he employs 
 them in fighting his battles, and they keep ranks, and know their 
 place, and observe the word of command as his hosts. But what is meant 
 by the psalmist's calling upon them, and exciting them to praise God, 
 is not so easy to account for. I will not say, They do not heed it, 
 because we find that <I>to the principalities and powers is known by 
 the church the manifold wisdom of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph. iii. 10</A>);

 but I will say, They do not need it, for they are continually praising 
 God and there is no deficiency at all in their performances; and 
 therefore when, in singing this psalm, we call upon the angels to
 praise God (as we did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20">Ps. ciii. 20</A>),

 we mean that we desire God may be praised by the ablest hands and in 
 the best manner,--that we are pleased to think he is so,--that we have 
 a spiritual communion with those that dwell in his house above and are 
 still praising him,--and that we have come by faith, and hope, and holy 
 love, to the <I>innumerable company of angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That there is above us not only an assembly of blessed spirits, but 
 a system of vast bodies too, and those bright ones, in which God is 
 praised, that is, which may give us occasion (as far as we know any 
 thing of them) to give to God the glory not only of their being, but of 
 their beneficence to mankind. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What these creatures are that thus show us the way in praising God, 
 and, whenever we look up and consider the heavens, furnish us with 
 matter for his praises. 

 (1.) There are the <I>sun, moon,</I> and <I>stars,</I> which
 continually, either day or night, present themselves to our view, as 
 looking-glasses, in which we may see a faint shadow (for so I must call 
 it, not a resemblance) of the glory of him that is <I>the Father of 
 lights,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The greater lights, the sun and moon, are not too great, too bright, to 
 praise him; and the praises of the less lights, the stars, shall not be 
 slighted. Idolaters made the sun, moon, and stars, their gods, and 
 praised them, worshipping and serving the creature, because it is seen, 
 more than the Creator, because he is not seen; but we, who worship the 
 true God only, make them our fellow-worshippers, and call upon them to 
 praise him with us, nay, as Levites to attend us, who, as priests, 
 offer this spiritual sacrifice. 

 (2.) There are the <I>heavens of heavens</I> above the sun and stars,
 the seat of the blessed; from the vastness and brightness of these 
 unknown orbs abundance of glory redounds to God, for <I>the heavens of 
 heavens are the Lord's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>)

 and yet <I>they cannot contain him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:27">1 Kings viii. 27</A>.

 The learned Dr. Hammond understands her, by <I>the heavens of
 heavens,</I> the upper regions of the air, or all the regions of it, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:33">Ps. lxviii. 33</A>.

 We read of the heaven of heavens, whence <I>God sends forth his voice, 
 and that a mighty voice,</I> meaning the thunder. 

 (3.) There are <I>the waters that are above the heavens,</I> the clouds
 that hang above in the air, where they are reserved <I>against the day 
 of battle and war,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:23">Job xxxviii. 23</A>.

 We have reason to praise God, not only that these waters do not drown 
 the earth, but that they do water it and make it fruitful. The Chaldee 
 paraphrase reads it, <I>Praise him, you heavens of heavens, and you 
 waters that depend on the word of him who is above the heavens,</I> for 
 the key of the clouds is one of the keys which God has in his hand, 
 wherewith he opens and none can shut, he shuts and none can open.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Upon what account we are to give God the glory of them: <I>Let them 
 praise the name of the Lord,</I> that is, let us praise the name of the 
 Lord for them, and observe what constant and fresh matter for praise 
 may be fetched from them. 

 (1.) Because he made them, gave them their powers and assigned them
 their places: <I>He commanded</I> them (great as they are) out of 
 nothing, <I>and they were created</I> at a word's speaking. God 
 created, and therefore may command; for he commanded, and so created; 
 his authority must always be acknowledged and acquiesced in, because he 
 once spoke with such authority.

 (2.) Because he still upholds and preserves them in their beings and
 posts, their powers and motions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He hath established them for ever and ever,</I> that is, to the end 
 of time, a short ever, but it is their ever; they shall last as long as 
 there is occasion for them. <I>He hath made a decree,</I> the law of 
 creation, <I>which shall not pass;</I> it was enacted by the wisdom of 
 God, and therefore needs not be altered, by his sovereignty and 
 inviolable fidelity, and therefore cannot be altered. All the creatures 
 that praised God at first for their creation must praise him still for 
 their continuance. And we have reason to praise him that they are kept 
 within the bounds of a decree; for to that it is owing that the waters 
 above the heavens have not a second time drowned the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
 &nbsp; 8  Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his
 word:
 &nbsp; 9  Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
 &nbsp; 10  Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
 &nbsp; 11  Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges
 of the earth:
 &nbsp; 12  Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
 &nbsp; 13  Let them praise the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for his name alone is
 excellent; his glory <I>is</I> above the earth and heaven.
 &nbsp; 14  He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all
 his saints; <I>even</I> of the children of Israel, a people near unto
 him. Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Considering that this earth, and the atmosphere that surrounds it, are 
 the very sediment of the universe, it concerns us to enquire after 
 those considerations that may be of use to reconcile us to our place in 
 it; and I know none more likely than this (next to the visit which the 
 Son of God once made to it), that even in this world, dark and as bad 
 as it is, God is praised: <I>Praise you the Lord from the earth,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 As the rays of the sun, which are darted directly from heaven, reflect 
 back (though more weakly) from the earth, so should the praises of God, 
 with which this cold and infected world should be warmed and 
 perfumed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Even those creatures that are not dignified with the powers of 
 reason are summoned into this concert, because God may be glorified in 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.

 Let the <I>dragons</I> or <I>whales,</I> that sport themselves in the 
 mighty waters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:26">Ps. civ. 26</A>),

 dance before the Lord, to his glory, who largely proves his own 
 omnipotence by his dominion over the leviathan or whale,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1">Job xli. 1</A>,

 &c. <I>All deeps,</I> and their inhabitants, praise God--the sea, and 
 the animals there--the bowels of the earth, and the animals there. 
 <I>Out of the depths</I> God may be praised as well as prayed unto. If 
 we look up into the atmosphere we meet with a great variety of meteors, 
 which, being a king of new productions (and some of them 
 unaccountable), do in a special manner magnify the power of the great 
 Creator. There are fiery meteors; lightning is fire, and there are 
 other blazes sometimes kindled which may be so called. There are watery 
 meteors, <I>hail,</I> and <I>snow,</I> and the <I>vapours</I> of which 
 they are gendered. There are airy meteors, <I>stormy winds;</I> we
 know not whence they come nor whither they go, whence their mighty 
 force comes nor how it is spent; but this we know, that, be they ever 
 so strong, so stormy, they <I>fulfil God's word,</I> and do that, and 
 no more than that, which he appoints them; and by <I>this</I> Christ 
 showed himself to have a divine power, that he <I>commanded even the 
 winds and the seas,</I> and <I>they obeyed him.</I> Those that will not 
 fulfil God's word, but rise up in rebellion against it, show themselves 
 to be more violent and headstrong than even the stormy winds, for they 
 fulfil it. Take a view of the surface of the earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and there are presented to our view the exalted grounds, <I>mountains 
 and all hills,</I> from the barren tops of some of which, and the 
 fruitful tops of others, we may fetch matter for praise; there are the 
 exalted plants, some that are exalted by their usefulness, as the 
 <I>fruitful trees</I> of various kinds, for the fruits of which God is 
 to be praised, others by their stateliness, as <I>all cedars,</I> those 
 <I>trees of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:16">Ps. civ. 16</A>.

 Cedars, the high trees, are not the fruitful trees, yet they had their
 use even in God's temple. Pass we next to the animal kingdom, and there 
 we find God glorified, even by the <I>beasts</I> that run wild, <I>and 
 all cattle</I> that are tame and in the service of man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Nay, even the <I>creeping things</I> have not sunk so low, nor do the 
 <I>flying fowl</I> soar so high, as not to be called upon to <I>praise 
 the Lord.</I> Much of the wisdom, power, and goodness of the Creator 
 appears in the several capacities and instincts of the creatures, in 
 the provision made for them and the use made of them. When we see all 
 so very strange, and all so very good, surely we cannot but acknowledge 
 God with wonder and thankfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Much more those creatures that are dignified with the powers of 
 reason ought to employ them in praising God: <I>Kings of the earth and 
 all people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 1. God is to be glorified in and for these, as in and for the inferior 
 creatures, for their hearts are in the hand of the Lord and he makes 
 what use he pleases of them. God is to be praised in the order and 
 constitution of kingdoms, the <I>pars imperans--the part that 
 commands,</I> and the <I>pars subdita--the part that is subject: Kings 
 of the earth and all people.</I> It is by him that kings reign, and 
 people are subject to them; the <I>princes and judges of the earth</I> 
 have their wisdom and their commission from him, and we, to whom they 
 are blessings, ought to bless God for them. God is to be praised also
 in the constitution of families, for he is the founder of them; and for 
 all the comfort of relations, the comfort that parents and children, 
 brothers and sisters, have in each other, God is to be praised. 

 2. God is to be glorified by these. Let all manner of persons praise
 God.

 (1.) Those of each rank, high and low. The praises of kings, and
 princes, and judges, are demanded; those on whom God has put honour 
 must honour him with it, and the power they are entrusted with, and the 
 figure they make in the world, put them in a capacity of bringing more 
 glory to God and doing him more service than others. Yet the praises of 
 the people are expected also, and God will graciously accept of them; 
 Christ despised not the hosannas of the multitude.

 (2.) Those of each sex, <I>young men and maidens,</I> who are
 accustomed to make merry together; let them turn their mirth into this 
 channel; let it be sacred, that it may be pure.

 (3.) Those of each age. <I>Old men</I> must still bring forth this
 fruit in old age, and not think that either the gravity or the 
 infirmity of their age will excuse them from it; <I>and children</I> 
 too must begin betimes to praise God; even <I>out of the mouth of babes 
 and sucklings</I> this good work is perfected. A good reason is given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 why all these should <I>praise the name of the Lord,</I> because <I>his 
 name alone is excellent</I> and worthy to be praised; it is a name 
 above every name, no name, no nature, but his, has in it all 
 excellency. <I>His glory is above</I> both <I>the earth and the 
 heaven,</I> and let all inhabitants both of earth and heaven praise him 
 and yet acknowledge his name to be exalted <I>far above all blessing 
 and praise.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Most of all his own people, who are dignified with peculiar 
 privileges, must in a peculiar manner give glory to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The dignity God has put upon <I>his people, even the children of 
 Israel,</I> typical of the honour reserved for all true believers, who 
 are God's spiritual Israel. <I>He exalts</I> their <I>horn,</I> their 
 brightness, their plenty, their power. The people of Israel were, in 
 many respects, honoured above any other nation, for <I>to them 
 pertained the adoption, the glory, and the covenants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.

 It was their own honour that they were <I>a people near unto God,</I> 
 his <I>Segulla, his peculiar treasure;</I> they were admitted into his 
 courts, when a stranger that came nigh must be put to death. They had
 him <I>nigh to them in all that which they called upon him for.</I> 
 This blessing has not come upon the Gentiles, through Christ, for those 
 that <I>were afar off are</I> by <I>his blood made nigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:13">Eph. ii. 13</A>.
 
 It is the greatest honour that can be put upon a man to be brought near 
 to god, the nearer the better; and it will be best of all when nearest 
 of all in the kingdom of glory. 

 2. The duty God expects from them in consideration of this. Let those
 whom God honours honour him: <I>Praise you the Lord.</I> Let him be 
 <I>the praise of all his saints,</I> the object of their praise; for he 
 is a praise to them. <I>He is thy praise, and he is thy God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:21">Deut. x. 21</A>.

 Some by <I>the horn of his people</I> understand David, as a type of
 Christ, whom God has exalted to be <I>a prince and a Saviour,</I> who 
 is indeed the praise of all his saints and will be so for ever; for it 
 is through him that they are <I>a people near to God.</I></P>
