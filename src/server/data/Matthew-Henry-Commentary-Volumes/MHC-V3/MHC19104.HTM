 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is very probable that this psalm was penned by the same hand, and at 
 the same time, as the former; for as that ended this begins, with 
 "Bless the Lord, O my soul!" and concludes with it too. The style 
 indeed is somewhat different, because the matter is so: the scope of 
 the foregoing psalm was to celebrate the goodness of God and his tender 
 mercy and compassion, to which a soft and sweet style was most 
 agreeable; the scope of this is to celebrate his greatness, and 
 majesty, and sovereign dominion, which ought to be done in the most 
 stately lofty strains of poetry. David, in the former psalm, gave God 
 the glory of his covenant-mercy and love to his own people; in this he 
 gives him the glory of his works of creation and providence, his 
 dominion over, and his bounty to, all the creatures. God is there 
 praised as the God of grace, here as the God of nature. And this psalm 
 is wholly bestowed on that subject; not as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-14">Ps. xix.</A>,

 which begins with it, but passes from it to the consideration of the
 divine law; nor as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:1-9">Ps. viii.</A>,

 which speaks of this but prophetically, and with an eye to Christ. This
 noble poem is thought by very competent judges greatly to excel, not 
 only for piety and devotion (that is past dispute), but for flight of 
 fancy, brightness of ideas, surprising turns, and all the beauties and 
 ornaments of expression, the Greek and Latin poets upon any subject of 
 this nature. Many great things the psalmist here gives God the glory of 
 
 I. The splendour of his majesty in the upper world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The creation of the sea and the dry land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. The provision he makes for the maintenance of all the creatures
 according to their nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:10-18,27,28">ver. 10-18, 27, 28</A>.

 IV. The regular course of the sun and moon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 V. The furniture of the sea,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>.

 IV. God's sovereign power over all the creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:29-32">ver. 29-32</A>.

 And, lastly, he concludes with a pleasant and firm resolution to 
 continue praising God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:33-35">ver. 33-35</A>),

 with which we should heartily join in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O my soul. O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, thou art very
 great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
 &nbsp; 2  Who coverest <I>thyself</I> with light as <I>with</I> a garment: who
 stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
 &nbsp; 3  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who
 maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
 wind:
 &nbsp; 4  Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
 &nbsp; 5  <I>Who</I> laid the foundations of the earth, <I>that</I> it should not
 be removed for ever.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou coveredst it with the deep as <I>with</I> a garment: the
 waters stood above the mountains.
 &nbsp; 7  At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
 hasted away.
 &nbsp; 8  They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
 the place which thou hast founded for them.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
 turn not again to cover the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When we are addressing ourselves to any religious service we must 
 <I>stir up ourselves to take hold on God</I> in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:7">Isa. lxiv. 7</A>);

 so David does here. "Come, my soul, where art thou? What art thou
 thinking of? Here is work to be done, good work, angels' work; set 
 about it in good earnest; let all the powers and faculties be engaged 
 and employed in it: <I>Bless the Lord, O my soul!</I>" In these 
 verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist looks up to the divine glory shining in the upper 
 world, of which, though it is one of the things not seen, faith is the 
 evidence. With what reverence and holy awe does he begin his meditation 
 with that acknowledgment: <I>O Lord my God! thou art very great!</I>
 It is the joy of the saints that he who is their God is a great God. 
 The grandeur of the prince is the pride and pleasure of all his good 
 subjects. The majesty of God is here set forth by various instances, 
 alluding to the figure which great princes in their public appearances 
 covet to make. Their equipage, compared with his (even of the eastern 
 kings, who most affected pomp), is but as the light of a glow-worm 
 compared with that of the sun, when he goes forth in his strength.
 Princes appear great, 

 1. In their robes; and what are God's robes? <I>Thou art clothed with
 honour and majesty,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 God is seen in his works, and these proclaim him infinitely wise and 
 good, and all that is great. Thou <I>coverest thyself with light as 
 with a garment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 God <I>is light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1 John i. 5</A>),

 the <I>Father of lights</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">Jam. i. 17</A>);

 he <I>dwells in light</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>);

 he clothes himself with it. The residence of his glory is in the
 highest heaven, that light which was created the first day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:3">Gen. i. 3</A>.

 Of all visible beings light comes nearest to the nature of a spirit, 
 and therefore with that God is pleased to cover himself, that is, to 
 reveal himself under that similitude, as men are seen in the clothes 
 with which they cover themselves; and so only, for his face cannot be 
 seen.

 2. In their palaces or pavilions, when they take the field; and what is 
 God's palace and his pavilion? He <I>stretches out the heavens like a 
 curtain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 So he did at first, when he made the firmament, which in the Hebrew has 
 its name from its being expanded, or <I>stretched out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:7">Gen. i. 7</A>.

 He made it to divide the waters as a curtain divides between two 
 apartments. So he does still: he now <I>stretches out the heavens like 
 a curtain,</I> keeps them upon the stretch, and they <I>continue to 
 this day according to his ordinance.</I> The regions of the air are 
 stretched out about the earth, like a curtain about a bed, to keep it 
 warm, and drawn between us and the upper world, to break its dazzling 
 light; for, though God <I>covers himself with light,</I> yet, in 
 compassion to us, <I>he makes darkness his pavilion. Thick clouds are a 
 covering to him.</I> The vastness of this pavilion may lead us to 
 consider how great, how very great, he is that <I>fills heaven and 
 earth.</I> He has his <I>chambers,</I> his <I>upper rooms</I> (so the 
 word signifies), <I>the beams</I> whereof <I>he lays in the waters,</I> 
 the waters that are above the firmament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as he has <I>founded the earth upon the seas and floods,</I> the waters 
 beneath the firmament. Though air and water are fluid bodies, yet, by 
 the divine power, they are kept as tight and as firm in the place 
 assigned them as a chamber is with beams and rafters. How great a God 
 is he whose presence-chamber is thus reared, thus fixed! 

 3. In their coaches of state, with their stately horses, which add much
 to the magnificence of their entries; but God <I>makes the clouds his 
 chariots,</I> in which he rides strongly, swiftly, and far above out of 
 the reach of opposition, when at any time he will act by uncommon 
 providences in the government of this world. He descended in a cloud, 
 as in a chariot, to Mount Sinai, to give the law, and to Mount Tabor, 
 to proclaim the gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>),

 and he <I>walks</I> (a gentle pace indeed, yet stately) <I>upon the
 wings of the wind.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10,11">Ps. xviii. 10, 11</A>.

 He commands the winds, directs them as he pleases, and serves his own
 purposes by them. 

 4. In their retinue or train of attendants; and here also God is very 
 great, for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 he <I>makes his angels spirits.</I> This is quoted by the apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:7">Heb. i. 7</A>)

 to prove the pre-eminence of Christ above the angels. The angels are
 here said to be <I>his angels</I> and <I>his ministers,</I> for they 
 are under his dominion and at his disposal; they are <I>winds,</I> and 
 <I>a flame of fire,</I> that is, they appeared in wind and fire (so 
 some), or they are as swift as winds, and pure as flames; or he 
 <I>makes them spirits,</I> so the apostle quotes it. They are spiritual 
 beings; and, whatever vehicles they may have proper to their nature, it 
 is certain they have not bodies as we have. Being spirits, they are so
 much the further removed from the encumbrances of the human nature and 
 so much the nearer allied to the glories of the divine nature. And they 
 are bright, and quick, and ascending, as fire, as <I>a flame of 
 fire.</I> In Ezekiel's vision they ran and returned <I>like a flash of 
 lightning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:14">Ezek. i. 14</A>.

 Thence they are called <I>seraphim--burners.</I> Whatever they are,
 they are what God made them, what he still makes them; they derive 
 their being from him, having the being he gave them, are held in being 
 by him, and he makes what use he pleases of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He looks down, and looks about, to the power of God shining in this 
 lower world. He is not so taken up with the glories of his court as to 
 neglect even the remotest of his territories; no, not the sea and dry 
 land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He has founded the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though he has <I>hung it upon nothing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>),

 <I>ponderibus librata suis--balanced by its own weight,</I> yet it is
 as immovable as if it had been laid upon the surest foundations. He has 
 built the earth upon her basis, so that though it has received a 
 dangerous shock by the sin of man, and the malice of hell strikes at 
 it, yet <I>it shall not be removed for ever,</I> that is, not till the 
 end of time, when it must give way to the new earth. Dr. Hammond's 
 paraphrase of this is worth noting: "God has fixed so strange a place 
 for the earth, that, being a heavy body, one would think it should fall 
 every minute; and yet, which way soever we would imagine it to stir, it 
 must, contrary to the nature of such a body, fall upwards, and so can 
 have no possible ruin but by tumbling into heaven."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He has set bounds to the sea; for that also is his. 

 (1.) He brought it within bounds in the creation. At first the earth, 
 which, being the more ponderous body, would subside of course, was 
 <I>covered with the deep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The waters were above the mountains;</I> and so it was unfit to be, 
 as it was designed, a habitation for man; and therefore, on the third 
 day, God said, <I>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered to one 
 place, and let the dry land appear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9">Gen. i. 9</A>.

 This command of God is here called his <I>rebuke,</I> as if he gave it 
 because he was displeased that the earth was thus covered with water 
 and not fit for man to dwell on. Power went along with this word, and 
 therefore it is also called here <I>the voice of</I> his 
 <I>thunder,</I> which is a mighty voice and produces strange effects, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>At thy rebuke,</I> as if they were made sensible that they were out 
 of their place, <I>they fled; they hasted away</I> (they called, and 
 not in vain, to the rocks and mountains to cover them), as it is said 
 on another occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:16">Ps. lxxii. 16</A>),

 <I>The waters saw thee, O God! the waters saw thee; they were
 afraid.</I> Even those fluid bodies received the impression of God's
 terror. But <I>was the Lord displeased against the rivers?</I> No; it
 was <I>for the salvation of his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:8,13">Hab. iii. 8, 13</A>.

 So here; God rebuked the waters for man's sake, to prepare room for
 him; for <I>men must not be made as the fishes of the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:14">Hab. i. 14</A>);

 they must have air to breathe in. Immediately therefore, with all
 speed, the waters retired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>They</I> go over hill and dale (as we say), <I>go up by the
 mountains</I> and <I>down by the valleys;</I> they will neither stop at 
 the former nor lodge in the latter, but make the best of their way 
 <I>to the place which thou hast founded for them,</I> and there they 
 make their bed. Let the obsequiousness even of the unstable waters 
 teach us obedience to the word and will of God; for shall man alone of 
 all the creatures be obstinate? Let their retiring to and resting in 
 the place assigned them teach us to acquiesce in the disposals of that 
 wise providence which appoints us the bounds of our habitation. 

 (2.) He keeps it within bounds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The waters are forbidden to pass over the limits set them; they may 
 not, and therefore they do not, <I>turn again to cover the earth.</I> 
 Once they did, in Noah's flood, because God bade them, but never since, 
 because he forbids them, having promised not to drown the world again. 
 God himself glorifies in this instance of his power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:8">Job xxxviii. 8</A>,

 &c.) and uses it as an argument with us to fear him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22">Jer. v. 22</A>.

 This, if duly considered, would keep the world in awe of the Lord and
 his goodness, That the waters of the sea would soon cover the earth if 
 God did not restrain them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <I>which</I> run among
 the hills.
 &nbsp; 11  They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
 quench their thirst.
 &nbsp; 12  By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
 <I>which</I> sing among the branches.
 &nbsp; 13  He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
 satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
 &nbsp; 14  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for
 the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the
 earth;
 &nbsp; 15  And wine <I>that</I> maketh glad the heart of man, <I>and</I> oil to
 make <I>his</I> face to shine, and bread <I>which</I> strengtheneth man's
 heart.
 &nbsp; 16  The trees of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> are full <I>of sap;</I> the cedars of
 Lebanon, which he hath planted;
 &nbsp; 17  Where the birds make their nests: <I>as for</I> the stork, the
 fir trees <I>are</I> her house.
 &nbsp; 18  The high hills <I>are</I> a refuge for the wild goats; <I>and</I> the
 rocks for the conies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having given glory to God as the powerful protector of this earth, in 
 saving it from being deluged, here he comes to acknowledge him as its 
 bountiful benefactor, who provides conveniences for all the 
 creatures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He provides fresh water for their drink: <I>He sends the springs 
 into the valleys,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 There is water enough indeed in the sea, that is, enough to drown us, 
 but not one drop to refresh us, be we ever so thirsty--it is all so 
 salt; and therefore God has graciously provided water fit to drink. 
 Naturalists dispute about the origin of fountains; but, whatever are 
 their second causes, here is their first cause; it is God that <I>sends 
 the springs into the</I> brooks, <I>which</I> walk by easy steps 
 between <I>the hills,</I> and receive increase from the rain-water that 
 descends from them. These <I>give drink,</I> not only to man, and those 
 creatures that are immediately useful to him, but <I>to every beast of 
 the field</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 for where God has given life he provides a livelihood and takes care of 
 all the creatures. Even <I>the wild asses,</I> though untameable and 
 therefore of no use to man, are welcome to <I>quench their thirst;</I> 
 and we have no reason to grudge it them, for we are better provided 
 for, though <I>born like the wild ass's colt.</I> We have reason to 
 thank God for the plenty of fair water with which he has provided the 
 habitable part of his earth, which otherwise would not be habitable. 
 That ought to be reckoned a great mercy the want of which would be a 
 great affliction; and the more common it is the greater mercy it is. 
 <I>Usus communis aquarum--water is common for all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He provides food convenient for them, both for man and beast: 
 <I>The heavens drop fatness;</I> they <I>hear the earth,</I> but God 
 <I>hears them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:21">Hos. ii. 21</A>.

 <I>He waters the hills from his chambers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 from those chambers spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>the beams of</I> which <I>he lays in the waters,</I> those 
 store-chambers, the clouds that distil fruitful showers. The hills that 
 are not watered by the rivers, as Egypt was by the Nile, are watered by 
 the rain from heaven, which is called <I>the river of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>),

 as Canaan was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:11,12">Deut. xi. 11, 12</A>.

 Thus <I>the earth is satisfied with the fruit of his works,</I> either
 with the rain it drinks in (the earth knows when it has enough; it is a 
 pity that any man should not) or with the products it brings forth. It 
 is a satisfaction to the earth to bear the fruit of God's works for the 
 benefit of man, for thus it answers the end of its creation. The 
 <I>food</I> which God <I>brings forth out of the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 is <I>the fruit of his works,</I> which <I>the earth is satisfied 
 with.</I> Observe how various and how valuable its products are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the cattle there is grass, and the beasts of prey, that live not 
 on grass, feed on those that do; for man there is herb, a better sort 
 of grass (and a dinner of herbs and roots is not to be despised); nay, 
 he is furnished with <I>wine, and oil, and bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 We may observe here, concerning our food, that which will help to make 
 us both humble and thankful. 

 (1.) To make us humble let us consider that we have a necessary 
 dependence upon God for all the supports of this life (we live upon 
 alms; we are at his finding, for our own hands are not sufficient for 
 us),--that our food comes all out of the earth, to remind us whence we 
 ourselves were taken and whither we must return,--and that therefore we 
 must not think to <I>live by bread alone,</I> for that will feed the 
 body only, but must look into the word of God for the meat that endures 
 to eternal life. Let us also consider that we are in this respect 
 fellow-commoners with the beasts; the same earth, the same spot of 
 ground, that brings grass for the cattle, brings corn for man.

 (2.) To make us thankful let us consider, 

 [1.] That God not only provides for us, but for our servants. The
 cattle that are of use to man are particularly taken care of; grass is 
 made to grow in great abundance for them, when <I>the young lions,</I> 
 that are not for the service of man, often <I>lack and suffer 
 hunger.</I> 

 [2.] That our food is nigh us, and ready to us. Having our habitation 
 on the earth, there we have our storehouse, and depend not on the 
 <I>merchant-ships that bring food from afar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:14">Prov. xxxi. 14</A>.

 [3.] That we have even from the products of the earth, not only for
 necessity, but for ornament and delight, so good a Master do we serve.
 <I>First,</I> Does nature call for something to support it, and repair 
 its daily decays? Here is <I>bread, which strengthens man's heart,</I> 
 and is therefore called <I>the staff of life;</I> let none who have 
 that complain of want. <I>Secondly,</I> Does nature go further, and
 covet something pleasant? Here is <I>wine, that makes glad the
 heart,</I> refreshes the spirits, and exhilarates them, when it is 
 soberly and moderately used, that we may not only go through our 
 business, but go through it cheerfully. It is a pity that that should 
 be abused to overcharge the heart, and unfit men for their duty, which 
 was given to revive their heart and quicken them in their duty.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Is nature yet more humoursome, and does it crave 
 something for ornament too? Here is that also out of the earth--<I>oil 
 to make the face to shine,</I> that the countenance may not only be 
 cheerful but beautiful, and we may be the more acceptable to one 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Nay, the divine providence not only furnishes animals with their 
 proper food, but vegetables also with theirs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The trees of the Lord are full of sap,</I> not only men's trees, 
 which they take care of and have an eye to, in their orchards, and 
 parks, and other enclosures, but God's trees, which grow in the 
 wildernesses, and are taken care of only by his providence; they <I>are 
 full of sap</I> and want no nourishment. Even <I>the cedars of 
 Lebanon,</I> an open forest, though they are high and bulky, and 
 require a great deal of sap to feed them, have enough from the earth; 
 they are trees <I>which he has planted,</I> and which therefore he will 
 protect and provide for. We may apply this to the trees of 
 righteousness, which are the planting of the Lord, planted in his 
 vineyard; these <I>are full of sap,</I> for what God plants he will 
 water, and those that <I>are planted in the house of the Lord shall 
 flourish in the courts of our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:13">Ps. xcii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He takes care that they shall have suitable habitations to dwell 
 in. To men God has given discretion to build for themselves and for the 
 cattle that are serviceable to them; but there are some creatures which 
 God more immediately provides a settlement for. 

 1. The birds. Some birds, by instinct, make their nests in the bushes
 near rivers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>By the springs</I> that <I>run among the hills</I> some of the 
 <I>fowls of heaven have their habitation, which sing among the 
 branches.</I> They sing, according to their capacity, to the honour of 
 their Creator and benefactor, and their singing may shame our silence. 
 Our <I>heavenly Father feeds them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26">Matt. vi. 26</A>),

 and therefore they are easy and cheerful, and take no thought for the
 morrow. The birds being made to <I>fly above the earth</I> (as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20">Gen. i. 20</A>),

 they <I>make their nests</I> on high, in the tops of trees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 it should seem as if nature had an eye to this in <I>planting the 
 cedars of Lebanon,</I> that they might be receptacles for the birds. 
 Those that fly heavenward shall not want resting-places. <I>The 
 stork</I> is particularly mentioned; <I>the fir-trees,</I> which are 
 very high, <I>are her house,</I> her castle. 

 2. The smaller sort of beasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The wild goats,</I> having neither strength nor swiftness to secure 
 themselves, are guided by instinct to <I>the high hills,</I> which are 
 a refuge to them; and <I>the rabbits,</I> which are also helpless 
 animals, find shelter in <I>the rocks,</I> where they can set the 
 beasts of prey at defiance. Does God provide thus for the inferior 
 creatures; and will he not himself be a refuge and dwelling-place to 
 his own people?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
 down.
 &nbsp; 20  Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the
 beasts of the forest do creep <I>forth.</I>

 their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
 &nbsp; 30  Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
 renewest the face of the earth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught to praise and magnify God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For the constant revolutions and succession of day and night, and 
 the dominion of sun and moon over them. The heathen were so affected 
 with the light and influence of the sun and moon, and their 
 serviceableness to the earth, that they worshipped them as deities; and 
 therefore the scripture takes all occasions to show that the gods they 
 worshipped are the creatures and servants of the true God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>He appointed the moon for seasons,</I> for the measuring of the 
 months, the directing of the seasons for the business of the 
 husbandman, and the governing of the tides. The full and change, the 
 increase and decrease, of the moon, exactly observe the appointment of 
 the Creator; so does the sun, for he keeps as punctually to the time 
 and place of his going down as if he were an intellectual being and 
 knew what he did. God herein consults the comfort of man. 

 1. The shadows of the evening befriend the repose of the night

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>Thou makes darkness and it is night,</I> which, though black, 
 contributes to the beauty of nature, and is as a foil to the light of 
 the day; and under the protection of the night <I>all the beasts of the 
 forest creep forth</I> to feed, which they are afraid to do in the day, 
 God having put the <I>fear</I> and <I>dread of man upon every beast of 
 the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:2">Gen. ix. 2</A>),

 which contributes as much to man's safety as to his honour. See how 
 nearly allied those are to the disposition of the wild beasts who 
 <I>wait for the twilight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15">Job xxiv. 15</A>)

 and have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; and compare
 to this the danger of ignorance and melancholy, which are both as 
 darkness to the soul; when, in either of those ways, <I>it is 
 night,</I> then <I>all the beasts of the forest creep forth.</I> 
 Satan's temptations then assault us and have advantage against us. Then 
 the <I>young lions roar after their prey;</I> and, as naturalists tell 
 us, their roaring terrifies the timorous beasts so that they have not 
 strength nor spirit to escape from them, which otherwise they might do, 
 and so they become an easy prey to them. They are said to <I>seek their 
 meat from God,</I> because it is not prepared for them by the care and 
 forecast of man, but more immediately by the providence of God. The 
 roaring of the young lions, like the crying of the young ravens, is 
 interpreted <I>asking their meat of God.</I> Does God put this 
 construction upon the language of mere nature, even in venomous 
 creatures? and shall he not much more interpret favourably the language 
 of grace in his own people, though it be weak and broken, <I>groanings 
 which cannot be uttered?</I>

 2. The light of the morning befriends the business of the day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):
 
 <I>The sun arises</I> (for, as he <I>knows his going down,</I> so, 
 thanks be to God, he knows his rising again), and then the wild beasts 
 betake themselves to their rest; even they have some society among 
 them, for they <I>gather themselves together</I> and <I>lay down in 
 their dens,</I> which is a great mercy to the children of men, that 
 while they are abroad, as becomes honest travellers, between sun and 
 sun, care is taken that they shall not be set upon by wild beasts, for 
 they are then drawn out of the field, and the sluggard shall have no 
 ground to excuse himself from the business of the day with this, That 
 there is <I>a lion in the way.</I> Therefore then <I>man goes forth to 
 his work and to his labour.</I> The beasts of prey creep forth with 
 fear; man goes forth with boldness, as one that has dominion. The 
 beasts creep forth to spoil and do mischief; man goes forth to work and 
 do good. There is the work of every day, which is to be done in its 
 day, which man must apply to every morning (for the lights are set up 
 for us to work by, not to play by) and which he must stick to till 
 evening; it will be time enough to rest when the night comes, in which 
 <I>no man can work.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the replenishing of the ocean 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>):

 As <I>the earth is full of God's riches,</I> well stocked with animals, 
 and those well provided for, so that it is seldom that any creature 
 dies merely for want of food, <I>so is this great and wide sea</I> 
 which seems a useless part of the globe, at least not to answer the 
 room it takes up; yet God has appointed it its place and made it 
 serviceable to man both for navigation (<I>there go the ships,</I> in 
 which goods are conveyed, to countries vastly distant, speedily and 
 much more cheaply than by land-carriage) and also to be his storehouse 
 for fish. God made not the sea in vain, any more than the earth; he 
 <I>made it to be inherited,</I> for <I>there are things swimming 
 innumerable, both small and great animals,</I> which serve for man's 
 dainty food. The whale is particularly mentioned in the history of the 
 creation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:21">Gen. i. 21</A>)

 and is here called the <I>leviathan,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1">Job xli. 1</A>.

 He is made to <I>play in the sea;</I> he has nothing to do, as man has, 
 who <I>goes forth to his work;</I> he has nothing to fear, as the 
 beasts have, that lie down in their dens; and therefore he plays with 
 the waters. It is a pity that any of the children of men, who have 
 nobler powers and were made for nobler purposes, should live as if they 
 were sent into the world, like leviathan into the waters, to play 
 therein, spending all their time in pastime. The leviathan is said to 
 <I>play in the waters,</I> because he is so well armed against all 
 assaults that he sets them at defiance and <I>laughs at the shaking of 
 a spear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:29">Job xli. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For the seasonable and plentiful provision which is made for all 
 the creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 1. God is a bountiful benefactor to them: He <I>gives them their 
 meat;</I> he <I>opens his hand and they are filled with good.</I> He 
 supports the armies both of heaven and earth. Even the meanest 
 creatures are not below his cognizance. He is open-handed in the gifts 
 of his bounty, and is a great and good housekeeper that provides for so 
 large a family. 

 2. They are patient expectants from him: They <I>all wait upon him.</I> 
 They seek their food, according to the natural instinct God has put 
 into them and in the proper season for it, and affect not any other 
 food, or at any other time, than nature has ordained. They do their 
 part for the obtaining of it: what God gives them <I>they gather,</I> 
 and expect not that Providence should put it into their mouths; and 
 what they gather they are satisfied with--<I>they are filled with 
 good.</I> They desire no more than what God sees fit for them, which 
 may shame our murmurings, and discontent, and dissatisfaction with our 
 lot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. For the absolute power and sovereign dominion which he has over all 
 the creatures, by which every species is still continued, though the 
 individuals of each are daily dying and dropping off. See here, 

 1. All the creatures perishing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Thou hidest thy face,</I> withdrawest thy supporting power, thy 
 supplying bounty, and <I>they are troubled</I> immediately. Every 
 creature has as necessary a dependence upon God's favours as every 
 saint is sensible he has and therefore says with David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:7">Ps. xxx. 7</A>),

 <I>Thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</I> God's displeasure
 against this lower world for the sin of man is the cause of all the 
 vanity and burden which the whole creation groans under. <I>Thou takest 
 away their breath,</I> which is in thy hand, and then, and not till 
 then, <I>they die and return to their dust,</I> to their first 
 principles. The <I>spirit of the beast, which goes downward,</I> is at 
 God's command, as well as <I>the spirit of a man, which goes 
 upward.</I> The death of cattle was one of the plagues of Egypt, and is 
 particularly taken notice of in the drowning of the world. 

 2. All preserved notwithstanding, in a succession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created.</I> The same spirit 
 (that is, the same divine will and power) by which they were all 
 created at first still preserves the several sorts of creatures in 
 their being, and place, and usefulness; so that, though one generation 
 of them passes away, another comes, and from time to time they are 
 created; new ones rise up instead of the old ones, and this is a 
 continual creation. Thus the <I>face of the earth is renewed</I> from 
 day to day by the light of the sun (which beautifies it anew every 
 morning), from year to year by the products of it, which enrich it anew 
 every spring and put quite another face upon it from what it had all 
 winter. The world is as full of creatures as if none died, for the 
 place of those that die is filled up. This (the Jews say) is to be 
 applied to the resurrection, which every spring is an emblem of, when a 
 new world rises out of the ashes of the old one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the midst of this discourse the psalmist breaks out into wonder at 
 the works of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>O Lord! how manifold are thy works!</I> They are numerous, they are 
 various, of many kinds, and many of every kind; and yet <I>in wisdom 
 hast thou made them all.</I> When men undertake many works, and of 
 different kinds, commonly some of them are neglected and not done with 
 due care; but God's works, though many and of very different kinds, are 
 all made in wisdom and with the greatest exactness; there is not the 
 least flaw nor defect in them. The works of art, the more closely they 
 are looked upon with the help of microscopes, the more rough they 
 appear; the works of nature through these glasses appear more fine and 
 exact. They are all made in wisdom, for they are all made to answer the 
 end they were designed to serve, the good of the universe, in order to 
 the glory of the universal Monarch.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  The glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall endure for ever: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 rejoice in his works.
 &nbsp; 32  He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
 hills, and they smoke.
 &nbsp; 33  I will sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> as long as I live: I will sing
 praise to my God while I have my being.
 &nbsp; 34  My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 35  Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
 wicked be no more. Bless thou the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O my soul. Praise ye the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist concludes this meditation with speaking,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Praise to God, which is chiefly intended in the psalm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is to be praised, 

 (1.) As a great God, and a God of matchless perfection: <I>The glory of 
 the Lord shall endure for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 It shall endure to the end of time in his works of creation and 
 providence; it shall endure to eternity in the felicity and adorations 
 of saints and angels. Man's glory is fading; God's glory is 
 everlasting. Creatures change, but with the Creator there is no 
 variableness. 

 (2.) As a gracious God: <I>The Lord shall rejoice in his works.</I> He 
 continues that complacency in the products of his own wisdom and 
 goodness which he had when he <I>saw every thing that he had made, and 
 behold it was very good,</I> and <I>rested the seventh day.</I> We 
 often do that which, upon the review, we cannot rejoice in, but are 
 displeased at, and wish undone again, blaming our own management. But 
 God always <I>rejoices in his works,</I> because they are all done in 
 wisdom. We regret our bounty and beneficence, but God never does; he 
 rejoices in the works of his grace: his <I>gifts and callings</I> are 
 <I>without repentance.</I> 
 
 (3.) As a God of almighty power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>He looks on the earth, and it trembles,</I> as unable to bear his 
 frowns--trembles, as Sinai did, <I>at the presence of the Lord. He 
 touches the hills, and they smoke.</I> The volcanoes, or burning 
 mountains, such as &AElig;tna, are emblems of the power of God's wrath 
 fastening upon proud unhumbled sinners. If an angry look and a touch 
 have such effects, what will the weight of his heavy hand do and the 
 operations of his outstretched arm? <I>Who knows the power of his 
 anger?</I> Who then dares set it at defiance? God rejoices in his works 
 because they are all so observant of him; and he will in like manner 
 <I>take pleasure in those that fear him and that tremble at his 
 word.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The psalmist will himself be much in praising him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>I will sing unto the Lord, unto my God,</I> will praise him as 
 Jehovah, the Creator, and as <I>my God,</I> a God in covenant with me, 
 and this not now only, but <I>as long as I live,</I> and <I>while I 
 have my being.</I>" Because we have our being from God, and depend upon 
 him for the support and continuance of it, as long as we live and have 
 our being we must continue to praise God; and when we have no life, no 
 being, on earth, we hope to have a better life and better being in a 
 better world and there to be doing this work in a better manner and in 
 better company.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joy to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>My meditation of him shall be sweet;</I> it shall be fixed and 
 close; it shall be affecting and influencing; and therefore it shall be 
 sweet. Thoughts of God will <I>then</I> be most pleasing, when they are 
 most powerful. Note, Divine meditation is a very sweet duty to all
 that are sanctified: "<I>I will be glad in the Lord;</I> it shall be a 
 pleasure to me to praise him; I will be glad of all opportunities to 
 set forth his glory; and I will <I>rejoice in the Lord always</I> and 
 in him only." All my joys shall centre in him, and in him they shall be 
 full.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Terror to the wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth; and let the wicked be 
 no more.</I> 

 1. Those that oppose the God of power, and fight against him, will
 certainly be consumed; none can prosper that harden themselves against 
 the Almighty. 

 2. Those that rebel against the light of such convincing evidence of 
 God's being, and refuse to serve him whom all the creatures serve, will 
 justly be consumed. Those that make that earth to groan under the 
 burden of their impieties which God thus fills with his riches deserve 
 to be consumed out of it, and that it should spue them out. 

 3. Those that heartily desire to praise God themselves cannot but have
 a holy indignation at those that blaspheme and dishonour him, and a 
 holy satisfaction in the prospect of their destruction and the honour 
 that God will get to himself upon them. Even this ought to be the 
 matter of their praise: "While <I>sinners</I> are <I>consumed out of 
 the earth,</I> let <I>my soul bless the Lord</I> that I am not cast 
 away with the workers of iniquity, but distinguished from them by the 
 special grace of God. When <I>the wicked</I> are <I>no more</I> I hope 
 to be praising God world without end; and therefore, <I>Praise you the 
 Lord;</I> let all about me join with me in praising God.
 <I>Hallelujah;</I> sing praise to Jehovah." This is the first time that 
 we meet with <I>Hallelujah;</I> and it comes in here upon occasion of 
 the destruction of the wicked; and the last time we meet with it is 
 upon a similar occasion. When the New-Testament Babylon is consumed,
 this is the burden of the song, <I>Hallelujah,</I>
