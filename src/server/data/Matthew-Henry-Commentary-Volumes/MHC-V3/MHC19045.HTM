 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is an illustrious prophecy of Messiah the Prince: it is all 
 over gospel, and points at him only, as a bridegroom espousing the 
 church to himself and as a king ruling in it and ruling for it. It is 
 probable that our Saviour has reference to this psalm when he compares 
 the kingdom of heaven, more than once, to a nuptial solemnity, the 
 solemnity of a royal nuptial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:2,25:1">Matt. xxii. 2; xxv. 1</A>.

 We have no reason to think it has any reference to Solomon's marriage
 with Pharaoh's daughter; if I thought that it had reference to any 
 other than the mystical marriage between Christ and his church, I would 
 rather apply it to some of David's marriages, because he was a man of 
 war, such a one as the bridegroom here is described to be, which 
 Solomon was not. But I take it to be purely and only meant of Jesus
 Christ; of him speaks the prophet this, of him and of no other man; and 
 to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:6,7">
 ver. 6, 7</A>)

 it is applied in the New Testament

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8">Heb. i. 8</A>),

 nor can it be understood of any other. The preface speaks the
 excellency of the song,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45: ">
 ver. 1</A>.

 The psalm speaks,

 I. Of the royal bridegroom, who is Christ.

 1. The transcendent excellency of his person,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. The glory of his victories, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 3. The righteousness of his government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 4. The splendour of his court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 II. Of the royal bride, which is the church.

 1. Her consent gained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 2. The nuptials solemnized, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.
 
 3. The issue of this marriage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 In singing this psalm our hearts must be filled with high thoughts of 
 Christ, with an entire submission to and satisfaction in his 
 government, and with an earnest desire of the enlarging and
 perpetuating of his church in the world.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil.
 A song of loves.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My heart is inditing a good
 matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the
 king: my tongue <I>is</I> the pen of a ready writer.
 &nbsp; 2  Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured
 into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
 &nbsp; 3  Gird thy sword upon <I>thy</I> thigh, O <I>most</I> mighty, with thy
 glory and thy majesty.
 &nbsp; 4  And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
 meekness <I>and</I> righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee
 terrible things.
 &nbsp; 5  Thine arrows <I>are</I> sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
 <I>whereby</I> the people fall under thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make <I>Shoshannim,</I> in the title, to signify an instrument of 
 six strings; others take it in its primitive signification for lilies 
 or roses, which probably were strewed, with other flowers, at nuptial 
 solemnities; and then it is easily applicable to Christ who calls 
 himself the <I>rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:1">Cant. ii. 1</A>.

 It is <I>a song of loves,</I> concerning the holy love that is between
 Christ and his church. It is a <I>song of the well-beloved,</I> the 
 virgins, the companions of the bride

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 prepared to be sung by them. The virgin-company that attend the Lamb on
 Mount Zion are said to <I>sing a new song,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3,4">Rev. xiv. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 speaks, 

 1. The dignity of the subject. It is <I>a good matter,</I> and it is a
 pity that such a moving art as poetry should ever be employed about a
 bad matter. It is <I>touching the King,</I> King Jesus, and his kingdom 
 and government. Note, Those that speak of Christ speak of a good 
 matter, no subject so noble, so copious, so fruitful, so profitable, 
 and so well-becoming us; it is a shame that this good matter is not 
 more the matter of our discourse. 

 2. The excellency of the management. This song was a confession with
 the mouth of faith in the heart concerning Christ and his church.

 (1.) The matter was well digested, as it well deserved: <I>My heart is
 inditing it,</I> which perhaps is meant of that Spirit of prophecy that 
 dictated the psalm to David, that Spirit of Christ which was in the 
 prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>.

 But it is applicable to his devout meditations and affections in his
 heart, out of the abundance of which his mouth spoke. Things concerning 
 Christ ought to be thought of by us with all possible seriousness, with 
 fixedness of thought and a fire of holy love, especially when we are to 
 speak of those things. We then speak best of Christ and divine things 
 when we speak from the heart that which has warmed and affected us; and 
 we should never be rash in speaking of the things of Christ, but weigh 
 well beforehand what we have to say, lest we speak amiss. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:2">Eccl. v. 2</A>.

 (2.) It was well expressed: <I>I will speak of the things which I have
 made.</I> He would express himself, 

 [1.] With all possible clearness, as one that did himself understand
 and was affected with the things he spoke of. Not, "I will speak the 
 things I have heard from others," that is speaking by rote; but, "the 
 things which I have myself studied." Note, What God has wrought in our 
 souls, as well as what he has wrought for them, we must declare to 
 others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.

 [2.] With all possible cheerfulness, freedom, and fluency: "<I>My
 tongue is</I> as <I>the pen of a ready writer,</I> guided by my heart 
 in every word as the pen is by the hand." We call the prophets the 
 <I>penmen</I> of scripture, whereas really they were but the pen. The 
 tongue of the most subtle disputant, and the most eloquent orator, is 
 but the pen with which God writes what he pleases. Why should we
 quarrel with the pen if bitter things be written against us, or idolize 
 the pen if it write in our favour? David not only spoke what he thought 
 of Christ, but wrote it, that it might spread the further and last the 
 longer. His tongue was as the pen of a ready writer, that lets nothing 
 slip. When the heart is inditing a good matter it is a pity but the 
 tongue should be as <I>the pen of a ready writer,</I> to leave it upon 
 record.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In these verses the Lord Jesus is represented,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As most beautiful and amiable in himself. It is a marriage-song; and 
 therefore the transcendent excellencies of Christ are represented by
 the beauty of the royal bridegroom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Thou art fairer than the children of men,</I> than any of them. He
 proposed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to speak of the King, but immediately directs his speech to him. Those
 that have an admiration and affection for Christ love to go to him and 
 tell him so. Thus we must profess our faith, that we see his beauty,
 and our love, that we are pleased with it: <I>Thou are fair,</I> thou 
 art <I>fairer than the children of men.</I> Note, Jesus Christ is in 
 himself, and in the eyes of all believers, more amiable and lovely than 
 the children of men. The beauties of the Lord Jesus, as God, as 
 Mediator, far surpass those of human nature in general and those which 
 the most amiable and excellent of the children of men are endowed with; 
 there is more in Christ to engage our love than there is or can be in 
 any creature. Our beloved is more than another beloved. The beauties of 
 this lower world, and its charms, are in danger of drawing away our 
 hearts from Christ, and therefore we are concerned to understand how 
 much he excels them all, and how much more worthy he is of our 
 love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As the great favourite of heaven. He is <I>fairer than the children 
 of men,</I> for God has done more for him than for any of the children 
 of men, and all his kindness to the children of men is for his sake, 
 and passes through his hands, through his mouth. 

 (1.) He has grace, and he has it for us; <I>Grace is poured into thy
 lips.</I> By his word, his promise, his gospel, the good-will of God is 
 made known to us and the good work of God is begun and carried on in 
 us. He received all grace from God, all the endowments that were 
 requisite to qualify him for his work and office as Mediator, that from 
 his fulness we might receive,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.

 It was not only poured into his heart, for his own strength and
 encouragement, but poured into his lips, that by the words of his mouth 
 in general, and the kisses of his mouth to particular believers, he 
 might communicate both holiness and comfort. From this grace poured 
 into his lips proceeded those gracious words which all admired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:22">Luke iv. 22</A>.

 The gospel of grace is poured into his lips; for it <I>began to be
 spoken by the Lord,</I> and from him we receive it. He has the words of 
 eternal life. <I>The spirit of prophecy is put into thy lips;</I> so 
 the Chaldee. 

 (2.) He has the blessing, and he has it for us. "Therefore, because
 thou art the great trustee of divine grace for the use and benefit of
 the children of men, <I>therefore God has blessed thee for ever,</I>
 has made thee an everlasting blessing, so as that in thee all the
 nations of the earth shall be blessed." Where God gives his grace he
 will give his blessing. We are blessed with spiritual blessings in
 Christ Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph. i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. As victorious over all his enemies. The royal bridegroom is a man of 
 war, and his nuptials do not excuse him from the field of battle (as 
 was allowed by the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:5">Deut. xxiv. 5</A>);

 nay, they bring him to the field of battle, for he is to rescue his
 spouse by dint of sword out of her captivity, to conquer her, and to 
 conquer for her, and then to marry her. Now we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His preparations for war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O Most Mighty!</I> The word of God is
 the sword of the Spirit. By the promises of that word, and the grace 
 contained in those promises, souls are made willing to submit to Jesus 
 Christ and become his loyal subjects; by the threatenings of that word, 
 and the judgments executed according to them, those that stand it out 
 against Christ will, in due time, be brought down and ruined. By the 
 gospel of Christ many Jews and Gentiles were converted, and, at length, 
 the Jewish nation was destroyed, according to the predictions of it, 
 for their implacable enmity to it; and paganism was quite abolished. 
 The sword here girt on Christ's thigh is the same which is said to 
 <I>proceed out of his mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15">Rev. xix. 15</A>.

 When the gospel was sent forth to be preached to all nations, then our
 Redeemer girded his sword upon his thigh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His expedition to this holy war: He goes forth <I>with his glory 
 and his majesty,</I> as a great king takes the field with abundance of 
 pomp and magnificence--his sword, his glory, and majesty. In his gospel
 he appears transcendently great and excellent, bright and blessed, in 
 the honour and majesty which the Father had laid upon him. Christ, both 
 in his person and in his gospel, had nothing of external glory or 
 majesty, nothing to charm men (for he had no form nor comeliness), 
 nothing to awe men, for he <I>took upon him the form of a servant;</I> 
 it was all spiritual glory, spiritual majesty. There is so much grace, 
 and therefore glory, in that word, <I>He that believes shall be 
 saved,</I> so much terror, and therefore majesty, in that word, <I>He 
 that believes shall not be damned,</I> that we may well say, in the 
 chariot of that gospel, which these words are the sum of, the Redeemer 
 rides forth in glory and majesty. <I>In thy majesty ride 
 prosperously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>Prosper thou; ride thou.</I> This speaks the promise of his Father,
 that he should prosper according to <I>the good pleasure of the 
 Lord,</I> that he should <I>divide the spoil with the strong,</I> in 
 recompence of his sufferings. Those cannot but prosper to whom God 
 says, Prosper,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:10-12">Isa. lii. 10-12</A>.

 And it denotes the good wishes of his friends, praying that he may
 prosper in the conversion of souls to him, and the destruction of all 
 the powers of darkness that rebel against him. "<I>Thy kingdom 
 come;</I> Go on and prosper."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The glorious cause in which he is engaged--<I>because of truth, and
 meekness, and righteousness,</I> which were, in a manner, sunk and lost 
 among men, and which Christ came to retrieve and rescue. 

 [1.] The gospel itself is <I>truth, meekness, and righteousness;</I> it
 commands by the power of truth and righteousness; for Christianity has 
 these, incontestably, on its side, and yet it is to be promoted by 
 meekness and gentleness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:12,13,2Ti+2:25">1 Cor. iv. 12, 13; 2 Tim. ii. 25</A>.

 [2.] Christ appears in it in his <I>truth, meekness,</I> and
 <I>righteousness,</I> and these are his glory and majesty, and because 
 of these he shall prosper. Men are brought to believe on him because he 
 is true, to learn of him because he is meek,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>

 (the gentleness of Christ is of mighty force, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:1">2 Cor. x. 1</A>),

 and to submit to him because he is righteous and rules with equity.
 
 [3.] The gospel, as far as it prevails with men, sets up in their
 hearts <I>truth, meekness, and righteousness,</I> rectifies their 
 mistakes by the light of truth, controls their passions by the power of 
 meekness, and governs their hearts and lives by the laws of 
 righteousness. Christ came, by setting up his kingdom among men, to 
 restore those glories to a degenerate world, and to maintain the cause 
 of those just and rightful rulers under him that by error, malice, and 
 iniquity, had been deposed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The success of his expedition: "<I>Thy right hand shall teach thee 
 terrible things;</I> thou shalt experience a wonderful divine power 
 going along with thy gospel, to make it victorious, and the effects of 
 it will be terrible things." 

 [1.] In order to the conversion and reduction of souls to him, there
 are terrible things to be done; the heart must be pricked, conscience 
 must be startled, and the terrors of the Lord must make way for his 
 consolations. This is done by the right hand of Christ. The Comforter
 shall continue,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:8">John xvi. 8</A>.

 [2.] In the conquest of the gates of hell and its supporters, in the
 destruction of Judaism and Paganism, terrible things will be done, 
 which will make <I>men's hearts fail them for fear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26">Luke xxi. 26</A>)

 and great men and chief captains call to the <I>rocks and mountains to
 fall on them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>.

 The next verse describes these terrible things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Thy arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies. First,</I>
 Those that were by nature enemies are thus wounded, in order to their 
 being subdued and reconciled. Convictions are like the arrows of the 
 bow, which are sharp in the heart on which they fasten, and bring 
 people to fall under Christ, in subjection to his laws and government.
 Those that thus fall on this stone shall be broken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:44">Matt. xxi. 44</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Those that persist in their enmity are thus wounded,
 in order to their being ruined. The arrows of God's terrors are sharp 
 in their hearts, whereby they shall fall under him, so as to be made 
 his footstool, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 Those that would not have him to reign over them shall be brought forth
 and slain before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke xix. 27</A>);

 those that would not submit to his golden sceptre shall be broken to
 pieces by his iron rod.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the royal bridegroom filling his throne with judgment and 
 keeping his court with splendour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He here fills his throne with judgment. It is God the Father that 
 says to the Son here, <I>Thy throne, O God! is forever and ever,</I> as 
 appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8,9">Heb. i. 8, 9</A>,

 where this is quoted to prove that he is God and has a <I>more
 excellent name than the angels.</I> The Mediator is God, else he 
 neither would have been able to do the Mediator's work nor fit to wear 
 the Mediator's crown. Concerning his government observe,

 1. The eternity of it; it is <I>for ever and ever.</I> It shall
 continue on earth throughout all the ages of time, in despite of all 
 the opposition of the gates of hell; and in the blessed fruits and 
 consequences of it it shall last as long as the days of heaven, and run 
 parallel with the line of eternity itself. Perhaps even then the glory 
 of the Redeemer, and the blessedness of the redeemed, shall be in a 
 continual infinite progression; for it is promised that not only of his 
 government, but of <I>the increase of his government and peace, there 
 shall be no end</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:7">Isa. ix. 7</A>);

 even when the kingdom shall be <I>delivered up to God even the 
 Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24">1 Cor. xv. 24</A>)
 
 the throne of the Redeemer will continue.

 2. The equity of it: <I>The sceptre of thy kingdom,</I> the
 administration of thy government, <I>is right,</I> exactly according to 
 the eternal counsel and will of God, which is the eternal rule and 
 reason of good and evil. Whatever Christ does he does none of his 
 subjects any wrong, but gives redress to those that do suffer wrong: 
 <I>He loves righteousness, and hates wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He himself loves to do righteousness, and hates to do wickedness; and
 he loves those that do righteousness, and hates those that do 
 wickedness. By the holiness of his life, the merit of his death, and 
 the great design of his gospel, he has made it to appear that he loves 
 righteousness (for by his example, his satisfaction, and his precepts, 
 he has brought in an everlasting righteousness), and that he hates 
 wickedness, for never did God's hatred of sin appear so conspicuously 
 as it did in the sufferings of Christ.

 3. The establishment and elevation of it: <I>Therefore God, even thy
 God</I> (Christ, as Mediator, called God <I>his God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>,

 as commissioned by him, and the head of those that are taken into
 covenant with him), <I>has anointed thee with the oil of gladness. 
 Therefore,</I> that is, 

 (1.) "In order to this righteous government of thine, God has given
 thee his Spirit, that divine unction, to qualify thee for thy 
 undertaking,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.

 1. <I>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because he has anointed
 me.</I> What God called him to he fitted him for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2">Isa. xi. 2</A>.

 The Spirit is called <I>the oil of gladness</I> because of the delight
 wherewith Christ was filled in carrying on his undertaking. He was
 anointed with the Spirit <I>above all his fellows,</I> above all those
 that were anointed, whether priests or kings. 

 (2.) "In recompence of what thou has done and suffered for the
 advancement of righteousness and the destruction of sin God has 
 anointed thee with the oil of gladness, has brought thee to all the 
 honours and all the joys of thy exalted state." <I>Because he humbled 
 himself, God has highly exalted him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:8,9">Phil. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 His anointing him denotes the power and glory to which he is exalted;
 he is invested in all the dignities and authorities of the Messiah. And 
 his anointing him with the oil of gladness denotes <I>the joy that was 
 set before him</I> (so his exaltation is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>)

 both in the light of his <I>Father's countenance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:28">Acts ii. 28</A>)

 and in the success of his undertaking, which he shall <I>see, and be 
 satisfied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.

 This he is anointed with <I>above all his fellows,</I> above all
 believers, who are his brethren, and who partake of the anointing--they
 by measure, he without measure. But the apostle brings it to prove his
 pre-eminence above the angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb:1:4,9">Heb. i. 4, 9</A>.

 The salvation of sinners is the joy of angels 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:10">Luke xv. 10</A>),

 but much more of the Son.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He keeps his court with splendour and magnificence. 

 1. His robes of state, wherein he appears, are taken notice of, not for
 their pomp, which might strike an awe upon the spectator, but their 
 pleasantness and the gratefulness of the odours with which they were 
 perfumed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia</I> (the <I>oil of
 gladness</I> with which he and his garments were anointed): these were 
 some of the ingredients of the holy anointing oil which God appointed, 
 the like to which was not to be made up for any common use

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:23,24">Exod. xxx. 23, 24</A>),

 which was typical of the unction of the Spirit which Christ, the great
 high priest of our profession, received, and to which therefore there 
 seems here to be a reference. It is the savour of these good ointments, 
 his graces and comforts, that draws souls to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:3,4">Cant. i. 3, 4</A>)

 and makes him <I>precious to believers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7">1 Pet. ii. 7</A>.

 2. His royal palaces are said to be <I>ivory</I> ones, such as were
 then reckoned most magnificent. We read of an ivory house that Ahab
 made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:39">1 Kings xxii. 39</A>.

 The mansions of light above are the <I>ivory palaces,</I> whence all
 the joys both of Christ and believers come, and where they will be for
 ever in perfection; for by them he is made glad, and all that are his
 with him; for they shall enter into the joy of their Lord. 

 3. The beauties of his court shine very brightly. In public appearances
 at court, when the pomp of it is shown, nothing is supposed to
 contribute so much to it as the splendour of the ladies, which is 
 alluded to here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (1.) Particular believers are here compared to the ladies at court,
 richly dressed in honour of the sovereign: <I>Kings' daughters are 
 among thy honourable women,</I> whose looks, and mien, and ornaments, 
 we may suppose, from the height of their extraction, to excel all 
 others. All true believers are born from above; they are the children 
 of the King of kings. These attend the throne of the Lord Jesus daily 
 with their prayers and praises, which is really their honour, and he is 
 pleased to reckon it his. The numbering of kings' daughters among his 
 honourable women, or maids of honour, intimates that the kings whose 
 daughters they were should be tributaries to him and dependents on him, 
 and would therefore think it a preferment to their daughters to attend 
 him. 

 (2.) The church in general, constituted of these particular believers,
 is here compared to the queen herself--the queen-consort, whom, by an 
 everlasting covenant, he hath betrothed to himself. She stands <I>at 
 his right hand,</I> near to him, and receives honour from him, in the 
 richest array, <I>in gold of Ophir,</I> in robes woven with golden 
 thread or with a gold chain and other ornaments of gold. This is <I>the 
 bride, the Lamb's wife,</I> whose graces, which are her ornaments, are 
 compared to <I>fine linen, clean and white</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>),

 for their purity, here to <I>gold of Ophir,</I> for their costliness;
 for, as we owe our redemption, so we owe our adorning, not to 
 corruptible things, but to <I>the precious blood of the Son of 
 God.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
 forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
 &nbsp; 11  So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he <I>is</I> thy
 Lord; and worship thou him.
 &nbsp; 12  And the daughter of Tyre <I>shall be there</I> with a gift;

 &nbsp; 13  The king's daughter <I>is</I> all glorious within: her clothing
 <I>is</I> of wrought gold.

 thee.

 therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This latter part of the psalm is addressed to the royal bride, standing 
 on the right hand of the royal bridegroom. God, who said to the Son, 
 <I>Thy throne is for ever and ever,</I> says this to the church, which, 
 upon the account of her espousals to the Son, he here calls his 
 <I>daughter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells her of the duties expected from her, which ought to be 
 considered by all those that come into relation to the Lord Jesus: 
 "<I>Hearken,</I> therefore, <I>and consider</I> this, <I>and incline 
 thy ear,</I> that is, submit to those conditions of thy espousals, and 
 bring thy will to comply with them." This is the method of profiting by 
 the word of God. <I>He that has ears, let him hear,</I> let him hearken 
 diligently; he that hearkens, let him consider and weigh it duly; he 
 that considers, let him incline and yield to the force of what is laid 
 before him. And what is it that is here required?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She must renounce all others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the law of her espousals: "<I>Forget thy own people and 
 thy father's house,</I> according to the law of marriage. Retain not 
 the affection thou hast had for them, nor covet to return to them 
 again; banish all such remembrance (not only of thy people that were 
 dear to thee, but of thy father's house that were dearer) as may 
 incline thee to look back, as Lot's wife to Sodom." When Abraham, in 
 obedience to God's call, had quitted his native soil, he was not so 
 much as <I>mindful of the country whence he came out.</I> This shows, 
 
 [1.] How necessary it was for those who were converted from Judaism or
 paganism to the faith of Christ wholly to cast out the old leaven, and 
 not to bring into their Christian profession either the Jewish 
 ceremonies or the heathen idolatries, for these would make such a 
 mongrel religion in Christianity as the Samaritans had. 

 [2.] How necessary it is for us all, when we give up our names to Jesus
 Christ, to hate father and mother, and all that is dear to us in this 
 world, in comparison, that is, to love them less than Christ and his 
 honour, and our interest in him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is good encouragement given to the royal bride thus entirely 
 to break off from her former alliances: <I>So shall the king greatly 
 desire thy beauty,</I> which intimates that the mixing of her old rites 
 and customs, whether Jewish or Gentile, with her religion, would 
 blemish her beauty and would hazard her interest in the affections of 
 the royal bridegroom, but that, if she entirely conformed to his will, 
 he would delight in her. The beauty of holiness, both on the church and 
 on particular believers, is in the sight of Christ of great price and 
 very amiable. Where that is he says, <I>This is my rest for ever; here 
 will I dwell, for I have desired it.</I> Among the golden candlesticks 
 he walks with pleasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:1">Rev. ii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She must reverence him, must love, honour, and obey him: <I>He is 
 thy Lord, and worship thou him.</I> The church is to be subject to 
 Christ as the wife to the husband 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:24">Eph. v. 24</A>),

 to call him <I>Lord,</I> as Sarah called Abraham, and to obey him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:6">1 Pet. iii. 6</A>),

 and so not only to submit to his government, but to give him divine
 honours. We must worship him as God, and our Lord; for this is the will
 of God, that <I>all men should honour the Son even as they honour the
 Father;</I> nay, in so doing it is reckoned that they honour the
 Father. If we confess that Christ is Lord, and pay our homage to him
 accordingly, it is <I>to the glory of God the Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:11">Phil. ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells her of the honours designed for her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Great court should be made to her, and rich presents brought her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>The daughter of Tyre,</I>" a rich and splendid city, "the
 <I>daughter of the King of Tyre</I> shall be <I>there with a gift;</I> 
 every royal family round about shall send a branch, as a representative 
 of the whole, to seek thy favour and to make an interest in thee; 
 <I>even the rich among the people,</I> whose wealth might be thought to 
 exempt them from dependence at court, even they shall entreat thy 
 favour, for his sake to whom thou art espoused, that by thee they may 
 make him their friend." The Jews, the pretending Jews, who are rich to 
 a proverb (as rich as a Jew), shall come and worship before the 
 church's feet in the Philadelphian period, and shall <I>know that 
 Christ has loved her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 When the Gentiles, being converted to the faith of Christ, join
 themselves to the church, they then <I>come with a gift,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5,Ro+15:16">2 Cor. viii. 5; Rom. xv. 16</A>.

 When with themselves they devote all they have to the honour of Christ,
 and the service of his kingdom, they then <I>come with a gift.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She shall be very splendid, and highly esteemed in the eyes of all, 
 
 (1.) For her personal qualifications, the endowments of her mind, which
 every one shall admire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The king's daughter is all glorious within.</I> Note, The glory of
 the church is spiritual glory, and that is indeed all glory; it is the 
 glory of the soul, and that is the man; it is glory in God's sight, and 
 it is an earnest of eternal glory. The glory of the saints falls not 
 within the view of a carnal eye. As their life, so their glory, is 
 hidden with Christ in God, neither can the natural man know it, for it 
 is spiritually discerned; but those who do so discern it highly value 
 it. Let us see here what is that true glory which we should be 
 ambitious of, not that which <I>makes a fair show in the flesh,</I> but 
 which is in <I>the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not 
 corruptible</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>),

 <I>whose praise is not of men, but of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>.

 (2.) For her rich apparel. Though all her glory is within, that for
 which she is truly valuable, yet <I>her clothing</I> also <I>is of 
 wrought gold;</I> the conversation of Christians, in which they appear 
 in the world, must be enriched with good works, not gay and gaudy ones, 
 like paint and flourish, but substantially good, like gold; and it must 
 be accurate and exact, like wrought gold, which is worked with a great 
 deal of care and caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Her nuptials shall be celebrated with a great deal of honour and joy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):

 <I>She shall be brought to the king,</I> as the Lord God brought the
 woman to the man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:22">Gen. ii. 22</A>),

 which was a type of this mystical marriage between Christ and his
 church. None are brought to Christ but whom the Father brings, and he 
 has undertaken to do it; none besides are so brought <I>to the king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 as to <I>enter into the king's palace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This intimates a two-fold bringing of the spouse to Christ. 

 [1.] In the conversion of souls to Christ; then they are espoused to
 him, privately contracted, as chaste virgins,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:2,Ro+7:4">2 Cor. xi. 2; Rom. vii. 4</A>.

 [2.] In the completing of the mystical body, and the glorification of
 all the saints, at the end of time; then the <I>bride, the Lamb's 
 wife,</I> shall be made completely ready, when all that belong to the 
 election of grace shall be called in and called home, and all gathered 
 together to Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>.

 Then is the marriage of the Lamb come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7,21:2">Rev. xix. 7; xxi. 2</A>),

 and the virgins <I>go forth to meet the bridegroom,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:1">Matt. xxv. 1</A>.

 Then they shall <I>enter into the king's palaces,</I> into the heavenly
 mansions, to be ever with the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In both these espousals, observe, to the honour of the royal
 bride, 

 [1.] Her wedding clothes--<I>raiment of needle-work,</I> the
 righteousness of Christ, the graces of the Spirit; both curiously 
 wrought by divine wisdom. 

 [2.] Her bride-maids--<I>the virgins her companions,</I> the wise
 virgins who have oil in their vessels as well as in their lamps, those 
 who, being joined to the church, cleave to it and follow it, these 
 shall go in to the marriage. 

 [3.] The mirth with which the nuptials will be celebrated: <I>With
 gladness and rejoicing shall she be brought.</I> When the prodigal is 
 brought home to his father <I>it is meet that we should make merry and 
 be glad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:32">Luke xv. 32</A>);

 and when the marriage of the Lamb has come <I>let us be glad and
 rejoice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7">Rev. xix. 7</A>);

 for the <I>day of his espousals is the day of the gladness of his
 heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The progeny of this marriage shall be illustrious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children.</I> Instead of the
 Old-Testament church, the economy of which had waxed old, and ready to 
 <I>vanish away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>),

 as the fathers that are going off, there shall be a New-Testament
 church, a Gentile-church, that shall be grafted into the same olive and 
 partake of its <I>root and fatness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>);

 more and more eminent shall be <I>the children of the desolate</I> than
 <I>the children of the married wife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.
 
 This promise to Christ is of the same import with that
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>,

 <I>He shall see his seed;</I> and these shall be made <I>princes in all 
 the earth;</I> there shall be some of all nations brought into 
 subjection to Christ, and so made princes, <I>made to our God kings and 
 priests,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>.

 Or it may intimate that there should be a much greater number of
 Christian kings than ever there was of Jewish kings (those in Canaan 
 only, these in all the earth), nursing fathers and nursing mothers to 
 the church, which shall <I>suck the breasts of kings.</I> They are 
 princes of Christ's making; for <I>by him kings reign and princes 
 decree justice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The praise of this marriage shall be perpetual in the praises of the 
 royal bridegroom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I will make thy name to be remembered.</I> His Father has given him
 <I>a name above every name,</I> and here promises to make it perpetual, 
 by keeping up a succession of ministers and Christians in every age, 
 that shall bear up his name, which shall thus <I>endure for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17">Ps. lxxii. 17</A>),

 by being remembered in all the generations of time; for the entail of
 Christianity shall not be cut off. "Therefore, because they shall
 remember thee in all generations, they shall praise thee for ever and 
 ever." Those that help to support the honour of Christ on earth shall 
 in heaven see his glory, and share in it, and be for ever praising him. 
 In the believing hope of our everlasting happiness in the other world 
 let us always keep up the remembrance of Christ, as our only way 
 thither, in our generation; and, in assurance of the perpetuating of 
 the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world, let us transmit the 
 remembrance of him to succeeding generations, that his name <I>may 
 endure for ever and be as the days of heaven.</I></P>
