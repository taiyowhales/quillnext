 Eliphaz, in the foregoing chapter, for the making good of his charge 
 against Job, had vouched a word from heaven, sent him in a vision. In 
 this chapter he appeals to those that bear record on earth, to the 
 saints, the faithful witnesses of God's truth in all ages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:1">ver. 1</A>.

 They will testify,

 I. That the sin of sinners is their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 II. That yet affliction is the common lot of mankind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 III. That when we are in affliction it is our wisdom and duty to apply
 to God, for he is able and ready to help us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.

 IV. That the afflictions which are borne well will end well; and Job
 particularly, if he would come to a better temper, might assure himself
 that God had great mercy in store for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:17-27">ver. 17-27</A>.

 So that he concludes his discourse in somewhat a better humour than he
 began it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
 of the saints wilt thou turn?
 &nbsp; 2  For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
 one.
 &nbsp; 3  I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed
 his habitation.
 &nbsp; 4  His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
 gate, neither <I>is there</I> any to deliver <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
 the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A very warm dispute being begun between Job and his friends, Eliphaz 
 here makes a fair motion to put the matter to a reference. In all 
 debates perhaps the sooner this is done the better if the contenders 
 cannot end it between themselves. So well assured is Eliphaz of the 
 goodness of his own cause that he moves Job himself to choose the 
 arbitrators 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee;</I> that is, 

 1. "If there be any that suffer as thou sufferest.  Canst thou produce
 an instance of any one that was really a saint that was reduced to such 
 an extremity as thou art now reduced to? God never dealt with any that 
 love his name as he deals with thee, and therefore surely thou art none 
 of them." 

 2. "If there be any that say as thou sayest. Did ever any good man
 curse his day as thou dost? Or will any of the saints justify thee in 
 these heats or passions, or say that these are the spots of God's 
 children? Thou wilt find none of the saints that will be either thy 
 advocates or my antagonists. <I>To which of the saints wilt thou 
 turn?</I> Turn to which thou wilt, and thou wilt find they are all of 
 my mind. I have the <I>communis sensus fidelium--the unanimous vote of 
 the faithful</I> on my side; they will all subscribe to what I am going 
 to say." Observe,

 (1.) Good people are called <I>saints</I> even in the Old Testament; 
 and therefore I know not why we should, in common speaking (unless 
 because we must <I>loqui cum vulgo--speak as our neighbours</I>), 
 appropriate the title to those of the New Testament, and not say St. 
 Abraham, St. Moses, and St.  Isaiah, as well as St. Matthew and St. 
 Mark; and St. David the psalmist, as well as St. David the British 
 bishop. Aaron is expressly called <I>the saint of the Lord.</I> 

 (2.) All that are themselves saints will turn to those that are so, 
 will choose them for their friends and converse with them, will choose 
 them for their judges and consult them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:79">Ps. cxix. 79</A>.

 The saints shall <I>judge the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:1,2">1 Cor. vi. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>Walk in the way of good men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:20">Prov. ii. 20</A>),

 <I>the old way, the footsteps of the flock.</I> Every one chooses some
 sort of people or other to whom he studies to recommend himself, and 
 whose sentiments are to him the test of honour and dishonour. Now all 
 true saints endeavour to recommend themselves to those that are such, 
 and to stand right in their opinion.

 (3.) There are some truths so plain, and so universally known and 
 believed, that one may venture to appeal to any of the saints 
 concerning them. However there are some things about which they 
 unhappily differ, there are many more, and more considerable, in which 
 they are agreed; as the evil of sin, the vanity of the world, the worth 
 of the soul, the necessity of a holy life, and the like. Though they do 
 not all live up, as they should, to their belief of these truths, yet 
 they are all ready to bear their testimony to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now there are two things which Eliphaz here maintains, and in which he 
 doubts not but all the saints concur with him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the sin of sinners directly tends to their own ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Wrath kills the foolish man,</I> his own wrath, and therefore he is
 foolish for indulging it; it is a fire in his bones, in his blood, 
 enough to put him into a fever. <I>Envy</I> is the rottenness of the 
 bones, and so <I>slays the silly one</I> that frets himself with it. 
 "So it is with thee," says Eliphaz, "while thou quarrellest with God 
 thou doest thyself the greatest mischief; thy anger at thy own 
 troubles, and thy envy at our prosperity, do but add to thy pain and 
 misery: turn to the saints, and thou wilt find they understand their 
 interest better." Job had told his wife she spoke as the foolish women; 
 now Eliphaz tells him he acted as the foolish men, the silly ones. Or 
 it may be meant thus: "If men are ruined and undone, it is always their 
 own folly that ruins and undoes them. They kill themselves by some lust 
 or other; therefore, no doubt, Job, thou hast done some foolish thing, 
 by which thou hast brought thyself into this calamitous condition." 
 Many understand it of God's wrath and jealousy. Job needed not be 
 uneasy at the prosperity of the wicked, for the world's smiles can 
 never shelter them from God's frowns; they are foolish and silly if 
 they think they will. God's anger will be the death, the eternal death, 
 of those on whom it fastens. What is hell but God's anger without 
 mixture or period?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That their prosperity is short and their destruction certain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 He seems here to parallel Job's case with that which is commonly the
 case of wicked people.

 1. Job had prospered for a time, seemed confirmed, and was secure in
 his prosperity; and it is common for foolish wicked men to do so: <I>I 
 have seen them taking root</I>--planted, and, in their own and others' 
 apprehension, fixed, and likely to continue. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:2,Ps+37:35,36">Jer. xii. 2; Ps. xxxvii. 35, 36</A>.

 We see worldly men taking root in the earth; on earthly things they fix
 the standing of their hopes, and from them they draw the sap of their 
 comforts. The outward estate may be flourishing, but the soul cannot 
 prosper that takes root in the earth.

 2. Job's prosperity was now at an end, and so has the prosperity of
 other wicked people quickly been.

 (1.) Eliphaz foresaw their ruin with an eye of faith. Those who looked 
 only at present things blessed their habitation, and thought them 
 happy, blessed it long, and wished themselves in their condition. But 
 Eliphaz cursed it, suddenly cursed it, as soon as he saw them begin to 
 take root, that is, he plainly foresaw and foretold their ruin; not 
 that he prayed for it (<I>I have not desired the woeful day</I>), but 
 he prognosticated it. <I>He went into the sanctuary,</I> and there 
 <I>understood their end</I> and heard their doom read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17,18">Ps. lxxiii. 17, 18</A>),
 
 that the <I>prosperity of fools will destroy them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32">Prov. i. 32</A>.

 Those who believe the word of God can see a <I>curse in the house of 
 the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>),

 though it be ever so finely and firmly built, and ever so full of all
 good things; and they can foresee that the curse will, in time, 
 infallibly consume it with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4">Zech. v. 4</A>.

 (2.) He saw, at length, what he had foreseen.  He was not disappointed
 in his expectation concerning him; the event answered it; his family 
 was undone, and his estate ruined. In these particulars he plainly and 
 very invidiously reflects on Job's calamities. 

 [1.] His children were crushed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They thought themselves safe in their eldest brother's house, but were
 <I>far from safety,</I> for they were <I>crushed in the gate.</I> 
 Perhaps the door or gate of the house was highest built, and fell 
 heaviest upon them, <I>and there was none to deliver them</I> from 
 perishing in the ruins.  This is commonly understood of the destruction 
 of the families of wicked men, by the execution of justice upon them, 
 to oblige them to restore what they have ill-gotten. They leave it to 
 their children; but the descent shall not bar the entry of the rightful 
 owners, who will crush their children, and cast them by due course of 
 law (and there shall be none to help them), or perhaps by oppression,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:9,10">Ps. cix. 9</A>,

 &c.

 [2.] His estate was plundered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Job's was so. The hungry robbers, the Sabeans and Chaldeans, ran away
 with it, and swallowed it; and this, says he, I have often observed in 
 others. What has been got by spoil and rapine has been lost in the same 
 way. The careful owner hedged it about with thorns, and then thought it 
 safe; but the fence proved insignificant against the greediness of the 
 spoilers (if hunger will break through the stone walls, much more 
 through thorn hedges), and against the divine curse, which will go 
 through the thorns and briers, and <I>burn them together,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither
 doth trouble spring out of the ground;
 &nbsp; 7  Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
 &nbsp; 8  I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
 &nbsp; 9  Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
 without number:
 &nbsp; 10  Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
 fields:
 &nbsp; 11  To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
 may be exalted to safety.
 &nbsp; 12  He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
 hands cannot perform <I>their</I> enterprise.
 &nbsp; 13  He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel
 of the froward is carried headlong.
 &nbsp; 14  They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the
 noonday as in the night.
 &nbsp; 15  But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
 from the hand of the mighty.
 &nbsp; 16  So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz, having touched Job in a very tender part, in mentioning both 
 the loss of his estate and the death of his children as the just 
 punishment of his sin, that he might not drive him to despair, here 
 begins to encourage him, and puts him in a way to make himself easy. 
 Now he very much changes his voice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:20">Gal. iv. 20</A>),

 and speaks in the accents of kindness, as if he would atone for the
 hard words he had given him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He reminds him that no affliction comes by chance, nor is to be 
 attributed to second causes: It <I>doth not come forth of the dust,</I> 
 nor <I>spring out of the ground,</I> as the grass doth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It doth not come of course, at certain seasons of the year, as natural
 productions do, by a chain of second causes. The proportion between 
 prosperity and adversity is not so exactly observed by Providence as 
 that between day and night, summer and winter, but according to the 
 will and counsel of God, when and as he thinks fit. Some read it, 
 <I>Sin comes not forth out of the dust, nor iniquity of the ground.</I> 
 If men be bad, they must not lay the blame upon the soil, the climate, 
 or the stars, but on themselves. <I>If thou scornest, thou alone shalt 
 bear it.</I> We must not attribute our afflictions to fortune, for they 
 are from God, nor our sins to fate, for they are from ourselves; so 
 that, whatever trouble we are in, we must own that God sends it upon us 
 and we procure it to ourselves: the former is a reason why we should be 
 very patient, the latter why we should be very penitent, when we are 
 afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reminds him that trouble and affliction are what we have all 
 reason to expect in this world: <I>Man is brought to trouble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 not as man (had he kept his innocency he would have been born to
 pleasure), but as sinful man, as <I>born of a woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>),

 who was in the transgression. Man is born in sin, and therefore born to
 trouble. Even those that are born to honour and estate are yet born to 
 trouble in the flesh. In our fallen state it has become natural to us 
 to sin, and the natural consequence of that is affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Rom. v. 12</A>.

 There is nothing in this world we are born to, and can truly call our
 own, but sin and trouble; both are as the sparks that fly upwards.  
 Actual transgressions are the sparks that fly out of the furnace of 
 original corruption; and, being called <I>transgressors from the 
 womb,</I> no wonder that we <I>deal very treacherously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.
 
 Such too is the frailty of our bodies, and the vanity of all our
 enjoyments, that our troubles also thence arise as naturally <I>as the 
 sparks fly upwards</I>--so many are they, so thick and so fast does one
 follow another. Why then should we be surprised at our afflictions as 
 strange, or quarrel with them as hard, when they are but what we are 
 born to? Man is born to <I>labour</I> (so it is in the margin), is 
 sentenced to eat his bread in the sweat of his face, which should inure 
 him to hardness, and make him bear his afflictions the better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He directs him how to behave himself under his affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>I would seek unto God; surely I would:</I> so it is in the original.
 Here is, 

 1. A tacit reproof to Job for not seeking to God, but quarrelling with
 him: "Job, if I had been in thy case, I would not have been so peevish 
 and passionate as thou art. I would have acquiesced in the will of 
 God." It is easy to say what we would do if we were in such a one's 
 case; but when it comes to the trial, perhaps it will be found not so 
 easy to do as we say. 

 2. Very good and seasonable advice to him, which Eliphaz transfers to
 himself in a figure: "For my part, the best way I should think I could 
 take, if I were in thy condition, would be to apply to God." Note, We 
 should give our friends no other counsel than what we would take 
 ourselves if we were in their case, that we may be easy under our 
 afflictions, may get good by them, and may see a good issue of them.

 (1.) We must by prayer fetch in mercy and grace from God, seek to him 
 as a Father and friend, though he contend with us, as one who is alone 
 able to support and succour us. His favour we must seek when we have 
 lost all we have in the world; to him we must address ourselves as the 
 fountain and Father of all good, all consolation.  <I>Is any afflicted? 
 let him pray.</I> It is heart's-ease, a salve for every sore. 

 (2.) We must by patience refer ourselves and our cause to him: <I>To 
 God would I commit my cause;</I> having spread it before him, I would 
 leave it with him; having laid it at his feet, I would lodge it in his 
 hand.  "<I>Here I am, let the Lord do with me as seemeth him good.</I>" 
 If our cause be indeed a good cause, we need not fear committing it to 
 God, for he is both just and kind. Those that would seek so as to speed 
 must refer themselves to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He encourages him thus to seek to God, and commit his cause to him. 
 It will not be in vain to do so, for he is one in whom we shall find 
 effectual help.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He recommends to his consideration God's almighty power and 
 sovereign dominion. In general, he <I>doeth great things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 great indeed, for he can do any thing, he doth do every thing, and all
 according to the counsel of his own will--great indeed, for the
 operations of his power are, 

 (1.) <I>Unsearchable,</I> and such as can never be fathomed, can never 
 be found out <I>from the beginning to the end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 11</A>.

 The works of nature are mysterious; the most curious searches come far
 short of full discoveries and the wisest philosophers have owned 
 themselves at a loss. The designs of Providence are much more deep and
 unaccountable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:33">Rom. xi. 33</A>.

 (2.) <I>Numerous,</I> and such as can never be reckoned up. He doeth 
 great <I>things without number;</I> his power is never exhausted, nor 
 will all his purposes ever be fulfilled till the end of time. 

 (3.) They are <I>marvellous,</I> and such as never can be sufficiently 
 admired; eternity itself will be short enough to be spent in the 
 admiration of them. Now, by the consideration of this, Eliphaz intends,

 [1.] To convince Job of his fault and folly in quarrelling with God. We 
 must not pretend to pass a judgment upon his works, for they are 
 unsearchable and above our enquiries; nor must we strive with our 
 Maker, for he will certainly be too hard for us, and is able to crush 
 us in a moment. 

 [2.] To encourage Job to seek unto God, and to refer his cause to him. 
 What more encouraging than to see that he is one to whom power belongs? 
 He can do great things and marvellous for our relief, when we are 
 brought ever so low.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives some instances of God's dominion and power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God doeth great things in the kingdom of nature: <I>He gives rain 
 upon the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 put here for all the gifts of common providence, all the <I>fruitful
 seasons</I> by which he <I>filleth our hearts with food and 
 gladness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>.

 Observe, When he would show what great things God does he speaks of his
 giving rain, which, because it is a common thing, we are apt to look 
 upon as a little thing, but, if we duly consider both how it is 
 produced and what is produced by it, we shall see it to be a great work 
 both of power and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He doeth great things in the affairs of the children of men, not 
 only enriches the poor and comforts the needy, by the rain he sends 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but, in order to the advancing of those that are low, he <I>disappoints 
 the devices of the crafty;</I> for 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>

 is to be joined to
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Compare with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:51-53">Luke i. 51-53</A>.

 He hath <I>scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,</I>
 and so hath <I>exalted those of low degree,</I> and <I>filled the heart 
 with good things.</I> See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How he frustrates the counsels of the proud and politic, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 There is a supreme power that manages and overrules men who think
 themselves free and absolute, and fulfils its own purposes in spite of 
 their projects. Observe, <I>First,</I> The froward, that walk contrary 
 to God and the interests of his kingdom, are often very crafty; for 
 they are the seed of the old serpent that was noted for his subtlety. 
 They think themselves wise, but, at the end, will be fools. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The Froward enemies of God's kingdom have their 
 devices, their enterprises, and their counsels, against it, and against 
 the loyal faithful subjects of it. They are restless and unwearied in 
 their designs, close in their consultations, high in their hopes, deep 
 in their politics, and fast-linked in their confederacies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> God easily can, and (as far as is for his glory) 
 certainly will, blast and defeat all the designs of his and his 
 people's enemies. How were the plots of Ahithophel, Sanballat, and 
 Haman baffled! How were the confederacies of Syria and Ephraim against 
 Judah, of Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, against God's Israel, the kings 
 of the earth and the princes against the Lord and against his anointed, 
 broken! The hands that have been stretched out against God and his 
 church have not performed their enterprise, nor have the weapons formed 
 against Sion prospered. <I>Fourthly,</I> That which enemies have 
 designed for the ruin of the church has often turned to their own ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>He takes the wise in their own craftiness,</I> and <I>snares them in
 the work of their own hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15,16,9:15,16">Ps. vii. 15, 16; ix. 15, 16</A>.

 This is quoted by the apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19">1 Cor. iii. 19</A>)

 to show how the learned men of the heathen were befooled by their own
 vain philosophy.  <I>Fifthly,</I> When God infatuates men they are 
 perplexed, and at a loss, even in those things that seem most plain and 
 easy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They meet with darkness</I> even <I>in the day-time:</I> nay (as in
 the margin), <I>They run themselves into darkness</I> by the violence 
 and precipitation of their own counsels.  See

 [2.] How he favours the cause of the poor and humble, and espouses 
 that. <I>First,</I> He exalts the humble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Those whom proud men contrive to crush he raises from under their feet,
 and sets them in safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5">Ps. xii. 5</A>.

 The lowly in heart, and those that mourn, he advances, comforts, and
 makes to <I>dwell on high,</I> in the <I>munitions of rocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:16">Isa. xxxiii. 16</A>.

 Sion's mourners are the sealed ones, marked for safety,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:4">Ezek. ix. 4</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He delivers the oppressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The designs of the crafty are to ruin the poor.  Tongue, and hand, and
 sword, and all, are at work in order to this; but God takes under his 
 special protection those who, being poor and unable to help themselves, 
 being his poor and devoted to his praise, have committed themselves to 
 him. He saves them from the mouth that speaks hard things against them 
 and the hand that does hard things against them; for he can, when he 
 pleases, tie the tongue and wither the hand.  The effect of this is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 1. That weak and timorous saints are comforted: <I>So the poor,</I> who
 began to despair, <I>has hope.</I> The experiences of some are 
 encouragement to others to hope the best in the worst of times; for it 
 is the glory of God to send help to the helpless and hope to the 
 hopeless. 

 2.  That daring threatening sinners are confounded: <I>Iniquity stops
 her mouth,</I> being surprised at the strangeness of the deliverance, 
 ashamed of its enmity against those who appear to be the favourites of 
 Heaven, mortified at the disappointment, and compelled to acknowledge 
 the justice of God's proceedings, having nothing to object against 
 them. Those that domineered over God's poor, that frightened them, 
 menaced them, and falsely accused them, will not have a word to say 
 against them when God appears for them. See

 despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

 Eliphaz, in this concluding paragraph of his discourse, gives Job (what 
 he himself knew not how to take) a comfortable prospect of the issue of 
 his afflictions, if he did but recover his temper and accommodate 
 himself to them.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The seasonable word of caution and exhortation that he gives him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</I> Call it a
 chastening, which comes from the father's love and is designed for the 
 child's good. Call it the chastening of the Almighty, with whom it is 
 madness to contend, to whom it is wisdom and duty to submit, and who 
 will be a God all-sufficient (for so the word signifies) to all those 
 that trust in him. Do not <I>despise</I> it;" it is a copious word in 
 the original. 

 1. "Be not averse to it. Let grace conquer the antipathy which nature
 has to suffering, and reconcile thyself to the will of God in it." We 
 need the rod and we deserve it; and therefore we ought not to think it 
 either strange or hard if we feel the smart of it. Let not the heart 
 rise against a bitter pill or potion, when it is prescribed for our 
 good. 

 2. "Do not think ill of it; do not put it from thee (as that which is
 either hurtful or at least not useful, which there is not occasion for 
 nor advantage by) only because for the present it is not joyous, but 
 grievous." We must never scorn to stoop to God, nor think it a thing 
 below us to come under his discipline, but reckon, on the contrary, 
 that God really magnifies man when he thus <I>visits and tries him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:17,18"><I>ch.</I> vii. 17, 18</A>.

 3. "Do not overlook and disregard it, as if it were only a chance, and
 the production of second causes, but take great notice of it as the 
 voice of God and a messenger from heaven." More is implied than is 
 expressed: "<I>Reverence the chastening of the Lord;</I> have a humble 
 awful regard to this correcting hand, and tremble when the lion roars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:8">Amos iii. 8</A>.

 Submit to the chastening, and study to answer the call, to answer the
 end of it, and then you reverence it." When God by an affliction draws 
 upon us for some of the effects he has entrusted us with we must honour 
 his bill by accepting it, and subscribing it, resigning him his own 
 when he calls for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The comfortable words of encouragement which he gives him thus to 
 accommodate himself to his condition, and (as he himself had expressed 
 it) to receive evil at the hand of God, and not despise it as a gift 
 not worth the accepting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If his affliction was thus borne, 

 (1.) The nature and property of it would be altered. Though it looked 
 like a man's misery, it would really be his bliss: <I>Happy is the man 
 whom God correcteth</I> if he make but a due improvement of the 
 correction. A good man is happy though he be afflicted, for, whatever 
 he has lost, he has not lost his enjoyment of God nor his title to 
 heaven. Nay, he is happy because he is afflicted; correction is an 
 evidence of his sonship and a means of his sanctification; it mortifies 
 his corruptions, weans his heart from the world, draws him nearer to 
 God, brings him to his Bible, brings him to his knees, works him for, 
 and so is working for him, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of 
 glory. <I>Happy</I> therefore <I>is the man whom God correcteth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:12">Jam. i. 12</A>.

 (2.) The issue and consequence of it would be very good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 [1.] Though <I>he makes sore</I> the body with sore boils, the mind 
 with sad thoughts, yet he <I>binds up</I> at the same time, as the 
 skilful tender surgeon binds up the wounds he had occasion to make with 
 his incision-knife. When God makes sores by the rebukes of his 
 providence he binds up by the consolations of his Spirit, which 
 oftentimes abound most as afflictions do abound, and counterbalance 
 them, to the unspeakable satisfaction of the patient sufferers. 

 [2.] Though <I>he wounds,</I> yet <I>his hands make whole</I> in due 
 time; as he supports his people, and makes them easy under their 
 afflictions, so in due time he delivers them, and makes a way for them 
 to escape.  All is well again; and he comforts them <I>according to the 
 time wherein he afflicted them.</I> God's usual method is first to 
 wound and then to heal, first to convince and then to comfort, first to 
 humble and then to exalt; and (as Mr. Caryl observes) he never makes a 
 wound too great, too deep, for his own cure.  <I>Una eademque manus 
 vulnus opemque tulit--The hand that inflicts the wound applies the 
 cure.</I> God tears the wicked and goes away; let those heal that will, 
 if they can 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>);

 but the humble and penitent may say, <I>He has torn and he will heal
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1">Hos. vi. 1</A>.

 This is general, but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:19-27">following verses</A>

 Eliphaz addresses himself directly to Job, and gives him many precious
 promises of great and kind things which God would do for him if he did
 but humble himself under his hand. Though then they had no Bibles that
 we know of, yet Eliphaz had sufficient warrant to give Job these
 assurances, from the general discoveries God had made of his good will
 to his people. And, though in every thing which Job's friends said they
 were not directed by the Spirit of God (for they spoke both of God and
 Job some things that were not right), yet the general doctrines they
 laid down expressed the pious sense of the patriarchal age, and as St.
 Paul quoted 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:13,1Co+1:19">
 <I>v.</I> 13</A>

 for canonical scripture, and as the command

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:17,Heb+12:5">
 <I>v.</I> 17</A>

 is no doubt binding on us, so these promises here may be, and must be,
 received and applied as divine promises, and we may <I>through patience 
 and comfort of this</I> part of <I>scripture have hope.</I> Let us 
 therefore give diligence to make sure our interest in these promises, 
 and then view the particulars of them and take the comfort of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is here promised that as afflictions and troubles recur
 supports and deliverances shall be graciously repeated, be it ever so
 often: <I>In six troubles he shall</I> be ready to <I>deliver thee; 
 yea, and in seven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This intimates that,as long as we are here in this world, we must
 expect a succession of troubles, that the clouds will return after the 
 rain. After six troubles may come a seventh; after many, look for more; 
 but out of them all will God deliver those that are his,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11,Pa+34:19">2 Tim. iii. 11; Ps. xxxiv. 19</A>.

 Former deliverances are not, as among men, excuses from further
 deliverances, but earnests of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:19">Prov. xix. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That, whatever troubles good men may be in, <I>there shall no evil 
 touch them;</I> they shall do them no real harm; the malignity of them, 
 the sting, shall be taken out; they may hiss, but they cannot hurt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:10">Ps. xci. 10</A>.
 
 The <I>evil one toucheth not</I> God's children,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18">1 John v. 18</A>.

 Being kept from sin, they are kept from the evil of every trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That, when desolating judgments are abroad, they shall be taken 
 under special protection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Do many perish about them for want of the necessary supports of life?
 They shall be supplied. "<I>In famine he shall redeem thee from 
 death;</I> whatever becomes of others, thou shalt be <I>kept alive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:19">Ps. xxxiii. 19</A>.

 <I>Verily, thou shalt be fed,</I> nay, even <I>in the days of famine
 thou shalt be satisfied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3,19">Ps. xxxvii. 3, 19</A>.

 <I>In</I> time of <I>war,</I> when thousands fall on the right and left
 hand, he shall redeem thee <I>from the power of the sword.</I> If God 
 please, it shall not touch thee; or if it wound thee, if it kill thee, 
 it shall not hurt thee; it can but kill the body, nor has it power to 
 do that unless it be given from above."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That, whatever is maliciously said against them, it shall not
 affect them to do them any hurt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 "<I>Thou shalt</I> not only be protected from the killing sword of war,
 but shalt <I>be hidden from the scourge of the</I> tongue, which, like 
 a scourge, is vexing and painful, though not mortal." The best men, and 
 the most inoffensive, cannot, even in their innocency, secure 
 themselves from calumny, reproach, and false accusation. From these a 
 man cannot hide himself, but God can hide him, so that the most 
 malicious slanders shall be so little heeded by him as not to disturb 
 his peace, and so little heeded by others as not to blemish his 
 reputation: and the remainder of wrath God can and does restrain, for 
 it is owing to the hold he has of the consciences of bad men that the 
 scourge of the tongue is not the ruin of all the comforts of good men 
 in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That they shall have a holy security and serenity of mind, arising
 from their hope and confidence in God, even in the worst of times. When 
 dangers are most threatening they shall be easy, believing themselves 
 safe; and they <I>shall not be afraid of destruction,</I> no, not when 
 they see it coming 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 nor <I>of the beasts of the field</I> when they set upon them, nor of
 men as cruel as beasts; nay, <I>at destruction and famine thou shalt 
 laugh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 not so as to despise any of God's chastenings or make a jest of his
 judgments, but so as to triumph in God, in his power and goodness, and 
 therein to triumph over the world and all its grievances, to be not 
 only easy, but cheerful and joyful, in tribulation. Blessed Paul 
 laughed at destruction when he said, <I>O death! where is thy 
 sting?</I> when, in the name of all the saints, he defied all the 
 calamities of this present time to <I>separate us from the love of 
 God,</I> concluding that <I>in all these things we are more than 
 conquerors,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35-39">Rom. viii. 35</A>,

 &c. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) That, being at peace with God, there shall be a covenant of
 friendship between them and the whole creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "When thou walkest over thy grounds thou shalt not need to fear
 stumbling, for <I>thou shalt be at league with the stones of the 
 field,</I> not to dash thy foot against any of them, nor shalt thou be 
 in danger from <I>the beasts of the field,</I> for they shall all be at 
 peace with thee;" compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:18">Hos. ii. 18</A>,

 <I>I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field.</I>
 This implies that while man is at enmity with his Maker the inferior 
 creatures are at war with him; but <I>tranquillus Deus tranquillat 
 omnia--a reconciled God reconciles all things.</I> Our covenant with 
 God is a covenant with all the creatures that they shall do us no hurt 
 but be ready to serve us and do us good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) That their houses and families shall be comfortable to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Peace and piety in the family will make it so. "<I>Thou shalt know</I>
 and be assured <I>that thy tabernacle</I> is and <I>shall be in 
 peace;</I> thou mayest be confident both of its present and its future 
 prosperity." <I>That peace is thy tabernacle</I> (so the word is); 
 peace is the house in which those dwell who dwell in God, and are at 
 home in him. "<I>Thou shalt visit</I>" (that is, enquire into the 
 affairs of) "<I>thy habitation,</I> and take a review of them, <I>and 
 shalt not sin.</I>"

 [1.] God will provide a settlement for his people, mean perhaps and 
 movable, a cottage, a tabernacle, but a fixed and quiet habitation. 
 "Thou shalt not sin," or <I>wander;</I> that is, as some understand it, 
 "thou shalt not be a fugitive and a vagabond" (Cain's curse), "but
 shalt dwell in the land, and verily, not uncertainly as vagrants, shalt 
 thou be fed." 

 [2.] Their families shall be taken under the special protection of the 
 divine Providence, and shall prosper as far as is for their good. 

 [3.] They shall be assured of peace, and of the continuance and entail 
 of it. "Thou shalt know, to thy unspeakable satisfaction, that peace is 
 sure to thee and thine, having the word of God for it." Providence may 
 change, but the promise cannot. 

 [4.] They shall have wisdom to govern their families aright, to order 
 their affairs with discretion, and to look well to the ways of their 
 household, which is here called <I>visiting their habitation.</I> 
 Masters of families must not be strangers at home, but must have a 
 watchful eye over what they have and what their servants do. 

 [5.] They shall have grace to manage the concerns of their families 
 after a godly sort, and not to sin in the management of them. They 
 shall call their servants to account without passion, pride, 
 covetousness, worldliness, or the like; they shall look into their 
 affairs without discontent at what is or distrust of what shall be. 
 Family piety crowns family peace and prosperity.  The greatest 
 blessing, both in our employments and in our enjoyments, is to be kept 
 from sin in them. When we are abroad it is comfortable to hear that our 
 tabernacle is in peace; and when we return home it is comfortable to 
 visit our habitation with satisfaction in our success, that we have not 
 failed in our business, and with a good conscience, that we have not 
 offended God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) That their posterity shall be numerous and prosperous. Job had 
 lost all his children; "but," says Eliphaz, "if thou return to God, he 
 will again build up thy family, and thy seed shall be many and as great 
 as ever, and thy offspring increasing and flourishing <I>as the grass 
 of the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and thou shalt know it." God has blessings in store for the seed of the
 faithful, which they shall have if they do not stand in their own light 
 and forfeit them by their folly. It is a comfort to parents to see the 
 prosperity, especially the spiritual prosperity, of their children; if 
 they are truly good, they are truly great, how small a figure soever 
 they may make in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (9.) That their death shall be seasonable, and they shall finish their 
 course, at length, with joy and honour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 It is a great mercy,
 
 [1.] To live to a full age, and not to have the number of our months 
 cut off in the midst. If the providence of God do not give us long 
 life, yet, if the grace of God give us to be satisfied with the time 
 allotted us, we may be said to come to a full age. That man lives long 
 enough that has done his work and is fit for another world. 

 [2.] To be willing to die, to come cheerfully to the grave, and not to 
 be forced thither, as he whose soul was required of him. 

 [3.] To die seasonably, as the corn is cut and housed when it is fully 
 ripe; not till then, but then not suffered to stand a day longer, lest 
 it shed.  Our times are in God's hand; it is well they are so, for he 
 will take care that those who are his shall die in the best time: 
 however their death may seem to us untimely, it will be found not 
 unseasonable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:27">last verse</A>

 he recommends these promises to Job, 

 (1.) As faithful sayings, which he might be confident of the truth of: 
 "<I>Lo, this we have searched, and so it is.</I> We have indeed 
 received these things by tradition from our fathers, but we have not 
 taken them upon trust; we have carefully searched them, have compared 
 spiritual things with spiritual, have diligently studied them, and been 
 confirmed in our belief of them from our own observation and 
 experience; and we are all of a mind that so it is." Truth is a 
 treasure that is well worth digging for, diving for; and then we shall 
 know both how to value it ourselves and how to communicate it to others 
 when we have taken pains in searching for it.  

 (2.) As well worthy of all acceptation, which he might improve to his 
 great advantage: <I>Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</I> It is 
 not enough to hear and know the truth, but we must improve it, and be 
 made wiser and better by it, receive the impressions of it, and submit 
 to the commanding power of it. <I>Know it for thyself</I> (so the word 
 is), with application to thyself, and thy own case; not only "This is 
 true," but "this is true concerning me." That which we thus hear and 
 know for ourselves we hear and know for our good, as we are nourished 
 by the meat which we digest.  That is indeed a good sermon to us which 
 does us good.</P>
