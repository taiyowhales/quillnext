 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
 seemly for a fool.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is too common a thing for honour to be given to fools, who are 
 utterly unworthy of it and unfit for it. Bad men, who have neither wit 
 nor grace, are sometimes preferred by princes, and applauded and cried 
 up by the people. <I>Folly is set in great dignity,</I> as Solomon 
 observed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:6">Eccl. x. 6</A>.

 2. It is very absurd and unbecoming when it is so. It is an incongruous 
 <I>as snow in summer,</I> and as great a disorder in the commonwealth 
 as that is in the course of nature and in the seasons of the year; nay, 
 it is as injurious <I>as rain in harvest,</I> which hinders the 
 labourers and spoils the fruits of the earth when they are ready to be 
 gathered. When bad men are in power they commonly abuse their power, in 
 discouraging virtue, and giving countenance to wickedness, for want of 
 wisdom to discern it and grace to detest it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr26_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
 curse causeless shall not come.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The folly of passion. It makes men scatter <I>causeless curses,</I> 
 wishing ill to others upon presumption that they are bad and have done 
 ill, when either they mistake the person or misunderstand the fact, or 
 they call evil good and good evil. Give honour to a fool, and he 
 thunders out his anathemas against all that he is disgusted with, right 
 or wrong. Great men, when wicked, think they have a privilege to keep 
 those about them in awe, by cursing them, and swearing at them, which 
 yet is an expression of the most impotent malice and shows their 
 weakness as much as their wickedness. 

 2. The safety of innocency. He that is cursed without cause, whether by 
 furious imprecations or solemn anathemas, the curse shall do him no 
 more harm than the bird that flies over his head, than Goliath's curses 
 did to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:43">1 Sam. xvii. 43</A>.

 It will fly away like the sparrow or the wild dove, which go nobody
 knows where, till they return to their proper place, as the curse will 
 at length return upon the head of him that uttered it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
 fool's back.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 1. Wicked men are compared to <I>the horse</I> and <I>the ass,</I> so 
 brutish are they, so unreasonable, so unruly, and not to be governed 
 but by force or fear, so low has sin sunk men, so much below 
 themselves. Man indeed is <I>born like the wild ass's colt,</I> but as 
 some by the grace of God are changed, and become rational, so others by 
 custom in sin are hardened, and become more and more sottish, <I>as the 
 horse and the mule,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:9">Ps. xxxii. 9</A>.

 2. Direction is given to use them accordingly. Princes, instead of
 giving <I>honour to a fool</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 must put disgrace upon him--instead of putting power into his hand,
 must exercise power over him. A <I>horse</I> unbroken needs <I>a 
 whip</I> for correction, and an <I>ass a bridle</I> for direction and 
 to check him when he would turn out of the way; so a vicious man, who 
 will not be under the guidance and restraint of religion and reason, 
 ought to be whipped and bridled, to be rebuked severely, and made to 
 smart for what he has done amiss, and to be restrained from offending 
 any more.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
 like unto him.
 &nbsp; 5  Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
 own conceit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here the noble security of the scripture-style, which seems to 
 contradict itself, but really does not. Wise men have need to be 
 directed how to deal with fools; and they have never more need of
 wisdom than in dealing with such, to know when to keep silence and when
 to speak, for there may be a time for both.

 1. In some cases a wise man will not set his wit to that of a fool so 
 far as to <I>answer him according to his folly</I> "If he boast of 
 himself, do not answer him by boasting of thyself. If he rail and talk 
 passionately, do not thou rail and talk passionately too. If he tell 
 one great lie, do not thou tell another to match it. If he calumniate 
 thy friends, do not thou calumniate his. If he banter, do not answer 
 him in his own language, <I>lest thou be like him,</I> even thou, who 
 knowest better things, who hast more sense, and hast been better 
 taught." 

 2. Yet, in other cases, a wise man will use his wisdom for the 
 conviction of a fool, when, by taking notice of what he says, there may 
 be hopes of doing good, or at least preventing further, mischief, 
 either to himself or others. "If thou have reason to think that thy 
 silence will be deemed an evidence of the weakness of thy cause, or of 
 thy own weakness, in such a case <I>answer him,</I> and let it be an 
 answer <I>ad hominem--to the man,</I> beat him at his own weapons, and 
 that will be answer <I>ad rem--to the point,</I> or as good as one.
 If he offer any thing that looks like an argument, an answer that, and 
 suit thy answer to his case. If he think, because thou dost not answer 
 him, that what he says is unanswerable, then give him an answer, 
 <I>lest he be wise in his own conceit</I> and boast of a victory." For

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To recommend wisdom to us, and to quicken us to the diligent use of all 
 the means for the getting of wisdom, Solomon here shows that fools are 
 fit for nothing; they are either sottish men, who will never think and 
 design at all, or vicious men, who will never think and design well. 

 1. They are not fit to be entrusted with any business, not fit to go
 on an errand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He that</I> does but <I>send a message by the hand of a fool,</I> of
 a careless heedless person, one who is so full of his jests and so 
 given to his pleasures that he cannot apply his mind to any thing that 
 is serious, will find his message misunderstood, the one half of it 
 forgotten, the rest awkwardly delivered, and so many blunders made 
 about it that he might as well have <I>cut off his legs,</I> that is, 
 never have sent him. Nay, he will <I>drink damage;</I> it will be very 
 much to his prejudice to have employed such a one, who, instead of 
 bringing him a good account of his affairs, will abuse him and put a 
 trick upon him; for, in Solomon's language, a knave and a fool are of 
 the same signification. It will turn much to a man's disgrace to make 
 use of the service of a fool, for people will be apt to judge of the 
 master by his messenger.

 2. They are not fit to have any honour put upon them. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Honour is not seemly for a fool;</I> here he shows that it is lost
 and thrown away upon him, as if a man should throw a precious stone, or 
 a stone fit to be used in weighing, into a heap of common stones, where 
 it would be buried and of no use; it is as absurd as if a man should 
 <I>dress up a stone in purple</I> (so others); nay, it is dangerous, it 
 is like <I>a stone bound in a sling,</I> with which a man will be 
 likely to do hurt. To <I>give honour to a fool</I> is to put a sword in 
 a madman's hand, with which we know not what mischief he may do, even 
 to those that put it into his hand.

 3. They are not fit to deliver wise sayings, nor should they undertake
 to handle any matter of weight, though they should be instructed 
 concerning it, and be able to say something to it. Wise sayings, as a 
 foolish man delivers them and applies them (in such a manner that one 
 may know he does not rightly understand them), lose their excellency 
 and usefulness: <I>A parable in the mouth of fools</I> ceases to be a 
 parable, and becomes a jest. If a man who lives a wicked life, yet 
 speaks religiously and takes God's covenant into his mouth,

 (1.) He does but shame himself and his profession: As <I>the legs of
 the lame are not equal,</I> by reason of which their going is unseemly, 
 so unseemly is it for a fool to pretend to speak apophthegms, and give 
 advice, and for a man to talk devoutly whose conversation is a constant 
 contradiction to his talk and gives him the lie. His good words raise 
 him up, but then his bad life takes him down, and so his <I>legs are 
 not equal.</I> "A wise saying," (says bishop Patrick) "doth as ill 
 become a fool as dancing doth a cripple; for, as his lameness never so 
 much appears as when he would seem nimble, so the other's folly is 
 never so ridiculous as when he would seem wise." As therefore it is 
 best for a lame man to keep his seat, so it is best for a silly man, or 
 a bad man, to hold his tongue. 

 (2.) He does but do mischief with it to himself and others, as a
 drunkard does with a thorn, or any other sharp thing which he takes in 
 his hand, with which he tears himself and those about him, because he 
 knows not how to manage it. Those that talk well and do not live well, 
 their good words will aggravate their own condemnation and others will 
 be hardened by their inconsistency with themselves. Some give this 
 sense of it: The sharpest saying, by which a sinner, one would think, 
 should be pricked to the heart, makes no more impression upon a fool, 
 no, though it come out of his own mouth, than the scratch of a thorn 
 does upon the hand of a man when he is drunk, who then feels it not nor 
 complains of it,

 Our translation gives this verse a different reading in the text and in 
 the margin; and accordingly it expresses either, 

 1. The equity of a good God. The <I>Master,</I> or <I>Lord</I> (so
 <I>Rab</I> signifies), or, as we read it, <I>The great God that formed 
 all things</I> at first, and still governs them in infinite wisdom, 
 renders to every man according to his work. He <I>rewards the fool,</I> 
 who sinned through ignorance, <I>who knew not his Lord's will, with few 
 stripes;</I> and he <I>rewards the transgressor,</I> who sinned 
 presumptuously and with a high hand, who <I>knew his Lord's will and 
 would not do it, with many stripes.</I> Some understand it of the 
 goodness of God's common providence even to fools and transgressors, on 
 whom <I>he causes his sun to shine</I> and <I>his rain to fall.</I> Or, 
 
 2. The iniquity of a bad prince (so the margin reads it): <I>A great 
 man grieves all, and he hires the fool; he hires also the 
 transgressors.</I> When a wicked man gets power in his hand, by 
 himself, and by the fools and knaves whom he employs under him, whom he 
 hires and chooses to make use of, he grieves all who are under him and 
 is vexatious to them. We should therefore <I>pray for kings and all in 
 authority,</I> that, under them, our lives may be quiet and 
 peaceable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What an abominable thing sin is, and how hateful sometimes it is 
 made to appear, even to the sinner himself. When his conscience is 
 convinced, or he feels smart from his sin, he is sick of it, and vomits 
 it up; he seems then to detest it and to be willing to part with it. It 
 is in itself, and, first or last, will be to the sinner, more loathsome 
 than the vomit of a dog, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:2">Ps. xxxvi. 2</A>.

 2. How apt sinners are to relapse into it notwithstanding. As the dog, 
 after he has gained ease by vomiting that which burdened his stomach, 
 yet goes and licks it up again, so sinners, who have been convinced 
 only and not converted, return to sin again, forgetting how sick it 
 made them. The apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:22">2 Pet. ii. 22</A>)

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? <I>there is</I> more

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A spiritual disease supposed, and that is self-conceit: <I>Seest 
 thou a man?</I> Yes, we see many a one, <I>wise in his own conceit,</I> 
 who has some little sense, but is proud of it, thinks it much more than 
 it is, more than any of his neighbours, have, and enough, so that he 
 needs no more, has such a conceit of his own abilities as makes him 
 opinionative, dogmatical, and censorious; and all the use he makes of 
 his knowledge is that it puffs him up. Or, if by a wise man we 
 understand a religious man, it describes the character of those who, 
 making some show of religion, conclude their spiritual state to be good 
 when really it is very bad, like Laodicea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.

 2. The danger of this disease. It is in a manner desperate: <I>There is 
 more hope of a fool,</I> that knows and owns himself to be such, 
 <I>than of</I> such a one. Solomon was not only a wise man himself, but 
 a teacher of wisdom; and this observation he made upon his pupils, that 
 he found his work most difficult and least successful with those that 
 had a good opinion of themselves and were not sensible that they needed 
 instruction. Therefore he that <I>seems</I> to himself <I>to be
 wise</I> must <I>become a fool, that he may be wise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:18">1 Cor. iii. 18</A>.
 
 There is more hope of a publican than of a proud Pharisee,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:32">Matt. xxi. 32</A>.
 
 Many are hindered from being truly wise and religious by a false and 
 groundless conceit that they are so,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  The slothful <I>man</I> saith, <I>There is</I> a lion in the way; a
 lion <I>is</I> in the streets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When a man talks foolishly we say, He talks idly; for none betray their 
 folly more than those who are idle and go about to excuse themselves in 
 their idleness. As men's folly makes them slothful, so their 
 slothfulness makes them foolish. Observe, 

 1. What <I>the slothful man</I> really dreads. He dreads <I>the way,
 the streets,</I> the place where work is to be done and a journey to be 
 gone; he hates business, hates every thing that requires care and 
 labour. 

 2. What he dreams of, and pretends to dread--<I>a lion in the way.</I> 
 When he is pressed to be diligent, either in his worldly affairs or in 
 the business of religion, this is his excuse (and a sorry excuse it is, 
 as bad as none), <I>There is a lion in the way,</I> some insuperable 
 difficulty or danger which he cannot pretend to grapple with. Lions 
 frequent woods and deserts; and, in the day-time, when man has business 
 to do, they are in their dens, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:22,23">Ps. civ. 22, 23</A>.

 But the sluggard fancies, or rather pretends to fancy, <I>a lion in the
 streets,</I> whereas the lion is only in his own fancy, nor is he so 
 fierce as he is painted. Note, It is a foolish thing to frighten 
 ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  <I>As</I> the door turneth upon his hinges, so <I>doth</I> the
 slothful upon his bed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in 
 love with his ease; he lies in his bed on one side till he is weary of 
 that, and then turns to the other, but still in his bed, when it is far 
 in the day and work is to be done, as the door is moved, but not 
 removed; and so his business is neglected and his opportunities are let 
 slip. See the sluggard's character. 

 1. He is one that does not care to get out of his bed, but seems to be 
 hung upon it, <I>as the door upon the hinges.</I> Bodily ease, too much 
 consulted, is the sad occasion of many a spiritual disease. Those that 
 love sleep will prove in the end to have loved death. 

 2. He does not care to get forward with his business; in that he stirs 
 to and fro a little, but to no purpose; he is where he was. Slothful 
 professors turn, in profession, like <I>the door upon the hinges.</I> 
 The world and the flesh are the two hinges on which they are hung, and 
 though they move in a course of external services, have got into road 
 of duties, and tread around in them like the horse in the mill, yet 
 they get no good, they get no ground, they are never the nearer 
 heaven--sinners unchanged, saints unimproved.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr26_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The slothful hideth his hand in <I>his</I> bosom; it grieveth him
 to bring it again to his mouth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The sluggard has now, with much ado, got out of his bed, but he might 
 as well have lain there still for any thing he is likely to bring to 
 pass in his work, so awkwardly does he go about it. Observe, 

 1. The pretence he makes for his slothfulness: He <I>hides his hand in 
 his bosom</I> for fear of cold; next to his warm bed in his warm bosom. 
 Or he pretends that he is lame, as some do that make a trade of 
 begging; something ails his hand; he would have it thought that it is 
 blistered with yesterday's hard work. Or it intimates, in general, his 
 aversion to business; he has tried, and his hands are not used to 
 labour, and therefore he hugs himself in his own ease and cares for 
 nobody. Note, It is common for those that will not do their duty to 
 pretend they cannot. <I>I cannot dig,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:3">Luke xvi. 3</A>.

 2. The prejudice he sustains by his slothfulness. He himself is the 
 loser by it, for he starves himself: <I>It grieves him to bring his 
 hand to his mouth,</I> that is, he cannot find in his heart to feed 
 himself, but dreads, as if it were a mighty toil, to lift his hand to 
 his head. It is an elegant hyperbole, aggravating his sin, that he 
 cannot endure to take the least pains, no, not for the greatest profit, 
 and showing how his sin is his punishment. Those that are slothful in 
 the business of religion will not be at the pains to feed their own 
 souls with the word of God, the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised 
 blessings by prayer, though they might have them for the fetching.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr26_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  The sluggard <I>is</I> wiser in his own conceit than seven men
 that can render a reason.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The high opinion which the sluggard has of himself, notwithstanding 
 the gross absurdity and folly of his slothfulness: He thinks himself 
 <I>wiser than seven men,</I> than seven wise men, for they are such as 
 <I>can render a reason.</I> It is the wisdom of a man to be able to 
 <I>render a reason,</I> of a good man to be able to give <I>a reason of 
 the hope that is in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet. iii. 15</A>.

 What we do we should be able to <I>render a reason</I> for, though
 perhaps we may not have wit enough to show the fallacy of every 
 objection against it. He that takes pains in religion can render a good 
 reason for it; he knows that he is working for a good Master and that 
 <I>his labour shall not be in vain.</I> But <I>the sluggard</I> thinks 
 himself <I>wiser than seven</I> such; for let seven such persuade him 
 to be diligent, with all the reasons they can render for it, it is to 
 no purpose; his own determination, he thinks, answer enough to them and 
 all their reasons.

 2. The reference that this has to his slothfulness. It is <I>the 
 sluggard,</I> above all men, that is thus self-conceited; for, 

 (1.) His good opinion of himself is the cause of his slothfulness; he 
 will not take pains to get wisdom because he thinks he is wise enough 
 already. A conceit of the sufficiency of our attainments is a great 
 enemy to our improvement. 

 (2.) His slothfulness is the cause of his good opinion of himself. If
 he would but take pains to examine himself, and compare himself with 
 the laws of wisdom, he would have other thoughts of himself. Indulged 
 slothfulness is at the bottom of prevailing self-conceitedness. Nay, 
 
 (3.) So wretchedly besotted is he that he takes his slothfulness to be
 his wisdom; he thinks it is his wisdom to make much of himself, and 
 take all the ease he can get, and do no more in religion than he needs 
 must, to avoid suffering, to sit still and see what other people do, 
 that he may have the pleasure of finding fault with them. Of such 
 sluggards, who are proud of that which is their shame, their is little 
 hope,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  He that passeth by, <I>and</I> meddleth with strife <I>belonging</I>

 1. That which is here condemned is <I>meddling with strife that belongs
 not to us.</I> If we must not be hasty to strive in our own cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:8"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 8</A>),

 much less in other people's, especially theirs that we are no way
 related to or concerned in, but light on accidentally as we pass by. If 
 we can be instrumental to make peace between those that are at variance 
 we must do it, though we should thereby get the ill-will of both sides, 
 at least while they are in their heat; but to make ourselves busy in 
 other men's matters, and parties in other men's quarrels, is not only 
 to court our own trouble, but to thrust ourselves into temptation. 
 <I>Who made</I> me <I>a judge?</I> Let them end it, as they began it, 
 between themselves. 

 2. We are cautioned against it because of the danger it exposes us to;
 it is like taking a snarling cur <I>by the ears,</I> that will snap at 
 you and bite you; you had better have let him alone, for you cannot get 
 clear of him when you would, and must thank yourselves if you come off 
 with a wound and dishonour. He that has got <I>a dog by the ears,</I> 
 if he lets him go he flies at him, if he keeps his hold, he has his 
 hands full, and can do nothing else. Let every one <I>with quietness 
 work and mind his own business,</I> and not with unquietness quarrel 
 and meddle with other people's business.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  As a mad <I>man</I> who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
 &nbsp; 19  So <I>is</I> the man <I>that</I> deceiveth his neighbour, and saith,
 Am not I in sport?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How mischievous those are that make no scruple of <I>deceiving their 
 neighbours;</I> they are <I>as madmen that cast firebrands, arrows, and 
 death,</I> so much hurt may they do by their deceits. They value 
 themselves upon it as polite cunning men, but really they are <I>as 
 madmen.</I> There is not a greater madness in the world than a wilful 
 sin. It is not only the passionate furious man, but the malicious 
 deceitful man, that is <I>a madman;</I> he does in effect <I>cast 
 fire-brands, arrows, and death;</I> he does more mischief than he can 
 imagine. Fraud and falsehood burn like fire-brands, kill, even at a 
 distance, like arrows. 

 2. See how frivolous the excuse is which men commonly make for the
 mischief they do, that they did it in a jest; with this they think to 
 turn it off when they are reproved for it, <I>Am not I in sport?</I> 
 But it will prove dangerous playing with fire and jesting with 
 edge-tools. Not that those are to be commended who are captious, and 
 can take no jest (those that themselves are <I>wise must suffer 
 fools,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:19,20">2 Cor. xi. 19, 20</A>),

 but those are certainly to be condemned who are any way abusive to
 their neighbours, impose upon their credulity, cheat them in their 
 bargains with them, tell lies to them or tell lies of them, give them 
 ill language, or sully their reputation, and then think to excuse it by 
 saying that they did but jest. <I>Am not I in sport?</I> He that sins 
 in jest must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. Truth is
 too valuable a thing to be sold for a jest, and so is the reputation of 
 our neighbour. By lying and slandering in jest men learn themselves, 
 and teach others, to lie and slander in earnest; and a false report, 
 raised in mirth, may be spread in malice; besides, if a man may tell a 
 lie to make himself merry, why not to make himself rich, and so 
 <I>truth quite perishes,</I> and men <I>teach their tongues to tell 
 lies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:5">Jer. ix. 5</A>.

 If men would consider that a lie comes from the devil, and brings to
 hell-fire, surely that would spoil the sport of it; it is <I>casting 
 arrows and death</I> to themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Where no wood is, <I>there</I> the fire goeth out: so where
 <I>there is</I> no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
 &nbsp; 21  <I>As</I> coals <I>are</I> to burning coals, and wood to fire; so <I>is</I>
 a contentious man to kindle strife.
 &nbsp; 22  The words of a talebearer <I>are</I> as wounds, and they go down
 into the innermost parts of the belly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Contention is as a fire; it heats the spirit, burns up all that is 
 good, and puts families and societies into a flame. Now here we are 
 told how that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning, that we may 
 avoid the occasions of strife and so prevent the mischievous 
 consequences of it. If then we would keep the peace, 

 1. We must not give ear to <I>talebearers,</I> for they feed the fire
 of contention with fuel; nay, they spread it with combustible matter; 
 the tales they carry are fireballs. Those who by insinuating base 
 characters, revealing secrets, and misrepresenting words and actions, 
 do what they can to make relations, friends, and neighbours, jealous 
 one of another, to alienate them one from another, and sow discord 
 among them, are to be banished out of families and all societies, and 
 then strife will as surely cease as the fire will go out when it has no 
 fuel; the contenders will better understand one another and come to a 
 better temper; old stories will soon be forgotten when there are no new 
 ones told to keep up the remembrance of them, and both sides will see 
 how they have been imposed upon by a common enemy. Whisperers and 
 backbiters are incendiaries not to be suffered. To illustrate this, he 
 repeats 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 
 what he had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:8"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 8</A>),

 that <I>the words of a tale-bearer are as wounds,</I> deep and
 dangerous wounds, wounds in the vitals. They wound the reputation of 
 him who is belied, and perhaps the wound proves incurable, and even the 
 plaster of a recantation (which yet can seldom be obtained) may not 
 prove wide enough for it. They wound the love and charity which he to 
 whom they are spoken ought to have for his neighbour and give a fatal 
 stab to friendship and Christian fellowship. We must therefore not only 
 not be tale-bearers ourselves at any time, nor ever do any ill offices, 
 but we should not give the least countenance to those that are. 

 2. We must not associate with peevish passionate people, that are
 exceptions, and apt to put the worst constructions upon everything, 
 that pick quarrels upon the least occasion, and are quick, and high, 
 and hot, in resenting affronts. These are <I>contentious men,</I> that 
 <I>kindle strife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The less we have to do with such the better, for it will be very
 difficult to avoid quarrelling with those that are quarrelsome.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Burning lips and a wicked heart <I>are like</I> a potsherd
 covered with silver dross.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This may be meant either, 

 1. Of <I>a wicked heart</I> showing itself in <I>burning lips,</I> 
 furious, passionate, outrageous words, burning in malice, and 
 persecuting those to whom, or of whom, they are spoken; ill words and 
 ill-will agree as well together as <I>a potsherd</I> and the <I>dross 
 of silver,</I> which, now that the pot is broken and the dross 
 separated from the silver, are fit to be thrown together to the 
 dunghill. 

 2. Or of <I>a wicked heart</I> disguising itself with <I>burning
 lips,</I> burning with the professions of love and friendship, and even 
 persecuting a man with flatteries; this is <I>like a potsherd covered 
 with</I> the scum or <I>dross of silver,</I> with which one that is 
 weak may be imposed upon, as if it were of some value, but a wise man 
 is soon aware of the cheat. This sense agrees with the following 
 verses.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up
 deceit within him;
 &nbsp; 25  When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for <I>there are</I>
 seven abominations in his heart.
 &nbsp; 26  <I>Whose</I> hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
 shewed before the <I>whole</I> congregation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is cause to complain, not only of the want of sincerity in men's 
 profession of friendship, and that they do not love so well as they 
 pretend nor will serve their friends so much as they promise, but, 
 which is much worse, of wicked designs in the profession of friendship, 
 and the making of it subservient to the most malicious intentions. This 
 is here spoken of as a common thing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He that hates</I> his neighbour, and is contriving to do him a
 mischief, yet <I>dissembles with his lips,</I> professes to have a 
 respect for him and to be ready to serve him, talks kindly with him, as 
 Cain with Abel, asks, <I>Art thou in health, my brother?</I> as Joab to 
 Amasa, that his malice may not be suspected and guarded against, and so 
 he may have the fairer opportunity to execute the purposes of it, this 
 man <I>lays up deceit within him,</I> that is, he keeps in his mind the 
 mischief he intends to do his neighbour till he catches him at an 
 advantage. This is malice which has no less of the subtlety than it has 
 of the venom of the old serpent in it. Now, as to this matter, we are 
 here cautioned,

 1. Not to be so foolish as to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by 
 the pretensions of friendship. Remember to distrust when a man 
 <I>speaks fair;</I> be not too forward to <I>believe him</I> unless you 
 know him well, for it is possible there may be <I>seven abominations in 
 his heart,</I> a great many projects of mischief against you, which he 
 is labouring so industriously to conceal with his fair speech. Satan is 
 an enemy that hates us, and yet in his temptations speaks fair, as he 
 did to Eve, but it is madness to give credit to him, <I>for there are 
 seven abominations in his heart; seven other spirits</I> does one 
 unclean spirit bring <I>more wicked than himself.</I> 

 2. Not to be so wicked as to impose upon any with a profession of
 friendship; for, though the fraud may be carried on plausibly awhile, 
 it will be brought to light, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He <I>whose hatred is covered by deceit</I> will one time or other be
 discovered, and <I>his wickedness shown,</I> to his shame and 
 confusion, <I>before the whole congregation;</I> and nothing will do 
 more to make a man odious to all companies. Love (says one) is the best 
 armour, but the worst cloak, and will serve dissemblers as the disguise 
 which Ahab put on and perished in.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth
 a stone, it will return upon him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What pains men take to do mischief to others. As they put a force 
 upon themselves by concealing their design with a profession of 
 friendship, so they put themselves to a great deal of labour to bring 
 it about; it is <I>digging a pit,</I> it is <I>rolling a stone,</I> 
 hard work, and yet men will not stick at it to gratify their passion 
 and revenge. 

 2. What preparation they hereby make of mischief to themselves. Their
 violent dealing will return upon their own heads; they shall themselves 
 <I>fall into the pit they digged,</I> and the stone they rolled <I>will 
 return upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15,16,9:15,16">Ps. vii. 15, 16; ix. 15, 16</A>.

 The righteous God will take the wise, not only <I>in their own
 craftiness,</I> but in their own cruelty. It is the plotter's doom.
 Haman is hanged on a gallows of his own preparing.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  A lying tongue hateth <I>those that are</I> afflicted by it; and
 a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are two sorts of lies equally detestable:--

 1. A slandering lie, which avowedly hates those it is spoken of: <I>A
 lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it;</I> it afflicts them 
 by calumnies and reproaches because it hates them, and can thus smite 
 them secretly where they are without defence; and it hates them because 
 it has afflicted them and made them its enemies. The mischief of this 
 is open and obvious; it afflicts, it hates, and owns it, and every body 
 sees it. 

 2. A flattering lie, which secretly works the ruin of those it is
 spoken to. In the former the mischief is plain, and men guard against 
 it as well as they can, but in this it is little suspected, and men 
 betray themselves by being credulous of their own praises and the 
 compliments that are passed upon them. A wise man therefore will be
 more afraid of a flatterer that kisses and kills than of a slanderer
 that proclaims war.</P>
