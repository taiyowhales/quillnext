 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Christ's gracious acceptance of the invitation which his church had
 given him, and the kind visit which he made to her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The account which the spouse gives of her own folly, in putting a
 slight upon her beloved, and the distress she was in by reason of his 
 withdrawings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>.

 III. The enquiry of the daughters of Jerusalem concerning the amiable
 perfections of her beloved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:9">ver. 9</A>),

 and her particular answer to that enquiry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I am come into my garden, my sister, <I>my</I> spouse: I have
 gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with
 my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends;
 drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These words are Christ's answer to the church's prayer in the close of 
 the foregoing chapter, <I>Let my beloved come into his garden;</I> here 
 he has come, and lets her know it. See how ready God is to hear prayer, 
 how ready Christ is to accept the invitations that his people give him, 
 though we are backward to hear his calls and accept his invitations. He 
 is free in condescending to us, while we are shy of ascending to him. 
 Observe how the return answered the request, and outdid it. 

 1. She called him <I>her beloved</I> (and really he was so), and
 invited him because she loved him; in return to this, he called her his 
 <I>sister and spouse,</I> as several times before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1-16"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>

 Those that make Christ their best beloved shall be owned by him in the
 nearest and dearest relations. 

 2. She called the garden <I>his,</I> and the pleasant fruits of it 
 <I>his,</I> and he acknowledges them to be so: It is <I>my garden,</I> 
 it is <I>my spice.</I> When God was displeased with Israel he turned 
 them off to Moses (They are <I>thy people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7">Exod. xxxii. 7</A>);

 and he called the appointed feasts of the Lord <I>their appointed
 feasts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:14">Isa. i. 14</A>);

 but now that they are in his favour he owns them for his garden.
 "Though of small account, yet it is mine." Those that are in sincerity 
 give up themselves and all they have and can do to Jesus Christ, he 
 will do them the honour to stamp them, and what they have and do for 
 him, with his own mark, and say, <I>It is mine.</I>

 3. She invited him to <I>come into his garden,</I> and he says, <I>I
 have come.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:9">Isa. lviii. 9</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am.</I> When Solomon prayed 
 that God would come and take possession of the house he had built for
 him, he did come; <I>his glory filled the house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:2">2 Chron. vii. 2</A>),

 and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 he let him know that he had chosen and sanctified this house, that his 
 <I>name might be there for ever.</I> Those that throw open the door of 
 their souls to Jesus Christ shall find him ready to come in to them; 
 and in every place where he records his name he will meet his people, 
 and bless them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24">Exod. xx. 24</A>.

 4. She desired him to <I>eat his pleasant fruits,</I> to accept of the
 sacrifices offered in his temple, which were as the fruits of his 
 garden, and he does so, but finds they are not gathered and ready for 
 eating, therefore he does himself gather them. As the fruits are his, 
 so is the preparation of them; he finds his heart unready for his 
 entertainment, but does himself draw out into exercise those gracious 
 habits which he had planted there. What little good there is in us 
 would be shed and lost if he did not gather it, and preserve it to 
 himself. 

 5. She only desired him to <I>eat the fruits</I> of the garden, but he
 brought along with him something more, <I>honey,</I> and <I>wine,</I> 
 and <I>milk,</I> which yield substantial nourishment, and which were 
 the products of Canaan, Immanuel's land. Christ delights himself 
 greatly in that which he has both conferred upon his people and wrought 
 in them. Or we may suppose this to have been prepared by the spouse
 herself, as Esther prepared for the king her husband <I>a banquet of 
 wine;</I> it is but plain fare, and what is natural, honey and milk, 
 but, being kindly designed, it is kindly accepted; imperfections are 
 overlooked; the honey-comb is eaten with the honey, and the weakness of 
 the flesh passed by and pardoned, because the <I>spirit is willing.</I> 
 When Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection he did eat 
 with them a piece of a honey-comb 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:42,43">Luke xxiv. 42, 43</A>),

 in which this scripture was fulfilled. He did not drink the wine only,
 which is liquor for men, for great men, but the milk too, which is 
 liquor for children, little children, for he was to be the <I>holy 
 child Jesus,</I> that had need of milk.

 6. She only invited him to come himself, but he, bringing his own 
 entertainment along with him, brings his friends too, and invites them 
 to share in the provisions. <I>The more the merrier,</I> we say; and
 here, where there was so great a plenty, there was not the worse fare. 
 When our Lord Jesus fed 5000 at once <I>they did all eat and were 
 filled.</I> Christ invites all his friends to the <I>wine and milk</I> 
 which he himself drinks of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>),

 to the <I>feast of fat things</I> and <I>wines on the lees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>.

 The great work of man's redemption, and the riches of the covenant of
 grace, are a feast to the Lord Jesus and they ought to be so to us. The 
 invitation is very free, and hearty, and loving: <I>Eat, O friends!</I> 
 If Christ comes to sup with us, it is we that sup with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 <I>Eat, O friends!</I> Those only that are Christ's friends are welcome
 to his table; his enemies, <I>that will not have him to reign over 
 them,</I> have <I>no part nor lot in the matter. Drink, yea, drink
 abundantly.</I> Christ, in his gospel, has made plentiful provision for 
 poor souls. <I>He fills the hungry with good things;</I> there is 
 enough for all, there is enough for each; <I>we are not straitened in 
 him</I> or in his grace, let us not therefore be straitened in our own 
 bosoms. <I>Open the mouth widely, and Christ will fill it. Be not drunk 
 with wine,</I> but <I>be filled with the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18">Eph. v. 18</A>.

 Those that entertain Christ must bid his friends welcome with him;
 Jesus and his disciples were called together to the marriage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:2">John ii. 2</A>),

 and Christ will have all his friends to rejoice with him in the day of
 his espousals to his church, and, in token of that, to feast with him. 
 In spiritual and heavenly joys there is no danger of exceeding; there 
 we may <I>drink abundantly, drink of the river of God's pleasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:8">Ps. xxxvi. 8</A>),

 and be <I>abundantly satisfied,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:4">Ps. lxv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  I sleep, but my heart waketh: <I>it is</I> the voice of my beloved
 that knocketh, <I>saying,</I> Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove,
 my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, <I>and</I> my locks with
 the drops of the night.
 &nbsp; 3  I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
 my feet; how shall I defile them?
 &nbsp; 4  My beloved put in his hand by the hole <I>of the door,</I> and my
 bowels were moved for him.
 &nbsp; 5  I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped <I>with</I>
 myrrh, and my fingers <I>with</I> sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
 handles of the lock.
 &nbsp; 6  I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
 <I>and</I> was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I
 could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
 &nbsp; 7  The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote
 me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
 from me.
 &nbsp; 8  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my
 beloved, that ye tell him, that I <I>am</I> sick of love.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this song of loves and joys we have here a very melancholy scene; 
 the spouse here speaks, not to her beloved (as before, for he has 
 withdrawn), but of him, and it is a sad story she tells of her own 
 folly and ill conduct towards him, notwithstanding his kindness, and of 
 the just rebukes she fell under for it. Perhaps it may refer to 
 Solomon's own apostasy from God, and the sad effects of that apostasy 
 after God had come into his garden, had taken possession of the temple 
 he had built, and he had feasted with God upon the sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 
 however, it is applicable to the too common case both of the churches
 and particular believers, who by their carelessness and security 
 provoke Christ to withdraw from them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The indisposition that the spouse was under, and the listlessness 
 that had seized her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I sleep, but my heart wakes.</I> Here is,

 1. Corruption appearing in the actings of it: <I>I sleep.</I> The wise
 virgins slumbered. She <I>was on her bed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>),

 but now she sleeps. Spiritual distempers, if not striven against at
 first, are apt to grow upon us and to get ground. <I>She slept,</I> 
 that is, pious affections cooled, she neglected her duty and grew 
 remiss in it, she indulged herself in her ease, was secure and off her 
 watch. This is sometimes the bad effect of more than ordinary 
 enlargements--a good cause. St. Paul himself was in danger of being 
 puffed up with abundant revelations, and of saying, <I>Soul, take thy 
 ease,</I> which made a <I>thorn in the flesh</I> necessary for him, to 
 keep him from sleeping. Christ's disciples, when he had come into his
 garden, the garden of his agony, were heavy with sleep, and could not 
 watch with him. True Christians are not always alike lively and 
 vigorous in religion. 

 2. Grace remaining, notwithstanding, in the habit of it: "<I>My heart
 wakes;</I> my own conscience reproaches me for it, and ceases not to 
 rouse me out of my sluggishness. <I>The spirit is willing,</I> and, 
 <I>after the inner man, I delight in the law of God,</I> and <I>with my 
 mind I serve that.</I> I am, for the present, overpowered by 
 temptation, but all does not go one way in me. I sleep, but it is not
 a dead sleep; I strive against it; it is not a sound sleep; I cannot be 
 easy under this indisposition." Note,

 (1.) We ought to take notice of our own spiritual slumbers and 
 distempers, and to reflect upon it with sorrow and shame that we have 
 fallen asleep when Christ has been nigh us in his garden. 

 (2.) When we are lamenting what is amiss in us, we must not overlook 
 the good that is wrought in us, and preserved alive: "My heart wakes in 
 Christ, who is dear to me as my own heart, and is my life; when I 
 sleep, <I>he neither slumbers nor sleeps.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The call that Christ gave to her, when she was under this 
 indisposition: <I>It is the voice of my beloved;</I> she knew it to be 
 so, and was soon aware of it, which was a sign that her heart was 
 awake. Like the child Samuel, she heard at the first call, but did not, 
 like him, mistake the person; she knew it to be the voice of Christ. He 
 knocks, to awaken us to come and let him in, knocks by his word and 
 Spirit, knocks by afflictions and by our own consciences; though this 
 is not expressly quoted, yet probably it is referred to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>),
 
 <I>Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.</I> He calls sinners into
 covenant with him and saints into communion with him. Those whom he 
 loves he will not let alone in their carelessness, but will find some 
 way or other to awaken them, to rebuke and chasten them. When we are 
 unmindful of Christ he thinks of us, and provides that our faith fail 
 not. Peter denied Christ, but the Lord turned and looked upon him, and 
 so brought him to himself again. Observe how moving the call is: 
 <I>Open to me, my sister, my love.</I> 

 1. He sues for entrance who may demand it; he knocks who could easily
 knock the door down. 

 2. He gives her all the kind and most endearing titles imaginable: 
 <I>My sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;</I> he not only gives her 
 no hard names, nor upbraids her with unkindness in not sitting up for 
 him, but, on the contrary, studies how to express his tender affection 
 to her still. <I>His loving-kindness he will not utterly take
 away.</I> Those that by faith are espoused to Christ he looks upon as 
 his sisters, his loves, his doves, and all that is dear; and, being 
 clothed with his righteousness, they are undefiled. This consideration 
 should induce her to open to him. Christ's love to us should engage 
 ours to him, even in the most self-denying instances. <I>Open to
 me.</I> Can we deny entrance to such a friend, to such a guest? Shall 
 we not converse more with one that is infinitely worthy of our 
 acquaintance, and so affectionately desirous of it, though we only can 
 be gainers by it? 

 3. He pleads distress, and begs to be admitted <I>sub form&acirc;
 pauperis--under the character of a poor traveller</I> that wants a
 lodging: "<I>My head is wet with the dew,</I> with the cold drops of 
 the night; consider what hardships I have undergone, to merit thee, 
 which surely may merit from thee so small a kindness as this." When 
 Christ was crowned with thorns, which no doubt fetched blood from his 
 blessed head, then was his head <I>wet with the dew.</I> "Consider what 
 a grief it is to me to be thus unkindly used, as much as it would be to 
 a tender husband to be kept out of doors by his wife in a rainy stormy 
 night." Do we thus require him for his love? The slights which careless 
 souls put upon Jesus Christ are to him as a <I>continual dropping in a
 very rainy day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The excuse she made to put off her compliance with this call 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on again?</I> She is half 
 asleep; she knows the voice of her beloved; she knows his knock, but 
 cannot find in her heart to open to him. She was undressed, and would 
 not be at the pains to dress herself again; she had <I>washed her 
 feet,</I> and would not have occasion to wash them again. She could not 
 send another to open the door (it must be our own act and deed to let 
 Christ into our hearts), and yet she was loth to go herself; she did 
 not say, <I>I will not open,</I> but, <I>How shall I?</I> Note, 
 Frivolous excuses are the language of prevailing slothfulness in 
 religion; Christ calls to us to open to him, but we pretend we have no 
 mind, or we have no strength, or we have no time, and therefore think 
 we may be excused, as the <I>sluggard</I> that <I>will not plough by 
 reason of cold.</I> And those who ought to <I>watch for the Lord's 
 coming</I> with their <I>loins girt,</I> if they ungird themselves and 
 put off their coat, will find it difficult to recover their former 
 resolution and to put it on again; it is best therefore to keep tight.
 Making excuses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:18">Luke xiv. 18</A>)
 
 is interpreted making light of Christ
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:5">Matt. xxii. 5</A>),

 and so it is. Those put a great contempt upon Christ that cannot find
 in their hearts to bear a cold blast for him, or get out of a warm 
 bed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The powerful influences of divine grace, by which she was made 
 willing to rise and open to her beloved. When he could not prevail with 
 her by persuasion he <I>put in his hand by the hole in the door,</I> to 
 unbolt it, as one weary of waiting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This intimates a work of the Spirit upon her soul, by which she was 
 unwilling made willing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 The conversion of Lydia is represented by the <I>opening of her
 heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:14">Acts xvi. 14</A>)

 and Christ is said to open his disciples' understandings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:45">Luke xxiv. 45</A>.
 
 He that <I>formed the spirit of man within him</I> knows all the
 avenues to it, and which way to enter into it; he can find the <I>hole 
 of the door</I> at which to put in his hand for the conquering of 
 prejudices and the introducing of his own doctrine and law. He has the 
 <I>key of David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Rev. iii. 7</A>),

 with which he opens the door of the heart in such a way as is suited to
 it, as the key is fitted to the wards of the lock, in such a way as not 
 to put a force upon its nature, but only upon its ill nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Her compliance with these methods of divine grace at last: <I>My 
 bowels were moved for him.</I> The will was gained by a good work 
 wrought upon the affections: <I>My bowels were moved for him,</I> as 
 those of the two disciples were when Christ made their <I>hearts to 
 burn within them.</I> She was moved with compassion to her beloved, 
 because his <I>head was wet with dew.</I> Note, Tenderness of spirit, 
 and a heart of flesh, prepare the soul for the reception of Christ into 
 it; and therefore his love to us is represented in such a way as is 
 most affecting. Did Christ redeem us in his pity? Let us in pity 
 receive him, and, for his sake, those that are his, when at any time 
 they are in distress. This good work, wrought upon her affections, 
 raised her up, and made her ashamed of her dulness and slothfulness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 <I>I rose up, to open to my beloved</I>), his grace inclining her to do 
 it and conquering the opposition of unbelief. It was her own act, and 
 yet he wrought it in her. And now her <I>hands dropped with myrrh upon 
 the handles of the lock.</I> Either,

 1. She found it there when she applied her hand to the lock, to shoot
 it back; he that <I>put in his hand by the hole of the door</I> left it 
 there as an evidence that he had been there. When Christ has wrought 
 powerfully upon a soul he leaves a blessed sweetness in it, which is 
 very delightful to it. With this he oiled the lock, to make it go easy. 
 Note, When we apply ourselves to our duty, in the lively exercises of 
 faith, under the influence of divine grace, we shall find it will go on 
 much more readily and sweetly than we expected. If we will but rise up, 
 to open to Christ, we shall find the difficulty we apprehended in it 
 strangely overcome, and shall say with Daniel, <I>Now let my Lord 
 speak, for thou hast strengthened me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:19">Dan. x. 19</A>.
 
 Or,

 2. She brought it thither. Her <I>bowels being moved for her
 beloved,</I> who had stood so long in the cold and wet, when she came 
 to open to him she prepared to anoint his head, and so to refresh and 
 comfort him, and perhaps to prevent his catching cold; she was in such 
 haste to meet him that she would not stay to make the usual 
 preparation, but dipped her hand in her box of ointment, that she might 
 readily anoint his head at his first coming in. Those that open the 
 doors of their hearts to Christ, those <I>everlasting doors,</I> must 
 meet him with the lively exercises of faith and other graces, and with 
 these must anoint him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Her sad disappointment when she did open to her beloved. And here
 is the most melancholy part of the story: <I>I opened to my 
 beloved,</I> as I intended, but, alas! <I>my beloved had withdrawn 
 himself, and was gone. My beloved was gone, was gone,</I> so the word 
 is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She did not open to him at his first knock, and now she came too 
 late, when afterwards she <I>would have inherited this blessing.</I> 
 Christ will be sought while he may be found; if we slip our time, we 
 may lose our passage. Note, 

 (1.) Christ justly rebukes our delays with his denials, and suspends 
 the communications of comfort from those that are remiss and drowsy in 
 their duty. 

 (2.) Christ's departures are matter of great grief and lamentation to 
 believers. The royal psalmist never complains of any thing with such 
 sorrowful accents as God's <I>hiding his face</I> from him, and 
 <I>casting him off,</I> and <I>forsaking him.</I> The spouse here is 
 ready to tear her hair, and rend her clothes, and wring her hands, 
 crying, <I>He is gone, he is gone;</I> and that which cuts her to the 
 heart is that she may thank herself, she provoked him to withdraw. If 
 Christ departs, it is because he takes something unkindly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now observe what she does, in this case, and what befel her. 

 (1.) She still calls him her <I>beloved,</I> being resolved, how cloudy 
 and dark soever the day be, she will not quit her relation to him and 
 interest in him. It is a weakness, upon every apprehension either of 
 our own failings or of God's withdrawings, to conclude hardly as to our 
 spiritual state. Every desertion is not despair. I will say, <I>Lord, I 
 believe,</I> though I must say, <I>Lord, help my unbelief.</I> Though 
 he leave me, I love him; he is mine. 

 (2.) She now remembers the words he said to her when he called her, and 
 what impressions they made upon her, reproaching herself for her folly 
 in not complying sooner with her convictions: "<I>My soul failed when 
 he spoke;</I> his words melted me when he said, <I>My head is wet with 
 dew;</I> and yet, wretch that I was, I lay still, and made excuses, and 
 did not open to him." The smothering and stifling of our convictions is 
 a thing that will be very bitter in the reflection, when God opens our 
 eyes. Sometimes the word has not its effect immediately upon the heart, 
 but it melts it afterwards, upon second thoughts. <I>My soul</I> now 
 <I>melted because of his words</I> which he had spoken before. 

 (3.) She did not go to bed again, but went in pursuit of him: <I>I 
 sought him; I called him.</I> She might have saved herself this labour 
 if she would but have bestirred herself when he first called; but we 
 cut ourselves out a great deal of work, and create ourselves a great 
 deal of trouble, by our own slothfulness and carelessness in improving 
 our opportunities. Yet it is her praise that, when her beloved has
 withdrawn, she continues seeking him; her desires toward him are made 
 more strong, and her enquiries after him more solicitous, by his 
 withdrawings. She calls him by prayer, calls after him, and begs of him 
 to return; and she not only prays but uses means, she seeks him in the 
 ways wherein she used to find him. 

 (4.) Yet still she missed of him: <I>I could not find him; he gave me 
 no answer.</I> She had no evidence of his favour, no sensible comforts, 
 but was altogether in the dark, and in doubt concerning his love 
 towards her. Note, There are those who have a true love for Christ, and 
 yet have not immediate answers to their prayers for his smiles; but he 
 gives them an equivalent if he strengthens them with the strength in 
 their souls to continue seeking him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3">Ps. cxxxviii. 3</A>.

 St. Paul could not prevail for the removing of the <I>thorn in the
 flesh,</I> but was answered with grace sufficient for him.

 (5.) She was ill-treated by the watchmen; <I>They found me; they smote 
 me; they wounded me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They took her for a lewd woman (because she went about the streets at 
 that time of night, when they were walking their rounds), and beat her 
 accordingly. Disconsolate saints are taken for sinners, and are 
 censured and reproached as such. Thus Hannah, when she was praying in
 the <I>bitterness of her soul,</I> was wounded and smitten by Eli, one 
 of the prime watchmen, when he said to her, <I>How long wilt thou be 
 drunken?</I> so counting her a daughter of Belial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:14,15">1 Sam. i. 14, 15</A>.

 It is no new thing for those that are of the loyal loving subjects of
 Zion's King to be misrepresented by the watchmen of Zion, as enemies or 
 scandals to his kingdom; they could not abuse and persecute them but by 
 putting them into an ill name. Some apply it to those ministers who, 
 though watchmen by office, yet misapply the word to awakened 
 consciences, and through unskillfulness, or contempt of their griefs, 
 add affliction to the afflicted, and <I>make the hearts of the 
 righteous sad whom God would not have made sad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:22">Ezek. xiii. 22</A>),
 
 discouraging those who ought to be encouraged and talking to the grief
 of those <I>whom God has wounded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:26">Ps. lix. 26</A>.

 Those watchmen were bad enough that could not, or would not, assist the
 spouse in her enquiries after her beloved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3"><I>ch.</I> iii. 3</A>);

 but these were much worse, that hindered her with their severe and
 uncharitable censures, <I>smote her</I> and <I>wounded her</I> with 
 their reproaches, and though they were the <I>keepers of the wall of 
 Jerusalem,</I> as if they had been the breakers of it, <I>took away her 
 veil,</I> from her rudely and barbarously, as if it had been only a 
 pretence of modesty, but a cover of the contrary. Those whose outward 
 appearances are all good, and who yet are invidiously condemned and run 
 down as hypocrites, have reason to complain, as the spouse here, of the 
 <I>taking away of their veil</I> from them. 

 (6.) When she was disabled by the abuses the watchmen gave her to 
 prosecute her enquiry herself she gave charge to those about her to 
 assist her in the enquiry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem!</I> all my friends and 
 acquaintance, <I>if you find my beloved,</I> it may be you may meet 
 with him before I shall, <I>what shall you tell him?</I> so some read.
 "Speak a good word for me; tell him that <I>I am sick of love.</I>" 
 Observe here,

 [1.] What her condition was. She loved Jesus Christ to such a degree 
 that his absence made her sick, extremely sick, she could not bear it, 
 and she was in pain for his return as a woman in travail, as Ahab for 
 Naboth's vineyard, which he so passionately coveted. This is a sickness 
 which is a sign of a healthy constitution of soul, and will certainly 
 end well, a sickness that will not be death, but life. It is better to 
 be sick of love to Christ than at ease in love to the world. 

 (2.) What course she took in this condition. She did not sink into 
 despair, and conclude that she should die of her disease, but she sent 
 after her beloved; she asked the advice of her neighbours, and begged 
 their prayers for her, that they would intercede with him on her 
 behalf. "Tell him, though I was careless, and foolish, and slothful,
 and rose not up so soon as I should have done to open to him, yet I 
 love him; he <I>knows all things,</I> he <I>knows that I do.</I> 
 Represent me to him as sincere, though in many instances coming short 
 of my duty; nay, represent me to him as sincere, though in many 
 instances coming short of my duty; nay, represent me as an object of 
 his pity, that he may have compassion on me and help me." She does not 
 bid them tell him how the watchmen had abused her; how unrighteous 
 soever they were in it, she acknowledges that <I>the Lord is 
 righteous,</I> and therefore bears it patiently. "But tell him that I 
 am wounded with love to him." Gracious souls are more sensible of 
 Christ's withdrawings than of any other trouble whatsoever.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The question which the daughters of Jerusalem put to the spouse 
 concerning her beloved, in answer to the charge she had given them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. The respectful title they give to the spouse: <I>O thou fairest 
 among women!</I> Our Lord Jesus makes his spouse truly amiable, not 
 only in his eyes, but in the eyes of all the daughters of Jerusalem. 
 The church is the most excellent society in the world, the communion of 
 saints the best communion, and the beauty of the sanctuary a 
 transcendent beauty. The saints are the most excellent people; holiness 
 is the symmetry of the soul; it is its agreement with itself; it 
 recommends itself to all that are competent judges of it. Even those 
 that have little acquaintance with Christ, as those daughters of 
 Jerusalem here, cannot but see an amiable beauty in those that bear his 
 image, which we should love wherever we see it, though in different 
 dresses. 

 2. Their enquiry concerning her beloved: "<I>What is thy beloved more 
 than another beloved?</I> If thou wilt have us to find him for thee, 
 give us his marks, that we may know him when we see him."

 (1.) Some take it for a scornful question, blaming her for making such 
 ado about him: "Why shouldst thou be so passionate in enquiring after 
 thy beloved, more than others are after theirs? Why shouldst thou be so 
 set upon him, more than others that yet have a kindness for him?" Those 
 that are zealous in religion are men wondered at by such as are 
 indifferent to it. The many careless ones laugh at the few that are 
 solicitous and serious. "What is there in him that is so very charming, 
 more than in another person? If he be gone, thou, who art the 
 <I>fairest among women,</I> wilt soon have another with an equal 
 flame." Note, Carnal hearts see nothing excellent or extraordinary in 
 the Lord Jesus, in his person or offices, in his doctrine or in his 
 favours; as if there were no more in the knowledge of Christ, and in 
 communion with him, than in the knowledge of the world and in its 
 conversation. 

 (2.) Others rather take it for a serious question, and suppose that 
 those who put it intended,

 [1.] To comfort the spouse, who, they knew, would recover new spirits 
 if she did but talk awhile of her beloved; nothing would please her 
 better, nor give a more powerful diversion to her grief, than to be put 
 upon the pleasing task of describing the beauties of her beloved. 

 [2.] To inform themselves; they had heard, in general, that he was 
 excellent and glorious, but they desired to know more particularly. 
 They wondered what moved the spouse to charge them concerning her 
 beloved with so much vehemence and concern, and therefore concluded 
 there must be something more in him than in another beloved, which they 
 are willing to be convinced of. <I>Then</I> there begin to be some
 hopes of people when they begin to enquire concerning Christ and his 
 transcendent perfections. And sometimes the extraordinary zeal of one, 
 in enquiring after Christ, may be a means to provoke many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:2">2 Cor. ix. 2</A>),
 
 as the apostle, by the faith of the Gentiles, would stir up the Jews to
 a holy emulation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:10">John iv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The account which the spouse gives of her beloved in answer to this 
 question. We should always be ready to instruct and assist those that 
 are enquiring after Christ. Experienced Christians, who are well 
 acquainted with Christ themselves, should do all they can to make 
 others acquainted with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She assures them, in general, that he is one of incomparable 
 perfections and unparalleled worth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Do not you know my beloved? Can the daughters of Jerusalem be ignorant 
 of him that is Jerusalem's crown and crowned head? Let me tell you 
 then,"

 (1.) That he has every thing in him that is lovely and amiable: <I>My
 beloved is white and ruddy,</I> the colours that make up a complete 
 beauty. This points not at any extraordinary beauty of his body, when 
 he should be incarnate (it was never said of the child Jesus, as of the 
 child Moses, when he was born, that he was <I>exceedingly fair,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:20">Acts vii. 20</A>;
 
 nay, <I>he had no form nor comeliness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>);

 but his divine glory, and the concurrence of every thing in him as
 Mediator, to make him truly lovely in the eyes of those that are 
 enlightened to discern spiritual things. In him we may behold the 
 <I>beauty of the Lord;</I> he was the <I>holy child Jesus;</I> that was 
 his fairness. If we look upon him as made to us <I>wisdom, 
 righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,</I> he appears, in all, 
 very amiable. His love to us renders him lovely. He is <I>white</I> in 
 the spotless innocency of his life, <I>ruddy</I> in the bloody 
 sufferings he went through at his death,--<I>white</I> in his glory, as 
 God (when he was transfigured <I>his raiment was white as the 
 light</I>), <I>ruddy</I> in his assuming the nature of man, 
 <I>Adam</I>--<I>red earth,</I>--<I>white</I> in his tenderness towards 
 his people, <I>ruddy</I> in his terrible appearances against his and 
 their enemies. His complexion is a very happy composition.

 (2.) That he has that loveliness in him which is not to be found in any 
 other: He is <I>the chief among ten thousand,</I> a nonsuch for beauty, 
 <I>fairer than the children of men,</I> than any of them, than all of 
 them; there is none like him, nor any to be compared with him; every 
 thing else is to be accounted <I>loss and dung in comparison of 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:8">Phil. iii. 8</A>.
 
 <I>He is higher than the kings of the earth</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:27">Ps. lxxxix. 27</A>)

 and has <I>obtained a more excellent name</I> than any of the
 principalities and powers of the upper or lower world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:9,Heb+1:1-14,4:1-16">Phil. ii. 9; Heb. i. iv.</A>.

 He is a <I>standard-bearer among ten thousand</I> (so the word is), the 
 tallest and comeliest of the company. He is himself <I>lifted up as an 
 ensign</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>),

 to whom we must be gathered and must always have an eye. And there is
 all the reason in the world why he should have the innermost and 
 uppermost place in our souls who is the <I>fairest of ten thousands</I> 
 in himself and the fittest of twenty thousands for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She gives a particular detail of his accomplishments, conceals not 
 his power or comely proportion. Every thing in Christ is amiable. Ten 
 instances she here gives of his beauty, which we need not be nice in 
 the application of, lest the wringing of them bring forth blood and 
 prove the wresting of them. The design, in general, is to show that he 
 is every way qualified for his undertaking, and has all that in him 
 which may recommend him to our esteem, love, and confidence. Christ's 
 appearance to John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:13">Rev. i. 13</A>,

 &c.) may be compared with the description which the spouse gives of him
 here, the scope of both being to represent him transcendently glorious, 
 that is, both great and gracious, made lovely in the eyes of believers 
 and making them happy in himself. 

 (1.) <I>His head is as the most fine gold. The head of Christ is 
 God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:3">1 Cor. xi. 3</A>),

 and it is promised to the saints that <I>the Almighty shall be their
 gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:25">Job xxii. 25</A>),

 their defence, their treasure; much more was he so to Christ, <I>in
 whom dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:9">Col. ii. 9</A>.
 
 Christ's head bespeaks his sovereign dominion over all and his vital
 influence upon his church and all its members. This is as <I>gold,
 gold;</I> the former word in the original signifies shining gold, the 
 latter strong solid gold; Christ's sovereignty is both beautiful and 
 powerful. Nebuchadnezzar's monarchy is compared to a <I>head of 
 gold</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:38">Dan. ii. 38</A>),

 because it excelled all the other monarchies, and so does Christ's
 government.

 (2.) <I>His locks are bushy and black,</I> not <I>black as the tents of 
 Kedar,</I> whose blackness was their deformity, to which therefore the 
 church compares herself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),
 
 but <I>black as a raven,</I> whose blackness is his beauty. Sometimes
 Christ's hair is represented as <I>white</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:14">Rev. i. 14</A>),

 denoting his eternity, that he is <I>the ancient of days;</I> but here
 as <I>black and bushy,</I> denoting that he is ever young and that 
 there is in him no decay, nothing that waxes old. Every thing that 
 belongs to Christ is amiable in the eyes of a believer, even his hair 
 is so; it was pity that it should be wet, as it was, <I>with the 
 dew,</I> and these <I>locks with the drops of the night,</I> while he 
 waited to be gracious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 (3.) <I>His eyes are as the eyes of doves,</I> fair and clear, and 
 chaste and kind, <I>by the rivers of waters,</I> which doves delight 
 in, and in which, as in a glass, they see themselves. They are washed, 
 to make them clean, <I>washed with milk,</I> to make them white, and 
 <I>fitly set,</I> neither starting out nor sunk in. Christ is <I>of 
 purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</I> for they are doves' eyes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13">Hab. i. 13</A>.

 All believers speak with pleasure of the omniscience of Christ, as the
 spouse here of <I>his eyes;</I> for, though it be terrible to his 
 enemies <I>as a flame of fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:14">Rev. i. 14</A>),

 yet it is amiable and comfortable to his friends, as <I>doves'
 eyes,</I> for it is a witness to their integrity. <I>Thou knowest all
 things, thou knowest that I love thee.</I> Blessed and holy are those 
 that walk always as under the eye of Christ.

 (4.) <I>His cheeks</I> (the rising of the face) <I>are as a bed of
 spices,</I> raised in the gardens, which are the beauty and wealth of 
 them, and <I>as sweet flowers,</I> or towers of sweetness. There is
 that in Christ's countenance which is amiable in the eyes of all the 
 saints, in the least glimpse of him, for the cheek is but a part of the 
 face. The half discoveries Christ makes of himself to the soul are 
 reviving and refreshing, fragrant above the richest flowers and 
 perfumes. 

 (5.) <I>His lips are like lilies,</I> not white like lilies, but sweet 
 and pleasant. Such are <I>the words of his lips</I> to all that are 
 sanctified, <I>sweeter than honey and the honey-comb;</I> such are the 
 <I>kisses of his lips,</I> all the communications of his grace; 
 <I>grace is poured into his lips,</I> and those that heard him 
 <I>wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. His 
 lips</I> are as <I>lilies, dropping sweet-smelling myrrh.</I> Never any 
 lilies in nature dropped myrrh, but nothing in nature can fully set 
 forth the beauty and excellence of Christ, and therefore, to do it by 
 comparison, there must be a composition of images. 

 (6.) <I>His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl,</I> a noted 
 precious stone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Great men had their hands adorned with gold rings on their fingers, set
 with diamonds or other precious stones, but, in her eye, <I>his 
 hands</I> themselves were <I>as gold rings;</I> all the instances of 
 his power, the works of his hands, all the performances of his 
 providence and grace, are all rich, and pure, and precious, as gold, 
 <I>as the precious onyx and the sapphire,</I> all fitted to the purpose 
 for which they were designed <I>as gold rings</I> to the finger, and 
 all beautiful and very becoming, <I>as rings set with beryl.</I> His 
 hands, which are stretched forth both to receive his people and to give 
 to them, are thus rich and comely.

 (7.) <I>His bowels are as bright ivory,</I> for so it should be 
 rendered, rather than <I>his belly,</I> for it is the same word that 
 was used for <I>bowels</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 and is often ascribed to God (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15,Jer+31:20">Isa. lxiii. 15; Jer. xxxi. 20</A>),

 and so it denotes his tender compassion and affection for his spouse,
 and the love he has to her even in her desolate and deserted state. 
 This love of his is like <I>bright ivory,</I> finely polished, and 
 richly <I>overlaid with sapphires.</I> The love itself is strong and 
 firm, and the instances and circumstances of it are bright and 
 sparkling, and add much to the inestimable value of it.

 (8.) <I>His legs are as pillars of marble,</I> so strong, and stately, 
 and no disgrace, no, not to the <I>sockets of fine gold upon</I> which 
 they are <I>set,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:16"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This bespeaks his stability and stedfastness; where he sets his foot he
 will fix it; he is able to bear all the weight of the government that 
 is upon his shoulders, and his legs will never fail under him. This 
 sets forth the stateliness and magnificence of <I>the goings of our 
 God, our King, in his sanctuary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:24">Ps. lxviii. 24</A>),

 and the steadiness and evenness of all his dispensations towards his
 people. <I>The ways of the Lord are equal;</I> they are all <I>mercy 
 and truth;</I> these are the <I>pillars of marble,</I> more lasting 
 than the pillars of heaven.

 (9.) <I>His countenance</I> (his port and mien) <I>is as Lebanon,</I>
 that stately hill; his aspect beautiful and charming, like the prospect 
 of that pleasant forest or park, <I>excellent as the cedars,</I> which, 
 in height and strength, excel other trees, and are of excellent use.
 Christ is a goodly person; the more we look upon him the more beauty we 
 shall see in him.

 (10.) <I>His mouth is most sweet;</I> it is sweetness itself; it is 
 <I>sweetnesses</I> (so the word is); it is pure essence, nay, it is the 
 quintessence of all delights, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The words of his mouth are all sweet to a believer, sweet as milk to
 babes (to whom it is agreeable), as honey to those that are grown up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:103">Ps. cxix. 103</A>),

 to whom it is delicious. The kisses of his mouth, all the tokens of his
 love, have a transcendent sweetness in them, and are most delightful to 
 those who have their <I>spiritual senses exercised. To you that
 believe he is precious.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She concludes with a full assurance both of faith and hope, and so 
 gets the mastery of her trouble. 

 (1.) Here is a full assurance of faith concerning the complete beauty 
 of the Lord Jesus: "<I>He is altogether lovely.</I> Why should I stand 
 to mention particulars, when throughout there is nothing amiss?" She is 
 sensible she does him wrong in the particular descriptions of him, and 
 comes far short of the dignity and merit of the subject, and therefore 
 she breaks off with the general encomium: <I>He is</I> truly 
 <I>lovely,</I> he is wholly so; there is nothing in him but what is 
 amiable, and nothing amiable but what is in him. <I>He is all 
 desires;</I> he has all in him that one can desire. And therefore all
 her desire is towards him, and she seeks him thus carefully and cannot 
 rest contented in the want of him. Who can but love him who is so 
 lovely? 

 (2.) Here is a full assurance of hope concerning her own interest in 
 him: "<I>This is my beloved, and this is my friend;</I> and therefore 
 wonder not that I thus long after him." See with what a holy boldness 
 she claims relation to him, and then with what a holy triumph she 
 proclaims it. It is property that sweetens excellency. To see Christ, 
 and not to see him as ours, would be rather a torture than a happiness; 
 but to see one that is thus lovely, and to see him as ours, is a 
 complete satisfaction. Here is a true believer,

 [1.] Giving an entire consent to Christ: "He is mine, <I>my Lord and my
 God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:28">John xx. 28</A>),

 mine according to the tenour of the gospel-covenant, mine in all
 relations, bestowed upon me, to be all that to me that my poor soul 
 stands in need of."

 [2.] Taking an entire complacency in Christ. It is spoken of here with 
 an air of triumph: "This is he whom I have chosen, and to whom I have 
 given up myself. None but Christ, none but Christ. This is he on whom
 my heart is, for he is my best-beloved; this is he in whom I trust, and 
 from whom I expect all good, <I>for this is my friend.</I>" Note, Those 
 that make Christ their beloved shall have him their friend; he has 
 been, is, and will be, a special friend to all believers. He loves 
 those that love him; and those that have him their friend have reason 
 to glory in him, and speak of him with delight. "Let others be governed 
 by the love of the world, and seek their happiness in its friendship 
 and favours, <I>This is my beloved and this is my friend.</I> Others 
 may do as they please, but this is my soul's choice, my soul's rest, my 
 life, my joy, my all; this is he whom I desire to live and die 
 with."</P>
