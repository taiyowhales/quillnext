 The affections between Christ and his spouse are as strong and lively 
 here, in this closing chapter of the song, as ever, and rather more so. 
 
 I. The spouse continues her importunity for a more intimate communion
 and fellowship with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. She charges the daughters of Jerusalem not to interrupt her
 communion with her beloved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:4">ver. 4</A>);

 and they, thereupon, admire her dependence on him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:5">ver. 5</A>.

 III. She begs of her beloved, whom she raises up by her prayers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:5">ver. 5</A>),

 that he would by his grace confirm that blessed union with him to which
 she was admitted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 IV. She makes intercession for others also, that care might be taken of
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 and pleases herself with the thoughts of her own interest in Christ and
 his affection to her,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:10">ver. 10</A>.

 V. She owns herself his tenant for a vineyard she held of him at 
 Baal-hamon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 VI. The song concludes with an interchanging of parting requests.
 Christ charges his spouse that she should often let him hear from her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:13">ver. 13</A>),

 and she begs of him that he would hasten his return to her,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O that thou <I>wert</I> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of
 my mother! <I>when</I> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
 yea, I should not be despised.
 &nbsp; 2  I would lead thee, <I>and</I> bring thee into my mother's house,
 <I>who</I> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced
 wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
 &nbsp; 3  His left hand <I>should be</I> under my head, and his right hand
 should embrace me.
 &nbsp; 4  I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
 nor awake <I>my</I> love, until he please.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 I. The spouse wishes for a constant intimacy and freedom with the Lord 
 Jesus. She was already betrothed to him, but, the nuptials being yet 
 not solemnized and published (the bride, the Lamb's wife, will not be 
 completely ready till his second coming), she was obliged to be shy and 
 to keep at some distance; she therefore wishes she may be taken for his 
 sister, he having called her so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>),

 and that she might have the same chaste and innocent familiarity with
 him that a sister has with a brother, an own brother, that <I>sucked 
 the breasts</I> of the same <I>mother</I> with her, who would therefore 
 be exceedingly tender of her, as Joseph was of his brother Benjamin. 
 Some make this to be the prayer of the Old-Testament saints for the 
 hastening of Christ's incarnation, that the church might be the better 
 acquainted with him, when, <I>forasmuch as the children are partakers 
 of flesh and blood,</I> he should also himself likewise take part of 
 the same, and not be ashamed to call them brethren. It is rather the 
 wish of all believers for a more intimate communion with him, that they 
 might <I>receive the Spirit of sanctification,</I> and so Christ must 
 be as their brother, that is, that they might be as his brethren, which 
 <I>then</I> they are when by grace they are made partakers of a divine 
 nature, and <I>he that sanctifies, and those that are sanctified, are 
 both of one,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>,

 &c. It becomes brethren and sisters, the children of the same parents, 
 that have been nursed at the same breast, to be very loving to and 
 tender of one another; such a love the spouse desires might be between 
 her and her beloved, that she might call him brother. 

 2. She promises herself then the satisfaction of making a more open 
 profession of her relation to him than at present she could make: 
 "<I>When I should find thee without,</I> any where, even before 
 company, <I>I would kiss thee,</I> as a sister does her own brother, 
 especially her little brother that is now <I>sucking the breasts of her 
 mother</I>" (for so some understand it); "I would use all the decent 
 freedom with thee that could be, and <I>should not be despised</I> for 
 it, as doing any thing unbecoming the modesty of my sex." The church, 
 since Christ's incarnation, can better own him than she could before, 
 when she would have been laughed at for being so much in love with one 
 that was not yet born. Christ has become as our brother; wherever we 
 find him, therefore, let us be ready to own our relation to him and 
 affection for him, and not fear being despised for it, nor regard that 
 any more than David did when he danced before the ark. <I>If this be to 
 be vile, I will be yet more vile.</I> Nay, let us hope that we shall 
 not be despised so much as some imagine. <I>Of the maid-servants of 
 whom thou hast spoken I shall be had in honour.</I> Wherever we find 
 the image of Christ, though it be without, among those that do not 
 follow him with us, we must love it, and testify that love, and we 
 <I>shall not be despised</I> for it, but catholic charity will gain us 
 respect. 

 3. She promises to improve the opportunity she should then have for
 cultivating an acquaintance with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>I would lead thee,</I> as my brother, by the arm, and hang upon
 thee; I would show thee all the house of my precious things, would 
 bring <I>thee into my mother's house,</I> into the church, into the 
 solemn assemblies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4"><I>ch.</I> iii. 4</A>),

 into my closet" (for there the saints have most familiar communion with
 Christ), "and <I>there thou wouldst instruct me</I>" (so some read it),
 as brethren inform their sisters of what they desire to be instructed 
 in. Those that know Christ shall be taught of him; and <I>therefore</I> 
 we should desire communion with Christ that we may receive instruction 
 from him. He has come that he might give us an understanding. Or, "My 
 mother would instruct me when I have thee with me." It is the presence 
 of Christ in and with his church that makes the word and ordinances 
 instructive to her children, who shall all be taught of God. 

 4. She promises him to bid him welcome to the best she had; she would
 <I>cause him to drink of her spiced wine and the juice of her 
 pomegranate,</I> and bid him welcome to it, wishing it better for his 
 sake. The exercise of grace and the performance of duty are spiced wine 
 to the Lord Jesus, very acceptable to him, as expressive of a grateful 
 sense of his favours. Those that are pleased with Christ must study to 
 be pleasing to him; and they will not find him hard to be pleased. He 
 reckons hearty welcome his best entertainment; and, if he have that, he 
 will bring his entertainment along with him. 

 5. She doubts not but to experience his tender care of her and
 affection to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that she should be supported by his power and kept from fainting in the
 hardest services and sufferings <I>(His left hand shall be under my 
 head</I>) and that she should be comforted with his love--<I>His right 
 hand should embrace me.</I> Thus Christ laid his right hand upon John 
 when he was ready to die away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17">Rev. i. 17</A>.

 See also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:10,18">Dan. x. 10, 18</A>.
 
 It may be read as it is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 6</A>,

 <I>His left hand is under my head</I> (for the words are the same in
 the original) and so it expresses an immediate answer to her prayer; 
 she was answered with <I>strength in her soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3">Ps. cxxxviii. 3</A>.

 While we are following hard after Christ his <I>right hand sustains
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8">Ps. lxiii. 8</A>.
 
 <I>Underneath are the everlasting arms.</I>

 6. She charges those about her to take heed of doing any thing to
 interrupt the pleasing communion she now had with her beloved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 as she had done before, when he thus strengthened and comforted her
 with his presence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:7"><I>ch.</I> ii. 7</A>):

 Let me <I>charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem,</I> and reason with
 you, <I>Why should you stir up, and why should you awake, my love, 
 until he will?</I> The church, our common mother, charges all her 
 children that they never do any thing to provoke Christ to withdraw, 
 which we are very prone to do. Why should you put such an affront upon 
 him? Why should you be such enemies to yourselves? We should thus 
 reason with ourselves when we are tempted to do that which will grieve 
 the Spirit. "What! Am I weary of Christ's presence, that I affront him
 and provoke him to depart from me? Why should I do that which he will 
 take so unkindly and which I shall certainly repent of?"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Who <I>is</I> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning
 upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there
 thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth
 <I>that</I> bare thee.
 &nbsp; 6  Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
 for love <I>is</I> strong as death; jealousy <I>is</I> cruel as the grave:
 the coals thereof <I>are</I> coals of fire, <I>which hath a</I> most
 vehement flame.
 &nbsp; 7  Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
 it: if <I>a</I> man would give all the substance of his house for
 love, it would utterly be contemned.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The spouse is much admired by those about her. It comes in in a 
 parenthesis, but in it gospel-grace lies as plain, and as much above 
 ground, as any where in this mystical song: <I>Who is this that comes 
 up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</I> Some make these 
 the words of the bridegroom, expressing himself well pleased with her 
 reliance on him and resignation of herself to his guidance. They are 
 rather the words of the daughters of Jerusalem, to whom she spoke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they see her, and bless her. The angels in heaven, and all her friends
 on earth, are the joyful spectators of her bliss. The Jewish church 
 came up from the wilderness supported by the divine power and favour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:10,11">Deut. xxxii. 10, 11</A>.

 The Christian church was raised up from a low and desolate condition by
 the grace of Christ relied on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:27">Gal. iv. 27</A>.

 Particular believers are amiable, nay, admirable, and divine grace is
 to be admired in them, when by the power of that grace they are brought 
 <I>up from the wilderness, leaning</I> with a holy confidence and 
 complacency <I>upon</I> Jesus Christ <I>their beloved.</I> This 
 bespeaks the beauty of a soul, and the wonders of divine grace,

 1. In the conversion of sinners. A sinful state is a <I>wilderness,</I>
 remote from communion with God, barren and dry, and in which there is 
 no true comfort; it is a wandering wanting state. Out of this 
 wilderness we are concerned to <I>come up,</I> by true repentance, in 
 the strength of the grace of Christ, supported by our beloved and 
 carried in his arms. 

 2. In the consolation of saints. A soul convinced of sin, and truly 
 humbled for it, is in a <I>wilderness,</I> quite at a loss; and there 
 is no coming out of this <I>wilderness</I> but <I>leaning</I> on Christ 
 as our beloved, by faith, and not <I>leaning to our own 
 understanding,</I> nor trusting to any righteousness or strength of our 
 own as sufficient for us, but going forth, and going on, in the 
 strength of the Lord God, and making mention of his righteousness, even 
 his only, who is <I>the Lord our righteousness.</I> 

 3. In the salvation of those that belong to Christ. We must go up from
 the wilderness of this world having our conversation in heaven; and, at 
 death, we must remove thither, <I>leaning</I> upon Christ, must live 
 and die by faith in him. <I>To me to live is Christ,</I> and it is he 
 that is gain in death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She addresses herself to her beloved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She puts him in mind of the former experience which she and others 
 had had of comfort and success in applying to him. 

 (1.) For her own part: "<I>I raised thee up under the apple tree,</I> 
 that is, I have many a time wrestled with thee by prayer and have 
 prevailed. When I was alone in the acts of devotion, retired in the 
 orchard, under <I>the apple-tree</I>" (which Christ himself was 
 compared to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>),

 as <I>Nathanael under the fig-tree</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:48">John i. 48</A>),

 "meditating and praying, then <I>I raised thee up,</I> to help me and
 comfort me," as the disciples raised him up in the storm, saying, 
 <I>Master, carest thou not that we perish?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:38">Mark iv. 38</A>),
 
 and the church
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:23">Ps. xliv. 23</A>),
 
 <I>Awake, why sleepest thou?</I> Note, The experience we have had of
 Christ's readiness to yield to the importunities of our faith and 
 prayer should encourage us to continue instant in our addresses to him, 
 to strive more earnestly, and not to faint. <I>I sought the Lord, and 
 he heard me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:4">Ps. xxxiv. 4</A>.

 (2.) Others also had like experience of comfort in Christ, as it 
 follows there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:5">Ps. xxxiv. 5</A>),

 <I>They looked unto him,</I> as well as I, <I>and were lightened.</I>
 There <I>thy mother brought thee forth,</I> the universal church, or 
 believing souls, in whom Christ was formed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:15">Gal. iv. 15</A>.

 They were in pain for the comfort of an interest in thee, and
 <I>travailed in pain</I> with <I>great sorrow</I> (so the word here 
 signifies); but they <I>brought thee forth;</I> the pangs did not 
 continue always; those that had <I>travailed</I> in convictions at last 
 <I>brought forth</I> in consolations, and the <I>pain was forgotten</I> 
 for joy of the Saviour's birth. By this very similitude our Saviour 
 illustrates the joy which his disciples would have in his return to 
 them, after a mournful separation for a time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21,22">John xvi. 21, 22</A>.

 After the bitter pangs of repentance many a one has had the blessed 
 birth of comfort; why then may not I?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She begs of him that her union with him might be confirmed, and her 
 communion with him continued and made more intimate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm.</I>

 (1.) "Let me have a place in thy heart, an interest in thy love." This 
 is that which all those desire above any thing that know how much their 
 happiness is bound up in the love of Christ. 

 (2.) "Let me never lose the room I have in thy heart; let thy love to 
 me be ensured, as that deed which is sealed up not to be robbed. Let 
 nothing ever prevail either to separate me from thy love, or, by 
 suspending the communications of it, to deprive me of the comfortable 
 sense of it." 

 (3.) "Let me be always near and dear to thee, as the <I>signet on thy 
 right hand,</I> not to be parted with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer. xxii. 24</A>),

 <I>engraven upon the palms of thy hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14">Isa. xlix. 14</A>),

 be loved with a peculiar love."

 (4.) "Be thou my high priest; let my name be written on thy 
 breast-plate, nearer thy heart, as the names of all the tribes were 
 engraven like the engravings of a signet in twelve precious stones on 
 the breast-plate of Aaron, and also on two precious <I>stones</I> on 
 the <I>two shoulders</I> or arms of the ephod," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:11,12,21">Exod. xxviii. 11, 12, 21</A>.

 (5.) "Let thy power be engaged for me, as an evidence of thy love to 
 me; let me be not only a <I>seal upon thy heart,</I> but a <I>seal upon 
 thy arm;</I> let me be ever borne up in thy arms, and know it to my 
 comfort." Some make these to be the words of Christ to his spouse, 
 commanding her to be ever mindful of him and of his love to her; 
 however, if we desire and expect that Christ should set us as a <I>seal 
 on his heart,</I> surely we cannot do less than set him as a seal on 
 ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To enforce this petition, she pleads the power of love, of her love 
 to him, which constrained her to be thus pressing for the tokens of his 
 love to her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Love is a violent vigorous passion. 

 [1.] It is <I>strong as death.</I> The pains of a disappointed lover 
 are like the pains of death; nay, the pains of death are slighted, and 
 made nothing of, in pursuit of the beloved object. Christ's love to us 
 was <I>strong as death,</I> for it broke through death itself. <I>He 
 loved us, and gave himself for us.</I> The love of true believers to 
 Christ is <I>strong as death,</I> for it makes them dead to every thing 
 else; it even parts between soul and body, while the soul, upon the 
 wings of devout affections, soars upward to heaven, and even forgets
 that it is yet clothed and clogged with flesh. Paul, in a rapture of 
 this love, knew not whether he was in <I>the body or out of the 
 body.</I> By it a believer is crucified to the world. 

 [2.] <I>Jealousy is cruel as the grave,</I> which swallows up and 
 devours all; those that truly love Christ are jealous of every thing 
 that would draw them from him, and especially jealous of themselves, 
 lest they should do any thing to provoke him to withdraw from them, 
 and, rather than do so, would <I>pluck out a right eye</I> and <I>cut 
 off a right hand,</I> than which what can be more cruel? Weak and 
 trembling saints, who conceive a jealousy of Christ, doubting of his 
 love to them, find that jealousy to prey upon them like the grave; 
 nothing wastes the spirits more; but it is an evidence of the strength 
 of their love to him. 

 (3.) <I>The coals thereof,</I> its lamps, and flames, and beams, are 
 very strong, and burn with incredible force, as the <I>coals of fire 
 that have a most vehement flame, a flame of the Lord</I> (so some read 
 it), a powerful piercing flame, as the lightning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:7">Ps. xxix. 7</A>.

 Holy love is a fire that begets a vehement heat in the soul, and
 consumes the dross and chaff that are in it, melts it down like wax 
 into a new form, and carries it upwards as the sparks towards God and 
 heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Love is a valiant victorious passion. Holy love is so; the 
 reigning love of God in the soul is constant and firm, and will not be 
 drawn off from him either by fair means or foul, by <I>life or 
 death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:38">Rom. viii. 38</A>.

 [1.] Death, and all its terrors, will not frighten a believer from 
 loving Christ: <I>Many waters,</I> though they will quench fire, 
 <I>cannot quench this love,</I> no, nor the <I>floods drown it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The noise of these waters will strike no terror upon it; let them do
 their worst, Christ shall still be the best beloved. The overflowing of 
 these waters will strike no damp upon it, but it will enable a man to 
 rejoice in tribulation. <I>Though he slay me,</I> I will love him and 
 <I>trust in him.</I> No waters could quench Christ's love to us, nor 
 any floods drown it; he waded through the greatest difficulties, even 
 seas of blood. Love sat king upon the floods; let nothing then abate 
 our love to him.

 [2.] Life, and all its comforts, will not entice a believer from loving 
 Christ: <I>If a man</I> could hire him with <I>all the substance of his 
 house,</I> to take his love off from Christ and set it upon the world 
 and the flesh again, he would reject the proposal with the utmost 
 disdain; as Christ, when the kingdoms of this world and the glory of 
 them were offered him, to buy him off from his undertaking, said, 
 <I>Get thee hence, Satan.</I> It would utterly be contemned. Offer 
 those things to those that know no better. Love will enable us to repel 
 and triumph over temptations from the smiles of the world, as much as 
 from its frowns. Some give this sense of it: <I>If a man would give
 all the substance of his house to</I> Christ, as an equivalent instead 
 of love, to excuse it, <I>it would be contemned.</I> He seeks not ours, 
 but us, the heart, not the wealth. <I>If I give all my goods to feed 
 the poor, and have not love, it is nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1">1 Cor. xiii. 1</A>.

 Thus believers stand affected to Christ: the gifts of his providence
 cannot satisfy them without the assurances of his love.</P>

 silver: and if she <I>be</I> a door, we will inclose her with boards
 of cedar.
 &nbsp; 10  I <I>am</I> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
 eyes as one that found favour.
 &nbsp; 11  Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard
 unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
 thousand <I>pieces</I> of silver.
 &nbsp; 12  My vineyard, which <I>is</I> mine, <I>is</I> before me: thou, O
 Solomon, <I>must have</I> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit
 thereof two hundred.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ and his spouse having sufficiently confirmed their love to each 
 other, and agreed it to be on both sides <I>strong as death</I> and 
 inviolable, they are here, in these verses, like a loving husband and 
 his wife, consulting together about their affairs, and considering what 
 they should do. Yoke-fellows, having laid their hearts together, lay 
 their heads together, to contrive about their relations and about their 
 estates; and, accordingly, this happy pair are here advising with one 
 another about a sister, and a vineyard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are here consulting about their sister, their little sister, 
 and the disposing of her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The spouse proposes her case with a compassionate concern 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>We have a little sister and she has no breasts</I> (she has not
 grown up to maturity); <I>what shall we do for</I> this <I>little 
 sister</I> of <I>ours in the day that she shall be spoken for,</I> so 
 as that we may do well for her?

 (1.) This may be understood as spoken by the Jewish church concerning 
 the Gentile world. God has espoused the church of the Jews to himself, 
 and she was richly endowed, but what shall become of the poor Gentiles, 
 <I>the barren that has not borne,</I> and <I>the desolate?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.

 Their condition (say the pious Jews) is very deplorable and forlorn;
 they are <I>sisters,</I> children of the same fathers, God and Adam, 
 but they are <I>little,</I> because not dignified with the knowledge of 
 God; they <I>have no breasts,</I> no divine revelation, no scriptures, 
 no ministers, no breasts of consolation drawn out to them, when they 
 might suck, being <I>strangers to the covenants of promise,</I> no 
 breasts of instruction themselves to draw out to their children, to 
 nourish them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:2">1 Pet. ii. 2</A>.

 <I>What shall we do for</I> them? We can but pity them, and pray for
 them. Lord, what wilt thou do for them? The saints, in Solomon's time, 
 might know, from David's psalms, that God had mercy in store for them, 
 and they begged it might be hastened to them. Now the tables are 
 turned; the Gentiles are betrothed to Christ, and ought to return the 
 kindness by an equal concern for the bringing in of the Jews again, our 
 eldest sister, that once had breasts, but now has none. If we take it 
 in this sense, the unbelieving posterity of these pious Jews 
 contradicted this prayer of their fathers; for, when the day came that 
 the Gentiles should be <I>spoken for</I> and courted to Christ, instead 
 of considering what to do for them they plotted to do all they could 
 against them, which filled up the measure of their iniquity, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) It may be applied to any other that belong to the election of 
 grace, but are yet uncalled. They are remotely related to Christ and
 his church, and sisters to them both, <I>other sheep that are not of 
 this fold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16,Ac+18:10">John x. 16; Acts xviii. 10</A>.

 They <I>have no breasts,</I> none yet fashioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:7">Ezek. xvi. 7</A>),

 no affection to Christ, no principle of grace. <I>The day</I> will
 come <I>when</I> they <I>shall be spoken for,</I> when the chosen shall 
 be called, shall be courted for Christ, by the ministers, the friends 
 of the bridegroom. A blessed day it will be, a day of visitation. What 
 shall we do, in that day, to promote the match, to conquer their 
 coyness, and persuade them to consent to Christ and present themselves 
 chaste virgins to him? Note, Those that through grace are brought to 
 Christ themselves should contrive what they may do to help others to 
 him, to carry on the great design of his gospel, which is to espouse 
 souls to Christ and convert sinners to him from whom they have 
 departed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ soon determines what to do in this case, and his spouse 
 agrees with him in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>If she be a wall,</I> if the good work be once begun with the
 Gentiles, with the souls that are to be called in, if the <I>little 
 sister, when she shall be spoken for</I> by the gospel, will but 
 receive the word, and build herself upon Christ the foundation, and 
 frame her doings to turn to the Lord, as the wall is in order to the 
 house, <I>we will build upon her a palace of silver,</I> or build her 
 up into such a palace; we will carry on the good work that is begun, 
 till the wall become a palace, the wall of stone a palace of silver," 
 which goes beyond the boast of Augustus C&aelig;sar, that what he found 
 brick he left marble. This <I>little sister,</I> when once she is 
 joined to the Lord, shall be made to <I>grow into a holy temple, a 
 habitation of God through the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21,22">Eph. ii. 21, 22</A>.

 <I>If she be a door,</I> when this palace comes to be finished, and the
 doors of this wall set up, which was the last thing done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:1">Neh. vii. 1</A>),

 then <I>we will enclose here with boards of cedar;</I> we will
 carefully and effectually protect her, that she shall receive no 
 damage. <I>We will</I> do it; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, all concur 
 in contriving, carrying on, and crowning, the blessed work when the 
 time comes. Whatever is wanting shall be set in order, and the work of 
 faith shall be fulfilled with power. Though the beginnings of grace be 
 small, the latter end shall greatly increase. The church is in care 
 concerning those that are yet uncalled. "Let me alone," says Christ; "I 
 will do all that which is necessary to be done for them. Trust me with 
 it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The spouse takes this occasion to acknowledge with thankfulness his 
 kindness to her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 She is very willing to trust him with her <I>little sister,</I> for she
 herself had had great experience of his grace, and, for her part, she 
 owed her all to him: <I>I am a wall, and my breasts like towers.</I> 
 This she speaks, not as upbraiding her little sister that had no 
 breasts, but comforting her concerning her, that he who had made her 
 what she was, who had built her up upon himself and made her to grow up 
 to maturity, could and would do the same kindness for those whose case 
 she bore upon her heart. <I>Then was I in his eyes as one that found 
 favour.</I> See,

 (1.) What she values herself upon, her having found favour in the eyes 
 of Jesus Christ. Those are happy, truly happy, and for ever so, that
 have the favour of God and are accepted of him. 

 (2.) How she ascribes the good work of God in her to the good-will of 
 God towards her: "He has <I>made me a wall and my breasts as 
 towers,</I> and then, in that instance more than in any thing, I 
 experienced his love to me." <I>Hail, thou that art highly 
 favoured,</I> for in thee Christ is formed. 

 (3.) What pleasure God takes in the work of his own hands. When we are 
 made as a <I>wall,</I> as a <I>brazen wall</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:18,15:20">Jer. i. 18; xv. 20</A>),

 that stands firmly against <I>the blast of the terrible ones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:4">Isa. xxv. 4</A>),
 
 then God takes delight in us to do us good.

 (4.) With what joy and triumph we ought to speak of God's grace towards 
 us, and with what satisfaction we should look back upon the special 
 times and seasons when <I>we were in his eyes as those that find 
 favour;</I> these were days never to be forgotten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are here consulting about <I>a vineyard</I> they had in the 
 country, the church of Christ on earth considered under the notion of 
 <I>a vineyard</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon,</I> had a kingdom in the
 possession of a multitude, a numerous people. As he was a type of 
 Christ, so his vineyard was a type of the church of Christ. Our Saviour 
 has given us a key to these verses in the parable of the vineyard let 
 out to the unthankful husbandmen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33">Matt. xxi. 33</A>.

 The bargain was that, every one of the tenants having so much of the
 vineyard assigned him as would contain 1000 vines, he was to pay the 
 annual rent of 1000 <I>pieces of silver;</I> for we read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:23">Isa. vii. 23</A>)
 
 that in a fruitful soil there were 1000 <I>vines at</I> 1000
 <I>silverlings.</I> Observe,

 1. Christ's church is his vineyard, a pleasant and peculiar place,
 privileged with many honours; he delights to walk in it, as a man in 
 his vineyard, and is pleased with its fruits. 

 2. He has entrusted each of us with his vineyard, as <I>keepers</I> of
 it. The privileges of the church are that good thing which he has 
 committed to us, to be kept as a sacred trust. The service of the 
 church is to be our business, according as our capacity is. <I>Son, go
 work to-day in my vineyard.</I> Adam, in innocency, was <I>to dress the 
 garden, and to keep it.</I> 

 3. He expects rent from those that are employed in his vineyard and
 entrusted with it. <I>He comes, seeking fruit,</I> and requires 
 gospel-duty of all those that enjoy gospel-privileges. Every one, of 
 what rank or degree soever, must bring glory and honour to Christ, and 
 do some service to the interest of his kingdom in the world, in 
 consideration of what benefit and advantage they enjoy by their share 
 of the privileges of the vineyard.

 4. Though Christ has <I>let out his vineyard to keepers,</I> yet still
 it is his, and he has his eye always upon it for good; for, if he did 
 not watch over it <I>night and day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1,2">Isa. xxvii. 1, 2</A>),

 <I>the watchmen,</I> to whom he has let it out, would keep it <I>but in
 vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1">Ps. cxxvii. 1</A>.

 Some take these for Christ's words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>My vineyard, which is mine, is before me;</I> and they observe how
 he dwells upon his property in it: It is <I>my vineyard, which is 
 mine;</I> so dear is his church to him, it is <I>his own in the 
 world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1">John xiii. 1</A>),

 and therefore he will always have it under his protection; it is his
 own, and he will look after it.

 5. The church, that enjoys the privileges of the vineyard, must have
 them always before her. The keeping of the vineyard requires constant 
 care and diligence. They are rather the words of the spouse: <I>My 
 vineyard, which is mine, is before me.</I> She has lamented her fault 
 and folly in not keeping her <I>own vineyard</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>),

 but now she resolves to reform. Our hearts are our vineyards, which we
 must <I>keep with all diligence;</I> and therefore we must have a 
 watchful jealous eye upon them at all times. 

 6. Our great care must be to pay our rent for what we hold of Christ's
 vineyard, and to see that we do not go behind-hand, nor disappoint the 
 messengers he sends to <I>receive the fruits</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:34">Matt. xxi. 34</A>):

 <I>Thou, O Solomon! must have</I> 1000, and shalt have. The main of
 the profits belong to Christ; to him and his praise all our fruits must 
 be dedicated.

 7. If we be careful to give Christ the praise of our church-privileges,
 we may then take to ourselves the comfort and benefit of them. If the 
 owner of the vineyard have had his due, the keepers of it shall be well 
 paid for their cares and pains; they shall have 200, which sum, no 
 doubt, was looked upon as a good profit. Those that work for Christ are 
 working for themselves, and shall be unspeakable gainers by it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ and his spouse are here parting for a while; she must stay below 
 <I>in the gardens</I> on earth, where she has work to do for him; he 
 must remove to <I>the mountains of spices</I> in heaven, where he has 
 business to attend for her, as <I>an advocate with the Father.</I> Now 
 observe with what mutual endearments they part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He desires to hear often from her. She is ready at her pen; she must 
 be sure to write to him; she knows how to direct 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Thou that,</I> for the present, <I>dwellest in the gardens,</I>
 dressing and keeping them till thou remove from the garden below to the 
 paradise above--<I>thou,</I> O believer! whoever thou art, <I>that 
 dwellest in the gardens</I> of solemn ordinances, <I>in the gardens</I> 
 of church-fellowship and communion, <I>the companions</I> are so happy 
 as to hear <I>thy voice, cause me to hear it</I> too." Observe,

 1. Christ's friends should keep a good correspondence one with
 another, and, as dear companions, speak often to one another 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:16">Mal. iii. 16</A>)

 and hearken to one another's voice; they should edify, encourage, and
 respect one another. They are companions in the kingdom and patience of 
 Christ, and therefore, as fellow-travellers, should keep up mutual 
 freedom, and not be shy of, nor strange to, one another. <I>The
 communion of saints</I> is an article of our covenant, as well as an 
 article of our creed, <I>to exhort one another daily,</I> and be glad 
 to be exhorted by another. <I>Hearken to the voice</I> of the church, 
 as far as it agrees with the voice of Christ; his companions will do 
 so.

 2. In the midst of our communion with one another we must not neglect
 our communion with Christ, but let him see our countenance and hear our 
 voice; he here bespeaks it: "<I>The companions hearken to thy 
 voice;</I> it is a pleasure to them; <I>cause me to hear it.</I> Thou 
 makest thy complaints to them when any thing grieves thee; why does 
 thou not bring them to me, and let me hear them? Thou art free with 
 them; be as free with me; pour out thy heart to me." Thus Christ, when 
 he left his disciples, ordered them to send to him upon every occasion.
 <I>Ask, and you shall receive.</I> Note, Christ not only accepts and 
 answers, but even courts his people's prayers, not reckoning them a 
 trouble to him, but an honour and a <I>delight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 We <I>cause him to hear</I> our prayers when we not only pray, but
 wrestle and strive in prayer. He loves to be pressingly importuned, 
 which is not the manner of men. Some read it, "<I>Cause me to be 
 heard;</I> thou hast often an opportunity of speaking to thy 
 companions, and they hearken to what thou sayest; speak of me to them; 
 let my name be heard among them; let me be the subject of thy 
 discourse." "One word of Christ" (as archbishop Usher used to say) 
 "before you part." No subject is more becoming, or should be more 
 pleasing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She desires his speedy return to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Make haste, my beloved,</I> to come again, and receive me to
 thyself; <I>be thou like a roe, or a young hart, upon the mountains of 
 spices;</I> let no time be lost; it is pleasant dwelling here <I>in the 
 gardens, but to depart, and be with</I> thee, <I>is far better;</I> 
 that therefore is what I wish, and wait, and long for. <I>Even so, 
 come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</I> Observe,

 1. Though Jesus Christ be now retired, he will return. The heavens,
 those high <I>mountains of</I> sweet <I>spices,</I> must <I>contain him 
 till the times of refreshing shall come;</I> and those times will come, 
 <I>when every eye shall see him,</I> in all the pomp and power of the 
 upper and better world, the mystery of God being finished and the 
 mystical body completed. 

 2. True believers, as they are looking for, so they are hastening to,
 the coming of that <I>day of the Lord,</I> not that they would have him 
 make more haste than good speed, but that the intermediate counsels may 
 all be fulfilled, and then that the end may come--the sooner the 
 better. Not that they think him <I>slack concerning his promise, as
 some men count slackness,</I> but thus they express the strength of 
 their affections to him and the vastness of their expectations from him 
 when he comes again. 

 3. Those only that can in sincerity call Christ their <I>beloved,</I>
 their <I>best beloved,</I> can, upon good grounds, desire him to hasten 
 his second coming. As for those whose hearts go a whoring after the 
 world, and who set their affections on the things of the earth, they 
 cannot love his appearing, but dread it rather, because then the earth, 
 and all the things of it which they have chosen for their portion, will 
 be burnt up. But those that truly love Christ long for his second 
 coming, because it will be the crown both of his glory and their bliss. 
 
 4. The comfort and satisfaction which we sometimes have in communion
 with God in grace here should make us breathe the more earnestly after 
 the immediate vision and complete fruition of him in the kingdom of 
 glory. The spouse, after an endearing conference with her beloved,
 finding it must break off, concludes with this affectionate request for 
 the perfecting and perpetuating of this happiness in the future state. 
 The clusters of grapes that meet us in this wilderness should make us 
 long for the full vintage in Canaan. If a day in his courts be so 
 sweet, what then will an eternity within the veil be! If this be 
 heaven, O that I were there!

 5. It is good to conclude our devotions with a joyful expectation of
 the glory to be revealed, and holy humble breathings towards it. We 
 should not part but with the prospect of meeting again. It is good to 
 conclude every sabbath with thoughts of the everlasting sabbath, which 
 shall have no night at the end of it, nor any week-day to come after 
 it. It is good to conclude every sacrament with thoughts of the 
 everlasting feast, when we shall sit down with Christ at his table in 
 his kingdom, to rise no more, and drink of the wine new there, and to 
 break up every religious assembly in hopes of <I>the general assembly 
 of the church of the first-born,</I> when time and days shall be no 
 more: Let the blessed Jesus hasten that blessed day. <I>Why are his 
 chariot-wheels so long a coming? Why tarry the wheels of his 
 chariots?</I></P>
