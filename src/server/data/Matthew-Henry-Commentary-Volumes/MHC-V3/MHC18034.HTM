 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu, it is likely, paused awhile, to see if Job had any thing to say 
 against his discourse in the foregoing chapter; but he sitting silent, 
 and it is likely intimating his desire that he would go on, he here 
 proceeds. And, 

 I. He bespeaks not only the audience, but the assistance of the company, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 II. He charges Job with some more indecent expressions that had dropped
 from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. He undertakes to convince him that he had spoken amiss, by showing
 very fully, 
 
 1. God's incontestable justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:10-12,17,19,23">ver.  10-12, 17, 19, 23</A>.

 2.  His sovereign dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 3. His almighty power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:20,24">ver. 20, 24</A>.

 4. His omniscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:21,22,25">ver.  21, 22, 25</A>.

 5.  His severity against sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 6. His overruling providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:29,30">ver. 29, 30</A>.

 IV. He teaches him what he should say, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:31,32">ver. 31, 32</A>.

 And then, lastly, he leaves the matter to Job's own conscience, and 
 concludes with a sharp reproof of him for his peevishness and 
 discontent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:33-37">ver. 33-37</A>.

 All this Job not only bore patiently, but took kindly, because he saw 
 that Elihu meant well; and, whereas his other friends had accused him 
 of that from which his own conscience acquitted him, Elihu charged him 
 with that only for which, it is probable, his own heart, now upon the 
 reflection, began to smite him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Hear my words, O ye wise <I>men;</I> and give ear unto me, ye that
 have knowledge.
 &nbsp; 3  For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
 &nbsp; 4  Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves
 what <I>is</I> good.
 &nbsp; 5  For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
 judgment.
 &nbsp; 6  Should I lie against my right? my wound <I>is</I> incurable
 without transgression.
 &nbsp; 7  What man <I>is</I> like Job, <I>who</I> drinketh up scorning like
 water?
 &nbsp; 8  Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
 walketh with wicked men.
 &nbsp; 9  For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
 delight himself with God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Elihu humbly addresses himself to the auditors, and endeavours, like
 an orator, to gain their good-will and their favourable attention. 

 1.  He calls them <I>wise men,</I> and men that <I>had knowledge,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is comfortable dealing with such as understand sense. <I>I speak as
 to wise men,</I> who can <I>judge what I say,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:15">1 Cor. x. 15</A>.

 Elihu differed in opinion from them, and yet he calls them wise and
 knowing men. Peevish disputants think all fools that are not of their 
 mind; but it is a piece of justice which we owe to those who are wise 
 to acknowledge it, though our sentiments do not agree with theirs. 

 2.  He appeals to their judgment, and therefore submits to their trial,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>The ear</I> of the judicious <I>tries words,</I> whether what is 
 said be true or false, right or wrong, and he that speaks must stand 
 the test of the intelligent. As we must prove all things we hear, so we 
 must be willing that what we speak should be proved. 

 3. He takes them into partnership with him in the examination and 
 discussion of this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He does not pretend to be sole dictator, nor undertake to say what is 
 just and good and what is not, but he is willing to join with them in 
 searching it out, and desires a consultation: "Let us agree to lay 
 aside all animosities and feuds, all prejudices and affectation of 
 contradiction, and all stiffness in adhering to the opinion we have 
 once espoused, and <I>let us choose to ourselves judgment;</I> let us 
 fix right principles on which to proceed, and then take right methods 
 for finding out truth; and <I>let us know among ourselves,</I> by 
 comparing notes and communicating our reasons, <I>what is good</I> and 
 what is otherwise." Note, We are then likely to discern what is right 
 when we agree to assist one another in searching it out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He warmly accuses Job for some passionate words which he had 
 spoken, that reflected on the divine government, appealing to the house 
 whether he ought not to be called to the bar and checked for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He recites the words which Job had spoken, as nearly as he can 
 remember. 

 (1.) He had insisted upon his own innocency. Job hath said, <I>I am
 righteous</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and, when urged to confess his guilt, had stiffly maintained his plea
 of, <I>Not guilty: Should I lie against my right?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Job had spoken to this purport, <I>My righteousness I hold fast,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:6"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 6</A>.

 (2.) He had charged God with injustice in his dealings with him, that
 he had wronged him in afflicting him and had not righted him:

 <I>God has taken away my judgment;</I> so Job had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:2"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2</A>.

 (3.) He had despaired of relief and concluded that God could not, or
 would not, help him: <I>My wound is incurable,</I> and likely to be 
 mortal, and yet <I>without transgression; not for any injustice in my 
 hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:16,17"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16, 17</A>.

 (4.) He had, in effect, said that there is nothing to be got in the
 service of God and that no man will be the better at last for his 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He hath said</I> that which gives occasion to suspect that he thinks
 <I>it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with 
 God.</I> It is granted that there is a present pleasure in religion; 
 for what is it but to delight ourselves with God, in communion with 
 him, in concurrence with him, in walking with him as Enoch did? this is 
 a true notion of religion, and bespeaks its ways to be pleasantness. 
 Yet the advantage of it is denied, as if it were <I>vain to serve 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:14">Mal. iii. 14</A>.

 This Elihu gathers as Job's opinion, by an innuendo from what he said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:22"><I>ch.</I>  ix. 22</A>),

 <I>He destroys the perfect and the wicked,</I> which has a truth in it
 (for all things come alike to all), but it was ill expressed, and gave 
 too much occasion for this imputation, and therefore Job sat down 
 silently under it and attempted not his own vindication, whence Mr. 
 Caryl well observes that good men sometimes speak worse than they mean, 
 and that a good man will rather bear more blame than he deserves than 
 to stand to excuse himself when he has deserved any blame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He charges Job very high upon it. In general, <I>What man is like 
 Job?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "Did you ever know such a man as Job, or ever hear a man talk at such 
 an extravagant rate?" He represents him,

 (1.) As sitting in the seat of the scornful: "He <I>drinketh up
 scorning like water,</I>" that is, "he takes a great deal of liberty to 
 reproach both God and his friends, takes a pleasure in so doing, and is 
 very liberal in his reflections." Or, "He is very greedy in receiving 
 and hearkening to the scorns and contempts which others cast upon their 
 brethren, is well pleased with them and extols them." Or, as some 
 explain it, "By these foolish expressions of his he makes himself the 
 object of scorn, lays himself very open to reproach, and gives occasion 
 to others to laugh at him; while his religion suffers by them, and the 
 reputation of that is wounded through his side." We have need to pray 
 that God will never leave us to ourselves to say or do any thing which 
 may <I>make us a reproach to the foolish,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:8">Ps. xxxix. 8</A>.

 (2.) As walking in the course of the ungodly, and standing in the way
 of sinners: He <I>goes in company with the workers of iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 not that in his conversation he did associate with them, but in his
 opinion he did favour and countenance them, and strengthen their hands. 
 If (as it follows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 for the proof of this) <I>it profits a man nothing to delight himself
 in God,</I> why should he not lay the reins on the neck of his lusts 
 and herd with the workers of iniquity? He that says, I have <I>cleansed 
 my hands in vain,</I> does not only <I>offend against the generation of 
 God's children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:13,14">Ps. lxxii. 13, 14</A>),

 but gratifies his enemies, and says as they say.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be
 it from God, <I>that he should do</I> wickedness; and <I>from</I> the
 Almighty, <I>that he should commit</I> iniquity.
 &nbsp; 11  For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
 every man to find according to <I>his</I> ways.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
 Almighty pervert judgment.
 &nbsp; 13  Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
 disposed the whole world?
 &nbsp; 14  If he set his heart upon man, <I>if</I> he gather unto himself
 his spirit and his breath;
 &nbsp; 15  All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again
 unto dust.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of Elihu's discourse to reconcile Job to his afflictions and 
 to pacify his spirit under them. In order to this he had shown, in the 
 foregoing chapter, that God meant him no hurt in afflicting him, but 
 intended it for his spiritual benefit.  In this chapter he shows that 
 he did him no wrong in afflicting him, nor punished him more than he 
 deserved. If the former could not prevail to satisfy him, yet this 
 ought to silence him. In these verses he directs his discourse to all 
 the company: "<I>Hearken to me, you men of understanding</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 and show yourselves to be intelligent by assenting to this which I
 say." And this is that which he says, That the righteous God never did, 
 nor ever will do, any wrong to any of his creatures, but his ways are 
 equal, ours are unequal. The truth here maintained respects the justice 
 of equity of all God's proceedings. Now observe in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How plainly this truth is laid down, both negatively and positively. 

 1. He does wrong to none: <I>God cannot do wickedness,</I> nor <I>the 
 Almighty commit iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is inconsistent with the perfection of his nature, and so it is also 
 with the purity of his will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert
 judgment.</I> He neither can nor will do a wrong thing, nor deal hardly 
 with any man. He will never inflict the evil of punishment but where he 
 finds the evil of sin, nor in any undue proportion, for that would be 
 to commit iniquity and do wickedly. If appeals be made to him, or he be 
 to give a definitive sentence, he will have an eye to the merits of the 
 cause and not respect the person, for that were to pervert judgment. He 
 will never either do any man wrong or deny any man right, but <I>the 
 heavens will shortly declare his righteousness.</I> Because he is God, 
 and therefore is infinitely perfect and holy, he can neither do wrong 
 himself nor countenance it in others, nay more than he can die, or lie, 
 or deny himself. Though he be Almighty, yet he never uses his power, as 
 mighty men often do, for the support of injustice. He is 
 <I>Shaddai</I>--God <I>all-sufficient,</I> and therefore he cannot be 
 <I>tempted with evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13">James i. 13</A>),

 to do an unrighteous thing.

 2.  He ministers justice to all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The work of a man shall he render unto him.</I> Good works shall be
 rewarded and evil works either punished or satisfied for; so that 
 sooner or later, in this world or in that to come, he will cause every 
 man to find according to his ways.  This is the standing rule of 
 distributive justice, to give to every man according to his work. 
 <I>Say to the righteous, it shall be well with them; woe to the wicked, 
 it shall be ill with them.</I> If services persevered in now go 
 unrewarded, and sins persisted in now go unpunished, yet there is a day 
 coming when God will fully render to every man according to his works, 
 with interest for the delay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How warmly it is asserted, 

 1. With an assurance of the truth of it: <I>Yea, surely,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is a truth which none can deny or call in question; it is what we 
 may take for granted and are all agreed in, That God will not do 
 wickedly. 
 
 2. With an abhorrence of the very thought of the contrary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Far be it from God that he should do wickedness,</I> and from us
 that we should entertain the least suspicion of it or say any thing 
 that looks like charging him with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How evidently it is proved by two arguments:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His independent absolute sovereignty and dominion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Who has given him a charge over the earth</I> and deputed him to
 manage the affairs of men upon the earth? Or, Who besides has disposed 
 the whole world of mankind? He has the sole administration of the 
 kingdoms of men, and has it of himself, nor is he entrusted with it by 
 or for any other.

 (1.) It is certain that the government is his, and he does according to
 his will in all the hosts both of heaven and earth; and therefore he is 
 not to be charged with injustice; for <I>shall not the Judge of all the 
 earth do right?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>.

 How shall God either rule or judge the world if there be, or could be,
 any <I>unrighteousness with him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 He that is entitled to such unlimited power most certainly have in
 himself unspotted purity.  This is also a good reason why we should 
 acquiesce in all God's dealings with us. Shall not he that disposes of 
 the whole world dispose of us and our concerns?

 (2.) It is as certain that he does not derive his power from any, nor
 is it a dispensation that is committed to him, but his power is 
 original, and, like his being, of himself; and therefore, if he were 
 not perfectly just, all the world and the affairs of it would soon be 
 in the utmost confusion. The highest powers on earth have a God above 
 them, to whom they are accountable, because it is not far from them to 
 do iniquity. But <I>therefore</I> God has none above him, because it is 
 not possible that he should do any thing (such is the perfection of his 
 nature) that should need to be controlled.  And, if he be an absolute 
 sovereign, we are bound to submit to him, for there is no higher power 
 to which we may appeal, so that the virtue is a necessity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His irresistible power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>If he set his heart upon man,</I> to contend with him, much more
 <I>if</I> (as some read it) <I>he set his heart against man,</I> to 
 ruin him, if he should deal with man either by <I>summa potestas--mere 
 sovereignty,</I> or by <I>summum jus--strict justice,</I> there were no 
 standing before him; man's spirit and breath would soon be gone and 
 <I>all flesh would perish together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Many men's honesty is owing purely to their impotency; they do not do 
 wrong because they cannot support it when it is done, or it is not in 
 their power to do it. But God is able to crush any man easily and 
 suddenly, and yet does not by arbitrary power crush any man, which 
 therefore must be attributed to the infinite perfection of his nature, 
 and that is immutable. See here,

 (1.) What God can do with us. He can soon bring us to dust; there needs
 not any positive act of his omnipotence to do it; if he do but withdraw 
 that concurrence of his providence by which we live, <I>if he gather 
 unto himself that spirit and breath</I> which was from his hand at 
 first and is still in his hand, we expire immediately, like an animal 
 in an air-pump when the air is exhausted.

 (2.) What he may do with us without doing us wrong.  He may recall the
 being he gave, of which we are but tenants at will, and which also we 
 have forfeited; and therefore, as long as that is continued of his mere 
 favour, we have no reason to cry out of wrong, whatever other comforts 
 are removed.</P>

 &nbsp; 17  Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou
 condemn him that is most just?
 &nbsp; 18  <I>Is it fit</I> to say to a king, <I>Thou art</I> wicked? <I>and</I> to
 princes, <I>Ye are</I> ungodly?
 &nbsp; 19  <I>How much less to him</I> that accepteth not the persons of
 princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all
 <I>are</I> the work of his hands.
 &nbsp; 20  In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
 at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
 without hand.
 &nbsp; 21  For his eyes <I>are</I> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all
 his goings.
 &nbsp; 22  <I>There is</I> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the
 workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
 &nbsp; 23  For he will not lay upon man more <I>than right;</I> that he
 should enter into judgment with God.
 &nbsp; 24  He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
 others in their stead.
 &nbsp; 25  Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <I>them</I>
 in the night, so that they are destroyed.
 &nbsp; 26  He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
 &nbsp; 27  Because they turned back from him, and would not consider
 any of his ways:
 &nbsp; 28  So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
 he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
 &nbsp; 29  When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and
 when he hideth <I>his</I> face, who then can behold him? whether <I>it
 be done</I> against a nation, or against a man only:
 &nbsp; 30  That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu here addresses himself more directly to Job. He had spoken to the 
 rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 as <I>men of understanding;</I> now, speaking to Job; he puts an
 <I>if</I> upon his understanding: <I>If thou hast understanding,</I> 
 hear this and observe it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Hear this, That God is not to be quarrelled with for any thing that 
 he does. It is daring presumption to arraign and condemn God's 
 proceedings, as Job had done by his discontents. It was, 

 1. As absurd as it would be to advance one to power that is a professed 
 enemy to justice: <I>Shall even he that hates right govern?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The righteous Lord so loves righteousness that, in comparison with him, 
 even Job himself, though a perfect and upright man, might be said to 
 hate right; and shall he govern?  Shall he pretend to direct God or 
 correct what he does? Shall such unrighteous creatures as we are give 
 law to the righteous God? or must he take his measures from us? When we 
 consider the corruption of our nature, and the contrariety there is in 
 us to the eternal rule of equity, we cannot but see it to be an 
 impudent impious thing for us to prescribe to God. 

 2. It was as absurd as it would be to call a most righteous innocent
 person to the bar, and to give judgment against him, though it appeared 
 ever so plainly, upon the trial, that he was most just: <I>Wilt thou 
 condemn him that is righteous in all his ways,</I> and cannot but be 
 so? 

 3. It is more absurd and unbecoming than it would be to say to a 
 sovereign prince, <I>Thou art wicked,</I> and to judges upon the bench, 
 <I>You are ungodly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This would be looked upon as an insufferable affront to majesty and to 
 magistracy; no king, no prince, would bear it. In favour of government, 
 we presume it is a right sentence that is passed, unless the contrary 
 be very evident; but, whatever we think, it is not fit to tell a king 
 to his face that he is wicked. Nathan reproved David by a parable. But, 
 whatever a high priest or a prophet might do, it is not for an ordinary 
 subject to make so bold with the powers that are. How absurd is then to 
 say so to God--to impute iniquity to him, who, having no respect of 
 persons, is in no temptation to do an unjust thing! <I>He regardeth not 
 the rich more than the poor,</I> and therefore it is fit he should 
 rule, and it is not fit we should find fault with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, Rich and poor stand upon the same level before God. A great man 
 shall fare never the better, nor find any favour, for his wealth and 
 greatness; nor shall a poor man fare ever the worse for his poverty, 
 nor an honest cause be starved.  Job, now that he was poor, should have 
 as much favour with God, and be as much regarded by him, as when he was 
 rich; <I>for they are all the work of his hands.</I> Their persons are 
 so: the poor are made by the same hand, and of the same mould, as the 
 rich. Their conditions are so: the poor were made poor by the divine 
 providence, as well as the rich made rich; and therefore the poor shall 
 fare never the worse for that which is their lot, not their fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hear this, That God is to be acknowledged and submitted to in all 
 that he does. Divers considerations Elihu here suggests to Job, to 
 beget in him great and high thoughts of God, and so to persuade him to 
 submit and proceed no further in his quarrel with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God is almighty, and able to deal with the strongest of men when he 
 enters into judgment with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 even <I>the people,</I> the body of a nation, though ever so numerous,
 <I>shall be troubled,</I> unhinged, and put into disorder, when God 
 pleases; even <I>the mighty</I> man, the prince, though ever so 
 honourable, ever so formidable among men, <I>shall,</I> if God speak 
 the word, <I>be taken away</I> out of his throne, nay, out of the land 
 of the living; they shall die; they shall pass away.  What cannot he do 
 that has all the powers of death at his command? Observe the suddenness 
 of this destruction: <I>In a moment shall they die.</I> It is not a 
 work of time, with God, to bring down his proud enemies, but, when he 
 pleases, it is soon done; nor is he bound to give them warning, no, not 
 an hour's warning. <I>This night thy soul shall be required.</I> 
 Observe the season of it: <I>They shall be troubled at midnight,</I> 
 when they are secure and careless, and unable to help themselves; as 
 the Egyptians when their first-born were slain. This is the immediate 
 work of God: they are taken away, <I>without hand,</I> insensibly, by 
 secret judgments. God can himself humble the greatest tyrant, without 
 the assistance or agency of any man. Whatever hand he sometimes uses in 
 the accomplishing of his purposes, he needs none, but can do it without 
 hand. Nor is it one single mighty man only that he can thus overpower, 
 but even hosts of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number;</I> for no
 combined power can stand it out against Omnipotence. Yet, when God 
 destroys tyranny, he does not design anarchy; if those are brought down 
 that ruled ill, it does not therefore follow that people must have no 
 rulers; for, when he breaks mighty men, he <I>sets others in their 
 stead,</I> that will rule better, or, if they do not, <I>he overturns 
 them</I> also <I>in the night,</I> or in a night, <I>so that they are 
 destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Witness Belshazzar. Or, if he designs them space to repent, he does not 
 presently destroy them, but <I>he strikes them as wicked men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Some humbling mortifying judgments are brought upon them; these wicked 
 rulers are stricken as other wicked men, as surely, as sorely, stricken 
 in their bodies, estates, or families, and this for warning to their 
 neighbours; the stroke is given <I>in terrorem--as an alarm to 
 others,</I> and therefore is given <I>in the open sight of others,</I> 
 that they also may see and fear, and tremble before the justice of God.  
 If kings stand not before him, how shall we stand!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God is omniscient, and can discover that which is most secret. As 
 the strongest cannot oppose his arm, so the most subtle cannot escape 
 his eye; and therefore, if some are punished either more or less than 
 we think they should be, instead of quarrelling with God, it becomes us 
 to ascribe it to some secret cause known to God only. For, 

 (1.) Every thing is open before him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>His eyes are upon the ways of man;</I> not only they are within
 reach of his eye, so that he can see them, but his eye is upon them, so 
 that he actually observes and inspects them. He sees us all, and sees 
 all our goings; go where we will, we are under his eye; all our 
 actions, good and evil, are regarded and recorded and reserved to be 
 brought into judgment when the books shall be opened.

 (2.) Nothing is or can be concealed from him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>There is no darkness nor shadow of death</I> so close, so thick, so
 solitary, so remote from light or sight as that in it <I>the workers of 
 iniquity may hide themselves</I> from the discovering eye and avenging 
 hand of the righteous God. Observe here, 

 [1.] The workers of iniquity would hide themselves if they could from 
 the eye of the world for shame (and that perhaps they may do), and from 
 the eye of God for fear, as Adam among the trees of the garden. The day 
 is coming when mighty men, and chief captains, will call to the rocks 
 and mountains to hide them.

 [2.] They would gladly be hid even by the shadow of death, be hid in
 the grave, and lie for ever there, rather than appear before the 
 judgment-seat of Christ.

 (3.) It is in vain to think of flying from God's justice, or absconding
 when his wrath is in pursuit of us. The workers of iniquity may find 
 ways and means to hide themselves from men, but not from God: <I>He 
 knows their works</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 both what they do and what they design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God is righteous, and, in all his proceedings, goes according to the 
 rules of equity. Even when he is overturning mighty men, and breaking 
 them in pieces, yet <I>he will not lay upon man more than right,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 As he will not punish the innocent, so he will not exact of those that 
 are guilty more than their iniquities deserve; and of the proportion 
 between the sin and the punishment Infinite Wisdom shall be the judge. 
 He will not give any man cause to complain that he deals hardly with 
 him, nor shall any man <I>enter into judgment with God,</I> or bring an 
 action against him. If he do, God will be justified when he speaks and 
 clear when he judges. Therefore Job was very much to be blamed for his 
 complaints of God, and is here well-advised to let fall his action, for 
 he would certainly be cast or non-suited. <I>It is not for man ever to 
 purpose to enter into judgment with the Omnipotent;</I> so some read 
 the whole verse. Job had often wished to plead his cause before God. 
 Elihu asks, "To what purpose? The judgment already given concerning 
 thee will certainly be affirmed; no errors can be found in it, nor any 
 exceptions taken to it, but, after all, it must rest as it is." All is 
 well that God does, and will be found so. To prove that when God 
 destroys the mighty men, and <I>strikes them as wicked men,</I> he does 
 not <I>lay upon them more than right,</I> he shows what their 
 wickedness was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>);

 and let any compare that with their punishment, and then judge whether
 they did not deserve it.  In short, these unjust judges, whom God will 
 justly judge, neither <I>feared God nor regarded man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:2">Luke xviii. 2</A>.

 (1.) They were rebels to God: They <I>turned back from him,</I> cast
 off the fear of him, and abandoned the very thoughts of him; for 
 <I>they would not consider any of his ways,</I> took no heed either to 
 his precepts or to his providences, but lived without God in the world. 
 This is at the bottom of all the wickedness of the wicked, they turn 
 back from God; and it is because they do not consider, not because they 
 cannot, but because they will not. From inconsideration comes impiety, 
 and thence all immorality. 

 (2.) They were tyrants to all mankind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>.

 They will not call upon God for themselves; but they <I>cause the cry 
 of the poor to come to him,</I> and that cry is against them. They are 
 injurious and oppressive to the poor, wrong them, crush them, 
 impoverish them yet more, and add affliction to the afflicted, who cry 
 unto God, make their complaint to him, and he hears them and pleads 
 their cause. Their case is bad who have the prayers and tears of the 
 poor against them; for the cry of the oppressed will, sooner or later, 
 draw down vengeance on the heads of the oppressors, and no one can say 
 that this is <I>more than right,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:23">Exod. xxii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God has an uncontrollable dominion in all the affairs of the 
 children of men, and so guides and governs whatever concerns both 
 communities and particular persons, that, as what he designs cannot be 
 defeated, so what he does cannot be changed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29"><I>v.</I>  29</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The frowns of all the world cannot trouble those whom God quiets
 with his smiles. <I>When he gives quietness</I> who then <I>can make 
 trouble?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This is a challenge to all the powers of hell and earth to disquiet 
 those to whom God speaks peace, and for whom he creates it. If God give 
 outward peace to a nation, he can secure what he gives, and disable the 
 enemies of it to give it any disturbance. If God give inward peace to a 
 man only, the quietness and everlasting assurance which are the effect 
 of righteousness, neither the accusations of Satan nor the afflictions 
 of this present time, no, nor the arrests of death itself, can give 
 trouble. What can make those uneasy whose <I>souls dwell at ease in 
 God?</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:7">Phil. iv. 7</A>.

 (2.) The smiles of all the world cannot quiet those whom God troubles
 with his frowns; for if he, in displeasure, <I>hide his face,</I> and 
 withhold the comfort of his favour, <I>who then can behold him?</I> 
 that is, Who can behold a displeased God, so as to bear up under his 
 wrath or turn it away? Who can make him show his face when he resolves 
 to hide it, or see through the clouds and darkness which are round 
 about him? Or, Who can behold a disquieted sinner, so as to give him 
 effectual relief? Who can stand a friend to him to whom God is an 
 enemy? None can relieve the distresses of the outward condition without 
 God. <I>If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:27">2 Kings vi. 27</A>.

 Nor can any relieve the distresses of the mind against God and his
 terrors. If he impress the sense of his wrath upon a guilty conscience, 
 all the comforts the creature can administer are ineffectual. <I>As 
 vinegar upon nitre, so are songs to a heavy heart.</I> The 
 irresistibleness of God's operations must be acknowledged in his 
 dealings both with communities and with particular persons: what he 
 does cannot be controlled, <I>whether it be done against a nation</I> 
 in its public capacity <I>or against a man only</I> in his private 
 affairs. The same Providence that governs mighty kingdoms presides in 
 the concerns of the meanest individual; and neither the strength of a 
 whole nation can resist his power nor the smallness of a single person 
 evade his cognizance; but what he does shall be done effectually and 
 victoriously.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. God is wise, and careful of the public welfare, and therefore 
 provides <I>that the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be 
 ensnared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) The pride of hypocrites. They aim to reign; the praise of men, and
 power in the world, are their reward, what they aim at.

 (2.) The policy of tyrants. When they aim to set up themselves they
 sometimes make use of religion as a cloak and cover for their ambition 
 and by their hypocrisy come to the throne.

 (3.) The danger the people are in when hypocrites reign. They are
 likely to be ensnared in sin, or trouble, or both. Power, in the hands 
 of dissemblers, is often destructive to the rights and liberties of a 
 people, which they are more easily wheedled out of than forced out of.  
 Much mischief has been done likewise to the power of godliness under 
 the pretence of a form of godliness.

 (4.) The care which divine Providence takes of the people, to prevent
 this danger, <I>that the hypocrite reign not,</I> either that he do not 
 reign at all or that he do not reign long. If God has mercy in store 
 for a people, he will either prevent the rise or hasten the ruin of 
 hypocritical rulers.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Elihu instructs Job what he should say under his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 Having reproved him for his peevish passionate words, he here puts 
 better words into his mouth. When we reprove for what is amiss we must 
 direct to what is good, that our reproofs may be <I>the reproofs of 
 instruction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:23">Prov. vi. 23</A>.

 He does not impose it upon Job to use these words, but recommends it to
 him, as that which was <I>meet to be said.</I> In general, he would 
 have him repent of his misconduct, and indecent expressions, under his 
 affliction. Job's other friends would have had him own himself a wicked 
 man, and by overdoing they undid.  Elihu will oblige him only to own 
 that he had, in the management of this controversy, <I>spoken 
 unadvisedly with his lips.</I> Let us remember this, in giving 
 reproofs, and not make the matter worse than it is; for the stretching 
 of the crime may defeat the prosecution.  Elihu drives the right nail, 
 and speeds accordingly. He directs Job,

 1.  To humble himself before God for his sins, and to accept the 
 punishment of them: "<I>I have borne chastisement.</I> What I suffer 
 comes justly upon me, and therefore I will bear it, and not only 
 justify God in it, but acknowledge his goodness." Many are chastised 
 that do not bear chastisement, do not bear it well, and so, in effect, 
 do not bear it at all. Penitents, if sincere, will take all well that 
 God does, and will bear chastisement as a medicinal operation intended 
 for good. 
 
 2. To pray to God to discover his sins to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 "<I>That which I see not teach thou me.</I> Lord, upon the review, I
 find much amiss in me and much done amiss by me, but I have reason to 
 fear there is much more that I am not aware of, greater abominations, 
 which through ignorance, mistake, and partiality to myself, I do not 
 yet see; Lord, give me to see it, awaken by conscience to do its office 
 faithfully." A good man is willing to know the worst of himself, and 
 particularly, under affliction, desires to be told wherefore God 
 contends with him and what God designs in correcting him.

 3. To promise reformation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>I will not offend any more. "If I have done iniquity (or seeing that
 I have), I will do so no more;</I> whatever thou shalt discover to me 
 to have been amiss, by thy grace I will amend it for the future." This 
 implies a confession that we have offended, true remorse and godly 
 sorrow for the offence, and a humble compliance with God's design in 
 afflicting us, which is to separate between us and our sins. The 
 penitent here completes his repentance; for it is not enough to be 
 sorry for our sins, but we must go and sin no more, and, as here, bind 
 ourselves with the bond of a fixed resolution never more to return to 
 folly. This is meet to be said in a stedfast purpose, and meet to be 
 said to God in a solemn promise and vow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reasons with him concerning his discontent and uneasiness under 
 his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We are ready to think every thing that concerns us should be just as we 
 would have it; but Elihu here shows, 

 1. That it is absurd and unreasonable to expect this: "<I>Should it be 
 according to thy mind?</I> No, what reason for that?" Elihu here speaks 
 with a great deference to the divine will and wisdom, and a 
 satisfaction therein: it is highly fit that every thing should be 
 according to God's mind. He speaks also with a just disdain of the 
 pretensions of those that are proud, and would be their own carvers: 
 <I>Should it be according to thy mind?</I> Should we always have the 
 good we have a mind to enjoy? We should then wrongfully encroach upon 
 others and foolishly ensnare ourselves. Must we never be afflicted, 
 because we have no mind to it?  Is it fit that sinners should feel no 
 smart, that scholars should be under no discipline? Or, if we must be 
 afflicted, is it fit that we should choose what rod we will be beaten 
 with? No; it is fit that every thing should be according to God's mind, 
 and not ours; for he is the Creator, and we are creatures. He is 
 infinitely wise and knowing; we are foolish and short-sighted. He is in 
 one mind; we are in many. 

 2.  That it is in vain, and to no purpose, to expect it: "<I>He will
 recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose.</I> God will 
 take his own way, fulfil his own counsel, and recompense according to 
 the sentence of his own justice, whether thou art pleased or 
 displeased; he will neither ask thy leave nor ask thy advice, but, what 
 he pleases, that will he do. It is therefore thy wisdom to be easy, and 
 make a virtue of necessity; <I>make the best of that which is,</I> 
 because it is out of thy power to make it otherwise.  If thou pretend 
 to choose and refuse," that is, "to prescribe to God and except against 
 what he does, so will not I--I will acquiesce in all he does; and 
 <I>therefore speak what thou knowest;</I> say what thou wilt do, 
 whether thou wilt oppose or submit. The matter lies plainly before 
 thee; be at a point; thou art in God's hand, not in mine."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He appeals to all intelligent indifferent persons whether there 
 was not a great deal of sin and folly in that which Job said. 

 1. He would have the matter thoroughly examined, and brought to an 
 issue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 "<I>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end.</I> If any will
 undertake to justify what he has said, let them do it; if not, let us 
 all agree to bear our testimony against it." Many understand it of his 
 trial by afflictions: "Let his troubles be continued till he be 
 thoroughly humbled, and his proud spirit brought down, till he be made 
 to see his error and to retract what he has so presumptuously said 
 against God and his providence. Let the trial be continued till the end 
 be obtained." 

 2. He appeals both to God and man, and desires the judgment of both
 upon it.

 (1.) Some read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>

 as an appeal to God: <I>O, my Father! let Job be tried.</I> So the
 margin of our Bibles, for the same word signifies <I>my desire</I> and 
 <I>my father;</I> and some suppose that he lifted up his eyes when he 
 said this, meaning, "<I>O my Father who art in heaven!</I> let Job be 
 tried till he be subdued." When we are praying for the benefit of 
 afflictions either to ourselves or others we must eye God as a Father, 
 because they are fatherly corrections and a part of our filial 
 education,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:7">Heb. xii. 7</A>.

 (2.) He appeals to the by-standers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 "<I>Let men of understanding tell me</I> whether they can put any more
 favourable construction upon Job's words than I have put, and whether 
 he has not spoken very ill and ought not to cry, <I>Peccavi--I have 
 done wrong.</I>" In what Job had said he thought it appeared, 

 [1.] That he did not rightly understand himself, but had talked
 foolishly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 He cannot say that Job is without knowledge and wisdom; but, in this
 matter, <I>he has spoken without knowledge,</I> and, whatever his heart 
 is, <I>his words were without prudence.</I> What he said to his wife 
 may be retorted upon himself (<I>He speaks as one of the foolish men 
 speak</I>) and for the same reason, <I>Shall we not receive evil as 
 well as good</I> at God's hand?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>.

 Sometimes we need and deserve those reproofs ourselves which we have
 given to others. Those that reproach God's wisdom really reproach their 
 own. 

 [2.] That he had not a due regard to God, but had talked wickedly.  If 
 what he had said <I>be tried to the end,</I> that is, if one put it to 
 the utmost stretch and make the worst of it, it will be found, 
 <I>First,</I> That he has taken part with God's enemies: <I>His 
 answers</I> have been <I>for wicked men;</I> that is, what he had said 
 tended to strengthen the hands and harden the hearts of wicked people 
 in their wickedness, he having carried the matter of their prosperity 
 much further than he needed. Let wicked men, like Baal, plead for 
 themselves if they will, but far be it from us that we should answer 
 for them, or say any thing in favour of them. <I>Secondly,</I> That he 
 has insulted God's friends, and hectored over them: "<I>He clappeth his 
 hands among us;</I> and, if he be not thoroughly tried and humbled, 
 will grow yet more insolent and imperious, as if he had gotten the day 
 and silenced us all." To speak ill is bad enough, but to clap our hands 
 and triumph in it when we have done, as if error and passion had won 
 the victory, is much worse.  <I>Thirdly,</I> That he has spoken against 
 God himself, and, by standing to what he had said, <I>added rebellion 
 to his sin.</I> To speak, though but one word, against God, by whom we 
 speak and for whom we ought to speak, is a great sin; what is it then 
 to multiply words against him, as if we would out-talk him?  What is it 
 to repeat them, instead of unsaying them? Those that have sinned, and, 
 when they are called to repent, thus go on frowardly, add rebellion to 
 their sin and make it exceedingly sinful.  <I>Errare possum, 
 H&aelig;reticus esse nolo--I may fall into error, but I will not plunge 
 into heresy.</I></P>
