 Solomon, in this chapter, comes to recommend wisdom to us as the most 
 powerful antidote against both the temptations and vexations that arise 
 from the vanity of the world. Here is, 

 I. The benefit and praise of wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Some particular instances of wisdom prescribed to us. 

 1. We must keep in due subjection to the government God has set over us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 2. We must get ready for sudden evils, and especially for sudden death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 3. We must arm ourselves against the temptation of an oppressive
 government and not think it strange, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 The impunity of oppressors makes them more daring

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">ver. 11</A>),

 but in the issue it will be well with the righteous and ill with the
 wicked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),

 and therefore the present prosperity of the wicked and afflictions of 
 the righteous ought not to be a stumbling-block to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:14">ver. 14</A>.

 4. We must cheerfully use the gifts of God's providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:15">ver. 15</A>.

 5. We must with an entire satisfaction acquiesce in the will of God, 
 and, not pretending to find the bottom, we must humbly and silently
 adore the depth of his unsearchable counsels, being assured they are
 all wise, just, and good,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Who <I>is</I> as the wise <I>man?</I> and who knoweth the
 interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to
 shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
 &nbsp; 2  I <I>counsel thee</I> to keep the king's commandment, and <I>that</I>
 in regard of the oath of God.
 &nbsp; 3  Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
 thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
 &nbsp; 4  Where the word of a king <I>is, there is</I> power: and who may

 wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. An encomium of <I>wisdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that is, of true piety, guided in all its exercises by prudence and
 discretion. The wise man is the good man, that knows God and glorifies
 him, knows himself and does well for himself; his wisdom is a great
 happiness to him, for,

 1. It advances him above his neighbours, and makes him more excellent
 than they: <I>Who is as the wise man?</I> Note, Heavenly wisdom will
 make a man an incomparable man. No man without grace, though he be
 learned, or noble, or rich, is to be compared with a man that has true
 grace and is therefore accepted of God.

 2. It makes him useful among his neighbours and very serviceable to
 them: <I>Who</I> but the <I>wise man knows the interpretation of a
 thing,</I> that is, understands the times and the events of them, and
 their critical junctures, so as to direct <I>what Israel ought to
 do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:32">1 Chron. xii. 32</A>.

 3. It beautifies a man in the eyes of his friends: <I>It makes his face 
 to shine,</I> as Moses's did when he came down from the mount; it puts 
 honour upon a man and a lustre on his whole conversation, makes him to 
 be regarded and taken notice of, and gains him respect (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:7">Job xxix. 7</A>,

 &c.); it makes him lovely and amiable, and the darling and blessing of
 his country. <I>The strength of his face,</I> the sourness and severity 
 of his countenance (so some understand the last clause), <I>shall be 
 changed</I> by it into that which is sweet and obliging. Even those 
 whose natural temper is rough and morose by <I>wisdom</I> are strangely 
 altered; they become mild and gentle, and learn to look pleasant. 

 4. It emboldens a man against his adversaries, their attempts and their
 scorn: <I>The boldness of his face shall be</I> doubled by wisdom; it 
 will add very much to his courage in maintaining his integrity when he 
 not only has an honest cause to plead, but by his wisdom knows how to 
 manage it and where to find <I>the interpretation of a thing. He shall 
 not be ashamed, but shall speak with his enemy in the gate.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular instance of wisdom pressed upon us, and that is 
 subjection to authority, and a dutiful and peaceable perseverance in 
 our allegiance to the government which Providence has set over us.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the duty of subjects is here described. 

 (1.) We must be observant of the laws. In all those things wherein the 
 civil power is to interpose, whether legislative or judicial, we ought 
 to submit to its order and constitutions: <I>I counsel thee;</I> it may 
 as well be supplied, <I>I charge thee,</I> not only as a prince but as 
 a preacher: he might do both; "I recommend it to thee as a piece of 
 wisdom; I say, whatever those say that are given to change, <I>keep the 
 king's commandment;</I> wherever the sovereign power is lodged, be 
 subject to it. <I>Observe the mouth of a king</I>" (so the phrase is); 
 "say as he says; do as he bids thee; let his word be a law, or rather 
 let the law be his word." Some understand the following clause as a 
 limitation of this obedience: "<I>Keep the king's commandment,</I> yet 
 so as to have a <I>regard to the oath of God,</I> that is, so as to 
 keep a good conscience and not to violate thy obligations to God, which 
 are prior and superior to thy obligations to the king. <I>Render to
 C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's,</I> but so as to reserve 
 pure and entire <I>to God the things that are</I> his." 

 (2.) We must not be forward to find fault with the public 
 administration, or quarrel with every thing that is not just according 
 to our mind, nor quit our post of service under the government, and 
 throw it up, upon every discontent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "<I>Be not hasty to go out of his sight,</I> when he is displeased at 
 thee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4"><I>ch.</I> x. 4</A>),

 or when thou art displeased at him; fly not off in a passion, nor
 entertain such jealousies of him as will tempt thee to renounce the 
 court or forsake the kingdom." Solomon's subjects, as soon as his head 
 was laid low, went directly contrary to this rule, when upon the rough 
 answer which Rehoboam gave them, they were <I>hasty to go out of his 
 sight,</I> would not take time for second thoughts nor admit proposals 
 of accommodation, but cried, <I>To your tents, O Israel!</I> "There may 
 perhaps be a just cause <I>to go out of his sight;</I> but <I>be not 
 hasty</I> to do it; act with great deliberation." 

 (3.) We must not persist in a fault when it is shown us: "<I>Stand not 
 in an evil thing;</I> in any offence thou hast given to thy prince 
 humble thyself, and do not justify thyself, for that will make the 
 offence much more offensive. In any ill design thou hast, upon some 
 discontent, conceived against thy prince, do not proceed in it; but 
 <I>if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or hast thought 
 evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:32">Prov. xxx. 32</A>.

 Note, Though we may by surprise be drawn into an evil thing, yet we
 must not stand in it, but recede from it as soon as it appears to us to 
 be evil.

 (4.) We must prudently accommodate ourselves to our opportunities, both 
 for our own relief, if we think ourselves wronged, and for the redress 
 of public grievances: <I>A wise man's heart discerns both time and 
 judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 it is the wisdom of subjects, in applying themselves to their princes, 
 to enquire and consider both at what season and in what manner they may 
 do it best and most effectually, to pacify his anger, obtain his 
 favour, or obtain the revocation of any grievous measure prescribed. 
 Esther, in dealing with Ahasuerus, took a deal of pains to <I>discern 
 both time and judgment,</I> and she sped accordingly. This may be taken 
 as a general rule of wisdom, that every thing should be well timed; and 
 our enterprises are <I>then</I> likely to succeed, when we embrace the 
 exact opportunity for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What arguments are here used to engage us to be subject to the 
 higher powers; they are much the same with those which St. Paul uses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1">Rom. xiii. 1</A>,
 
 &c. 

 (1.) We <I>must needs be subject, for conscience-sake,</I> and that is
 the most powerful principle of subjection. We must be subject because 
 <I>of the oath of God,</I> the oath of allegiance which we have taken 
 to be faithful to the government, <I>the covenant between the king and 
 the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:16">2 Chron. xxiii. 16</A>.

 <I>David made a covenant,</I> or contract, <I>with the elders of
 Israel,</I> though he was king by divine designation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+11:3">1 Chron. xi. 3</A>.

 "<I>Keep the king's commandments,</I> for he has sworn to rule thee in
 the fear of God, and thou hast sworn, in that fear, to be faithful to 
 him." It is called <I>the oath of God</I> because he is a witness to it 
 and will avenge the violation of it.

 (2.) <I>For wrath's sake,</I> because of the sword which the prince 
 bears and the power he is entrusted with, which make him formidable: 
 <I>He does whatsoever pleases him;</I> he has a great authority and a 
 great ability to support that authority

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Where the word of a king is,</I> giving orders to seize a man, 
 <I>there is power;</I> there are many that will execute his orders, 
 which makes <I>the wrath of a king,</I> or supreme government, like 
 <I>the roaring of a lion</I> and like <I>messengers of death. Who may 
 say unto him, What doest thou?</I> He that contradicts him does it at 
 his peril. Kings will not bear to have their orders disputed, but 
 expect they should be obeyed. In short, it is dangerous contending with 
 sovereignty, and what many have repented. A subject is an unequal
 match for a prince. <I>He</I> may command me who has legions at 
 command. 

 (3.) For the sake of our own comfort: <I>Whoso keeps the 
 commandment,</I> and lives a quiet and peaceable life, <I>shall feel no 
 evil thing,</I> to which that of the apostle answers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:3">Rom. xiii. 3</A>),
 
 <I>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power</I> of the king? <I>Do
 that which is good,</I> as becomes a dutiful and loyal subject, <I>and 
 thou shalt</I> ordinarily <I>have praise of the same.</I> He that does 
 no ill shall feel no ill and needs fear none.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Because to every purpose there is time and judgment,

 &nbsp; 8  <I>There is</I> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain

 <I>there is</I> no discharge in <I>that</I> war; neither shall wickedness
 deliver those that are given to it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 that <I>a wise man's heart discerns time and judgment,</I> that is, a 
 man's wisdom will go a great way, by the blessing of God, in moral 
 prognostications; but here he shows that few have that wisdom, and that 
 even the wisest may yet be surprised by a calamity which they had not 
 any foresight of, and therefore it is our wisdom to expect and prepare 
 for sudden changes. Observe, 

 1. All the events concerning us, with the exact time of them, are 
 determined and appointed in the counsel and foreknowledge of God, and 
 all in wisdom: <I>To every purpose there is a time</I> prefixed, and it 
 is the best time, for it <I>is time and judgment,</I> time appointed 
 both in wisdom and righteousness; the appointment is not chargeable 
 with folly or iniquity. 

 2. We are very much in the dark concerning future events and the time
 and season of them: Man <I>knows not that which shall be</I> himself; 
 and <I>who can tell him when</I> or how <I>it shall be?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It cannot either be foreseen by him or foretold him; the stars cannot 
 foretel a man what shall be, nor any of the arts of divination. God
 has, in wisdom, concealed from us the knowledge of future events, that 
 we may be always ready for changes. 

 3. It is our great unhappiness and misery that, because we cannot 
 foresee an evil, we know not how to avoid it, or guard against it, and, 
 because we are not aware of the proper successful season of actions, 
 therefore we lose our opportunities and miss our way: <I>Because to 
 every purpose there is</I> but one way, one method, one proper 
 opportunity, <I>therefore the misery of man is great upon him;</I> 
 because it is so hard to hit that, and it is a thousand to one but he 
 misses it. Most of the miseries men labour under would have been 
 prevented if they could have been foreseen and the happy time 
 discovered to avoid them. Men are miserable because they are not 
 sufficiently sagacious and attentive. 

 4. Whatever other evils may be avoided, we are all under a fatal
 necessity of dying,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (1.) When the soul is required it must be resigned, and it is to no 
 purpose to dispute it, either by arms or arguments, by ourselves, or by 
 any friend: <I>There is no man that has power over</I> his own 
 <I>spirit, to retain it,</I> when it is summoned to return to God who 
 gave it. It cannot fly any where out of the jurisdiction of death, nor 
 find any place where its writs do not run. It cannot abscond so as to 
 escape death's eye, though it is hidden from the eyes of all living. A 
 man has no power to adjourn the day of his death, nor can he by prayers 
 or bribes obtain a reprieve; no bail will be taken, no essoine 
 [excuse], protection, or imparlance [conference], allowed. We have not
 <I>power over the spirit</I> of a friend, <I>to retain</I> that; the 
 prince, with all his authority, cannot prolong the life of the most 
 valuable of his subjects, nor the physician with his medicines and 
 methods, nor the soldier with his force, not the orator with his 
 eloquence, nor the best saint with his intercessions. The stroke of 
 death can by no means be put by when our days are determined and the 
 hour appointed us has come.

 (2.) Death is an enemy that we must all enter the lists with, sooner or 
 later: <I>There is no discharge in that war,</I> no dismission from it, 
 either of the men of business or of the faint-hearted, as there was 
 among the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5,8">Deut. xx. 5, 8</A>.

 While we live we are struggling with death, and we shall never put off
 the harness till we put off the body, never obtain a discharge till 
 death has obtained the mastery; the youngest is not released as a 
 fresh-water soldier, nor the oldest as <I>miles emeritus--a soldier 
 whose merits have entitled him to a discharge.</I> Death is a battle 
 that must be fought, <I>There is no sending to that war</I> (so some 
 read it), no substituting another to muster for us, no champion 
 admitted to fight for us; we must ourselves engage, and are concerned 
 to provide accordingly, as for a battle.

 (3.) Men's wickedness, by which they often evade or outface the justice 
 of the prince, cannot secure them from the arrest of death, nor can the 
 most obstinate sinner harden his heart against those terrors. Though he 
 <I>strengthen himself</I> ever so much <I>in his wickedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>),

 death will be too strong for him. The most subtle wickedness cannot
 outwit death, nor the most impudent wickedness outbrave death. Nay,
 the wickedness which men give themselves to will be so far from 
 delivering them from death that it will deliver them up to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, in the beginning of the chapter, had warned us against having 
 any thing to do with seditious subjects; here, in these verses, he 
 encourages us, in reference to the mischief of tyrannical and 
 oppressive rulers, such as he had complained of before, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16,4:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16; iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had observed many such rulers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 In the serious views and reviews he had taken of the children of men 
 and their state he had observed that many a time <I>one man rules over 
 another to his hurt;</I> that is, 

 (1.) To the hurt of the ruled (many understand it so); whereas they
 ought to be God's ministers unto their subjects <I>for their good</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:14">Rom. xiii. 14</A>),

 to administer justice, and to preserve the public peace and order, they
 use their power for their hurt, to invade their property, encroach upon 
 their liberty, and patronise the acts of injustice. It is sad with a 
 people when those that should protect their religion and rights aim at 
 the destruction of both.

 (2.) To the hurt of the rulers (so we render it), <I>to their own
 hurt,</I> to the feeling of their pride and covetousness, the 
 gratifying of their passion and revenge, and so to the filling up of 
 the measure of their sins and the hastening and aggravating of their 
 ruin. <I>Agens agendo repatitur</I>--<I>What hurt men do to others will 
 return, in the end, to their own hurt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had observed them to prosper and flourish in the abuse of their 
 power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I saw</I> those <I>wicked</I> rulers <I>come and go from the place 
 of the holy,</I> go in state to and return in pomp from the place of 
 judicature (which is called <I>the place of the Holy One</I> because 
 <I>the judgment is the Lord's,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:17">Deut. i. 17</A>,

 and he <I>judges among the gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1">Ps. lxxxii. 1</A>,

 and <I>is with them in the judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6">2 Chron. xix. 6</A>),

 and they continued all their days in office, were never reckoned with
 for their mal-administration, but died in honour and were buried 
 magnificently; their commissions were <I>durante 
 vit&acirc;</I>--<I>during life,</I> and not <I>quamdiu se bene
 gesserint</I>--<I>during good behaviour. And they were forgotten in the 
 city where they had so done;</I> their wicked practices were not 
 remembered against them to their reproach and infamy when they were 
 gone. Or, rather, it denotes the vanity of their dignity and power, for 
 that is his remark upon it in the close of the verse: <I>This is also 
 vanity.</I> They are proud of their wealth, and power, and honour, 
 because they sit in <I>the place of the holy;</I> but all this cannot 
 secure,

 (1.) Their bodies from being buried in the dust; <I>I saw</I> them laid 
 in the grave; and their pomp, though it attended them thither, could 
 <I>not descend after them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:17">Ps. xlix. 17</A>.

 (2.) Nor their names from being buried in oblivion; for <I>they were 
 forgotten,</I> as if they had never been.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He had observed that their prosperity hardened them in their 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is true of all sinners in general, and particularly of wicked 
 rulers, that, <I>because sentence against their evil works is not 
 executed speedily,</I> they think it will never be executed, and 
 therefore they set the law at defiance and <I>their hearts are full in 
 them to do evil;</I> they venture to do so much the more mischief, 
 fetch a greater compass in their wicked designs, and are secure and 
 fearless in it, and commit iniquity with a high hand. Observe,

 (1.) Sentence is passed against evil works and evil workers by the 
 righteous Judge of heaven and earth, even against the evil works of 
 princes and great men, as well as of inferior persons. 

 (2.) The execution of this sentence is often delayed a great while, and 
 the sinner goes on, not only unpunished, but prosperous and successful.
 
 (3.) Impunity hardens sinners in impiety, and the patience of God is 
 shamefully abused by many who, instead of being led by it to 
 repentance, are confirmed by it in their impenitence. 

 (4.) Sinners herein deceive themselves, for, though the <I>sentence</I> 
 be <I>not executed speedily,</I> it will be executed the more severely 
 at last. Vengeance comes slowly, but it comes surely, and wrath is in
 the mean time <I>treasured up against the day of wrath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He foresaw such an end of all these things as would be sufficient to 
 keep us from quarrelling with the divine Providence upon account of 
 them. He supposes a wicked ruler to do an unjust thing <I>a hundred 
 times,</I> and that yet his punishment is deferred, and God's patience 
 towards him <I>is prolonged,</I> much beyond what was expected, and the 
 days of his power are lengthened out, so that he continues to oppress; 
 yet he intimates that we should not be discouraged. 

 (1.) God's people are certainly a happy people, though they be 
 oppressed: "<I>It shall be well with those that fear God,</I> I say 
 with all those, and those only, <I>who fear before him.</I>" Note,

 [1.] It is the character of God's people that they <I>fear God,</I> 
 have an awe of him upon their hearts and make conscience of their duty 
 to him, and this because they see his eye always upon them and they 
 know it is their concern to approve themselves to him. When they lie at 
 the mercy of proud oppressors they fear God more then they fear them. 
 They do not quarrel with the providence of God, but submit to it. 

 [2.] It is the happiness of <I>all that fear God,</I> that in the worst 
 of times <I>it shall be well with them;</I> their happiness in God's 
 favour cannot be prejudiced, nor their communion with God interrupted, 
 by their troubles; they are in a good case, for they are kept in a good 
 frame under their troubles, and in the end they shall have a blessed 
 deliverance from and an abundant recompence for their troubles. And 
 therefore "<I>surely I know,</I> I know it by the promise of God, and 
 the experience of all the saints, <I>that,</I> however it goes with 
 others, <I>it shall go well with them.</I>" All is well that ends well.
 
 (2.) Wicked people are certainly a miserable people; though they 
 prosper, and prevail, for a time, the curse is as sure to them as the 
 blessing is to the righteous: <I>It shall not be well with the 
 wicked,</I> as others think it is, who judge by outward appearance, and 
 as they themselves expect it will be; nay, <I>woe to the wicked; it 
 shall be ill with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11">Isa. iii. 10, 11</A>);

 they shall be reckoned with for all the ill they have done; nothing
 that befals them shall be really well for them. <I>Nihil potest ad 
 malos pervenire quod prosit, imo nihil quod non noceat--No event can 
 occur to the wicked which will do them good, rather no event which will 
 not do them harm.</I> Seneca. Note,

 [1.] The wicked man's days <I>are as a shadow,</I> not only uncertain 
 and declining, as all men's days are, but altogether unprofitable. A 
 good man's days have some substance in them; he lives to a good 
 purpose. A wicked man's days are all <I>as a shadow,</I> empty and 
 worthless. 

 [2.] These days <I>shall not be prolonged</I> to what he promised 
 himself; he <I>shall not live out half his days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:23">Ps. lv. 23</A>.
 
 Though they may be <I>prolonged</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 beyond what others expected, yet his day shall come to fall. He shall
 fall short of everlasting life, and then his long life on earth will be 
 worth little.

 [3.] God's great quarrel with wicked people is for their <I>not fearing 
 before</I> him; that is at the bottom of their wickedness, and cuts 
 them off from all happiness.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there
 be just <I>men,</I> unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
 the wicked; again, there be wicked <I>men,</I> to whom it happeneth
 according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
 <I>is</I> vanity.
 &nbsp; 15  Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
 under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
 that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
 which God giveth him under the sun.
 &nbsp; 16  When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
 business that is done upon the earth: (for also <I>there is that</I>
 neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
 &nbsp; 17  Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find
 out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
 labour to seek <I>it</I> out, yet he shall not find <I>it;</I> yea further;
 though a wise <I>man</I> think to know <I>it,</I> yet shall he not be able
 to find <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Wise and good men have, of old, been perplexed with this difficulty, 
 how the prosperity of the wicked and the troubles of the righteous can 
 be reconciled with the holiness and goodness of the God that governs 
 the world. Concerning this Solomon here gives us his advice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He would not have us to be surprised at it, as though some strange 
 thing happened, for he himself saw it in his days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. He saw <I>just men to whom it happened according to the work of the 
 wicked,</I> who, notwithstanding their righteousness, suffered very 
 hard things, and continued long to do so, as if they were to be 
 punished for some great wickedness. 

 2. He saw <I>wicked men to whom it happened according to the work of
 the righteous,</I> who prospered as remarkably as if they had been 
 rewarded for some good deed, and that from themselves, from God, from 
 men. We see the just troubled and perplexed in their own minds, the 
 wicked easy, fearless, and secure,--the just crossed and afflicted by 
 the divine Providence, the wicked prosperous, successful, and smiled 
 upon,--the just, censured, reproached, and run down, by the higher 
 powers, the wicked applauded and preferred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He would have us to take occasion hence, not to charge God with 
 iniquity, but to charge the world with vanity. No fault is to be found 
 with God; but, as to the world, This <I>is vanity upon the earth,</I> 
 and again, <I>This is also vanity,</I> that is, it is a certain 
 evidence that the things of this world are not the best things nor were 
 ever designed to make a portion and happiness for us, for, if they had, 
 God would not have allotted so much of this world's wealth to his worst 
 enemies and so much of its troubles to his best friends; there must 
 therefore be another life after this the joys and griefs of which must 
 be real and substantial, and able to make men truly happy or truly 
 miserable, for this world does neither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He would have us not to fret and perplex ourselves about it, or 
 make ourselves uneasy, but cheerfully to enjoy what God has given us in 
 the world, to be content with it and make the best of it, though it be 
 much better with others, and such as we think very unworthy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>Then I commended joy,</I> a holy security and serenity of mind, 
 arising from a confidence in God, and his power, providence, and 
 promise, <I>because a man has no better thing under the sun</I> (though 
 a good man has much better things <I>above</I> the sun) <I>than to eat 
 and drink,</I> that is, soberly and thankfully to make use of the 
 things of this life according as his rank is, <I>and to be 
 cheerful,</I> whatever happens, <I>for that shall abide with him of his 
 labour.</I> That is all the fruit he has for himself of the pains that 
 he takes in the business of the world; let him therefore take it, and 
 much good may it do him; and let him not deny himself that, out of a 
 peevish discontent because the world does not go as he would have it. 
 <I>That shall abide with him</I> during <I>the days of his life which 
 God gives him under the sun.</I> Our present life is a life <I>under 
 the sun,</I> but we look for <I>the life of the world to come,</I> 
 which will commence and continue when <I>the sun shall be turned into 
 darkness</I> and shine no more. This present life must be reckoned by 
 days; this life is given us, and the days of it are allotted to us, by 
 the counsel of God, and therefore while it does last we must 
 accommodate ourselves to the will of God and study to answer the ends 
 of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He would not have us undertake to give a reason for that which God 
 does, for <I>his way is in the sea and his path in the great 
 waters,</I> past finding out, and therefore we must be contentedly and 
 piously ignorant of the meaning of God's proceedings in the government 
 of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 Here he shows, 

 1. That both he himself and many others had very closely studied the 
 point, and searched far into the reasons of the prosperity of the 
 wicked and the afflictions of the righteous. He, for his part, had 
 <I>applied his heart to know</I> this <I>wisdom, and to see the 
 business that is done,</I> by the divine Providence, <I>upon the 
 earth,</I> to find out if there were any certain scheme, any constant 
 rule or method, by which the affairs of this lower world were 
 administered, any course of government as sure and steady as the course 
 of nature, so that by what is done now we might as certainly foretel 
 what will be done next as by the moon's changing now we can foretel 
 when it will be at the full; this he would fain have found out. Others 
 had likewise set themselves to make this enquiry with so close an 
 application that they could not find time for <I>sleep, either day or 
 night,</I> nor find in their hearts to sleep, so full of anxiety were 
 they about these things. Some think Solomon speaks of himself, that he 
 was so eager in prosecuting this great enquiry that he could not sleep 
 for thinking of it. 
 
 2. That it was all labour in vain,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 When we look upon <I>all the works of God</I> and his providence, and 
 compare one part with another, we <I>cannot find</I> that there is any 
 such certain method by which <I>the work that is done under the sun</I> 
 is directed; we cannot discover any key by which to decipher the 
 character, nor by consulting precedents can we know the practice of 
 this court, nor what the judgment will be. 

 [1.] <I>Though a man</I> be ever so industrious, thou he <I>labour to 
 seek it out.</I> 

 [2.] Though he be ever so ingenious, <I>though</I> he be <I>a wise 
 man</I> in other things, and can fathom the counsels of kings 
 themselves and trace them by their footsteps. Nay, 

 [3.] Though he be very confident of success, though he <I>think to know 
 it, yet he shall not;</I> he cannot <I>find it out.</I> God's ways are 
 above ours, nor is he tied to his own former ways, but <I>his judgments 
 are a great deep.</I></P>
