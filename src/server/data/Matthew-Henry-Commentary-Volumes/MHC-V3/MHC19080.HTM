 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is much to the same purport with the foregoing. Some think 
 it was penned upon occasion of the desolation and captivity of the ten 
 tribes, as the foregoing psalm of the two. But many were the distresses 
 of the Israel of God, many perhaps which are not recorded in the sacred 
 history some whereof might give occasion for the drawing up of this 
 psalm, which is proper to be sung in the day of Jacob's trouble, and 
 if, in singing it, we express a true love to the church and a hearty 
 concern for its interest, with a firm confidence in God's power to help 
 it out of its greatest distresses, we make melody with our hearts to 
 the Lord. The psalmist here, 

 I. Begs for the tokens of God's presence with them and favour to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He complains of the present rebukes they were under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 III. He illustrates the present desolations of the church, by the
 comparison of a vine and a vineyard, which had flourished, but was now
 destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.

 IV. He concludes with prayer to God for the preparing of mercy for them
 and the preparing of them for mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 This, as many psalms before and after, relates to the public interests 
 of God's Israel, which ought to lie nearer to our hearts than any 
 secular interest of our own.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, Eduth. A psalm of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph
 like a flock; thou that dwellest <I>between</I> the cherubims, shine
 forth.
 &nbsp; 2  Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy
 strength, and come <I>and</I> save us.
 &nbsp; 3  Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
 shall be saved.
 &nbsp; 4  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
 prayer of thy people?
 &nbsp; 5  Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
 tears to drink in great measure.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
 laugh among themselves.
 &nbsp; 7  Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
 and we shall be saved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here, in the name of the church, applies to God by prayer, 
 with reference to the present afflicted state of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He entreats God's favour for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>);

 that is all in all to the sanctuary when it is desolate, and is to be 
 sought in the first place. Observe,

 1. How he eyes God in his address as the Shepherd of Israel, whom he 
 had called the <I>sheep of his pasture</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:13">Ps. lxxix. 13</A>),

 under whose guidance and care Israel was, as the sheep are under the 
 care and conduct of the shepherd. Christ is the great and good 
 Shepherd, to whom we may in faith commit the custody of his sheep that 
 were given to him. He <I>leads Joseph like a flock,</I> to the best 
 pastures, and out of the way of danger; if Joseph follow him not as 
 obsequiously as the sheep do the shepherd, it is his own fault. He 
 <I>dwells between the cherubim,</I> where he is ready to receive 
 petitions and to give directions. The mercy-seat was between the 
 cherubim; and it is very comfortable in prayer to look up to God as 
 sitting on a throne of grace, and that it is so to us is owning to the 
 great propitiation, for the mercy-seat was the propitiatory.

 2. What he expects and desires from God, that he would give ear to the
 cry of their miseries and of their prayers, that he would shine forth 
 both in his own glory and in favour and kindness to his people, that he 
 would show himself and smile on them, that he would <I>sir up his 
 strength,</I> that he would excite it and exert it. It had seemed to 
 slumber: "Lord, awaken it." His cause met with great opposition and the 
 enemies threatened to overpower it: "Lord, put forth thy strength so 
 much the more, and come for salvation to us; be to thy people a 
 powerful help and a present help; Lord, do this <I>before Ephraim, 
 Benjamin, and Manasseh,</I>" that is, "In the sight of all the tribes 
 of Israel; let them see it to their satisfaction." Perhaps these three 
 tribes are named because they were the tribes which formed that 
 squadron of the camp of Israel that in their march through the 
 wilderness followed next after the tabernacle; so that before them the 
 ark of God's strength rose to scatter their enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He complains of God's displeasure against them. God was angry, and 
 he dreads that more than any thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. It was great anger. He apprehended that God was <I>angry against the 
 prayer of his people,</I> not only that he was angry notwithstanding 
 their prayers, by which they hoped to turn away his wrath from them, 
 but that he was angry with their prayers, though they were his own 
 people that prayed. That God should be angry at the sins of his people 
 and at the prayers of his enemies is not strange; but that he should be 
 angry at the prayers of his people is strange indeed. He not only 
 delayed to answer them (that he often does in love), but he was 
 displeased at them. If he be really angry at the prayers of his people, 
 we may be sure it is because they ask amiss, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:3">Jam. iv. 3</A>.

 They pray, but they do not wrestle in prayer; their ends are not right,
 or there is some secret sin harboured and indulged in them; they do not 
 lift up pure hands, or they lift them up with wrath and doubting. But 
 perhaps it is only in their own apprehension; he seems angry with their 
 prayers when really he is not; for thus he will try their patience and 
 perseverance in prayer, as Christ tried the woman of Canaan when he 
 said, <I>It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to 
 dogs.</I>

 2. It was anger that had continued a great while: "<I>How long wilt
 thou be angry?</I> We have still continued praying and yet are still 
 under thy frowns." Now the tokens of God's displeasure which they had 
 been long under were both their sorrow and shame.

 (1.) Their sorrow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;</I> they eat their meat 
 from day to day in tears; this is the vinegar in which they <I>dipped 
 their morsel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:3">Ps. xlii. 3</A>.

 They had tears given them to drink, not now and then a taste of that
 bitter cup, but in great measure. Note, There are many that spend their 
 time in sorrow who yet shall spend their eternity in joy.

 (2.) It was their shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God, by frowning upon them, made them a strife unto their neighbours;
 each strove which should expose them most, and such a cheap and easy 
 prey were they made to them that all the strife was who should have the 
 stripping and plundering of them. Their enemies laughed among
 themselves to see the frights they were in, the straits they were 
 reduced to, and the disappointments they met with. When God is 
 displeased with his people we must expect to see them in tears and 
 their enemies in triumph.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He prays earnestly for converting grace in order to their 
 acceptance with God, and their salvation: <I>Turn us again, O God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>Turn us again, O God of hosts!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 and then <I>cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved.</I> It is 
 the burden of the song, for we have it again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They are conscious to themselves that they have gone astray from God
 and their duty, and have turned aside into sinful ways, and that it was 
 this that provoked God to hide his face from them and to give them up 
 into the hand of their enemies; and therefore they desire to begin 
 their work at the right end: "Lord, turn us to thee in a way of 
 repentance and reformation, and then, no doubt, thou wilt return to us 
 in a way of mercy and deliverance." Observe,

 1. No salvation but from God's favour: "<I>Cause thy face to shine,</I> 
 let us have thy love and the light of thy countenance, and then we 
 shall be saved." 

 2. No obtaining favour with God unless we be converted to him. We must
 turn again to God from the world and the flesh, and then he will cause 
 his face to shine upon us. 

 3. No conversion to God but by his own grace; we must frame our doings
 to turn to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:4">Hos. v. 4</A>)

 and then pray earnestly for his grace, <I>Turn thou me, and I shall be
 turned,</I> pleading that gracious promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23">Prov. i. 23</A>),

 <I>Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto
 you.</I> The prayer here is for a national conversion; in this method 
 we must pray for national mercies, that what is amiss may be amended, 
 and then our grievances would be soon redressed. National holiness 
 would secure national happiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
 heathen, and planted it.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou preparedst <I>room</I> before it, and didst cause it to take
 deep root, and it filled the land.
 &nbsp; 10  The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
 thereof <I>were like</I> the goodly cedars.
 &nbsp; 11  She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
 the river.
 &nbsp; 12  Why hast thou <I>then</I> broken down her hedges, so that all
 they which pass by the way do pluck her?
 &nbsp; 13  The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast
 of the field doth devour it.
 &nbsp; 14  Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
 heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
 &nbsp; 15  And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
 branch <I>that</I> thou madest strong for thyself.
 &nbsp; 16  <I>It is</I> burned with fire, <I>it is</I> cut down: they perish at
 the rebuke of thy countenance.
 &nbsp; 17  Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
 of man <I>whom</I> thou madest strong for thyself.
 &nbsp; 18  So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will
 call upon thy name.
 &nbsp; 19  Turn us again, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
 and we shall be saved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist is here presenting his suit for the Israel of God, and 
 pressing it home at the throne of grace, pleading with God for mercy 
 and grace for them. The church is here represented as a vine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8,14"><I>v.</I> 8, 14</A>)
 
 and a vineyard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 The root of this vine is Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:18">Rom. xi. 18</A>.

 The branches are believers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:5">John xv. 5</A>.

 The church is like a vine, weak and needing support, unsightly and
 having an unpromising outside, but spreading and fruitful, and its 
 fruit most excellent. The church is a choice and noble vine; we have 
 reason to acknowledge the goodness of God that he has planted such a 
 vine in the wilderness of this world, and preserved it to this day. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the vine of the Old-Testament church was planted at first. It 
 was <I>brought out of Egypt</I> with a high hand; <I>the heathen were 
 cast out</I> of Canaan to make room for it, seven nations to make room 
 for that one. <I>Thou didst sweep before it</I> (so some read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 to make clear work; the nations were swept away as dirt with the besom
 of destruction. God, having made room for it, and planted it, cause it 
 to take deep root by a happy establishment of their government both in 
 church and state, which was so firm that, though their neighbours about 
 them often attempted it, they could not prevail to pluck it up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it spread and flourished. 

 1. The land of Canaan itself was fully peopled. At first they were not 
 so numerous as to replenish it,

 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29">Exod. xxiii. 29</A>.

 But in Solomon's time <I>Judah and Israel were many as the sand of the
 sea;</I> the land was filled with them, and yet such a fruitful land
 that it was not over-stocked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The hills of Canaan were covered with their shadow, and the branches,
 though they extended themselves far, like those of the vine, yet were 
 not weak like them, but as strong as those of the goodly cedars. Israel 
 not only had abundance of men, but those mighty men of valour.

 2. They extended their conquests and dominion to the neighbouring
 countries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>She sent out her boughs to the sea,</I> the great sea westward, and 
 <I>her branches to the river,</I> to the river of Egypt southward, the 
 river of Damascus northward, or rather the river Euphrates eastward,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18">Gen. xv. 18</A>.

 Nebuchadnezzar's greatness is represented by a flourishing tree, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:20,21">Dan. iv. 20, 21</A>.

 But it is observable here concerning this vine that it is praised for
 its <I>shadow,</I> its <I>boughs,</I> and its <I>branches,</I> but not 
 a word of its fruit, for <I>Israel was an empty vine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:1">Hos. x. 1</A>.

 God came looking for grapes, but, behold, wild grapes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2">Isa. v. 2</A>.

 And, if a vine do not bring forth fruit, no tree so useless, so
 worthless,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:2,6">Ezek. xv. 2, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it was wasted and ruined: "Lord, thou hast done great things
 for this vine, and why shall it be all undone again? If it were a plant
 not of God's planting, it were not strange to see it rooted up; but
 will God desert and abandon that which he himself gave being to?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 <I>Why hast thou then broken down her hedges?</I> There was a good
 reason for this change in God's way towards them. This noble vine had 
 become <I>the degenerate plant of a strange vine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21">Jer. ii. 21</A>),

 to the reproach of its great owner, and then no marvel if he <I>took 
 away its hedge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:5">Isa. v. 5</A>);

 yet God's former favours to this vine are urged as pleas in prayer to
 God, and improved as encouragements to faith, that, notwithstanding all 
 this, God would not wholly cast them off. Observe, 

 1. The malice and enmity of the Gentile nations against Israel. As soon 
 as ever God <I>broke down their hedges</I> and left them exposed troops 
 of enemies presently broke in upon them, that waited for an opportunity 
 to destroy them. Those that passed by the way plucked at them; the
 <I>board out of the wood</I> and the <I>wild beast of the field</I> 
 were ready to ravage it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 But,

 2. See also the restraint which these cruel enemies were under; for
 till God had <I>broken down their hedges</I> they could not pluck a 
 leaf of this vine. The devil could not hurt Job so long as God 
 continued the <I>hedge round about him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10">Job i. 10</A>.

 See how much it is the interest of any people to keep themselves in the
 favour of God and then they need not fear any wild beast of the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:23">Job v. 23</A>.

 If we provoke God to withdraw, <I>our defence has departed from us,</I> 
 and we are undone. The deplorable state of Israel is described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>It is burnt with fire; it is cut down;</I> the people are treated 
 like thorns and briers, that are nigh unto cursing and whose end is to 
 be burned, and no longer like vines that are protected and cherished. 
 They perish not through the rage of the wild beast and the boar, but 
 <I>at the rebuke of thy countenance;</I> that was it which they dreaded 
 and to which they attributed all their calamities. It is well or ill 
 with us according as we are under God's smiles or frowns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What their requests were to God hereupon. 

 1. That God would help the vine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 that he would graciously take cognizance of its case and do for it as 
 he thought fit: "<I>Return, we beseech thee, O Lord of hosts!</I> for 
 thou hast seemed to go away from us. <I>Look down from heaven,</I> to 
 which thou hast retired,--from heaven, that place of prospect, whence 
 thou seest all the wrongs that are done us, that place of power, whence 
 thou canst send effectual relief,--from heaven, where thou hast 
 prepared thy throne of judgment, to which we appeal, and where thou 
 hast prepared a better country for those that are Israelites 
 indeed,--thence give a gracious look, thence make a gracious visit, to 
 this vine. Take our woeful condition into thy compassionate 
 consideration, and for the particular fruits of thy pity we refer 
 ourselves to thee. Only behold the vineyard, or rather the root, which 
 <I>thy right hand hath planted,</I> and which therefore we hope thy 
 right hand will protect, that <I>branch which thou madest strong for 
 thyself,</I> to show forth thy praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:21">Isa. xliii. 21</A>),

 that with the fruit of it thou mightest be honoured. Lord, it is formed
 by thyself and for thyself, and therefore it may with a humble 
 confidence be committed to thyself and to thy own care." <I>As for God, 
 his work is perfect.</I> What we read the <I>branch</I> in the Hebrew 
 is the <I>son (Ben</I>), whom in thy counsel thou hast made strong for 
 thyself. That branch was to come out of the stock of Israel (<I>my 
 servant the branch,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>),

 and therefore, till he should come, Israel in general, and the house of
 David in particular, must be preserved, and upheld, and kept in being. 
 <I>He is the true vine,</I>

 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1,Isa+11:1">John xv. 1; Isa. xi. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Destroy it not for that blessing is in it,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.

 2. That he would help the vine-dresser 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 "<I>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,</I>" that king 
 (whoever it was) of the house of David that was now to go in and out 
 before them; "let thy hand be upon him, not only to protect and cover
 him, but to own him, and strengthen him, and give him success." We have 
 this phrase,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:28">Ezra vii. 28</A>,

 <I>And I was strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon
 me.</I> Their king is called the <I>man of God's right hand</I> as he 
 was the representative of their state, which was dear to God, as his 
 Benjamin, the <I>son of his right hand,</I> as he was president in 
 their affairs and an instrument in God's right hand of much good to 
 them, defending them from themselves and from their enemies and 
 directing them in the right way, and as he was under-shepherd under him 
 who was the great shepherd of Israel. Princes, who have power, must 
 remember that they are <I>sons of men,</I> of <I>Adam</I> (so the word 
 is), that, if they are strong, it is God that has made them strong, and 
 he has made them so for himself, for they are his ministers to serve 
 the interests of his kingdom among men, and, if they do this in 
 sincerity, <I>his hand shall be upon them;</I> and we should pray in 
 faith that it may be so, adding this promise, that, if God will adhere 
 to our governors, we will adhere to him: <I>So will not we go back from 
 thee;</I> we will never desert a cause which we see that God espouses 
 and is the patron of. Let God be our leader and we will follow him.
 Adding also this prayer, "<I>Quicken us,</I> put life into us, revive 
 our dying interests, revive our drooping spirits, and then <I>we will 
 call upon thy name.</I> We will continue to do so upon all occasions, 
 having found it not in vain to do so." We cannot call upon God's name 
 in a right manner unless he quicken us; but it is he that puts life 
 into our souls, that puts liveliness into our prayers. But many
 interpreters, both Jewish and Christian, apply this to the Messiah, the 
 Son of David, the protector and Saviour of the church and the keeper of 
 the vineyard. 

 (1.) He is the man of God's right hand, to whom he has <I>sworn by his 
 right hand</I> (so the Chaldee), whom he has exalted to his right hand, 
 and who is indeed his right hand, the arm of the Lord, for all power is 
 given to him. 

 (2.) He is that son of man whom he <I>made strong for himself,</I> for 
 the glorifying of his name and the advancing of the interests of his 
 kingdom among men. 

 (3.) God's hand is upon him throughout his whole undertaking, to bear 
 him out and carry him on, to protect and animate him, that the <I>good 
 pleasure of the Lord might prosper in his hand.</I> 

 (4.) The stability and constancy of believers are entirely owing to the 
 grace and strength which are laid up for us in Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:28">Ps. lxviii. 28</A>.

 In him is our strength found, by which we are enabled to persevere to
 the end. Let thy hand be upon him; on him let our help be laid who is 
 mighty; let him be made able to save to the uttermost and that will be 
 our security; <I>so will not we go back from thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, The psalm concludes with the same petition that had been put up 
 twice before, and yet it is no vain repetition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Turn us again.</I> The title given to God rises, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,

 <I>O God!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 <I>O God of hosts!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 <I>O Lord (Jehovah) God of hosts!</I> When we come to God for his 
 grace, his good-will towards us and his good work in us, we should pray 
 earnestly, continue instant in prayer, and pray more earnestly.</P>
