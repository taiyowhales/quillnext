 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This short psalm sets forth the honour of the kingdom of God among men,
 to his glory, the terror of his enemies, and the comfort of all his
 loving subjects. It relates both to the kingdom of his providence, by
 which he upholds and governs the world, and especially to the kingdom
 of his grace, by which he secures the church, sanctifies and preserves
 it. The administration of both these kingdoms is put into the hands of
 the Messiah, and to him, doubtless, the prophet here hears witness, and
 to his kingdom, speaking of it as present, because sure; and because,
 as the eternal Word, even before his incarnation he was Lord of all.
 Concerning God's kingdom glorious things are here spoken. 

 I. Have other kings their royal robes? So has he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Have they their thrones? So has he,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:2">ver. 2</A>.

 III. Have they their enemies whom they subdue and triumph over? So has
 he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 IV. Is it their honour to be faithful and holy? So it is his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:5">ver. 5</A>.

 In singing this psalm we forget ourselves if we forget Christ, to whom
 the Father has given all power both in heaven and in earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Next to the being of God there is nothing that we are more concerned to 
 believe and consider than God's dominion, that Jehovah is God, and that 
 this God reigns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only that he is King of right, and is the owner and proprietor of 
 all persons and things, but that he is King in fact, and does direct 
 and dispose of all the creatures and all their actions according to the 
 counsel of his own will. This is celebrated here, and in many other 
 psalms: <I>The Lord reigns.</I> It is the song of the gospel church, of 
 the glorified church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:6">Rev. xix. 6</A>),

 <I>Hallelujah; the Lord God omnipotent reigns.</I> Here we are told how 
 he reigns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Lord reigns gloriously: <I>He is clothed with majesty.</I> The 
 majesty of earthly princes, compared with God's terrible majesty, is 
 but like the glimmerings of a glow-worm compared with the brightness of 
 the sun when he goes forth in his strength. Are the enemies of God's 
 kingdom great and formidable? Yet let us not fear them, for God's 
 majesty will eclipse theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reigns powerfully. He is not only clothed with majesty, as a 
 prince in his court, but he is <I>clothed with strength,</I> as a 
 general in the camp. He has wherewithal to support his greatness and to 
 make it truly formidable. See him not only clad in robes, but clad in 
 armour. Both <I>strength and honour are his clothing.</I> He can do 
 every thing, and with him nothing is impossible. 

 1. With this power <I>he has girded himself;</I> it is not derived from
 any other, nor does the executing of it depend upon any other, but he 
 has it of himself and with it does whatsoever he pleases. Let us not 
 fear the power of man, which is borrowed and bounded, but fear him who 
 has power to kill and cast into hell. 

 2. To this power it is owing that the world stands to this day. The 
 world also is established; it was so at first, by the creating power of 
 God, when he founded it upon the seas; it is so still, by that 
 providence which upholds all things and is a continued creation; it is 
 so established that though he has <I>hanged the earth upon nothing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>)

 yet <I>it cannot be moved;</I> all things <I>continue to this day,
 according to his ordinance.</I> Note, The preserving of the powers of 
 nature and the course of nature is what the God of nature must have the 
 glory of; and we who have the benefit thereof daily are very careless 
 and ungrateful if we give him not the glory of it. Though God clothes 
 himself with majesty, yet he condescends to take care of this lower 
 world and to settle its affairs; and, if he established the world, much 
 more will he establish his church, that it cannot be moved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He reigns eternally 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Thy throne is established of old.</I>

 1. God's right to rule the world is founded in his making it; he that
 gave being to it, no doubt, may give law to it, and so his title to the 
 government is incontestable: <I>Thy throne is established;</I> it is a 
 title without a flaw in it. And it is ancient: it is <I>established of 
 old,</I> from the beginning of time, before any other rule, 
 principality, or power was erected, as it will continue when all other 
 rule, principality, and power shall be put down,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24">1 Cor. xv. 24</A>.

 2. The whole administration of his government was settled in his
 eternal counsels before all worlds; for he does all according to the
 purpose which he purposed in himself; The chariots of Providence came
 down from between the mountains of brass, from those decrees which are
 fixed as the everlasting mountains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:1">Zech. vi. 1</A>):

 <I>Thou art from everlasting,</I> and therefore <I>thy throne is 
 established of old;</I> because God himself was from everlasting, his 
 throne and all the determinations of it were so too; for in an eternal 
 mind there could not but be eternal thoughts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He reigns triumphantly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 We have here,

 1. A threatening storm supposed: <I>The floods have lifted up, O
 Lord!</I> (to God himself the remonstrance is made) <I>the floods have 
 lifted up their voice,</I> which speaks terror; nay, they have 
 <I>lifted up their waves,</I> which speaks real danger. It alludes to a 
 tempestuous sea, such as the wicked are compared to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:20">Isa. lvii. 20</A>.
 
 The <I>heathen rage</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>)

 and think to ruin the church, to overwhelm it like a deluge, to sink it
 like a ship at sea. The church is said to <I>be tossed with 
 tempests</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+Isa+54:11">Isa. liv. 11</A>),

 and the <I>floods of ungodly men</I> make the saints <I>afraid,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+Ps+18:4">Ps. xviii. 4</A>.

 We may apply it to the tumults that are sometimes in our own bosoms,
 through prevailing passions and frights, which put the soul into 
 disorder, and are ready to overthrow its graces and comforts; but, if 
 the Lord reign there, even the winds and seas shall obey him. 

 2. An immovable anchor cast in this storm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Lord himself is mightier.</I> Let this keep our minds fixed,

 (1.) That God is on high, above them, which denotes his safety (they 
 cannot reach him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:10">Ps. xxix. 10</A>)

 and his sovereignty; they are ruled by him, they are overruled, and,
 wherein they rebel, overcome,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod. xviii. 11</A>.

 (2.) That he <I>is mightier,</I> does more <I>wondrous things</I> than
 <I>the noise of many waters;</I> they cannot disturb his rest or rule;
 they cannot defeat his designs and purposes. Observe, The power of the
 church's enemies is but <I>as the noise of many waters;</I> there is
 more of sound than substance in it. <I>Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a
 noise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+46:17">Jer. xlvi. 17</A>.

 The church's friends are commonly more frightened than hurt. God is
 mightier than this noise; he is mighty to preserve his people's 
 interests from being ruined by these many waters and his people's 
 spirits from being terrified by the noise of them. He can, when he 
 pleases, command peace to the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7">Ps. lxv. 7</A>),

 peace in the soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3">Isa. xxvi. 3</A>.

 Note, The unlimited sovereignty and irresistible power of the great
 Jehovah are very encouraging to the people of God, in reference to all 
 the noises and hurries they meet with in this world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1,2">Ps. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He reigns in truth and holiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. All his promises are inviolably faithful: <I>Thy testimonies are
 very sure.</I> As God is able to protect his church, so he is true to 
 the promises he has made of its safety and victory. His word is passed, 
 and all the saints may rely upon it. Whatever was foretold concerning 
 the kingdom of the Messiah would certainly have its accomplishment in 
 due time. Those testimonies upon which the faith and hope of the 
 Old-Testament saints were built were very sure, and would not fail 
 them. 

 2. All his people ought to be conscientiously pure: <I>Holiness becomes 
 thy house, O Lord! for ever.</I> God's church is his house; it is a 
 holy house, cleansed from sin, consecrated by God, and employed in his 
 service. The holiness of it is its beauty (nothing better becomes the 
 saints than conformity to God's image and an entire devotedness to his 
 honour), and it is its strength and safety; it is the holiness of God's 
 house that secures it against the many waters and their noise. Where
 there is purity there shall be peace. Fashions change, and that which 
 is becoming at one time is not so at another; but holiness always 
 becomes God's house and family, and those who belong to it; it is 
 perpetually decent; and nothing so ill becomes the worshippers of the 
 holy God as unholiness.</P>
