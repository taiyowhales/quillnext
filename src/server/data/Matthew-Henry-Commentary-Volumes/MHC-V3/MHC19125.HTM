 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This short psalm may be summed up in those words of the prophet 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11">Isa. iii. 10, 11</A>),

 "Say you to the righteous, It shall be well with him. Woe to the
 wicked, it shall be ill with him." Thus are life and death, the
 blessing and the curse, set before us often in the psalms, as well as 
 in the law and the prophets.

 I. It is certainly well with the people of God; for, 

 1. They have the promises of a good God that they shall be fixed 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and safe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2">ver. 2</A>),
 
 and not always under the hatches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3">ver. 3</A>.

 2. They have the prayers of a good man, which shall be heard for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:4">ver. 4</A>.

 II. It is certainly ill with the wicked, and particularly with the
 apostates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:5">ver. 5</A>.

 Some of the Jewish rabbies are of opinion that it has reference to the 
 days of the Messiah; however, we that are members of the gospel-church 
 may certainly, in singing this psalm, take comfort of these promises, 
 and the more so if we stand in awe of the threatening.</P>

 <P>A song of degrees.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  They that trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>shall be</I>
 as mount Zion, <I>which</I> cannot be removed, <I>but</I> abideth for ever.
 &nbsp; 2  As the mountains <I>are</I> round about Jerusalem, so the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>is</I> round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
 &nbsp; 3  For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
 righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
 iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are three very precious promises made to the people of God, which, 
 though they are designed to secure the welfare of the church in 
 general, may be applied by particular believers to themselves, as other 
 promises of this nature may. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The character of God's people, to whom these promises belong. Many 
 call themselves God's people who have no part nor lot in this matter. 
 But those shall have the benefit of them and may take the comfort of 
 them, 
 
 (1.) Who are <I>righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 righteous before God, righteous to God, and righteous to all men, for
 his sake justified and sanctified. 

 (2.) Who <I>trust in the Lord,</I> who depend upon his care and devote 
 themselves to his honour. All that deal with God must deal upon trust, 
 and he will give comfort to those only that give credit to him, and 
 make it to appear they do so by quitting other confidences, and 
 venturing to the utmost for God. The closer our expectations are 
 confined to God the higher our expectations may be raised from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promises themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That their hearts shall be established by faith: those minds shall 
 be truly stayed that are stayed on God: <I>They shall be as Mount 
 Zion.</I> The church in general is called <I>Mount Zion</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>),

 and it shall in <I>this</I> respect be like <I>Mount Zion,</I> it shall
 be built upon a rock, and its interests shall be so well secured that 
 <I>the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</I> The stability of 
 the church is the satisfaction of all its well-wishers. Particular
 persons, who trust in God, shall be established 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7">Ps. cxii. 7</A>);

 their faith shall be their fixation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:9">Isa. vii. 9</A>.

 <I>They shall be as Mount Zion,</I> which is firm as it is a mountain 
 supported by providence, much more as a holy mountain supported by 
 promise. 

 (1.) They <I>cannot be removed</I> by the prince of the power of the 
 air, nor by all his subtlety and strength. They cannot be removed from 
 their integrity nor from their confidence in God. 

 (2.) They <I>abide for ever</I> in that grace which is the earnest of 
 their everlasting continuance in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, committing themselves to God, they shall be safe, under his 
 protection, from all the insults of their enemies, as Jerusalem had a 
 natural fastness and fortification in the <I>mountains</I> that <I>were 
 round about it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those mountains not only sheltered it from winds and tempests, and 
 broke the force of them, but made it also very difficult of access for 
 an enemy; such a defence is God's providence to his people. Observe,

 (1.) The compass of it: <I>The Lord is round about his people</I> on 
 every side. There is no gap in the hedge of protection which he makes 
 round about his people, at which the enemy, who goes about them, 
 seeking to do them a mischief, can find entrance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10">Job i. 10</A>.

 (2.) The continuance of it--<I>henceforth even for ever.</I> Mountains 
 may moulder and <I>come to nought, and rocks</I> be <I>removed out of 
 their place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:18">Job xiv. 18</A>),

 but God's covenant with his people cannot be <I>broken</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa. liv. 10</A>)
 
 nor his care of them cease. Their being said to stand fast <I>for 
 ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and here to have God <I>round about them for ever,</I> intimates that
 the promises of the stability and security of God's people will have 
 their full accomplishment in their everlasting state. In heaven they 
 shall <I>stand fast for ever,</I> shall be as <I>pillars in the temple 
 of our God and go no more out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Rev. iii. 12</A>),

 and there God himself, with his glory and favour, will be <I>round 
 about them for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That their troubles shall last no longer than their strength will 
 serve to bear them up under them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) It is supposed that the <I>rod of the wicked</I> may come, may 
 fall, <I>upon the lot of the righteous.</I> The rod of their power may 
 oppress them; the rod of their anger may vex and torment them. It may 
 fall upon their persons, their estates, their liberties, their 
 families, their names, any thing that falls to their lot, only it 
 cannot reach their souls. 

 (2.) It is promised that, though it may come upon their lot, it shall 
 not rest there; it shall not continue so long as the enemies design, 
 and as the people of God fear, but God will cut the work short in 
 righteousness, so short that even <I>with the temptation he will make a 
 way for them to escape.</I> 

 (3.) It is considered as a reason of this promise that if the trouble 
 should continue over-long the righteous themselves would be in 
 temptation to <I>put forth their hands to iniquity,</I> to join with 
 wicked people in their wicked practices, to say as they say and do as 
 they do. There is danger lest, being long persecuted for their 
 religion, at length they grow weary of it and willing to give it up, 
 lest, being kept long in expectation of promised mercies, they begin to 
 distrust the promise, and to think of casting God off, upon suspicion 
 of his having cast them off. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:13,14">Ps. lxxiii. 13, 14</A>.

 Note, God considers the frame of his people, and will proportion their 
 trials to their strength by the care of his providence, as well as 
 their strength to their trials by the power of his grace. <I>Oppression 
 makes a wise man mad,</I> especially if it continue long; therefore 
 <I>for the elect's sake</I> the days shall be shortened, that, whatever 
 becomes of their lot in this world, they may not lose their lot among 
 the chosen.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The prayer the psalmist puts up for the happiness of those that are
 sincere and constant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Do good, O Lord! unto those that are good.</I> This teaches us to
 pray for all good people, to <I>make supplication for all saints;</I> 
 and we may pray in faith for them, being assured that those who do well 
 shall certainly be well dealt with. Those that are as they should be 
 shall be as they would be, provided they be <I>upright in heart,</I> 
 that they be really as good as they seem to be. <I>With the upright
 God will show himself upright.</I> He does not say, Do good, O Lord! to 
 those that are perfect, that are sinless and spotless, but to those 
 that are sincere and honest. God's promises should quicken our prayers. 
 It is comfortable wishing well to those for whom God has engaged to do 
 well.

 2. The prospect he has of the ruin of hypocrites and deserters; he does 
 not pray for it (<I>I have not desired the woeful day, thou 
 knowest</I>), but he predicts it: <I>As for those,</I> who having known 
 the way of righteousness, for fear of the rod of the wicked, basely 
 turn aside out of it <I>to their wicked ways,</I> use indirect ways to 
 prevent trouble or extricate themselves out of it, or those who, 
 instead of reforming, grow worse and worse and are more obstinate and 
 daring in their impieties, God shall <I>send them away, cast them 
 out,</I> and <I>lead them forth with the workers of iniquity,</I> that 
 is, he will appoint them their portion with the worst of sinners. Note,

 (1.) Sinful ways are <I>crooked ways;</I> sin is the perverting of that 
 which is right. 

 (2.) The doom of those who turn aside to those crooked ways out of the 
 right way will be the same with theirs who have all along walked in 
 them, nay, and more grievous, for if any place in hell be hotter than 
 another that shall be the portion of hypocrites and apostates. God 
 shall <I>lead them forth,</I> as prisoners are led forth to execution. 
 <I>Go, you cursed, into everlasting fire;</I> and <I>these shall go 
 away;</I> all their former righteousness shall not be mentioned unto 
 them. The last words, <I>Place upon Israel,</I> may be taken as a 
 prayer: "God preserve his Israel in peace, when his judgments are 
 abroad reckoning with evil-doers." We read them as a promise: <I>Peace 
 shall be upon Israel;</I> that is,

 [1.] When those who have treacherously deserted the ways of God meet 
 with their own destruction those who faithfully adhere to them, though 
 they may have trouble in their way, shall have peace in the end.

 [2.] The destruction of those who walk in crooked ways will contribute
 to the peace and safety of the church. When Herod was cut off <I>the 
 word of God grew,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:23,24">Acts xii. 23, 24</A>.

 [3.] The peace and happiness of God's Israel will be the vexation, and
 will add much to the torment, of those who perish in their wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28,Isa+65:13">Luke xiii. 28; Isa. lxv. 13</A>.

 <I>My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.</I></P>
