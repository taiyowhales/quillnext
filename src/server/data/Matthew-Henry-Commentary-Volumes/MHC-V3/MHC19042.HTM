 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If the book of Psalms be, as some have styled it, a mirror or 
 looking-glass of pious and devout affections, this psalm in particular 
 deserves, as much as any one psalm, to be so entitled, and is as proper 
 as any to kindle and excite such in us: gracious desires are here 
 strong and fervent; gracious hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, are 
 here struggling, but the pleasing passion comes off a conqueror. Or we 
 may take it for a conflict between sense and faith, sense objecting and 
 faith answering. 

 I.  Faith begins with holy desires towards God and communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Sense complains of the darkness and cloudiness of the present
 condition, aggravated by the remembrance of the former enjoyments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. Faith silences the complaint with the assurance of a good issue at
 last, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:5">ver. 5</A>.

 IV. Sense renews its complaints of the present dark and melancholy
 state,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 V. Faith holds up the heart, notwithstanding, with hope that the day
 will dawn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:8">ver. 8</A>.

 VI. Sense repeats its lamentations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>)

 and sighs out the same remonstrance it had before made of its
 grievances.
 
 VII. Faith gets the last word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:11">ver.  11</A>),

 for the silencing of the complaints of sense, and, though it be almost
 the same with that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:5">ver. 5</A>)

 yet now it prevails and carries the day. The title does not tell us who 
 was the penman of this psalm, but most probably it was David, and we 
 may conjecture that it was penned by him at a time when, either by 
 Saul's persecution or Absalom's rebellion, he was driven from the 
 sanctuary and cut off from the privilege of waiting upon God in public 
 ordinances. The strain of it is much the same with 63, and therefore we 
 may presume it was penned by the same hand and upon the same or a 
 similar occasion. In singing it, if we be either in outward affliction 
 or in inward distress, we may accommodate to ourselves the melancholy 
 expressions we find here; if not, we must, in singing them, sympathize 
 with those whose case they speak too plainly, and thank God it is not 
 our own case; but those passages in it which express and excite holy 
 desires towards God, and dependence on him, we must earnestly endeavour 
 to bring our minds up to.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
 thee, O God.
 &nbsp; 2  My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
 come and appear before God?
 &nbsp; 3  My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
 continually say unto me, Where <I>is</I> thy God?
 &nbsp; 4  When I remember these <I>things,</I> I pour out my soul in me: for
 I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
 God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept
 holyday.
 &nbsp; 5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and <I>why</I> art thou
 disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him
 <I>for</I> the help of his countenance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Holy love to God as the chief good and our felicity is the power of 
 godliness, the very life and soul of religion, without which all 
 external professions and performances are but a shell and carcase: now 
 here we have some of the expressions of that love. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Holy love thirsting, love upon the wing, soaring upwards in holy 
 desires towards the Lord and towards the remembrance of his name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 "<I>My soul panteth, thirsteth, for God,</I> for nothing more than God, 
 but still for more and more of him." Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When it was that David thus expressed his vehement desire towards 
 God. It was, 

 (1.) When he was debarred from his outward opportunities of waiting on 
 God, when he was banished to the land of Jordan, a great way off from 
 the courts of God's house.  Note, Sometimes God teaches us effectually 
 to know the worth of mercies by the want of them, and whets our 
 appetite for the means of grace by cutting us short in those means.  We 
 are apt to loathe that manna, when we have plenty of it, which will be 
 very precious to us if ever we come to know the scarcity of it. 

 (2.) When he was deprived, in a great measure, of the inward comfort he 
 used to have in God. He now went mourning, but he went on panting. 
 Note, If God, by his grace, has wrought in us sincere and earnest 
 desires towards him, we may take comfort from these when we want those 
 ravishing delights we have sometimes had in God, because lamenting 
 after God is as sure an evidence that we love him as rejoicing in God.  
 Before the psalmist records his doubts, and fears, and griefs, which 
 had sorely shaken him, he premises this, That he looked upon the living 
 God as his chief good, and had set his heart upon him accordingly, and 
 was resolved to live and die by him; and, casting anchor thus at first, 
 he rides out the storm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the object of his desire and what it is he thus thirsts 
 after. 

 (1.) He pants after God, he thirsts for God, not the ordinances 
 themselves, but the God of the ordinances. A gracious soul can take 
 little satisfaction in God's courts if it do not meet with God himself 
 there: "<I>O that I knew where I might find him!</I> that I might have 
 more of the tokens of his favour, the graces and comforts of his 
 Spirit, and the earnests of his glory." 

 (2.) He has, herein, an eye to God as the living God, that has life in 
 himself, and is the fountain of life and all happiness to those that 
 are his, the living God, not only in opposition to dead idols, the 
 works of men's hands, but to all the dying comforts of this world, 
 which perish in the using. Living souls can never take up their rest 
 any where short of a living God. 

 (3.) He longs to <I>come and appear before God,</I>--to make himself
 known to him, as being conscious to himself of his own sincerity,--to 
 attend on him, as a servant appears before his master, to pay his 
 respects to him and receive his commands,--to give an account to him, 
 as one from whom our judgment proceeds. To appear before God is as much 
 the desire of the upright as it is the dread of the hypocrite. The 
 psalmist knew he could not come into God's courts without incurring 
 expense, for so was the law, that <I>none should appear before God 
 empty;</I> yet he longs to come, and will not grudge the charges.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What is the degree of this desire. It is very importunate; it is his 
 soul that pants, his soul that thirsts, which denotes not only the 
 sincerity, but the strength, of his desire. His longing for the water 
 of the well of Bethlehem was nothing to this. He compares it to the 
 <I>panting of a hart,</I> or deer, which is naturally hot and dry, 
 especially of a hunted buck, <I>after the water-brooks.</I> Thus 
 earnestly does a gracious soul desire communion with God, thus 
 impatient is it in the want of that communion, so impossible does it 
 find it to be satisfied with any thing short of that communion, and so 
 insatiable is it in taking the pleasures of that communion when the 
 opportunity of it returns, still thirsting after the full enjoyment of 
 him in the heavenly kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Holy love mourning for God's present withdrawings and the want of 
 the benefit of solemn ordinances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>My tears have been my meat day and night</I> during this forced 
 absence from God's house." His circumstances were sorrowful, and he 
 accommodated himself to them, received the impressions and returned the 
 signs of sorrow. Even the royal prophet was a weeping prophet when he 
 wanted the comforts of God's house. His tears were mingled with his 
 meat; nay, they were <I>his meat day and night;</I> he fed, he feasted, 
 upon his own tears, when there was such just cause for them; and it was 
 a satisfaction to him that he found his heart so much affected with a 
 grievance of this nature. Observe, He did not think it enough to shed a 
 tear or two at parting from the sanctuary, to weep a farewell-prayer 
 when he took his leave, but, as long as he continued under a forced 
 absence from that place of his delight, he never looked up, but wept 
 day and night. Note, Those that are deprived of the benefit of public 
 ordinances constantly miss them, and therefore should constantly mourn 
 for the want of them, till they are restored to them again. Two things 
 aggravated his grief:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reproaches with which his enemies teased him: <I>They 
 continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</I> 

 (1.) Because he was absent from the ark, the token of God's presence. 
 Judging of the God of Israel by the gods of the heathen, they concluded 
 he had lost his God.  Note, Those are mistaken who think that when they 
 have robbed us of our Bibles, and our ministers, and our solemn 
 assemblies, they have robbed us of our God; for, though God has tied us 
 to them when they are to be had, he has not tied himself to them. We 
 know where our God is, and where to find him, when we know not where 
 his ark is, nor where to find that. Wherever we are there is a way open 
 heaven-ward. 

 (2.) Because God did not immediately appear for his deliverance they 
 concluded that he had abandoned him; but herein also they were 
 deceived: it does not follow that the saints have lost their God 
 because they have lost all their other friends. However, by this base 
 reflection on God and his people, they added affliction to the 
 afflicted, and that was what they aimed at. Nothing is more grievous to 
 a gracious soul than that which is intended to shake its hope and 
 confidence in God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The remembrance of his former liberties and enjoyments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 <I>Son, remember thy good things,</I> is a great aggravation of evil 
 things, so much do our powers of reflection and anticipation add to the 
 grievance of this present time. David remembered the <I>days of 
 old,</I> and then <I>his soul was poured out in him;</I> he melted 
 away, and the thought almost broke his heart. He poured out his soul
 within him in sorrow, and then poured out his soul before God in 
 prayer. But what was it that occasioned this painful melting of spirit? 
 It was not the remembrance of the pleasures at court, or the 
 entertainments of his own house, from which he was now banished, that 
 afflicted him, but the remembrance of the free access he had formerly 
 had to God's house and the pleasure he had in attending the sacred 
 solemnities there. 

 (1.) He <I>went to the house of God,</I> though in his time it was but 
 a tent; nay, if this psalm was penned, as many think it was, at the 
 time of his being persecuted by Saul, the ark was then in a private 
 house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:3">2 Sam. vi. 3</A>.

 But the meanness, obscurity, and inconveniency of the place did not
 lessen his esteem of that sacred symbol of the divine presence. David 
 was a courtier, a prince, a man of honour, a man of business, and yet 
 very diligent in attending God's house and joining in public 
 ordinances, even in the days of Saul, when he and his great men 
 <I>enquired not at it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:3">1 Chron. xiii. 3</A>.

 Whatever others did, David and his house would serve the Lord. 

 (2.) He <I>went with the multitude,</I> and thought it no disparagement 
 to his dignity to be at the head of a crowd in attending upon God. Nay, 
 this added to the pleasure of it, that he was accompanied with a 
 multitude, and therefore it is twice mentioned, as that which he 
 greatly lamented the want of now. The more the better in the service of 
 God; it is the more like heaven, and a sensible help to our comfort in 
 the communion of saints. 

 (3.) He went <I>with the voice of joy and praise,</I> not only with joy 
 and praise in his heart, but with the outward expressions of it, 
 proclaiming his joy and speaking forth the high praises of his God.  
 Note, When we wait upon God in public ordinances we have reason to do 
 it both with cheerfulness and thankfulness, to take to ourselves the 
 comfort and give to God the glory of our liberty of access to him.  
 
 (4.) He went to keep holy-days, not to keep them in vain mirth and
 recreation, but in religious exercises. Solemn days are spent most 
 comfortably in solemn assemblies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Holy love hoping 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?</I> His sorrow was upon a very 
 good account, and yet it must not exceed its due limits, nor prevail to 
 depress his spirits; he therefore communes with his own heart, for his 
 relief.  "Come, my soul, I have something to say to thee in thy 
 heaviness." Let us consider,

 1. The cause of it.  "Thou art cast down, as one stooping and sinking
 under a burden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:25">Prov.  xii. 25</A>.

 Thou art disquieted, in confusion and disorder; now why are thou so?"
 This may be taken as an enquiring question: "Let the cause of this 
 uneasiness be duly weighed, and see whether it be a just cause." Our 
 disquietudes would in many cases vanish before a strict scrutiny into 
 the grounds and reasons of them.  "<I>Why am I cast down?</I> Is there 
 a cause, a real cause? Have not others more cause, that do not make so 
 much ado? Have not we, at the same time, cause to be encouraged?" Or it 
 may be taken as an expostulating question; those that commune much with 
 their own hearts will often have occasion to chide them, as David here.  
 "Why do I thus dishonour God by my melancholy dejections? Why do I 
 discourage others and do so much injury to myself? Can I give a good 
 account of this tumult?" 

 2. The cure of it: <I>Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him.</I> 
 A believing confidence in God is a sovereign antidote against 
 prevailing despondency and disquietude of spirit. And therefore, when 
 we chide ourselves to hope in God; when the soul embraces itself it 
 sinks; if it catch hold on the power and promise of God, it keeps the 
 head above water. <I>Hope in God,</I>

 (1.) That he shall have glory from us: "<I>I shall yet praise him;</I> 
 I shall experience such a change in my state that I shall not want 
 matter for praise, and such a change in my spirit that I shall not want 
 a heart for praise." It is the greatest honour and happiness of a man, 
 and the greatest desire and hope of every good man, to be unto God for 
 a name and a praise. What is the crown of heaven's bliss but this, that 
 there we shall be for ever praising God? And what is our support under 
 our present woes but this, that we shall yet praise God, that they 
 shall not prevent nor abate our endless hallelujahs? 

 (2.) That we shall have comfort in him. We shall praise him <I>for the 
 help of his countenance,</I> for his favour, the support we have by it 
 and the satisfaction we have in it. Those that know how to value and 
 improve the light of God's countenance will find in that a suitable, 
 seasonable, and sufficient help, in the worst of times, and that which 
 will furnish them with constant matter for praise. David's believing 
 expectation of this kept him from sinking, nay, it kept him from 
 drooping; his harp was a palliative cure of Saul's melancholy, but his 
 hope was an effectual cure of his own.</P>

 thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>Yet</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will command his lovingkindness in the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Complaints and comforts here, as before, take their turn, like day and 
 night in the course of nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He complains of the dejections of his spirit, but comforts himself 
 with the thoughts of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. In his troubles. His soul was dejected, and he goes to God and tells
 him so: <I>O my God! my soul is cast down within me.</I> It is a great 
 support to us, when upon any account we are distressed, that we have 
 liberty of access to God, and liberty of speech before him, and may 
 open to him the causes of our dejection. David had communed with his 
 own heart about its own bitterness, and had not as yet found relief; 
 and therefore he turns to God, and opens before him the trouble. Note, 
 When we cannot get relief for our burdened spirits by pleading with 
 ourselves, we should try what we can do by praying to God and leaving 
 our case with him. We cannot still these winds and waves; but we know 
 who can. 

 2. In his devotions.  His soul was elevated, and, finding the disease 
 very painful, he had recourse to that as a sovereign remedy.  "My soul 
 is plunged; therefore, to prevent its sinking, I will remember thee, 
 meditate upon thee, and call upon thee, and try what that will do to 
 keep up my spirit." Note, The way to forget the sense of our miseries 
 is to remember the God of our mercies. It was an uncommon case when the 
 psalmist <I>remembered God and was troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:3">Ps. lxxvii. 3</A>.

 He had often remembered God and was comforted, and therefore had
 recourse to that expedient now. He was now driven to the utmost borders 
 of the land of Canaan, to shelter himself there from the rage of his 
 persecutors--sometimes <I>to the country about Jordan,</I> and, when 
 discovered there, to <I>the land of the Hermonites,</I> or to a hill 
 called <I>Mizar,</I> or <I>the little hill;</I> but,

 (1.) Wherever he went he took his religion along with him. In all these 
 places, he remembered God, and lifted up his heart to him, and kept his 
 secret communion with him. This is the comfort of the banished, the 
 wanderers, the travellers, of those that are strangers in a strange 
 land, that <I>undique ad c&aelig;los tantundem est vi&aelig;--wherever 
 they are there is a way open heavenward.</I> 

 (2.) Wherever he was he retained his affection for the courts of God's
 house; from the land of Jordan, or from the top of the hills, he used 
 to look a long look, a longing look, towards the place of the 
 sanctuary, and wish himself there. Distance and time could not make him 
 forget that which his heart was so much upon and which lay so near 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He complains of the tokens of God's displeasure against him, but 
 comforts himself with the hopes of the return of his favour in due 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He saw his troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Deep calls unto deep,</I> one affliction comes upon the neck of 
 another, as if it were called to hasten after it; and thy water-spouts 
 give the signal and sound the alarm of war." It may be meant of the 
 terror and disquietude of his mind under the apprehensions of God's 
 anger. One frightful thought summoned another, and made way for it, as 
 is usual in melancholy people. He was overpowered and overwhelmed with 
 a deluge of grief, like that of the old world, when the windows of 
 heaven were opened and the fountains of the great deep were broken up. 
 Or it is an allusion to a ship at sea in a great storm, tossed by the 
 roaring waves, which go over it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:25">Ps. cvii. 25</A>.

 Whatever waves and billows of affliction go over us at any time we must
 call them God's waves and his billows, that we may humble ourselves 
 under his mighty hand, and may encourage ourselves to hope that though 
 we be threatened we shall not be ruined; for the waves and billows are 
 under a divine check.  <I>The Lord on high is mightier than the noise 
 of these many waters.</I> Let not good men think it strange if they be 
 exercised with many and various trials, and if they come thickly upon 
 them; God knows what he does, and so shall they shortly. Jonah, in the 
 whale's belly, made use of these words of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:3">Jonah ii. 3</A>

 (they are exactly the same in the original), and of him they were
 literally true, <I>All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me;</I> 
 for the book of psalms is contrived so as to reach every one's 
 case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He expected his deliverance to come from God's favour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness.</I> Things are bad, 
 but they shall not always be so. <I>Non si male nunc et olim sic 
 erit--Though affairs are now in an evil plight, they may not always be 
 so.</I> After the storm there will come a calm, and the prospect of 
 this supported him when deep called unto deep. Observe

 (1.) What he promised himself from God: <I>The Lord will command his 
 lovingkindness.</I> He eyes the favour of God as the fountain of all 
 the good he looked for. That is life; that is better than life; and 
 with that God will gather those from whom he has, <I>in a little wrath, 
 hid his face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8">Isa. liv. 7, 8</A>.

 God's conferring his favour is called his <I>commanding</I> it. This
 intimates the freeness of it; we cannot pretend to merit it, but it is 
 bestowed in a way of sovereignty, he gives like a king. It intimates 
 also the efficacy of it; he speaks his lovingkindness, and makes us to 
 hear it; speaks, and it is done.  He <I>commands deliverance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:4">Ps.  xliv. 4</A>),
 
 <I>commands the blessing</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:3">Ps. cxxxiii. 3</A>),

 as one having authority. By commanding his lovingkindness, he commands
 down the waves and the billows, and they shall obey him.  This he will 
 do <I>in the daytime,</I> for God's lovingkindness will make day in the 
 soul at any time. Though <I>weeping</I> has <I>endured for a night,</I> 
 a long night, yet <I>joy will come in the morning.</I>

 (2.) What he promised for himself to God. If God command his 
 lovingkindness for him, he will meet it, and bid it welcome, with his 
 best affections and devotions.

 [1.] He will rejoice in God: <I>In the night his song shall be with 
 me.</I> The mercies we receive in the day we ought to return thanks for 
 at night; when others are sleeping we should be praising God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:62">Ps. cxix. 62</A>,

 <I>At midnight will I rise to give thanks.</I> In silence and solitude,
 when we are retired from the hurries of the world, we must be pleasing 
 ourselves with the thoughts of God's goodness. Or in the night of 
 affliction: "Before the day dawns, in which God commands his 
 lovingkindness, I will sing songs of praise in the prospect of it." 
 Even in tribulation the saints can <I>rejoice in hope of the glory of 
 God,</I> sing in hope, and praise in hope,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:2,3">Rom. v. 2, 3</A>.

 It is God's prerogative to <I>give songs in the night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10">Job xxxv. 10</A>.

 [2.] He will seek to God in a constant dependence upon him: <I>My 
 prayer shall be to the God of my life.</I> Our believing expectation of 
 mercy must not supersede, but quicken, our prayers for it. God is the 
 God of our life, in whom we live and move, the author and giver of all 
 our comforts; and therefore to whom should we apply by prayer, but to 
 him? And from him what good may not we expect? It would put life into 
 our prayers in them to eye God as the God of our life; for then it is 
 for our lives, and the lives of our souls, that we stand up to make 
 request.</P>

 III. He complains of the insolence of his enemies, and yet comforts 
 himself in God as his friend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:9-11"><I>v.</I>  9-11.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His complaint is that his enemies oppressed and reproached him, and 
 this made a great impression upon him. 

 (1.) They oppressed him to such a degree that he went mourning from day 
 to day, from place to place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:9"><I>v.</I>  9</A>.

 He did not break out into indecent passions, though abused as never man
 was, but he silently wept out his grief, and went mourning; and for 
 this we cannot blame him: it must needs grieve a man that truly loves 
 his country, and seeks the good of it, to see himself persecuted and 
 hardly used, as if he were an enemy to it. Yet David ought not hence to 
 have concluded that God had forgotten him and cast him off, nor thus to 
 have expostulated with him, as if he did him as much wrong in suffering 
 him to be trampled upon as those did that trampled upon him: <I>Why go 
 I mourning?</I> and <I>why hast thou forgotten me?</I> We may complain 
 to God, but we are not allowed thus to complain of him.

 (2.) They reproached him so cuttingly that it was a <I>sword in his
 bones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>.

 He had mentioned before what the reproach was that touched him thus to
 the quick, and here he repeats it: <I>They say daily unto me, Where is 
 thy God?</I>--a reproach which was very grievous to him, both because 
 it reflected dishonour upon God and was intended to discourage his hope 
 in God, which he had enough to do to keep up in any measure, and which 
 was but too apt to fail of itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His comfort is that God is his <I>rock</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 --a rock to build upon, a rock to take shelter in. The rock of ages, in 
 whom is everlasting strength, would be his rock, his strength in the 
 inner man, both for doing and suffering. To him he had access with 
 confidence. To God his rock he might say what he had to say, and be 
 sure of a gracious audience. He therefore repeats what he had before
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and concludes with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?</I> His griefs and fears were 
 clamorous and troublesome; they were not silenced though they were 
 again and again answered. But here, at length, his faith came off a 
 conqueror and forced the enemies to quit the field. And he gains this 
 victory,

 (1.) By repeating what he had before said, chiding himself, as before, 
 for his dejections and disquietudes, and encouraging himself to trust 
 in the name of the Lord and to stay himself upon his God. Note, It may 
 be of great use to us to think our good thoughts over again, and, if we 
 do not gain our point with them at first, perhaps we may the second 
 time; however, where the heart goes along with the words, it is no vain 
 repetition. We have need to press the same thing over and over again 
 upon our hearts, and all little enough. 

 (2.) By adding one word to it; <I>there</I> he hoped to praise God for 
 the salvation that was in his countenance; <I>here,</I> "I will praise 
 him," says he, "as the salvation of my countenance from the present 
 cloud that is upon it; if God smile upon me, that will make me look 
 pleasant, look up, look forward, look round, with pleasure." He adds, 
 <I>and my God,</I> "related to me, in covenant with me; all that he is, 
 all that he has, is mine, according to the true intent and meaning of 
 the promise." This thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs 
 and fears. God's being with the saints in heaven, and being their God, 
 is that which will <I>wipe away all tears from their eyes,</I>
