 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Septuagint translation joins this psalm with the ninth, and makes
 them but one; but the Hebrew makes it a distinct psalm, and the scope 
 and style are certainly different. In this psalm, 

 I. David complains of the wickedness of the wicked, describes the
 dreadful pitch of impiety at which they had arrived (to the great 
 dishonour of God and the prejudice of his church and people), and 
 notices the delay of God's appearing against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He prays to God to appear against them for the relief of his people
 and comforts himself with hopes that he would do so in due time,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Why standest thou afar off, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? <I>why</I> hidest thou
 <I>thyself</I> in times of trouble?
 &nbsp; 2  The wicked in <I>his</I> pride doth persecute the poor: let them
 be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
 &nbsp; 3  For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
 the covetous, <I>whom</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> abhorreth.
 &nbsp; 4  The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
 seek <I>after God:</I> God <I>is</I> not in all his thoughts.
 &nbsp; 5  His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <I>are</I> far above
 out of his sight: <I>as for</I> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
 &nbsp; 6  He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <I>I
 shall</I> never <I>be</I> in adversity.
 &nbsp; 7  His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
 tongue <I>is</I> mischief and vanity.
 &nbsp; 8  He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
 secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily
 set against the poor.
 &nbsp; 9  He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
 wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth
 him into his net.
 &nbsp; 10  He croucheth, <I>and</I> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall
 by his strong ones.
 &nbsp; 11  He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
 face; he will never see <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in these verses, discovers,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A very great affection to God and his favour; for, in the time of
 trouble, that which he complains of most feelingly is God's withdrawing
 his gracious presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Why standest thou afar off,</I> as one unconcerned in the
 indignities done to thy name and the injuries done to the people?" 
 Note, God's withdrawings are very grievous to his people at any time, 
 but especially in times of trouble. Outward deliverance is afar off and 
 is hidden from us, and then we think God is afar off and we therefore 
 want inward comfort; but that is our own fault; it is because we judge 
 by outward appearance; we stand afar off from God by our unbelief, and 
 then we complain that God stands afar off from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A very great indignation against sin, the sins that made the times 
 perilous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:1">2 Tim. iii. 1</A>.

 he beholds the transgressors and is grieved, is amazed, and brings to
 his heavenly Father their evil report, not in a way of vain-glory, 
 boasting before God that he was not as <I>these publicans</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11">Luke xviii. 11</A>),

 much less venting any personal resentments, piques, or passions, of his 
 own; but as one that laid to he art that which is offensive to God and 
 all good men, and earnestly desired a reformation of manners. 
 passionate and satirical invectives against bad men do more hurt than 
 good; if we will speak of their badness, let it be to God in prayer, 
 for he alone can make them better. This long representation of the 
 wickedness of the wicked is here summed up in the first words of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor,</I> where two
 things are laid to their charge, pride and persecution, the former the 
 cause of the latter. Proud men will have all about them to be of their 
 mind, of their religion, to say as they say, to submit to their 
 dominion, and acquiesce in their dictates; and those that either 
 eclipse them or will not yield to them they malign and hate with an 
 inveterate hatred. Tyranny, both in state and church, owes its origin 
 to pride. The psalmist, having begun this description, presently 
 inserts a short prayer, a prayer in a parenthesis, which is an 
 advantage and no prejudice to the sense: <I>Let them be taken,</I> as 
 proud people often are, <I>in the devices that they have imagined,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Let their counsels be turned headlong, and let them fall headlong by 
 them. These two heads of the charge are here enlarged upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are proud, very proud, and extremely conceited of themselves; 
 justly therefore did he wonder that God did not speedily appear against 
 them, for he hates pride, and resists the proud. 

 (1.) The sinner proudly glories in his power and success. He <I>boasts 
 of his heart's desire,</I> boasts that he can do what he pleases (as if 
 God himself could not control him) and that he has all he wished for 
 and has carried his point. Ephraim said, <I>I have become rich, I have 
 found me out substance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+12:8">Hos. xii. 8</A>.

 "Now, Lord, is it for thy glory to suffer a sinful man thus to pretend
 to the sovereignty and felicity of a God?"

 (2.) He proudly contradicts the judgment of God, which, we are sure, is 
 according to truth; for he <I>blesses the covetous, whom the Lord 
 abhors.</I> See how God and men differ in their sentiments of persons: 
 God abhors covetous worldlings, who make money their God and idolize 
 is; he looks upon them as his enemies, and will have no communion with 
 them. <I>The friendship of the world is enmity to God.</I> But proud 
 persecutors bless them, and approve their sayings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:13">Ps. xlix. 13</A>.

 They applaud those as wise whom God pronounces foolish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:20">Luke xii. 20</A>);

 they justify those as innocent whom God condemns as deeply guilty
 before him; and they admire those as happy, in having their portion in 
 this life, whom God declares, upon that account, truly miserable. 
 <I>Thou, in thy lifetime, receivedst thy good things.</I> 

 (3.) He proudly casts off the thoughts of God, and all dependence upon 
 him and devotion to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance,</I> that pride of
 his heart which appears in his very countenance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:17">Prov. vi. 17</A>),

 <I>will not seek after God,</I> nor entertain the thoughts of him.
 <I>God is not in all his thoughts,</I> not in any of them. <I>All his 
 thoughts are that there is not God.</I> See here,

 [1.] The nature of impiety and irreligion; it is <I>not seeking after 
 God</I> and <I>not having him in our thoughts.</I> There is no enquiry 
 made after him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10,Jer+2:6">Job xxxv. 10, Jer. ii. 6</A>),

 no desire towards him, no communion with him, but a secret wish to have
 no dependence upon him and not to be beholden to him. Wicked people 
 will not seek after God (that is, will not call upon him); they live 
 without prayer, and that is living without God. They have many 
 thoughts, many projects and devices, but no eye to God in any of them, 
 no submission to his will nor aim at his glory.

 [2.] The cause of this impiety and irreligion; and that is pride. Men 
 will not seek after God because they think they have no need of him, 
 their own hands are sufficient for them; they think it a thing below 
 them to be religious, because religious people are few, and mean, and 
 despised, and the restraints of religion will be a disparagement to 
 them. 

 (4.) He proudly makes light of God's commandments and judgments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>His wings are always grievous;</I> he is very daring and resolute in
 his sinful courses; he will have his way, though ever so tiresome to 
 himself and vexatious to others; he travails with pain in his wicked 
 courses, and yet his pride makes him wilful and obstinate in them. 
 God's judgments (what he commands and what he threatens for the breach 
 of his commands) are <I>far above out of his sight;</I> he is not 
 sensible of his duty by the law of God nor of his danger by the wrath 
 and curse of God. Tell him of God's authority over him, he turns it off 
 with this, that he never saw God and therefore does not know that there 
 is a God, he is <I>in the height of heaven,</I> and <I>qu&aelig; supra 
 nos nihil ad nos--we have nothing to do with things above us.</I> Tell 
 him of God's judgments which will be executed upon those that go on 
 still in their trespasses, and he will not be convinced that there is 
 any reality in them; they are <I>far above out of his sight,</I> and 
 therefore he thinks they are mere bugbears. 

 (5.) He proudly despises all his enemies, and looks upon them with the 
 utmost disdain; he puffs at those whom God is preparing to be a scourge 
 and ruin to him, as if he could baffle them all, and was able to make 
 his part good with them. But, as it is impolitic to despise an enemy,
 so it is impious to despise any instrument of God's wrath. 

 (6.) He proudly sets trouble at defiance and is confident of the 
 continuance of his own prosperity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He hath said in his heart,</I> and pleased himself with the thought,
 <I>I shall not be moved,</I> my goods are laid up for many years, and 
 <I>I shall never be in adversity;</I> like Babylon, that said, <I>I 
 shall be a lady for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:7,Re+18:7">Isa. xlvii. 7; Rev. xviii. 7</A>.

 Those are nearest ruin who thus set it furthest from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are persecutors, cruel persecutors. For the gratifying of their 
 pride and covetousness, and in opposition to God and religion, they are 
 very oppressive to all within their reach. Observe, concerning these 
 persecutors, 

 (1.) That they are very bitter and malicious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>His mouth is full of cursing.</I> Those he cannot do a real mischief
 to, yet he will spit his venom at, and breathe out the slaughter which 
 he cannot execute. Thus have God's faithful worshippers been 
 anathematized and cursed, with bell, book, and candle. Where there is a 
 heart full of malice there is commonly a mouth full of curses.

 (2.) They are very false and treacherous. There is mischief designed, 
 but it is hidden under the tongue, not to be discerned, for <I>his 
 mouth is full of deceit</I> and vanity. He has learned of the devil to 
 deceive, and so to destroy; with this his hatred is covered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:26">Prov. xxvi. 26</A>.

 He cares not what lies he tells, not what oaths he breaks, nor what
 arts of dissimulation he uses, to compass his ends.

 (3.) That they are very cunning and crafty in carrying on their 
 designs. They have ways and means to concert what they intend, that 
 they may the more effectually accomplish it. Like Esau, that cunning 
 hunter, <I>he sits in the lurking places, in the secret places,</I> and 
 <I>his eyes are privily set</I> to do mischief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 not because he is ashamed of what he does (if he blushed, there were
 some hopes he would repent), not because he is afraid of the wrath of 
 God, for he imagines God will never call him to an account

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but because he is afraid lest the discovery of his designs should be
 the breaking of them. Perhaps it refers particularly to robbers and 
 highwaymen, who lie in wait for honest travellers, to make a prey of 
 them and what they have.

 (4.) That they are very cruel and barbarous. Their malice is against 
 <I>the innocent,</I> who never provoked them--against <I>the poor,</I> 
 who cannot resist them and over whom it will be no glory to triumph. 
 Those are perfectly lost to all honesty and honour against whose 
 mischievous designs neither innocence nor poverty will be any man's 
 security. Those that have power ought to protect the innocent and 
 provide for the poor; yet these will be the destroyers of those whose 
 guardians they ought to be. And what do they aim at? It is to <I>catch
 the poor,</I> and <I>draw them into their net,</I> that is, get them 
 into their power, not to strip them only, but to <I>murder them.</I> 
 They hunt for the precious life. It is God's poor people that they are 
 persecuting, against whom they bear a mortal hatred for his sake whose 
 they are and whose image they bear, and therefore they lie in wait to 
 murder them: <I>He lies in wait as a lion</I> that thirsts after blood, 
 and feeds with pleasure upon the prey. The devil, whose agent he is, is 
 compared to a roaring lion that seeks not what, but whom, he may 
 devour. 

 (5.) That they are base and hypocritical 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>He crouches and humbles himself,</I> as beasts of prey do, that they
 may get their prey within their reach. This intimates that the sordid 
 spirits of persecutors and oppressors will stoop to any thing, though 
 ever so mean, for the compassing of their wicked designs; witness the 
 scandalous practices of Saul when he hunted David. It intimates, 
 likewise, that they cover their malicious designs with the pretence of 
 meekness and humility, and kindness to those they design the greatest 
 mischief to; they seem to humble themselves to take cognizance of the 
 poor, and concern themselves in their concernments, when it is in order 
 to make them fall, to make a prey of them.

 (6.) That they are very impious and atheistical, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They could not thus break through all the laws of justice and goodness
 towards man if they had not first shaken off all sense of religion, and 
 risen up in rebellion against the light of its most sacred and 
 self-evident principles: <I>He hath said in his heart, God has 
 forgotten.</I> When his own conscience rebuked him with the 
 consequences of it, and asked how he would answer it to the righteous 
 Judge of heaven and earth, he turned it off with this, <I>God has 
 forsaken the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12,9:9">Ezek. viii. 12; ix. 9</A>.

 This is a blasphemous reproach, 

 [1.] Upon God's omniscience and providence, as if he could not, or did 
 not, see what men do in this lower world.

 [2.] Upon his holiness and the rectitude of his nature, as if, though 
 he did see, yet he did not dislike, but was willing to connive at, the 
 most unnatural and inhuman villanies. 

 [3.] Upon his justice and the equity of his government, as if, though 
 he did see and dislike the wickedness of the wicked, yet he would never 
 reckon with them, nor punish them for it, either because he could not 
 or durst not, or because he was not inclined to do so. Let those that 
 suffer by proud oppressors hope that God will, in due time, appear for 
 them; for those that are abusive to them are abusive to God Almighty 
 too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this psalm and praying it over, we should have our hearts 
 much affected with a holy indignation at the wickedness of the 
 oppressors, a tender compassion of the miseries of the oppressed, and a 
 pious zeal for the glory and honour of God, with a firm belief that he 
 will, in due time, give redress to the injured and reckon with the 
 injurious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here, upon the foregoing representation of the inhumanity and 
 impiety of the oppressors, grounds an address to God, wherein 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What he prays for. 

 1. That God would himself appear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Arise, O Lord! O God! lift up thy hand,</I> manifest thy presence
 and providence in the affairs of this lower world. <I>Arise, O 
 Lord!</I> to the confusion of those who say that thou hidest thy face.
 Manifest thy power, exert it for the maintaining of thy own cause, lift 
 up thy hand to give a fatal blow to these oppressors; let thy 
 everlasting arm be made bare."

 2. That he would appear for his people: "<I>Forget not the humble, the 
 afflicted,</I> that are poor, that are made poorer, and are poor in 
 spirit. Their oppressors, in their presumption, say that thou hast 
 forgotten them; and they, in their despair, are ready to say the same.
 Lord, make it to appear that they are both mistaken." 

 3. That he would appear against their persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) That he would disable them from doing any mischief: <I>Break thou 
 the arm of the wicked,</I> take away his power, <I>that the hypocrite 
 reign not, lest the people be ensnared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:30">Job xxxiv. 30</A>.

 We read of oppressors whose dominion was taken away, but their lives
 were prolonged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:12">Dan. vii. 12</A>),
 
 that they might have time to repent.

 (2.) That he would deal with them for the mischief they had done: 
 "<I>Seek out his wickedness;</I> let that be all brought to light which 
 he thought should for ever lie undiscovered; let that be all brought to 
 account which he thought should for ever go unpunished; bring it out 
 <I>till thou find none,</I> that is, till none of his evil deeds remain 
 unreckoned for, none of his evil designs undefeated, and none of his 
 partisans undestroyed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he pleads for the encouraging of his own faith in these 
 petitions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pleads the great affronts which these proud oppressors put upon 
 God himself: "Lord, it is thy own cause that we beg thou wouldst appear 
 in; the enemies have made it so, and therefore it is not for thy glory 
 to let them go unpunished" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Wherefore do the wicked contemn God?</I> He does so; for he says,
 "<I>Thou wilt not require it;</I> thou wilt never call us to an account 
 for what we do," than which they could not put a greater indignity upon 
 the righteous God. The psalmist here speaks with astonishment,

 (1.) At the wickedness of the wicked: "Why do they speak so impiously, 
 why so absurdly?" It is a great trouble to good men to think what 
 contempt is cast upon the holy God by the sin of sinners, upon his 
 precepts, his promises, his threatenings, his favours, his judgments; 
 all are despised and made light of. <I>Wherefore do the wicked thus
 contemn God?</I> It is because they do not know him. 

 (2.) At the patience and forbearance of God towards them: "Why are they 
 suffered thus to contemn God? Why does he not immediately vindicate 
 himself and take vengeance on them?" It is because the day of reckoning 
 is yet to come, when the measure of their iniquity is full.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pleads the notice God took of the impiety and iniquity of these 
 oppressors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "Do the persecutors encourage themselves with a groundless fancy that
 thou wilt never see it? Let the persecuted encourage themselves with a 
 well-grounded faith, not only that thou hast seen it, but that thou 
 doest behold it, even all the mischief that is done by the hands, and 
 all the spite and malice that lurk in the hearts, of these oppressors; 
 it is all known to thee, and observed by thee; nay, not only thou hast 
 seen it and dost behold it, but thou wilt requite it, wilt recompense 
 it into their bosoms, by thy just and avenging hand."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He pleads the dependence which the oppressed had upon him: "<I>The
 poor commits himself unto thee,</I> each of them does so, I among the
 rest. They rely on thee as their patron and protector, they refer
 themselves to thee as their Judge, in whose determination they
 acquiesce and at whose disposal they are willing to be. <I>They leave
 themselves with thee</I>" (so some read it), "not prescribing, but
 subscribing, to thy wisdom and will. They thus give thee honour as much 
 as their oppressors dishonour thee. They are thy willing subjects, and 
 put themselves under thy protection; therefore protect them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He pleads the relation in which God is pleased to stand to us, 

 (1.) As a great God. He <I>is King for ever and ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And it is the office of a king to administer justice for the restraint
 and terror of evil-doers and the protection and praise of those that do 
 well. To whom should the injured subjects appeal but to the sovereign?
 <I>Help, my Lord, O King! Avenge me of my adversary.</I> "Lord, let all 
 that pay homage and tribute to thee as their King have the benefit of 
 thy government and find thee their refuge. Thou art an everlasting 
 King, which no earthly prince is, and therefore canst and wilt, by an 
 eternal judgment, dispense rewards and punishments in an everlasting 
 state, when time shall be no more; and to that judgment the poor refer 
 themselves."

 (2.) As a good God. He is the helper of the fatherless 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 of those who have no one else to help them and have many to injure
 them. He has appointed kings to <I>defend the poor and fatherless</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3">Ps. lxxxii. 3</A>),

 and therefore much more will he do so himself; for he has taken it
 among the titles of his honour to be a Father to the fatherless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:5">Ps. lxviii. 5</A>),

 a helper of the helpless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He pleads the experience which God's church and people had had of 
 God's readiness to appear for them. 

 (1.) He had dispersed and extirpated their enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>The heathen have perished out of his land;</I> the remainders of
 the Canaanites, the seven devoted nations, which have long been as 
 thorns in the eyes and goads in the sides of Israel, are now, at 
 length, utterly rooted out; and this is an encouragement to us to hope 
 that God will, in like manner, break the arm of the oppressive 
 Israelites, who were, in some respects, worse than heathens."

 (2.) He had heard and answered their prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Lord, thou hast</I> many a time <I>heard the desire of the
 humble,</I> and never saidst to a distressed suppliant, <I>Seek in
 vain.</I> Why may not we hope for the continuance and repetition of the
 wonders, the favours, which our father told us of?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He pleads their expectations from God pursuant to their experience
 of him: "<I>Thou hast heard,</I> therefore <I>thou will cause thy ear
 to hear,</I> as, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:9">Ps. vi. 9</A>.

 Thou art the same, and thy power, and promise, and relation to thy
 people are the same, and the work and workings of grace are the same in 
 them; why therefore may we not hope that he who has been will still be, 
 will ever be, a God hearing prayers?" But observe,

 (1.) In what method God hears prayer. He first prepares the heart of 
 his people and then gives them an answer of peace; nor may we expect 
 his gracious answer, but in this way; so that God's working upon us is 
 the best earnest of his working for us. He prepares the heart for 
 prayer by kindling holy desires, and strengthening our most holy faith, 
 fixing the thoughts and raising the affections, and then he graciously 
 accepts the prayer; he prepares the heart for the mercy itself that is 
 wanting and prayed for, makes us fit to receive it and use it well, and 
 then gives it in to us. The preparation of the heart is from the Lord,
 and we must seek unto him for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:1">Prov. xvi. 1</A>)

 and take that as a leading favour.

 (2.) What he will do in answer to prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 [1.] He will plead the cause of the persecuted, will judge the 
 fatherless and oppressed, will judge for them, clear up their 
 innocency, restore their comforts, and recompense them for all the loss 
 and damage they have sustained. 

 [2.] He will put an end to the fury of the persecutors. Hitherto they 
 shall come, but no further; here shall the proud waves of their malice 
 be stayed; an effectual course shall be taken <I>that the man of the 
 earth may no more oppress.</I> See how light the psalmist now makes of 
 the power of that proud persecutor whom he had been describing in this 
 psalm, and how slightly he speaks of him now that he had been 
 considering God's sovereignty. <I>First,</I> He is but <I>a man of the 
 earth,</I> a man <I>out of</I> the earth (so the word is), sprung out 
 of the earth, and therefore mean, and weak, and hastening to the earth 
 again. Why then should we be afraid of the fury of the oppressor when 
 he is but <I>man that shall die, a son of man that shall be as 
 grass?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12">Isa. li. 12</A>.

 He that protects us is the Lord of heaven; he that persecutes us is but
 a man of the earth. <I>Secondly,</I> God has him in a chain, and can
 easily restrain the remainder of his wrath, so that he cannot do what 
 he would. When God speaks the word Satan shall by his instruments no 
 more deceive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:3">Rev. xx. 3</A>),

 no more oppress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:12-18">these verses</A>

 we must commit religion's just but injured cause to God, as those that
 are heartily concerned for its honour and interests, believing that he 
 will, in due time, plead it with jealousy.</P>
