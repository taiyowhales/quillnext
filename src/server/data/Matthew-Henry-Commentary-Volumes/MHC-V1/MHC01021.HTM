 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> visited Sarah as 
 he had said, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did
 unto Sarah as he had spoken.
 &nbsp; 2 For 
 Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham 
 a son in his old age, at the set time 
 of which God had spoken to him.
 &nbsp; 3 And Abraham called the name of his 
 son that was born unto him, whom 
 Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 Abraham circumcised his son Isaac 
 being eight days old, as God had commanded 
 him.
 &nbsp; 5 And Abraham was 
 an hundred years old, when his son 
 Isaac was born unto him.
 &nbsp; 6 And Sarah 
 said, God hath made me to laugh, 
 <I>so that</I> all that hear will laugh with 
 me.
 &nbsp; 7 And she said, Who would have 
 said unto Abraham, that Sarah should 
 have given children suck? for I have 
 borne <I>him</I> a son in his old age.
 &nbsp; 8 And 
 the child grew, and was weaned: and 
 Abraham made a great feast the <I>same</I> 
 day that Isaac was weaned.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Long-looked-for comes at last. The vision 
 concerning the promised seed is for an appointed 
 time, and now, at the end, it speaks, 
 and does not lie; few under the Old Testament 
 were brought into the world with such 
 expectation as Isaac was, not for the sake of 
 any great person eminence at which he 
 was to arrive, but because he was to be, in 
 this very thing, a type of Christ, that seed 
 which the holy God had so long promised 
 and holy men so long expected. In this 
 account of the first days of Isaac we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fulfilling of God's promise in the 
 conception and birth of Isaac,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 Note, 
 God's providences look best and brightest 
 when they are compared with his word, and 
 when we observe how God, in them all, acts 
 as he has said, as he has spoken. 
 
 1. Isaac 
 was born according to the promise. The 
 Lord visited Sarah in mercy, as he had said. 
 Note, No word of God shall fall to the 
 ground; for he is faithful that has promised, 
 and God's faithfulness is the stay and support 
 of his people's faith. He was born <I>at 
 the set time of which God had spoken,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Note, God is always punctual to his time; 
 though his promised mercies come not at 
 the time we set, they will certainly come at 
 the time he sets, and that is the best time. 
 
 2. He was born by virtue of the promise: 
 <I>Sarah by faith received strength to conceive</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11">Heb. xi. 11</A>.
 God therefore by promise 
 gave that strength. It was not by the 
 power of common providence, but by the 
 power of a special promise, that Isaac 
 was born. A sentence of death was, as it 
 were, passed upon the second causes: Abraham 
 was old, and Sarah old, and both as 
 good as dead; and then the word of God 
 took place. Note, True believers, by virtue 
 of God's promises, are enabled to do that 
 which is above the power of human nature, 
 for <I>by them they partake of a divine nature,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4">2 Pet. i. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abraham's obedience to God's precept 
 concerning Isaac.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He named him, as God commanded 
 him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 God directed him to a name for 
 a memorial, <I>Isaac, laughter;</I> and Abraham, 
 whose office it was, gave him that name, 
 though he might have designed him some 
 other name of a more pompous signification. 
 Note, It is fit that the luxuriancy of human 
 invention should always yield to the sovereignty 
 and plainness of divine institution; 
 yet there was good reason for the name, for, 
 
 (1.) When Abraham received the promise of 
 him he laughed for joy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>.
 Note,
 When the sun of comfort has risen upon the 
 soul it is good to remember how welcome 
 the dawning of the day was, and with what 
 exultation we embraced the promise. 
 
 (2.) When Sarah received the promise she 
 laughed with distrust and diffidence. Note, 
 When God gives us the mercies we began 
 to despair of we ought to remember with 
 sorrow and shame our sinful distrusts of 
 God's power and promise, when we were in 
 pursuit of them. 
 
 (3.) Isaac was himself, 
 afterwards, laughed at by Ishmael
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 and perhaps his name bade him expect it. 
 Note, God's favourites are often the world's 
 laughing-stocks. 
 
 (4.) The promise which 
 he was not only the son, but the heir of, 
 was to be the joy of all the saints in all ages, 
 and that which would fill their mouths with 
 laughter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He circumcised him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 The covenant 
 being established with him, the seal of 
 the covenant was administered to him; and 
 though a bloody ordinance, and he a darling, 
 yet it must not be omitted, no, nor deferred 
 beyond the eighth day. God had kept time 
 in performing the promise, and therefore 
 Abraham must keep time in obeying the 
 precept.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The impressions which this mercy 
 made upon Sarah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It filled her with joy
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 "<I>God has
 made me to laugh;</I> he has given me both 
 cause to rejoice and a heart to rejoice." 
 Thus the mother of our Lord,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:46,47">Luke i. 46, 47</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) God bestows mercies upon his 
 people to encourage their joy in his work 
 and service; and, whatever is the matter of 
 
 <A NAME="Page132"> </A>

 our joy, God must be acknowledged as the 
 author of it, unless it be the <I>laughter of the 
 fool.</I> 
 
 (2.) When mercies have been long 
 deferred they are the more welcome when 
 they come. 
 
 (3.) It adds to the comfort of 
 any mercy to have our friends rejoice 
 with us in it: <I>All that hear will laugh with me;</I> 
 for laughing is catching. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:58">Luke i. 58</A>.
 Others would rejoice in this instance of God's 
 power and goodness, and be encouraged to 
 trust in him. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:74">Ps. cxix. 74</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It filled her with wonder,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Observe here, 
 
 (1.) What it was she thought so wonderful:
 That <I>Sarah should give children suck,</I> 
 that she should, not only bear a child, but 
 be so strong and hearty at the age as to 
 give it suck. Note, Mothers, if they be 
 able, ought to be nurses to their own children. 
 Sarah was a person of quality, was 
 aged; nursing might be thought prejudicial 
 of herself, or to the child, or to both; she 
 had choice of nurses, no doubt, in her own 
 family: and yet she would do her duty in 
 this matter; and her daughters the good 
 wives are while they thus <I>do well,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:5,6">1 Pet. iii. 5, 6</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:3">Lam. iv. 3</A>.
 
 (2.) How she expressed 
 her wonder: "<I>Who would have said
 it?</I> The thing was so highly improbable, so 
 near to impossible, that if any one but God 
 had said it we could not have believed it." 
 Note, God's favours to his covenant-people 
 are such as surpass both their own and 
 others' thoughts and expectations. Who 
 could imagine that God should do so much 
 for those that deserve so little, nay, for those 
 that deserve so ill? See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20,2Sa+7:18,19">Eph. iii. 20; 2 Sam. vii. 18, 19</A>.
 Who would have said that God 
 should send his Son to die for us, his Spirit 
 to sanctify us, his angels to attend us? Who 
 would have said that such great sins should 
 be pardoned, such mean services accepted, 
 and such worthless worms taken into covenant 
 and communion with the great and 
 holy God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A short account of Isaac's infancy: 
 <I>The child grew,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Special notice is taken 
 of this, though a thing of course, to intimate 
 that the children of the promise are growing 
 children. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:80,Lu+2:40">Luke i. 80; ii. 40</A>.
 Those 
 that are born of God shall increase of God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:19">Col. ii. 19</A>.
 He grew so as not always to need milk, but 
 was able to bear strong meat, and then he 
 was weaned. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:13,14">Heb. v. 13, 14</A>.
 And 
 then it was that Abraham made a great feast 
 for his friends and neighbours, in thankfulness 
 to God for his mercy to him. He made 
 this feast, not on the day that Isaac was 
 born, that would have been too great a disturbance 
 to Sarah; nor on the day that he 
 was circumcised, that would have been too 
 great a diversion from the ordinance; but 
 on the day that he was weaned, because 
 God's blessing upon the nursing of children, 
 and the preservation of them throughout the 
 perils of the infant age, are signal instances 
 of the care and tenderness of the divine providence, 
 which ought to be acknowledged, 
 to its praise. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:9,10,Ho+11:1">Ps. xxii. 9, 10; Hos. xi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar 
 the Egyptian, which she had borne unto 
 Abraham, mocking.
 &nbsp; 10 Wherefore 
 she said unto Abraham, Cast out this 
 bondwoman and her son: for the son 
 of this bondwoman shall not be heir 
 with my son, <I>even</I> with Isaac.
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 the thing was very grievous in Abraham's 
 sight because of his son.
 &nbsp; 12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it 
 not be grievous in thy sight because 
 of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; 
 in all that Sarah hath said 
 unto thee, hearken unto her voice; 
 for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
 &nbsp; 13 And also of the son of the bondwoman 
 will I make a nation, because 
 he <I>is</I> thy seed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The casting out of Ishmael is here considered 
 of, and resolved on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ishmael himself gave the occasion by 
 some affronts he gave to Isaac his little 
 brother, some think on the day that Abraham 
 made the feast for joy that Isaac was 
 safely weaned, which the Jews say was not 
 till he was three years old, others say five.
 Sarah herself was an eye-witness of the 
 abuse: she <I>saw the son of the Egyptian mocking</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 mocking Isaac, no doubt, for it is 
 said, with reference to this 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:29">Gal. iv. 29</A>),
 that 
 <I>he that was born after the flesh persecuted him 
 that was born after the Spirit.</I> Ishmael is 
 here called the <I>son of the Egyptian,</I> because, 
 as some think, the 400 years' affliction of 
 the seed of Abraham by the Egyptians began 
 now, and was to be dated hence,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:13"><I>ch.</I> xv. 13</A>.
 She saw him <I>playing with Isaac,</I> so the
 LXX., and, in play, <I>mocking him.</I> Ishmael 
 was fourteen years older than Isaac; and, 
 when children are together, the elder should 
 be careful and tender of the younger: but it 
 argued a very base and sordid disposition in 
 Ishmael to be abusive to a child that was no 
 way a match for him. Note, 
 
 1. God takes 
 notice of what children say and do in their 
 play, and will reckon with them if they say 
 or do amiss, though their parents do not. 
 
 2. Mocking is a great sin, and very provoking 
 to God. 
 
 3. There is a rooted remaining 
 enmity in the seed of the serpent against the 
 seed of the woman. The children of promise 
 must expect to be mocked. This is 
 persecution, which those that will live godly 
 must count upon. 
 
 4. None are rejected and 
 cast out from God but those who have first 
 deserved it. Ishmael is continued in Abraham's 
 family till he becomes a disturbance, 
 grief, and scandal to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Sarah made the motion: <I>Cast out this 
 bond-woman,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 This seems to be spoken 
 
 <A NAME="Page133"> </A>

 in some heat, yet it is quoted 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:30">Gal. iv. 30</A>)
 as if it had been spoken by a spirit of prophecy; 
 and it is the sentence passed on all 
 hypocrites and carnal people, though they 
 have a place and a name in the visible 
 church. All that are born after the flesh and 
 not born again, that rest in the law and reject 
 the gospel promise, shall certainly be 
 cast out. It is made to point particularly at 
 the rejection of the unbelieving Jews, who, 
 though they were the seed of Abraham, yet, 
 because they submitted not to the gospel 
 covenant, were unchurched and disfranchised: 
 and that which, above any thing, 
 provoked God to cast them off was their 
 mocking and persecuting the gospel church, 
 God's Isaac, in its infancy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.
 Note, There are many who are familiarly 
 conversant with the children of God in this 
 world, and yet shall not partake with them in 
 the inheritance of sons. Ishmael might be 
 Isaac's play-fellow and school-fellow, yet not 
 his fellow-heir.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abraham was averse to it: <I>The thing 
 was very grievous in Abraham's sight,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 1. It grieved him that Ishmael had given 
 such a provocation. Note, Children ought 
 to consider that the more their parents love 
 them the more they are grieved at their misconduct, 
 and particularly at their quarrels 
 among themselves. 
 
 2. It grieved him that 
 Sarah insisted upon such a punishment. 
 "Might it not suffice to correct him? would 
 nothing less serve than to expel him?" 
 Note, Even the needful extremities which 
 must be used with wicked and incorrigible 
 children are very grievous to tender parents, 
 who cannot thus afflict willingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God determined it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 We may well suppose Abraham to be greatly 
 agitated about this matter, loth to displease 
 Sarah, and yet loth to expel Ishmael; in this 
 difficulty God tells him what his will is, 
 and then he is satisfied. Note, A good man 
 desires no more in doubtful cases than to 
 know his duty, and what God would have 
 him do; and, when he is clear in this, he is, 
 or should be, easy. To make Abraham so, 
 God sets this matter before him in a true 
 light, and shows him, 
 
 1. That the casting 
 out of Ishmael was necessary to the establishment 
 of Isaac in the rights and privileges 
 of the covenant: <I>In Isaac shall thy seed be 
 called.</I> Both Christ and the church must 
 descend from Abraham through the loins of 
 Isaac; this is the entail of the promise upon 
 Isaac, and is quoted by the apostle 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:7">Rom. ix. 7</A>)
 to show that not all who come from Abraham's 
 loins were the heirs of Abraham's 
 covenant. Isaac, the promised son, must be 
 the father of the promised seed; therefore, 
 "Away with Ishmael, send him far enough, 
 lest he corrupt the manners or attempt to 
 invade the rights of Isaac." It will be his 
 security to have his rival banished. The 
 covenant seed of Abraham must be a peculiar 
 people, a people by themselves, from the 
 very first, distinguished, not mingled with 
 those that were out of covenant; for this 
 reason Ishmael must be separated. Abraham 
 was <I>called alone,</I> and so must Isaac be. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:2">Isa. li. 2</A>.
 It is probable that Sarah little 
 thought of this
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51">John xi. 51</A>),
 but God took 
 what she said, and turned it into an oracle, 
 as afterwards,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:10"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 10</A>.

 2. That the 
 casting out of Ishmael should not be his 
 ruin,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 He shall be a <I>nation, because he 
 is thy seed.</I> We are not sure that it was his 
 eternal ruin. It is presumption to say that 
 all those who are left out of the external dispensation 
 from all his mercies: those may be 
 saved who are not thus honoured. However, 
 we are sure it was not his temporal ruin. 
 Though he was chased out of the church, he 
 was not <I>chased out of the world. I will make 
 him a nation.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) Nations are of 
 God's making: he founds them, he forms 
 them, he fixes them. 
 
 (2.) Many are full of 
 the blessings of God's providence that are 
 strangers to the blessings of his covenant. 
 
 (3.) The children of this world often fare the 
 better, as to outward things, for their relation 
 to the children of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And Abraham rose up early in 
 the morning, and took bread, and a 
 bottle of water, and gave <I>it</I> unto 
 Hagar, putting <I>it</I> on her shoulder, 
 and the child, and sent her away: and 
 she departed, and wandered in the wilderness 
 of Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 15 And the 
 water was spent in the bottle, and she 
 cast the child under one of the shrubs.
 &nbsp; 16 And she went, and sat her down 
 over against <I>him</I> a good way off, as it 
 were a bowshot: for she said, Let me 
 not see the death of the child. And 
 she sat over against <I>him,</I> and lift up 
 her voice, and wept.
 &nbsp; 17 And God 
 heard the voice of the lad; and the 
 angel of God called to Hagar out of 
 heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
 thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath 
 heard the voice of the lad where he 
 <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold 
 him in thine hand; for I will make 
 him a great nation.
 &nbsp; 19 And God 
 opened her eyes, and she saw a well 
 of water; and she went, and filled the 
 bottle with water, and gave the lad
 drink.
 &nbsp; 20 And God was with the lad; 
 and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, 
 and became an archer.
 &nbsp; 21 And 
 he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: 
 and his mother took him a wife out of 
 the land of Egypt.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The casting out of the 
 
 <A NAME="Page134"> </A>

 bond-woman, and her son from the family of 
 Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 Abraham's obedience to 
 the divine command in this matter was 
 speedy--<I>early in the morning,</I> we may suppose 
 immediately after he had, in the night's 
 visions, received orders to do this. It was 
 also submissive; it was contrary to his judgment, 
 at least to his own inclination, to do it; 
 yet as soon as he perceives that it is the 
 mind of God he makes no objections, but 
 silently does as he is bidden, as one trained 
 up to an implicit obedience. In sending 
 them away without any attendants, on foot, 
 and slenderly provided for, it is probable that 
 he observed the directions given him. If 
 Hagar and Ishmael had conducted themselves 
 well in Abraham's family, they might 
 have continued there; but they threw themselves 
 out by their own pride and insolence, 
 which were thus justly chastised. Note, By 
 abusing our privileges we forfeit them. Those 
 that know not when they are well off, in such 
 a desirable place as Abraham's family, deserve 
 to be cashiered, and to be made to know 
 the worth of mercies by the want of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their wandering in the wilderness, 
 missing their way to the place Abraham designed 
 them for a settlement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were reduced to great distress 
 there. Their provisions were spent, and 
 Ishmael was sick. He that used to be full 
 fed in Abraham's house, where he waxed 
 fat and kicked, now fainted and sunk, when 
 he was brought to short allowance. Hagar 
 is in tears, and sufficiently mortified. Now 
 she wishes for the crumbs she had wasted 
 and made light of at her master's table. Like 
 one under the power of the spirit of bondage, 
 she despairs of relief, counts upon nothing 
 but <I>the death of the child</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),
 though God had told her, before he was born, that 
 he should live to be a man, a great man. 
 We are apt to forget former promises, when 
 present providences seem to contradict them; 
 for we live by sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In this distress, God graciously appeared 
 for their relief: he heard <I>the voice of 
 the lad,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 We read not of a word he 
 said; but his sighs, and groans, and calamitous 
 state, cried aloud in the ears of mercy. 
 An angel was sent to comfort Hagar, and it 
 was not the first time that she had met with 
 God's comforts in a wilderness; she had 
 thankfully acknowledged the former kind 
 visit which God made his in such a case
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 13</A>),
 and therefore God now visited her 
 again with seasonable succours. 
 
 (1.) The 
 angel assures her of the cognizance God 
 took of her distress: <I>God has heard the voice 
 of the lad where he is,</I> though he is in a wilderness 
 (for, wherever we are, there is a way 
 open heaven-ward); therefore <I>lift up the lad, 
 and hold him in thy hand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 Note, God's 
 readiness to help us when we are in trouble 
 must not slacken, but quicken, our endeavours 
 to help ourselves. 
 
 (2.) He repeats the 
 promise concerning her son, that he should 
 be <I>a great nation,</I> as a reason why she should 
 bestir herself to help him. Note, It should 
 engage our care and pains about children 
 and young people to consider that we know 
 not what God has designed them for, nor 
 what great use Providence may make of 
 them. 
 
 (3.) He directs her to a present supply
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 <I>He opened her eyes</I> (which were 
 swollen and almost blinded with weeping), 
 and then <I>she saw a well of water.</I> Note, 
 Many that have reason enough to be comforted 
 go mourning from day to day, because 
 they do not see the reason they have for 
 comfort. There is a well of water by them 
 in the covenant of grace, but they are not 
 aware of it; they have not the benefit of it, 
 till the same God that opened their eyes to 
 see their wound opens them to see their 
 remedy, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:6,7">John xvi. 6, 7</A>.
 Now the apostle 
 tells us that those things concerning Hagar 
 and Ishmael are <B><I>allegoroumena</I></B> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:24">Gal. iv. 24</A>),
 they are to be allegorized; this then will 
 serve to illustrate the folly, 
 
 [1.] Of those 
 who, like the unbelieving Jews, seek for 
 righteousness by the law and the carnal ordinances 
 of it, and not by the promise made in 
 Christ, thereby running themselves into a 
 wilderness of want and despair. Their comforts 
 are soon exhausted, and if God save 
 them not by his special prerogative, and by 
 a miracle of mercy open their eyes and undeceive 
 them, they are undone. 
 
 [2.] Of those 
 who seek for satisfaction and happiness in the 
 world and the things of it. Those that forsake 
 the comforts of the covenant and communion 
 with God, and choose their portion 
 in this earth, take up with a bottle of water, 
 poor and slender provision, and that soon 
 spent; they wander endlessly in pursuit of satisfaction, 
 and, at length, sit down short of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The settlement of Ishmael, at last, in 
 the wilderness of Paran
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),
 a wild 
 place, fittest for a wild man; and such a one 
 he was,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 12</A>.
 Those that are born 
 after the flesh take up with the wilderness of 
 this world, while the children of the promise 
 aim at the heavenly Canaan, and cannot be 
 at rest till they are there. Observe, 
 
 1. He 
 had some tokens of God's presence: <I>God 
 was with the lad;</I> his outward prosperity 
 was owing to this. 
 
 2. By trade he was an 
 archer, which intimates that craft was his 
 excellency and sport his business: rejected 
 Esau was a cunning hunter. 
 
 3. He matched 
 among his mother's relations; she took him 
 a wife out of Egypt: as great an archer as he 
 was, he did not think he could take his aim well, 
 in the business of marriage, if he proceeded 
 without his mother's advice and consent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And it came to pass at that 
 time, that Abimelech and Phichol the 
 chief captain of his host spake unto 
 Abraham, saying, God <I>is</I> with thee in 
 all that thou doest:
 &nbsp; 23 Now therefore 
 swear unto me here by God that 

 <A NAME="Page135"> </A>

 thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor 
 with my son, nor with my son's son:
 <I>but</I> according to the kindness that I 
 have done unto thee, thou shalt do 
 unto me, and to the land wherein thou 
 hast sojourned.
 &nbsp; 24 And Abraham 
 said, I will swear.
 &nbsp; 25 And Abraham 
 reproved Abimelech because of a well 
 of water, which Abimelech's servants 
 had violently taken away.
 &nbsp; 26 And 
 Abimelech said, I wot not who hath 
 done this thing: neither didst thou tell 
 me, neither yet heard I <I>of it,</I> but to
 day.
 &nbsp; 27 And Abraham took sheep 
 and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; 
 and both of them made a 
 covenant.
 &nbsp; 28 And Abraham set seven 
 ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
 &nbsp; 29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, 
 What <I>mean</I> these seven ewe
 lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
 &nbsp; 30 And he said, For <I>these</I> 
 seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my 
 hand, that they may be a witness unto 
 me, that I have digged this well.
 &nbsp; 31 Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; 
 because there they sware both 
 of them.
 &nbsp; 32 Thus they made a covenant 
 at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech 
 rose up, and Phichol the chief captain 
 of his host, and they returned into the 
 land of the Philistines.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the treaty between 
 Abimelech and Abraham, in which 
 appears the accomplishment of that promise
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 2</A>)
 that God would <I>make his name 
 great.</I> His friendship is valued, is courted, 
 though a stranger, though a tenant at will to 
 the Canaanites and Perizzites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The league is proposed by Abimelech, 
 and Phichol his prime-minister of state and 
 general of his army.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The inducement to it was God's favour 
 to Abraham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 "<I>God is with thee in all
 that thou doest,</I> and we cannot but take notice 
 of it." Note, 
 
 (1.) God in his providence 
 sometimes shows his people such tokens for 
 good that their neighbours cannot but take 
 notice of it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:17">Ps. lxxxvi. 17</A>.
 Their affairs do 
 so visibly prosper, and they have such remarkable 
 success in their undertakings, that 
 a confession is extorted from all about them 
 of God's presence with them. 
 
 (2.) It is 
 good being in favour with those that are in 
 favour with God, and having an interest in 
 those that have an interest in heaven,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.
 <I>We will go with you, for we have 
 heard that God is with you.</I> We do well for 
 ourselves if we have fellowship with those 
 that have fellowship with God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The tenour of it was, in general, that 
 there should be a firm and constant friendship 
 between the two families, which should 
 not upon any account be violated. This 
 bond of friendship must be strengthened by 
 the bond of an oath, in which the true God
 was appealed to, both as a witness of their 
 sincerity and an avenger in case either side 
 were treacherous,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 (1.) He 
 desires the entail of this league upon his 
 posterity and the extension of it to his people. 
 He would have his son, and his son's son, 
 and his land likewise, to have the benefit of 
 it. Good men should secure an alliance and 
 communion with the favourites of Heaven, 
 not for themselves only, but for theirs also. 
 
 (2.) He reminds Abraham of the fair treatment 
 he had found among them: <I>According 
 to the kindness I have done unto thee.</I> As those 
 that have received kindness must return it, so 
 those that have shown kindness may expect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is consented to by Abraham, with a 
 particular clause inserted about a well. In 
 Abraham's part of this transaction observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was ready to enter into this league 
 with Abimelech, finding him to be a man of 
 honour and conscience, and that had the fear 
 of God before his eyes: <I>I will swear,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) Religion does not make men morose 
 and unconversable; I am sure it ought 
 not. We must not, under colour of shunning 
 bad company, be sour to all company, and 
 jealous of every body. 
 
 (2.) An honest mind 
 does not startle at giving assurances: if 
 Abraham say that he will be true to Abimelech, 
 he is not afraid to swear it; an oath is 
 for confirmation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prudently settled the matter concerning 
 a well, about which Abimelech's servants 
 had quarrelled with him. Wells of 
 water, it seems, were choice goods in that 
 country: thanks be to God, that they are not 
 so scarce in ours. 
 
 (1.) Abraham mildly told
 Abimelech of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Note, If our brother 
 trespass against us, we must, with the meekness 
 of wisdom, tell him his fault, that the 
 matter may be fairly accommodated and an 
 end made of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:15">Matt. xviii. 15</A>.

 (2.) He 
 acquiesced in Abimelech's justification of 
 himself in this matter: <I>I wot not who has 
 done this thing,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 Many are suspected 
 of injustice and unkindness that are perfectly 
 innocent, and we ought to be glad when they 
 clear themselves. The faults of servants 
 must not be imputed to their masters, unless 
 they know of them and justify them; and no 
 more can be expected from an honest man 
 than that he be ready to do right as soon as 
 he knows that he has done wrong. 
 
 (3.) He 
 took care to have his title to the well cleared 
 and confirmed, to prevent any disputes or 
 quarrels for the future,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 It is justice, 
 as well as wisdom, to do thus, <I>in perptuam 
 rei memoriam--that the circumstance may be 
 perpetually remembered.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He made a very handsome present to Abimelech,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 It was not any thing curious or 
 
 <A NAME="Page136"> </A>

 fine that he presented to him, but that which 
 was valuable and useful--<I>sheep and oxen,</I> in 
 gratitude for Abimelech's kindness to him, and 
 in token of hearty friendship between them. 
 The interchanging of kind offices is the improving 
 of love: that which is mine is my friend's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He ratified the covenant by an oath, and 
 registered it by giving a new name to the 
 place
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 <I>Beer-sheba,</I> the <I>well of the oath,</I> 
 in remembrance of the covenant they swore 
 to, that they might be ever mindful of it; or 
 <I>the well of seven,</I> in remembrance of the seven 
 lambs given to Abimelech, as a consideration 
 for his confirming Abraham's title to that 
 well. Note, Bargains made must be remembered, 
 that we may make them good, and may 
 not break our word through oversight.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge21_33"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ge21_34"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33 And <I>Abraham</I> planted a grove 
 in Beer-sheba, and called there on 
 the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the everlasting 
 God.
 &nbsp; 34 And Abraham sojourned 
 in the Philistines' land many days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 
 
 1. Abraham, having got into a 
 good neighbourhood, knew when he was well 
 off, and continued a great while there. There 
 he planted a grove for a shade to his tent, or 
 perhaps an orchard of fruit-trees; and there, 
 though we cannot say he settled, for God 
 would have him, while he lived, to be a 
 stranger and a pilgrim, yet he sojourned 
 many days, as many as would consist with 
 his character, as Abraham the <I>Hebrew,</I> or 
 <I>passenger.</I> 
 
 2. There he made, not only a 
 constant practice, but an open profession, of 
 his religion: <I>There he called on the name of 
 the Lord, the everlasting God,</I> probably in the 
 grove he planted, which was his oratory or 
 house of prayer. Christ prayed in a garden, 
 on a mountain. 
 
 (1.) Abraham kept up public 
 worship, to which, probably, his neighbours 
 resorted, that they might join with 
 him. Note, Good men should not only retain 
 their goodness wherever they go, but do 
 all they can to propagate it, and make others 
 good. 
 
 (2.) In calling on the Lord, we must 
 eye him as <I>the everlasting God, the God of 
 the world,</I> so some. Though God had made 
 himself known to Abraham as his God in 
 particular, and in covenant with him, yet he 
 forgets not to give glory to him as the Lord 
 of all: <I>The everlasting God,</I> who was, before 
 all worlds, and will be, when time and days 
 shall be no more. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:28">Isa. xl. 28</A>.</P>
