 Moses having, in the foregoing chapter, reminded them of their own sin,
 as a reason why they should not depend upon their own righteousness, in
 this chapter he sets before them God's great mercy to them,
 notwithstanding their provocations, as a reason why they should be more
 obedient for the future. 

 I. He mentions divers tokens of God's favour and reconciliation to 
 them, never to be forgotten. 

 (1.) The renewing of the tables of the covenant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>. 

 (2.) Giving orders for their progress towards Canaan,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>. 

 (3.) Choosing the tribe of Levi for his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 (4.) And continuing the priesthood after the death of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:6">ver. 6</A>.

 (5.) Owning and accepting the intercession of Moses for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.
 
 II. Hence he infers what obligations they lay under to fear,
 and love, and serve God, which he presses upon them with many motives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:12-22">ver. 12</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 At that time the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
 stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
 and make thee an ark of wood.
 &nbsp; 2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
 first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the
 ark.
 &nbsp; 3 And I made an ark <I>of</I> shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
 stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the
 two tables in mine hand.
 &nbsp; 4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
 the ten commandments, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto you in the mount
 out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave them unto me.
 &nbsp; 5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
 tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded me.
 &nbsp; 6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
 the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he
 was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office
 in his stead.
 &nbsp; 7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
 to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
 &nbsp; 8 At that time the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> separated the tribe of Levi, to bear
 the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to stand before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to
 minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
 &nbsp; 9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his
 brethren; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his inheritance, according as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thy God promised him.
 &nbsp; 10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time,
 forty days and forty nights; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hearkened unto me at
 that time also, <I>and</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would not destroy thee.
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Arise, take <I>thy</I> journey before
 the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
 sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There were four things in and by which God showed himself reconciled to 
 Israel and made them truly great and happy, and in which God's goodness 
 took occasion from their badness to make him the more illustrious:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gave them his law, gave it to them in writing, as a standing 
 pledge of his favour. Though the tables that were first written were 
 broken, because Israel had broken the commandments, and God might 
 justly break the covenant, yet when his anger was turned away the 
 tables were renewed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Note, God's putting his law in our reconciliation to God and the best 
 earnest of our happiness in him. Moses is told to hew the tables; for
 the law prepares the heart by conviction and humiliation for the grace 
 of God, but it is only that grace that then writes the law in it. Moses 
 made <I>an ark of shittim-wood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 a plain chest, the same, I suppose, in which the tables were afterwards 
 preserved: but Bezaleel is said to make it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+37:1">Exod. xxxvii. 1</A>),

 because he afterwards finished it up and overlaid it with gold. Or
 Moses is said to make it because, when he went up the second time into 
 the mount, he ordered it to be made by Bezaleel against he came down. 
 And it is observable that for this reason the ark was the first thing 
 that God gave orders about,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:10">Exod. xxv. 10</A>.

 And this left an earnest to the congregation that the tables should not
 miscarry this second time, as they had done the first. God will send 
 his law and gospel to those whose hearts are prepared as arks to 
 receive them. Christ is the ark in which now our salvation is kept
 safely, that it may not be lost as it was in the first Adam, when he 
 had it in his own hand. Observe, 

 1. What it was that God wrote on the two tables, the ten commandments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 or <I>ten words,</I> intimating in how little a compass they were 
 contained: they were not ten volumes, but ten words: it was the same 
 with the first writing, and both the same that he spoke in the mount. 
 The second edition needed no correction nor amendment, nor did what he 
 wrote differ form what he spoke. The written word is as truly the word 
 of God as that which he spoke to his servants the prophets. 

 2. What care was taken of it. These two tables, thus engraven, were
 faithfully laid up in the ark. <I>And there they be,</I> said Moses, 
 pointing it is probable towards the sanctuary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 That good thing which was committed to him he transmitted to them, and 
 left it pure and entire in their hands; now let them look to it at 
 their peril. Thus we may say to the rising generation, "God has 
 entrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, sacraments, &c., as tokens of his 
 presence and favour, and there they be; we lodge them with you," 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:13,14">2 Tim. i. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He led them forward towards Canaan, though they in their hearts 
 turned back towards Egypt, and he might justly have chosen their 
 delusions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 He brought them to a land of <I>rivers of waters,</I> out of a dry and 
 barren wilderness. Sometimes God supplied their wants by the ordinary
 course of nature: when that failed, then by miracles; and yet after 
 this, when they were brought into a little distress, we find them 
 distrusting God and murmuring, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:3,4">Num. xx. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He appointed a standing ministry among them, to deal for them in 
 holy things. At that time when Moses went up a second time to the 
 mount, or soon after, he had orders to separate the tribe of Levi to 
 God, and to his immediate service, they having distinguished themselves 
 by their zeal against the worshippers of the golden calf, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 The Kohathites carried the ark; they and the other Levites stood 
 <I>before the Lord,</I> to minister to him in all the offices of the 
 tabernacle; and the priests, who were of that tribe, were to bless the 
 people. This was a standing ordinance, which had now continued almost 
 forty years, even unto this day; and provision was made for the 
 perpetuating of it by the settled maintenance of that tribe, which was 
 such as gave them great encouragement in their work, and no diversion 
 from it. <I>The Lord is his inheritance.</I> Note, A settled ministry 
 is a great blessing to a people, and a special token of God's favour. 
 And, since the particular priests could not continue by reason of 
 death, God showed his care of the people in securing a succession, 
 which Moses takes notice of here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When <I>Aaron died,</I> the priesthood did not die with him, but 
 <I>Eleazar his son ministered in his stead,</I> and took care of the 
 ark, in which the tables of stone, those precious stones, were 
 deposited, that they should suffer no damage; there they be, and he has 
 the custody of them. Under the law, a succession in the ministry was 
 kept up, by an entail of the office on a certain tribe and family. But 
 now, under the gospel, when the effusion of the Spirit is more 
 plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's 
 operation on men's hearts, qualifying men for, and inclining men to, 
 that work, some in every age, that the name of Israel may not be 
 blotted out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and 
 therefore constituted him their prince and leader 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord hearkened to me and said, Arise, go before the people.</I> 
 It was a mercy to them that they had such a friend, so faithful both to 
 him that appointed him and to those for whom he was appointed. It was 
 fit that he who had saved them from ruin, by his intercession with 
 heaven, should have the conduct and command of them. And herein he was 
 a type of Christ, who, as he ever lives making intercession for us, so 
 he has <I>all power both in heaven and in earth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And now, Israel, what doth the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God require of thee,
 but to fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
 love him, and to serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God with all thy heart and
 with all thy soul,
 &nbsp; 13 To keep the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and his statutes,
 which I command thee this day for thy good?
 &nbsp; 14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 thy God, the earth <I>also,</I> with all that therein <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 15 Only the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
 he chose their seed after them, <I>even</I> you above all people, as
 <I>it is</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
 more stiffnecked.
 &nbsp; 17 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God <I>is</I> God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
 great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons,
 nor taketh reward:
 &nbsp; 18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow,
 and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
 &nbsp; 19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
 land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 20 Thou shalt fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God; him shalt thou serve, and
 to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
 &nbsp; 21 He <I>is</I> thy praise, and he <I>is</I> thy God, that hath done for
 thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
 &nbsp; 22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
 persons; and now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath made thee as the stars of
 heaven for multitude.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a most pathetic exhortation to obedience, inferred from the 
 premises, and urged with very powerful arguments and a great deal of 
 persuasive rhetoric. Moses brings it in like an orator, with an appeal 
 to his auditors <I>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require 
 of thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Ask what he requires; as David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12">Ps. cxvi. 12</A>),

 <I>What shall I render?</I> When we have received mercy from God it 
 becomes us to enquire what returns we shall make to him. Consider what 
 he requires, and you will find it is nothing but what is highly just 
 and reasonable in itself and of unspeakable benefit and advantage to 
 you. Let us see here what he does require, and what abundant reason 
 there is why we should do what he requires.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here most plainly directed in our duty to God, to our 
 neighbour, and to ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here taught our duty to God, both in the dispositions and 
 affections of our souls and in the actions of our lives, our principles 
 and our practices. 
 
 (1.) We must <I>fear the Lord our God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 We must adore his majesty, acknowledge his authority, stand in awe of 
 his power, and dread his wrath. This is gospel duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7">Rev. xiv. 6, 7</A>.

 (2.) We must love him, be well pleased that he is, desire that he may
 be ours, and delight in the contemplation of him and in communion with 
 him. Fear him as a great God, and our Lord, love him as a good God, and 
 our Father and benefactor.

 (3.) We must walk in his ways, that is, the ways which he has appointed
 us to walk in. The whole course of our conversation must be conformable 
 to his holy will.

 (4.) We must <I>serve him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>serve him with all our heart and soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 devote ourselves to his honour, put ourselves under his government, and 
 lay out ourselves to advance all the interests of his kingdom among 
 men. And we must be hearty and zealous in his service, engage and 
 employ our inward man in his work, and what we do for him we must do 
 cheerfully and with a good will. 

 (5.) We must <I>keep his commandments and his statutes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Having given up ourselves to his service, we must make his revealed 
 will our rule in every thing, perform all he prescribes, forbear all 
 the forbids, firmly believing that all the statutes he commands us are 
 for our good. Besides the reward of obedience, which will be our
 unspeakable gain, there are true honour and pleasure in obedience. It 
 is really for our present good to be meek and humble, chaste and sober, 
 just and charitable, patient and contented; these make us easy, and 
 safe, and pleasant, and truly great.

 (6.) We must give honour to God, in swearing by <I>his name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 so give him the honour of his omniscience, his sovereignty, his 
 justice, as well as of his necessary existence. <I>Swear by his
 name,</I> and not by the name of any creature, or false god, whenever 
 an oath for confirmation is called for. 

 (7.) To him we must cleave,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Having chosen him for our God, we must faithfully and constantly abide 
 with him and never forsake him. Cleave to him as one we love and 
 delight in, trust and confide in, and from whom we have great 
 expectations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here taught our duty to our neighbour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Love the stranger;</I> and, if the stranger, much more our brethren, 
 as ourselves. If the Israelites that were such a peculiar people, so 
 particularly distinguished from all people, must be kind to strangers, 
 much more must we, that are not enclosed in such a pale; we must have a 
 tender concern for all that share with us in the human nature, and 
 <I>as we have opportunity;</I> (that is, according to their necessities 
 and our abilities) we must <I>do good to all men.</I> Two arguments are
 here urged to enforce this duty:--

 (1.) God's common providence, which extends itself to all nations of
 men, they being all <I>made of one blood.</I> God <I>loveth the 
 stranger</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, he gives to all life, and breath, and all things, even to 
 those that are Gentiles, and <I>strangers to the commonwealth of 
 Israel</I> and to Israel's God. He knows those perfectly whom we know
 nothing of. He gives <I>food and raiment</I> even to those to whom he 
 has not shown his word and statutes. God's common gifts to mankind 
 oblige us to honour all men. Or the expression denotes the particular 
 care which Providence takes of strangers in distress, which we ought to 
 praise him for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:9">Ps. cxlvi. 9</A>,

 The <I>Lord preserveth the strangers</I>), and to imitate him, to serve
 him, and concur with him therein, being forward to make ourselves 
 instruments in his hand of kindness to strangers.

 (2.) The afflicted condition which the Israelites themselves had been 
 in, when they were strangers in Egypt. Those that have themselves been 
 in distress, and have found mercy with God, should sympathize most 
 feelingly with those that are in the like distress and be ready to show 
 kindness to them. The people of the Jews, notwithstanding these
 repeated commands given them to be kind to strangers, conceived a 
 rooted antipathy to the Gentiles, whom they looked upon with the utmost 
 disdain, which made them envy the grace of God and the gospel of 
 Christ, and this brought a final ruin upon themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are here taught our duty to ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Circumcise the foreskin of your hearts.</I> that is, "Cast away from 
 you all corrupt affections and inclinations, which hinder you from 
 fearing and loving God. <I>Mortify the flesh</I> with the lusts of it. 
 Away with all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, which obstruct 
 the free course of the word of God to your hearts. Rest not in the 
 circumcision of the body, which was only the sign, but be circumcised 
 in heart, which is the thing signified." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>.

 The command of Christ goes further than this, and obliges us not only
 to cut off the foreskin of the heart, which may easily be spared, but 
 to cut off the right hand and to pluck out the right eye that is an 
 offence to us; the more spiritual the dispensation is the more 
 spiritual we are obliged to be, and to go the closer in mortifying sin. 
 And <I>be no more stiff-necked,</I> as they had been hitherto,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:24"><I>ch.</I> ix. 24</A>.

 "Be not any longer obstinate against divine commands and corrections,
 but ready to comply with the will of God in both." The circumcision of 
 the heart makes it ready to yield to God, and draw in his yoke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here most pathetically persuaded to our duty. Let but reason 
 rule us, and religion will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Consider the greatness and glory of God, and therefore fear him, and 
 from that principle serve and obey him. What is it that is thought to 
 make a man great, but great honour, power, and possessions? Think then 
 how great the Lord our God is, and greatly to be feared. 

 (1.) He has great honour, a name above every name. He is <I>God of
 gods,</I> and <I>Lord of lords,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Angels are called <I>gods,</I> so are magistrates, and the Gentiles had 
 <I>gods many, and lords many,</I> the creatures of their own fancy; but 
 God is infinitely above all these nominal deities. What an absurdity 
 would it be for them to worship other gods when the God to whom they 
 had sworn allegiance was the God of gods! 

 (2.) He has great power. He is a <I>mighty God and terrible</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>who regardeth not persons.</I> He has the power of a conqueror, and 
 so he is terrible to those that resist him and rebel against him. He 
 has the power of a judge, and so he is just to all those that appeal to 
 him or appear before him. And it is as much the greatness and honour
 of a judge to be impartial in his justice, without respect to persons 
 or bribes, as it is to a general to be terrible to the enemy. Our God 
 is both. 
 
 (3.) He has great possessions. Heaven and earth are his
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and all the hosts and stars of both. Therefore he is able to bear us 
 out in his service, and to make up the losses we sustain in discharging 
 our duty to him. And yet therefore he has no need of us, nor any thing 
 we have or can do; we are undone without him, but he is happy without 
 us, which makes the condescensions of his grace, in accepting us and 
 our services, truly admirable. Heaven and earth are his possession, and 
 yet <I>the Lord's portion is his people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Consider the goodness and grace of God, and therefore love him, and 
 from that principle serve and obey him. His goodness is his glory as 
 much as his greatness. 

 (1.) He is good to all. Whomsoever he finds miserable, to them he will 
 be found merciful: He <I>executes the judgment of the fatherless and 
 widow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is his honour to help the helpless, and to succour those that most 
 need relief and that men are apt to do injury to, or at least to put a 
 light upon. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:4,5,146:7,9">Ps. lxviii. 4, 5; cxlvi. 7, 9</A>.

 (2.) But <I>truly God is good to Israel</I> in a special obligations to
 him: "<I>He is they praise, and he is thy God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> love him and serve him, because of the relation 
 wherein he stands to thee. He is thy God, a God in covenant with thee, 
 and as such he is thy praise," that is 

 [1.] "He puts honour upon thee; he is the God in whom, all the day
 long, thou mayest boast that thou knowest him, and art known of him. If 
 he is thy God, he is thy glory." 

 [2.] "He expects honour from thee. <I>He is thy praise,</I>" that is
 "he is the God whom thou art bound to praise; if he has not praise from 
 thee, whence may he expect it?" He <I>inhabits the praises of 
 Israel.</I> Consider, <I>First,</I> The gracious choice he made of 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 "He had a delight in thy fathers, and therefore chose their seed." Not 
 that there was any thing in them to merit his favour, or to recommend 
 them to it, but so it seemed good in his eyes. He would be kind to 
 them, though he had no need of them. <I>Secondly,</I> The great things
 he had done for Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He reminds them not only of what they had heard with their ears, and 
 which their fathers had told them of, but of what they had seen with 
 their eyes, and which they must tell their children of, particularly 
 that within a few generations seventy souls (for they were no more when 
 Jacob went down into Egypt) increased to a great nation, <I>as the 
 stars of heaven for multitude.</I> And the more they were in number the 
 more praise and service God expected from them; yet it proved, as in 
 the old world, that when they began to multiply they corrupted 
 themselves.</P>
