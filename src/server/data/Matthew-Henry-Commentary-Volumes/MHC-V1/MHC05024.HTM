 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
 pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found
 some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of
 divorcement, and give <I>it</I> in her hand, and send her out of his
 house.
 &nbsp; 2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
 another man's <I>wife.</I>
 &nbsp; 3 And <I>if</I> the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
 divorcement, and giveth <I>it</I> in her hand, and sendeth her out of
 his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her <I>to be</I>
 his wife;
 &nbsp; 4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
 again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that <I>is</I>
 abomination before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and thou shalt not cause the land to
 sin, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee <I>for</I> an inheritance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is that permission which the Pharisees erroneously referred to as 
 a precept, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:7">Matt. xix. 7</A>,

 <I>Moses commanded to give a writing of divorcement.</I> It was not so;
 our Saviour told them that he only suffered it because of the hardness 
 of their hearts, lest, if they had not had liberty to divorce their 
 wives, they should have ruled them with rigour, and it may be, have 
 been the death of them. It is probable that divorces were in use before 
 (they are taken for granted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:14">Lev.  xxi. 14</A>),

 and Moses thought it needful here to give some rules concerning them.
 
 1. That a man might not divorce his wife unless he <I>found some
 uncleanness in her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was not sufficient to say that he did not like her, or that he liked
 another better, but he must show cause for his dislike; something that 
 made her disagreeable and unpleasant to him, though it might not make 
 her so to another. This uncleanness must mean something less than 
 adultery; for, for that, she was to die; and less than the suspicion of 
 it, for in that case he might give her the waters of jealousy; but it 
 means either a light carriage, or a cross froward disposition, or some 
 loathsome sore or disease; nay, some of the Jewish writers suppose that 
 an offensive breath might be a just ground for divorce.  Whatever is 
 meant by it, doubtless it was something considerable; so that their 
 modern doctors erred who allowed divorce for every cause, though ever 
 so trivial,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:3">Matt. xix. 3</A>.

 2. That it must be done, not by word of mouth, for that might be spoken
 hastily, but by writing, and that put in due form, and solemnly 
 declared, before witnesses, to be his own act and deed, which was a 
 work of time, and left room for consideration, that it might not be 
 done rashly. 

 3. That the husband must give it into the hand of his wife, and send
 her away, which some think obliged him to endow her and make provision 
 for her, according to her quality and such as might help to marry her 
 again; and good reason he should do this, since the cause of quarrel 
 was not her fault, but her infelicity. 

 4. That being divorced it was lawful for her to marry another husband,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The divorce had dissolved the bond of marriage as effectually as death
 could dissolve it; so that she was as free to marry again as if her 
 first husband had been naturally dead. 

 5.  That if her second husband died, or divorced her, then still she
 might marry a third, but her first husband should never take her again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 which he might have done if she had not married another; for by that
 act of her own she had perfectly renounced him for ever, and, as to him 
 was looked upon as defiled, though not as to another person. The Jewish 
 writers say that this was to prevent a most vile and wicked practice 
 which the Egyptians had of changing wives; or perhaps it was intended 
 to prevent men's rashness in putting away their wives; for the wife 
 that was divorced would be apt, in revenge, to marry another 
 immediately, and perhaps the husband that divorced her, how much soever 
 he though to better himself by another choice, would find the next 
 worse, and something in her more disagreeable, so that he would wish 
 for his first wife again. "No" (says this law) "you shall not have her, 
 you should have kept her when you had her." Note, It is best to be 
 content with such things as we have, since changes made by discontent 
 often prove for the worse. The uneasiness we know is commonly better, 
 though we are apt to think it worse, than that which we do not know. By 
 the strictness of this law God illustrates the riches of his grace in 
 his willingness to be reconciled to his people that had gone a whoring 
 from him.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
 neither shall he be charged with any business: <I>but</I> he shall be
 free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath
 taken.
 &nbsp; 6 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to
 pledge: for he taketh <I>a man's</I> life to pledge.
 &nbsp; 7 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the
 children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth
 him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from
 among you.
 &nbsp; 8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
 diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites
 shall teach you: as I commanded them, <I>so</I> ye shall observe to
 do.
 &nbsp; 9 Remember what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
 after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
 into his house to fetch his pledge.
 &nbsp; 11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
 shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.
 &nbsp; 12 And if the man <I>be</I> poor, thou shalt not sleep with his
 pledge:
 &nbsp; 13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
 sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless
 thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God.

 Here is, 

 I. Provision made for the preservation and confirmation of love between 
 new-married people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This fitly follows upon the laws concerning divorce, which would be
 prevented if their affection to each other were well settled at first. 
 If the husband were much abroad from his wife the first year, his love 
 to her would be in danger of cooling, and of being drawn aside to 
 others whom he would meet with abroad; therefore his service to his 
 country in war, embassies, or other public business that would call him 
 from home, shall be dispensed with, <I>that he may cheer up the wife 
 that he has taken.</I> Note,

 1. It is of great consequence that love be kept up between husband and
 wife, and that every thing be very carefully avoided which might make 
 them strange one to another, especially at first; for in that relation, 
 where there is not the love that should be, there is an inlet ready to 
 abundance of guilt and grief. 

 2. One of the duties of that relation is to cheer up one another under
 the cares and crosses that happen, as helpers of each other's joy; for 
 a cheerful heart does good like a medicine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law against man-stealing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was not death by the law of Moses to steal cattle or goods; but to
 steal a child, or a weak and simple man, or one that a man had in his 
 power, and to make merchandize of him, this was a capital crime, and 
 could not be expiated, as other thefts, by restitution--so much is <I>a 
 man better than a sheep,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:12">Matt. xii. 12</A>.

 It was a very heinous offence, for, 

 1. It was robbing the public of one of its members. 

 2. It was taking away a man's liberty, the liberty of a free-born
 Israelite, which was next in value to his life.  

 3. It was driving a man out from the inheritance of the land, to the
 privileges of which he was entitled, and bidding him go serve other 
 gods, as David complains against Saul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A memorandum concerning the leprosy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 1. The laws concerning it must be carefully observed. The laws
 concerning it we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:14">Lev. xiii. 14</A>.

 They are here said to be commanded to the <I>priests and Levites,</I>
 and therefore are not repeated in a discourse to the people; but the 
 people are here charged, in case of leprosy, to apply to the priest 
 according to the law, and to abide by his judgment, so far as it agreed 
 with the law and the plain matter of fact. The plague of leprosy being 
 usually a particular mark of God's displeasure for sin, he in whom the 
 signs of it did appear ought not to conceal it, nor cut out the signs 
 of it, nor apply to the physician for relief; but he must go to the 
 priest, and follow his directions. Thus those that feel their 
 consciences under guilt and wrath must not cover it, nor endeavour to 
 shake off their convictions, but by repentance, and prayer, and humble 
 confession, take the appointed way to peace and pardon.

 2. The particular case of Miriam, who was smitten with leprosy for
 quarrelling with Moses, must not be forgotten. It was an explication of 
 the law concerning the leprosy. Remember that, and,

 (1.) "Take heed of sinning after the similitude of her transgression,
 by despising dominions and speaking evil of dignities, lest you thereby 
 bring upon yourselves the same judgment."

 (2.) "If any of you be smitten with a leprosy, expect not that the law
 should be dispensed with, nor think it hard to be shut out of the camp 
 and so made a spectacle; there is no remedy: Miriam herself, though a 
 prophetess and the sister of Moses, was not exempted, but was forced to 
 submit to this severe discipline when she was under this divine 
 rebuke." Thus David, Hezekiah, Peter, and other great men, when they 
 had sinned, humbled themselves, and took to themselves shame and grief; 
 let us not expect to be reconciled upon easier terms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some necessary orders given about pledges for the security of money 
 lent. They are not forbidden to take such securities as would save the 
 lender from loss, and oblige the borrower to be honest; but, 

 1. They must not take the millstone for a pledge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 for with that they ground the corn that was to be bread for their
 families, or, if it were a public mill, with it the miller got his 
 livelihood; and so it forbids the taking of any thing for a pledge by 
 the want of which a man was in danger of being undone. Consonant to 
 this is the ancient common law of England, which provides that no man 
 be distrained of the utensils or instruments of his trade or 
 profession, as the axe of a carpenter, or the books of a scholar, or 
 beasts belonging to the plough, as long as there are other beasts of 
 which distress may be made (<I>Coke, 1 Inst.  fol.</I> 47). This 
 teaches us to consult the comfort and subsistence of others as much as 
 our own advantage. That creditor who cares not though his debtor and 
 his family starve, nor is at all concerned what become of them, so he 
 may but get his money or secure it, goes contrary, not only to the law 
 of Christ, but even to the law of Moses too. 

 2. They must not go into the borrower's house to fetch the pledge, but
 must stand without, and he must bring it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 <I>The borrower</I> (says Solomon) <I>is servant to the lender;</I>
 therefore lest the lender should abuse the advantage he has against 
 him, and improve it for his own interest, it is provided that he shall 
 take not what he pleases, but what the borrower can best spare. A man's 
 house is his castle, even the poor man's house is so, and is here taken 
 under the protection of the law.  

 3. That a poor man's bed-clothes should never be taken for a pledge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:12,13"><I>v.</I>  12, 13</A>.
 
 This we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:26,27">Exod. xxii. 26, 27</A>.

 If they were taken in the morning, they must be brought back again at
 night, which is in effect to say that they must not be taken at all.  
 "Let the poor debtor sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee," that 
 is, "pray for thee, and praise God for thy kindness to him." Note, Poor 
 debtors ought to be sensible (more sensible than commonly they are) of 
 the goodness of those creditors that do not take all the advantage of 
 the law against them, and to repay their kindnesses by their prayers 
 for them, when they are not in a capacity to repay it in any other way.  
 "Nay, thou shalt not only have the prayers and good wishes of thy poor 
 brother, but <I>it shall be righteousness to thee before the Lord thy 
 God,</I>" that is, "It shall be accepted and rewarded as an act of 
 mercy to thy brother and obedience to thy God, and an evidence of thy 
 sincere conformity to the law. Though it may be looked upon by men as 
 an act of weakness to deliver up the securities thou hast for thy debt, 
 yet it shall be looked upon by thy God as an act of goodness, which 
 shall in no wise lose its reward."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant <I>that is</I> poor and
 needy, <I>whether he be</I> of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
 <I>are</I> in thy land within thy gates:
 &nbsp; 15 At his day thou shalt give <I>him</I> his hire, neither shall the
 sun go down upon it; for he <I>is</I> poor, and setteth his heart upon
 it: lest he cry against thee unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and it be sin unto

 &nbsp; 16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
 neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every
 man shall be put to death for his own sin.
 &nbsp; 17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, <I>nor</I>
 of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:
 &nbsp; 18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt,
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
 thee to do this thing.
 &nbsp; 19 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
 forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it:

 thine hands.
 &nbsp; 20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over
 the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the

 &nbsp; 21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt
 not glean <I>it</I> afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
 fatherless, and for the widow.
 &nbsp; 22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
 of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Masters are commanded to be just to their poor servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 1. They must not oppress them, by overloading them with work, by giving
 them undue and unreasonable rebukes, or by withholding from them proper 
 maintenance. A servant, though a stranger to the commonwealth of 
 Israel, must not be abused: "For <I>thou wast a bondman</I> in the land 
 where thou wast a stranger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and thou knowest what a grievous thing it is to be oppressed by a
 task-master, and therefore, in tenderness to those that are servants 
 and strangers, and in gratitude to that God who set thee at liberty and 
 settled thee in a country of thy own, <I>thou shalt not oppress a 
 servant.</I>" Let not masters be tyrants to their servants, for their 
 Master is in heaven.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13">Job xxxi. 13</A>.

 2. They must be faithful and punctual in paying them their wages:
 "<I>At his day thou shalt give him his hire,</I> not only pay it in 
 time, without further delay. As soon as he had done his day's work, if 
 he desire it, let him have his day's wages," as those labourers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:8">Matt. xx. 8</A>)

 <I>when evening had come.</I> he that works by day-wages is supposed to
 live from hand to mouth, and cannot have to-morrow's bread for his 
 family till be is paid for this day's labour.  If the wages be 
 withheld, 

 (1.) It will be grief to the servant, for, poor man, he <I>sets his
 heart upon it,.</I> or, as the word is, he <I>lifts up his soul to 
 it,</I> he is earnestly desirous of it, as the reward of his work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:2">Job vii. 2</A>),

 and depends upon it as the gift of God's providence for the maintenance
 of his family. A compassionate master, though it should be somewhat 
 inconvenient to himself, would not disappoint the expectation of a poor 
 servant that was so fond to think of receiving his wages. But that is 
 not the worst.

 (2.) It will be guilt to the master. "The injured servant will cry
 against thee to the Lord; since he has no one else to appeal to, he 
 will lodge his appeal in the court of heaven, and it will be sin to 
 thee." Or, if he do not complain, the cause will speak for itself, the 
 "<I>hire of the labourers which is kept back by fraud</I> will itself 
 <I>cry,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.

 It is a greater sin than most people think it is, and will be found so
 in the great day, to put hardships upon poor servants, labourers, and 
 workmen, that we employ. God will do them right if men do not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Magistrates and judges are commanded to be just in their 
 administrations. 

 1. In those which we call <I>pleas of the crown</I> a standing rule is
 here given, that <I>the fathers shall not be put to death for the 
 children, nor the children for the fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If the children make themselves obnoxious to the law, let them suffer
 for it, but let not the parents suffer either for them or with them; it 
 is grief enough to them to see their children suffer: if the parents be 
 guilty, let them die for their own sin; but though God, the sovereign 
 Lord of life, sometimes visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
 children, especially the sin of idolatry, and when he deals with 
 nations in their national capacity, yet he does not allow men to do so.  
 Accordingly, we find Amaziah sparing the children, even when the 
 fathers were put to death for killing the king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:6">2 Kings xiv. 6</A>.

 It was in an extraordinary case, and no doubt by special direction from
 heaven, that Saul's sons were put to death for his offence, and they 
 died rather as sacrifices than as malefactors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:9,14">2 Sam. xxi. 9, 14</A>.

 2. In common pleas between party and party, great care must be taken
 that none whose cause was just should fare the worse for their 
 weakness, nor for their being destitute of friends, as strangers, 
 fatherless, and widows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt not pervert their judgment,</I> nor force them to give
 their very raiment for a pledge, by defrauding them of their right." 
 Judges must be advocates for those that cannot speak for themselves and 
 have no friends to speak for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The rich are commanded to be kind and charitable to the poor. Many 
 ways they are ordered to be so by the law of Moses. The particular 
 instance of charity here prescribed is that they should not be greedy 
 in gathering in their corn, and grapes, and olives, so as to be afraid 
 of leaving any behind them, but be willing to overlook some, and let 
 the poor have the gleanings,

 1. "Say not, 'It is all my own, and why should not I have it?' But
 learn a generous contempt of property in small matters. One sheaf or 
 two forgotten will make thee never the poorer at the year's end, and it 
 will do somebody good, if thou have it not." 

 2. "Say not, '<I>What I give I will give,</I> and know whom I give it
 to, why should I leave it to be gathered by I know not whom, that will 
 never thank me.' But trust God's providence with the disposal of thy 
 charity, perhaps that will direct it to the most necessitous." Or, 
 "Thou mayest reasonably think it will come to the hands of the most 
 industrious, that are forward to seek and gather that which this law 
 provides for them." 

 3. "Say not, 'What should the poor do with grapes and olives? It is
 enough for them to have bread and water;' for, since they have the same 
 senses that the rich have, why should not they have so me little share 
 of the delights of sense?" Boaz ordered handfuls of corn to be left on 
 purpose for Ruth, and God blessed him. All that is left is not 
 lost.</P>
