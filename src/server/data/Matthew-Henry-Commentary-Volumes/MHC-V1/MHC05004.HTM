 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
 the judgments, which I teach you, for to do <I>them,</I> that ye may
 live, and go in and possess the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your
 fathers giveth you.
 &nbsp; 2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
 shall ye diminish <I>ought</I> from it, that ye may keep the
 commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God which I command you.
 &nbsp; 3 Your eyes have seen what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did because of Baal-peor:
 for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath
 destroyed them from among you.
 &nbsp; 4 But ye that did cleave unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God <I>are</I> alive
 every one of you this day.
 &nbsp; 5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
 whither ye go to possess it.
 &nbsp; 6 Keep therefore and do <I>them;</I> for this <I>is</I> your wisdom and
 your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
 all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation <I>is</I> a wise
 and understanding people.
 &nbsp; 7 For what nation <I>is there so</I> great, who <I>hath</I> God <I>so</I> nigh
 unto them, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God <I>is</I> in all <I>things that</I> we call
 upon him <I>for?</I>
 &nbsp; 8 And what nation <I>is there so</I> great, that hath statutes and
 judgments <I>so</I> righteous as all this law, which I set before you
 this day?
 &nbsp; 9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
 thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they
 depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them
 thy sons, and thy sons' sons;
 &nbsp; 10 <I>Specially</I> the day that thou stoodest before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God in Horeb, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Gather me the people
 together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn
 to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and
 <I>that</I> they may teach their children.
 &nbsp; 11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
 mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
 darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
 &nbsp; 12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
 heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only <I>ye
 heard</I> a voice.
 &nbsp; 13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded
 you to perform, <I>even</I> ten commandments; and he wrote them upon
 two tables of stone.
 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
 and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
 over to possess it.
 &nbsp; 15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
 manner of similitude on the day <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto you in
 Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
 &nbsp; 16 Lest ye corrupt <I>yourselves,</I> and make you a graven image,
 the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
 &nbsp; 17 The likeness of any beast that <I>is</I> on the earth, the
 likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
 &nbsp; 18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
 likeness of any fish that <I>is</I> in the waters beneath the earth:
 &nbsp; 19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
 seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, <I>even</I> all the host
 of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them,
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath divided unto all nations under the
 whole heaven.
 &nbsp; 20 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath taken you, and brought you forth out of
 the iron furnace, <I>even</I> out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
 inheritance, as <I>ye are</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 21 Furthermore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was angry with me for your sakes, and
 sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go
 in unto that good land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee <I>for</I>
 an inheritance:
 &nbsp; 22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but
 ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
 &nbsp; 23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
 image, <I>or</I> the likeness of any <I>thing,</I> which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 hath forbidden thee.
 &nbsp; 24 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>is</I> a consuming fire, <I>even</I> a jealous
 God.
 &nbsp; 25 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
 ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
 <I>yourselves,</I> and make a graven image, <I>or</I> the likeness of any
 <I>thing,</I> and shall do evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to
 provoke him to anger:
 &nbsp; 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
 that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye
 go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong <I>your</I> days
 upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
 &nbsp; 27 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall scatter you among the nations, and ye
 shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 shall lead you.
 &nbsp; 28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
 and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
 &nbsp; 29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, thou
 shalt find <I>him,</I> if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
 all thy soul.
 &nbsp; 30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
 upon thee, <I>even</I> in the latter days, if thou turn to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;
 &nbsp; 31 (For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>is</I> a merciful God;) he will not
 forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of
 thy fathers which he sware unto them.
 &nbsp; 32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before
 thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and
 <I>ask</I> from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there
 hath been <I>any such thing</I> as this great thing <I>is,</I> or hath been
 heard like it?
 &nbsp; 33 Did <I>ever</I> people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
 midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
 &nbsp; 34 Or hath God assayed to go <I>and</I> take him a nation from the
 midst of <I>another</I> nation, by temptations, by signs, and by
 wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out
 arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your
 God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
 &nbsp; 35 Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> he <I>is</I> God; <I>there is</I> none else beside him.
 &nbsp; 36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
 instruct thee: and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and
 thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.
 &nbsp; 37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
 seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
 mighty power out of Egypt;
 &nbsp; 38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
 than thou <I>art,</I> to bring thee in, to give thee their land <I>for</I>
 an inheritance, as <I>it is</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 39 Know therefore this day, and consider <I>it</I> in thine heart,
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> he <I>is</I> God in heaven above, and upon the earth
 beneath: <I>there is</I> none else.
 &nbsp; 40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his
 commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well
 with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest
 prolong <I>thy</I> days upon the earth, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth
 thee, for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This most lively and excellent discourse is so entire, and the 
 particulars of it are so often repeated, that we must take it 
 altogether in the exposition of it, and endeavour to digest it into 
 proper heads, for we cannot divide it into paragraphs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, it is the use and application of the foregoing history; 
 it comes in by way of inference from it: <I>Now therefore harken, O 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This use we should make of the review of God's providences concerning 
 us, we should by them be quickened and engaged to duty and obedience. 
 The histories of the years of ancient times should in like manner be 
 improved by us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The scope and drift of his discourse is to persuade them to keep 
 close to God and to his service, and not to forsake him for any other 
 god, nor in any instance to decline from their duty to him. Now observe 
 what he says to them, with a great deal of divine rhetoric, both by way 
 of exhortation and direction, and also by way of motive and argument to 
 enforce his exhortations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here how he charges and commands them, and shows them <I>what is 
 good, and what the Lord requires of them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He demands their diligent attention to the word of God, and to the 
 statutes and judgments that were taught them: <I>Hearken, O Israel.</I> 
 He means, not only that they must now give him the hearing, but that 
 whenever the book of the law was read to them, or read by them, they 
 should be attentive to it. "Hearken to the statutes, as containing the 
 great commands of God and the great concerns of your own souls, and 
 therefore challenging your utmost attention." At Horeb God had <I>made 
 them hear his words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 hear them with a witness; the attention which was then constrained by
 the circumstances of the delivery ought ever after to be engaged by the 
 excellency of the things themselves. What God so <I>spoke once,</I> we 
 should <I>hear twice,</I> hear often.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He charges them to preserve the divine law pure and entire among 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Keep it pure, and do not add to it; keep it entire, and do not diminish 
 from it. Not in practice, so some: "You shall not add by committing the 
 evil which the law forbids, nor diminish by omitting the good which the 
 law requires." Not in opinion, so others: "You shall not add your own 
 inventions, as if the divine institutions were defective, nor 
 introduce, much less impose, any rites of religious worship other than 
 what God has appointed; nor shall you diminish, or set aside, any thing 
 that is appointed, as needless or superfluous." God's work is perfect, 
 nothing can be put to it, nor taken from it, without making it the 
 worse. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 The Jews understand it as prohibiting the alteration of the text or
 letter of the law, even in the least jot or tittle; and to their great 
 care and exactness herein we are very much indebted, under God, for the 
 purity and integrity of the Hebrew code.  We find a fence like this 
 made about the New Testament in the close of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18,19">Rev. xxii. 18, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He charges them to keep God's <I>commandments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 to <I>do them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:5,14"><I>v.</I> 5, 14</A>),

 to <I>keep and do them</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to <I>perform the covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Hearing must be in order to doing, knowledge in order to practice. 
 God's commandments were the way they must keep in, the rule they must 
 keep to; they must govern themselves by the moral precepts, perform 
 their devotion according to the divine ritual, and administer justice 
 according to the judicial law. He concludes his discourse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>)

 with this repeated charge: <I>Thou shalt keep his statutes and his
 commandments which I command thee.</I> What are laws made for but to be 
 observed and obeyed?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He charges them to be very strict and careful in their observance 
 of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>Take you therefore good heed unto yourselves;</I> and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 <I>Take heed to yourselves.</I> Those that would be religious must be
 very cautious, and walk circumspectly. Considering how many temptations 
 we are compassed about with, and what corrupt inclinations we have in 
 our own bosoms, we have great need to look about us and to keep our 
 hearts with all diligence.  Those cannot walk aright that walk 
 carelessly and at all adventures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He charges them particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry, 
 that sin which of all others they would be most tempted to by the 
 customs of the nations, which they were most addicted to by the 
 corruption of their hearts, and which would be most provoking to God 
 and of the most pernicious consequences to themselves: <I>Take good 
 heed,</I> lest in this matter <I>you corrupt yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 
 Two sorts of idolatry he cautions them against:--

 [1.] The worship of images, however by them they might intend to 
 worship the true God, as they had done in the golden calf, so changing 
 the <I>truth of God into a lie</I> and his <I>glory into shame.</I> The 
 second commandment is expressly directed against this, and is here 
 enlarged upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:15-18"><I>v.</I> 15-18</A>.
 
 "Take heed <I>lest you corrupt yourselves,</I>" that is, "lest you 
 debauch yourselves;" for those that think to make images of God form in 
 their minds such notions of him as must needs be an inlet to all 
 impieties; and it is intimated that it is a spiritual adultery. "And 
 take heed lest you destroy yourselves. If any thing ruin you, this will 
 be it. Whatever you do, make no similitude of God, either in a human 
 shape, <I>male of female,</I> or in the shape of any <I>beast or fowl, 
 serpent or fish;</I>" for the heathen worshipped their gods by images 
 of all these kinds, being either not able to form, or not willing to 
 admit, that plain demonstration which we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6">Hos. viii. 6</A>:

 <I>The workman made it, therefore it is not God.</I> To represent an
 infinite Spirit by an image, and the great Creator by the image of a 
 creature, is the greatest affront we can put upon God and the greatest 
 cheat we can put upon ourselves. As an argument against their making 
 images of God, he urges it very much upon them that when God made 
 himself known to them at Horeb he did it by a voice of words which 
 sounded in their ears, to teach them that <I>faith comes by 
 hearing,</I> and God in the word is nigh us; but no image was presented 
 to their eye, for to see God as he is is reserved for our happiness in 
 the other world, and to see him as he is not will do us hurt and no 
 good in this world. You saw <I>no similitude</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>no manner of similitude,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Probably they expected to have seen some similitude, for they were 
 ready to <I>break through unto the Lord to gaze,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:21">Exod. xix. 21</A>.

 But all they saw was <I>light</I> and <I>fire,</I> and nothing that
 they could make an image of, God an infinite wisdom so ordering his 
 manifestation of himself because of the <I>peril of idolatry.</I> It is 
 said indeed of Moses that he <I>beheld the similitude of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:8">Num. xii. 8</A>),

 God allowing him that favour because he was above the temptation of
 idolatry; but for the people who had lately come from admiring the 
 idols of Egypt, they must see no resemblance of God, lest they should 
 have pretended to copy it, and so should have received the second 
 commandment in vain; "for" (says bishop Patrick) "they would have 
 thought that this forbade them only to make any representation of God 
 besides that wherein he showed himself to them, in which they would 
 have concluded it lawful to represent him." Let this be a caution to us 
 to take heed of making images of God in our fancy and imagination when 
 we are worshipping him, lest thereby we corrupt ourselves. There may be 
 idols in the heart, where there are none in the sanctuary. 

 [2.] The worship of the sun, moon, and stars, is another sort of 
 idolatry which they were cautioned against,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This was the most ancient species of idolatry and the most plausible, 
 drawing the adoration to those creatures that not only are in a 
 situation above us, but are most sensibly glorious in themselves and 
 most generally serviceable to the world. And the plausibleness of it 
 made it the more dangerous. It is intimated here, <I>First,</I> How 
 strong the temptation is to sense; for the caution is, <I>Lest thou 
 shouldest be driven to worship them</I> by the strong impulse of a vain 
 imagination and the impetuous torrent of the customs of the nations. 
 The heart is supposed to <I>walk after the eye,</I> which, in our 
 corrupt and degenerate state, it is very apt to do. "<I>When thou seest 
 the sun, moon, and stars,</I> thou wilt so admire their height and 
 brightness, their regular motion and powerful influence, that thou wilt 
 be strongly tempted to give that glory to them which is due to him that 
 made them, and made them what they are to us--gave them their beings, 
 and made them blessings to the world." It seems there was need of a 
 great deal of resolution to arm them against this temptation, so weak 
 was their faith in an invisible God and an invisible world. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Yet he shows how weak the temptation would be to those 
 that would use their reason; for these pretended deities, the <I>sun, 
 moon, and stars,</I> were only blessings which the Lord their God, whom 
 they were obliged to worship, had imparted to all nations. It is absurd 
 to worship them, for they are man's servants, were made and ordained to 
 give light on earth; and shall we serve those that were made to serve 
 us? The sun, in Hebrew is called <I>shemesh,</I> which signifies a 
 <I>servant,</I> for it is the minister-general of this visible world, 
 and holds the candle to all mankind; let it not then be worshipped as a 
 lord. Moreover, they are God's gifts; he has imparted them; whatever 
 benefit we have by them, we owe it to him; it is therefore highly 
 injurious to him to give that honour and praise to them which is due to 
 him only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) He charges them to teach their children to observe the laws of 
 God: <I>Teach them to thy sons, and thy sons' sons</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>that they may teach their children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 [1.] Care must be taken in general to preserve the entail of religion 
 among them, and to transmit the knowledge and worship of God to 
 posterity; for the kingdom of God in Israel was designed to be 
 perpetual, if they did not forfeit the privilege of it. 

 [2.] Parents must, in order hereunto, particularly take care to teach 
 their own children the fear of God, and to train them up in an 
 observance of all his commandments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) He charges them never to forget their duty: <I>Take heed lest you 
 forget the covenant of the Lord your God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Though God is ever mindful of the covenant, we are apt to forget it; 
 and this is at the bottom of all our departures from God.  We have need 
 therefore to watch against all those things which would put the 
 covenant out of our minds, and to watch over our own hearts, lest at 
 any time we let it slip; and so we must take heed lest at any time we 
 forget our religion, lest we lose it or leave it off. Care and caution, 
 and holy watchfulness, are the best helps against a bad memory. These 
 are the directions and commands he gives them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us see now what are the motives or arguments with which he backs 
 these exhortations. How does he order the cause before them, and fill 
 his mouth with arguments! He has a great deal to say on God's behalf. 
 Some of his topics are indeed peculiar to that people, yet applicable 
 to us. But, upon the whole, it is evident that religion has reason on 
 its side, the powerful charms of which all that are irreligious 
 wilfully stop their ears against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He urges the greatness, glory, and goodness, of God. Did we 
 consider what a God he is with whom we have to do, we should surely 
 make conscience of our duty to him and not dare to sin against him. He 
 reminds them here, 

 [1.] That the Lord Jehovah is the <I>one and only living and true 
 God.</I> This they must <I>know and consider,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 There are many things which we know, but are not the better for, 
 because we do not consider them, we do not apply them to ourselves, nor 
 draw proper inferences from them. This is a truth so evident that it 
 cannot but be known, and so influential that, if it were duly 
 considered, it would effectually reform the world, <I>That the Lord 
 Jehovah he is God,</I> an infinite and eternal Being, self-existent and 
 self-sufficient, and the fountain of all being, power, and motion--that 
 he is <I>God in heaven above,</I> clothed with all the glory and Lord 
 of all the hosts of the upper world, and that he is God <I>upon earth 
 beneath,</I> which, though distant from the throne of his glory, is not 
 out of the reach of his sight or power, and though despicable and mean 
 is not below his care and cognizance. And <I>there is none else,</I> no 
 true and living God but himself. All the deities of the heathen were 
 counterfeits and usurpers; nor did any of them so much as pretend to be 
 universal monarchs in heaven and earth, but only local deities. The 
 Israelites, who worshipped no other than the supreme 
 <I>Numen--Divinity,</I> were for ever inexcusable if they either 
 changed their God or neglected him. 

 [2.] That he is a <I>consuming fire, a jealous God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Take heed of offending him, for, <I>First,</I> He has a jealous eye to 
 discern an affront; he must have your entire affection and adoration, 
 and will by no means endure a rival.  God's jealousy over us is a good 
 reason for our godly jealousy over ourselves. <I>Secondly,</I> He has a 
 heavy hand to punish an affront, especially in his worship, for therein 
 he is in a special manner jealous. He is a <I>consuming fire;</I> his 
 wrath against sinners is so; it is dreadful and destroying, it is a 
 <I>fiery indignation</I> which will <I>devour the adversaries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:27">Heb. x. 27</A>.

 Fire consumes that only which is fuel for it, so the wrath of God
 fastens upon those only who, by their own sin, have fitted themselves 
 for destruction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:13,Isa+27:4">1 Cor. iii. 13; Isa. xxvii. 4</A>.

 Even in the New Testament we find the same argument urged upon us as a
 reason why we should serve <I>God with reverence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28,29">Heb. xii. 28, 29</A>),

 because though he is our God, and a rejoicing light to those that serve
 him faithfully, yet he is a consuming fire to those that trifle with 
 him. <I>Thirdly,</I> That yet he is <I>a merciful God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 It comes in here as an encouragement to repentance, but might serve as 
 an inducement to obedience, and a consideration proper to prevent their 
 apostasy. Shall we forsake a merciful God, who will never forsake us, 
 as it follows here, if we be faithful unto him? Whither can we go to 
 better ourselves? Shall we forget the covenant of our God, who will not 
 <I>forget the covenant of our fathers?</I> Let us be held to our duty 
 by the bonds of love, and prevailed with by the mercies of God to 
 cleave to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He urges their relation to this God, his authority over them and 
 their obligations to him. "The commandments you are to keep and do are 
 not mine," says Moses, "not my inventions, not my injunctions, but they 
 are the commandments of the Lord, framed by infinite wisdom, enacted by 
 sovereign power. He is the <I>Lord God of your fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 so that you are his by inheritance: your fathers were his, and you were
 born in his house. He is the <I>Lord your God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 so that you are his by your own consent. He is the <I>Lord my God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 so that I treat with you as his agent and ambassador;" and in his name
 Moses delivered unto them all that, and that only, which he had 
 received from the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He urges the wisdom of being religious: <I>For this is your wisdom 
 in the sight of the nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 In keeping God's commandments,
 
 [1.] They would act wisely for themselves; <I>This is your wisdom.</I> 
 It is not only agreeable to right reason, but highly conducive to our 
 true interest; this is one of the first and most ancient maxims of 
 divine revelation. <I>The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>.

 [2.] They would answer the expectations of their neighbours, who, upon 
 reading or hearing the precepts of the law that was given them, would 
 conclude that certainly the people that were governed by this law were 
 a wise and understanding people. Great things may justly be looked for 
 from those who are guided by divine revelation, and unto whom are 
 committed the oracles of God. They must needs be wiser and better than 
 other people; and so they are if they are ruled by the rules that are 
 given them; and if they are not, though reproach may for their sakes be 
 cast upon the religion they profess, yet it will in the end certainly 
 return upon themselves to their eternal confusion. Those that enjoy the 
 benefit of divine light and laws ought to conduct themselves so as to 
 support their own reputation for wisdom and honour (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:1">Eccl. x. 1</A>),
 
 that God may be glorified thereby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He urges the singular advantages which they enjoyed by virtue of 
 the happy establishment they were under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Our communion with God (which is the highest honour and happiness we 
 are capable of in this world) is kept up by the word and prayer; in 
 both these Israel were happy above any people under heaven. 

 [1.] Never were any people so privileged in speaking to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He was nigh unto them in all that they called upon him for, ready to 
 answer their enquiries and resolve them by his oracle, ready to answer 
 their requests and to grant them by a particular providence. When they 
 had cried unto God for bread, for water, for healing, they had found 
 him near them, to succour and relieve them, a very present help, and in 
 the midst of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1,5">Ps.  xlvi. 1, 5</A>),

 his ear open to their prayers. Observe, <I>First,</I> It is the
 character of God's Israel that on all occasions they call upon him, in 
 every thing they make their requests known to God. They do nothing but 
 what they consult him in, they desire nothing but what they come to him 
 for. <I>Secondly,</I> Those that call upon God shall certainly find him 
 within call, and ready to give an answer of peace to every prayer of 
 faith; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:9">Isa. lviii. 9</A>,

 "<I>Thou shalt cry,</I> as the child for a nurse, <I>and he shall say,
 Here I am,</I> what does my dear child cry for?" <I>Thirdly,</I> This 
 is a privilege which makes the Israel of God truly great and 
 honourable. What can go further than this to magnify a people or a 
 person? Is any name more illustrious than that of Israel, <I>a prince 
 with God? What nation is there so great?</I> Other nations might boast 
 of greater numbers, larger territories, and more ancient 
 incorporations; but none could boast of such an interest in heaven as 
 Israel had. They had their gods, but not so nigh to them as Israel's 
 God was; they could not help them in a time of need, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:27">1 Kings xviii. 27</A>.
 
 [2.] Never were any people so privileged in hearing from God, by the
 statutes and judgments which were set before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This also was the grandeur of Israel above any people. <I>What nation 
 is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous?</I> 
 Observe, <I>First,</I> That all these statutes and judgments of the 
 divine law are infinitely just and righteous, above the statutes and 
 judgments of any of the nations. The law of God is far more excellent 
 that the law of nations. No law so consonant to natural equity and the 
 unprejudiced dictates of right reason, so consistent with itself in all 
 the parts of it, and so conducive to the welfare and interest of 
 mankind, as the scripture-law is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:128">Ps. cxix. 128</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The having of these statutes and judgments set before
 them is the true and transcendent greatness of any nation or people. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19,20">Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20</A>.

 It is an honour to us that we have the Bible in reputation and power
 among us. It is an evidence of a people's being high in the favour of 
 God, and a means of making them high among the nations. Those that 
 magnify the law shall be magnified by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He urges God's glorious appearances to them at Mount Sinai, when 
 he gave them this law. This he insists much upon. Take heed <I>lest 
 thou forget the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in 
 Horeb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Some of them were now alive that could remember it, though they were 
 then under twenty years of age, and the rest of them might be said to 
 stand there in the loins of their fathers, who received the law and 
 entered into covenant there, not for themselves only, but for their 
 children, to whom God had an eye particularly in giving the law, that 
 they might teach it to their children. Two things they must remember, 
 and, one would think, they could never forget them:--

 [1.] What they saw at Mount Sinai,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They saw a strange composition of fire and darkness, both dreadful and 
 very awful; and they must needs be a striking foil to each other; the 
 darkness made the fire in the midst of it look the more dreadful. Fires 
 in the night are the most frightful, and the fire made the darkness 
 that surrounded it look the more awful; for it must needs be a strong 
 darkness which such a fire did not disperse. In allusion to this 
 appearance upon Mount Sinai, God is said to show himself for his 
 people, and against his and their enemies, in fire and darkness 
 together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:8,9">Ps. xviii. 8, 9</A>.
 
 He tells them again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 what they saw, for he would have them never forget it: <I>He showed
 thee his great fire.</I> One flash of lightning, that fire from heaven, 
 strikes an awe upon us; and some have observed that most creatures 
 naturally turn their faces towards the lightning, as ready to receive 
 the impressions of it; but how dreadful then must a constant fire from 
 heaven be! It gave an earnest of the day of judgment, in which <I>the 
 Lord Jesus shall be revealed in flaming fire.</I> As he reminds them of 
 what they saw, so he tells them what they saw not; no manner of 
 similitude, from which they might form either an idea of God in their 
 fancies or an image of God in their high places. By what we see of God 
 sufficient ground is given us to believe him to be a Being of infinite 
 power and perfection, but no occasion given us to suspect him to have a 
 body such as we have. 
 
 [2.] What they heard at Mount Sinai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>The Lord spoke unto you</I> with an intelligible voice, in your own
 language, and you heard it." This he enlarges upon towards the close of 
 his discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:32,33,36"><I>v.</I> 32, 33, 36</A>.

 <I>First, They heard the voice of God, speaking out of heaven.</I> God 
 manifests himself to all the world in the works of creation, without 
 speech or language, and yet their voice is heard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-3">Ps. xix. 1-3</A>);

 but to Israel he made himself known by speech and language,
 condescending to the weakness of the church's infant state. Here was 
 the <I>voice of one crying in the wilderness, to prepare the way of the 
 Lord. Secondly,</I> They heard it <I>out of the midst of the fire,</I> 
 which showed that it was God himself that spoke to them, for who else 
 could dwell with devouring fire? God spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, 
 which was terrible; but to Israel out of the fire, which was more 
 terrible. We have reason to be thankful that he does not thus speak to 
 us, but by men like ourselves, <I>whose terror shall not make us 
 afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:6,7">Job xxxiii. 6, 7</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> They heard it and yet lived,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 It was a wonder of mercy that the fire did not devour them, or that
 they did not die for fear, when Moses himself trembled.  
 <I>Fourthly,</I> Never any people heard the like. He bids them enquire 
 of former days and distant places, and they would find this favour of 
 God to Israel without precedent or parallel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 This singular honour done them called for singular obedience from them. 
 It might justly be expected that they should do more for God than other 
 people, since God had done so much more for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) He urges God's gracious appearances for them, in bringing them out
 of Egypt, from the iron furnace, where they laboured in the fire, 
 forming them into a people, and then taking them to be his own people, 
 a <I>people of inheritance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 this he mentions again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:34,37,28"><I>v.</I> 34, 37, 38</A>.

 Never did God do such a thing for any people; the rise of this nation 
 was quite different from that of all other nations. 

 [1.] They were thus dignified and distinguished, not for any thing in 
 them that was deserving or inviting, but because God had a kindness for 
 their fathers: he chose them. See the reasons of free grace; we are not 
 beloved for our own sakes, but for his sake who is the great trustee of 
 the covenant. 

 [2.] They were delivered out of Egypt by miracles and signs, in mercy 
 to them and in judgment upon the Egyptians, against whom God stretched 
 out his arm, which was signified by Moses's stretching out his hand in 
 summoning the plagues. 

 [3.] They were designed for a happy settlement in Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Nations must be driven out from before them, to make room for them, to 
 show how much dearer they were to God than any other people were. 
 Egyptians and Canaanites must both be sacrificed to Israel's honour and 
 interest.  Those that stand in Israel's light, in Israel's way, shall 
 find it is at their peril.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) He urges God's righteous appearance against them sometimes for 
 their sins. He specifies particularly the matter of Peor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 This had happened very lately: their eyes had seen but the other day 
 the sudden destruction of those that joined themselves to Baal-peor and 
 the preservation of those that clave to the Lord, from which they might 
 easily infer the danger of apostasy from God and the benefit of 
 adherence to him. He also takes notice again of God's displeasure 
 against himself: <I>The Lord was angry with me for your sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He mentions this to try their ingenuousness, whether they would really 
 be troubled for the great prejudice which they had occasioned to their 
 faithful friend and leader. Others' sufferings for our sakes should 
 grieve us more than our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) He urges the certain advantage of obedience. This argument he
 begins with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>That you may live, and go in and possess the land;</I> and this he
 concludes with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>That it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee.</I>
 He reminds them that they were upon their good behaviour, that their 
 prosperity would depend upon their piety. If they kept God's precepts, 
 he would undoubtedly fulfil his promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (9.) He urges the fatal consequences of their apostasy from God, that 
 it would undoubtedly be the ruin of their nation. This he enlarges 
 upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:25-31"><I>v.</I> 25-31</A>.

 Here, 

 [1.] He foresees their revolt from God to idols, that in process of 
 time, when they had remained long in the land and were settled upon 
 their lees, they <I>would corrupt themselves, and make a graven 
 image;</I> this was the sin that would most easily beset them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 [2.] He foretels the judgments of God upon them for this: <I>You shall 
 utterly be destroyed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>scattered among the nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 And their sin should be made their punishment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>There shall you serve gods, the work of men's hands,</I> be
 compelled to serve them, whether you will or no, or, through your own 
 sottishness and stupidity, you will find no better succours to apply 
 yourselves in your captivity." Those that cast off the duties of 
 religion in their prosperity cannot expect the comforts of it when they 
 come to be in distress. Justly are they then sent to the <I>gods whom 
 they have served,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.

 [3.] Yet he encourages them to hope that God would reserve mercy for
 them in the latter days, that he would by his judgments upon them bring 
 them to repentance, and take them again into covenant with himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 Here observe, <I>First,</I> That whatever place we are in we may 
 <I>thence seek the Lord our God,</I> though ever so remote from our own 
 land or from his holy temple. There is no part of this earth that has a 
 gulf fixed between it and heaven. <I>Secondly,</I> Those, and those 
 only, shall find God to their comfort, who seek him with all their 
 heart, that is, who are entirely devoted to him, earnestly desirous of 
 his favour and solicitous to obtain it. <I>Thirdly,</I> Afflictions are 
 sent to engage and quicken us to see God, and, by the grace of God 
 working with them, many are thus reduced to their right mind, "When 
 these things shall come upon thee, it is to be hoped that thou wilt 
 <I>turn to the Lord they God,</I> for thou seest what comes of turning 
 from him;" see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:11,12">Dan. ix. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> God's faithfulness to his covenant encourages us to
 hope that he will not reject us, though we be driven to him by 
 affliction. If we at length remember the covenant, we shall find that 
 he has not forgotten it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now let all these arguments be laid together, and then say whether 
 religion has not reason on its side. None cast off the government of 
 their God but those that have first abandoned the understanding of a 
 man.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward
 the sunrising;
 &nbsp; 42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
 neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
 fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
 &nbsp; 43 <I>Namely,</I> Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of
 the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan
 in Bashan, of the Manassites.
 &nbsp; 44 And this <I>is</I> the law which Moses set before the children of
 Israel:
 &nbsp; 45 These <I>are</I> the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
 judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after
 they came forth out of Egypt,
 &nbsp; 46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in
 the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
 whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come
 forth out of Egypt:
 &nbsp; 47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
 Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which <I>were</I> on this side
 Jordan toward the sunrising;
 &nbsp; 48 From Aroer, which <I>is</I> by the bank of the river Arnon, even
 unto mount Sion, which <I>is</I> Hermon,
 &nbsp; 49 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto
 the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The nomination of the cities of refuge on that side Jordan where
 Israel now lay encamped. Three cities were appointed for that purpose, 
 one in the lot of Reuben, another in that of Gad, and another in that 
 of the half tribe of Manasseh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:41-43"><I>v.</I> 41-43</A>.

 What Moses could do for that people while he was yet with them he did, 
 to give example to the rulers who were settled that they might observe 
 them the better when he was gone. 

 2. The introduction to another sermon that Moses preached to Israel,
 which we have in the following chapters.  Probably it was preached the 
 next sabbath day after, when the congregation attended to receive 
 instruction. He had in general exhorted them to obedience in the former 
 chapter; here he comes to repeat the law which they were to observe, 
 for he demands a universal but not an implicit obedience. How can we do 
 our duty if we do not know it? Here therefore he sets the law before 
 them as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in, 
 sets it before them as the glass in which they were to see their 
 natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they 
 might continue therein. <I>These are the testimonies, the statutes, and 
 the judgments,</I> the moral, ceremonial, and judicial laws, which had 
 been enacted before, when Israel had newly come out of Egypt, and were 
 now repeated, <I>on this side Jordan,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:44-46"><I>v.</I> 44-46</A>.

 The place where Moses gave them these laws in charge is here 
 particularly described.

 (1.) It was over-against Beth-peor, an idol-temple of the Moabites,
