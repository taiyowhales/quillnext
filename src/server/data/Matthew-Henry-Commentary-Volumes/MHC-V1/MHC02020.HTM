 All things being prepared for the solemn promulgation of the divine 
 law, we have, in this chapter,

 I. The ten commandments, as God himself spoke them upon mount Sinai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>),

 as remarkable a portion of scripture as any in the Old Testament.

 II. The impressions made upon the people thereby,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>.

 III. Some particular instructions which God gave privately to Moses, to
 be by him communicated to the people, relating to his worship,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And God spake all these words, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which have brought thee out of the
 land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
 &nbsp; 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
 &nbsp; 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
 likeness <I>of any thing</I> that <I>is</I> in heaven above, or that <I>is</I>
 in the earth beneath, or that <I>is</I> in the water under the earth:
 &nbsp; 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for
 I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>am</I> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
 the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
 <I>generation</I> of them that hate me;
 &nbsp; 6 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
 keep my commandments.
 &nbsp; 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in vain; for
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
 vain.
 &nbsp; 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
 &nbsp; 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:
 &nbsp; 10 But the seventh day <I>is</I> the sabbath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God:
 <I>in it</I> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
 daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
 nor thy stranger that <I>is</I> within thy gates:
 &nbsp; 11 For <I>in</I> six days the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made heaven and earth, the sea,
 and all that in them <I>is,</I> and rested the seventh day: wherefore
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The preface of the law-writer, Moses: <I>God spoke all these 
 words,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The law of the ten commandments is, 

 1. A law of God's making. They are enjoined by the infinite eternal 
 Majesty of heaven and earth. And <I>where the word of the King</I> of 
 kings <I>is surely there is power.</I> 

 2. It is a law of his own speaking. God has many ways of speaking to 
 the children of men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>);

 <I>once, yea twice</I>--by his Spirit, by conscience, by providences, 
 by his voice, all which we ought carefully to attend to; but he never 
 spoke, at any time, upon any occasion, as he spoke the ten 
 commandments, which therefore we ought to hear with the <I>more earnest 
 heed.</I> They were not only spoken audibly (so he owned the Redeemer 
 by a voice from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),

 but with a great deal of dreadful pomp. This law God had given to man
 before (it was written in his heart by nature); but sin had so defaced 
 that writing that it was necessary, in this manner, to revive the 
 knowledge of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preface of the Law-maker: <I>I am the Lord thy God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Herein, 

 1. God asserts his own authority to enact this law in general: "I am 
 the Lord who command thee all that follows." 

 2. He proposes himself as the sole object of that religious worship 
 which is enjoined in the first four of the commandments. They are here 
 bound to obedience by a threefold cord, which, one would think, could 
 not <I>easily be broken.</I>

 (1.) Because God <I>is the Lord</I>--Jehovah, self-existent,
 independent, eternal, and the fountain of all being and power; 
 therefore he has an incontestable right to command us. He that gives 
 being may give law; and therefore he is able to bear us out in our 
 obedience, to reward it, and to punish our disobedience. 

 (2.) He was their God, a God in covenant with them, their God by their
 own consent; and, if they would not keep his commandments, who would? 
 He had laid himself under obligations to them by promise, and therefore 
 might justly lay his obligations on them by precept. Though that 
 covenant of peculiarity is now no more, yet there is another, by virtue 
 of which all that are baptized are taken into relation to him as their 
 God, and are therefore unjust, unfaithful, and very ungrateful, if they 
 obey him not. 

 (3.) He had <I>brought them out of the land of Egypt;</I> therefore
 they were bound in gratitude to obey him, because he had done them so 
 great a kindness, had brought them out of a grievous slavery into a 
 glorious liberty. They themselves had been eye-witnesses of the great 
 things God had done in order to their deliverance, and could not but 
 have observed that every circumstance of it heightened their 
 obligation. They were now enjoying the blessed fruits of their 
 deliverance, and in expectation of a speedy settlement in Canaan; and 
 could they think any thing too much to do for him that had done so much 
 for them? Nay, by redeeming them, he acquired a further right to rule 
 them; they owed their service to him to whom they owed their freedom, 
 and whose they were by purchase. And thus Christ, having rescued us out 
 of the bondage of sin, is entitled to the best service we can do him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74">Luke i. 74</A>.

 Having loosed our bonds, he has bound us to obey him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The law itself. The first four of the ten commandments, which 
 concern our duty to God (commonly called <I>the first table</I>), we 
 have in these verses. It was fit that those should be put first, 
 because man had a Maker to love before he had a neighbour to love; and 
 justice and charity are acceptable acts of obedience to God only when 
 they flow from the principles of piety. It cannot be expected that he 
 should be true to his brother who is false to his God. Now our duty to 
 God is, in one word, to worship him, that is, to give to him the glory 
 due to his name, the inward worship of our affections, the outward 
 worship of solemn address and attendance. This is spoken of as the sum 
 and substance of the everlasting gospel. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>,

 <I>Worship God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The first commandment concerns the object of our worship, Jehovah, 
 and him only 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</I> The Egyptians, and
 other neighbouring nations, had many gods, the creatures of their own 
 fancy, strange gods, <I>new gods;</I> this law was prefixed because of 
 that transgression, and, Jehovah being the God of Israel, they must 
 entirely cleave to him, and not be for any other, either of their own 
 invention or borrowed from their neighbours. This was the sin they were 
 most in danger of now that the world was so overspread with polytheism, 
 which yet could not be rooted out effectually but by the gospel of 
 Christ. The sin against this commandment which <I>we</I> are most in 
 danger of is giving the glory and honour to any creature which are due 
 to God only. Pride makes a god of self, covetousness makes a god of 
 money, sensuality makes a god of the belly; whatever is esteemed or 
 loved, feared or served, delighted in or depended on, more than God, 
 that (whatever it is) we do in effect make a god of. This prohibition 
 includes a precept which is the foundation of the whole law, that we 
 take the Lord for our God, acknowledge that he is God, accept him for 
 ours, adore him with admiration and humble reverence, and set our 
 affections entirely upon him. In the last words, <I>before me,</I> it 
 is intimated, 

 (1.) That we cannot have any other God but he will certainly know it.
 There is none besides him but what is before him. Idolaters covet
 secresy; but <I>shall not God search this out?</I> 

 (2.) That it is very provoking to him; it is a sin that dares him to
 his face, which he cannot, which he will not, overlook, nor connive at. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:20,21">Ps. xliv. 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The second commandment concerns the ordinances of worship, or the 
 way in which God will be worshipped, which it is fit that he himself 
 should have the appointing of. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The prohibition: we are here forbidden to worship even the true
 God by images, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 [1.] The Jews (at least after the captivity) thought themselves 
 forbidden by this commandment to make any image or picture whatsoever. 
 Hence the very images which the Roman armies had in their ensigns are 
 called <I>an abomination</I> to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>),

 especially when they were set up <I>in the holy place.</I> It is
 certain that it forbids making any image of God (for <I>to whom can we 
 liken him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:15,18">Isa. xl. 18, 15</A>),

 or the image of any creature for a religious use. It is called the
 changing of the truth of God into a lie 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:25">Rom. i. 25</A>),

 for an image is a teacher of lies; it insinuates to us that God has a
 body, whereas he is an infinite spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18">Hab. ii. 18</A>.

 It also forbids us to make images of God in our fancies, as if he were
 a man as we are. Our religious worship must be governed by the power of 
 faith, not by the power of imagination. They must not make such images 
 or pictures as the heathen worshipped, lest they also should be tempted 
 to worship them. Those who would be kept from sin must keep themselves
 from the occasions of it. 

 [2.] They must not <I>bow down to them</I> occasionally, that is, show
 any sign of respect or honour to them, much less serve them constantly, 
 by sacrifice or incense, or any other act of religious worship. When 
 they paid their devotion to the true God, they must not have any image 
 before them, for the directing, exciting, or assisting of their 
 devotion. Though the worship was designed to terminate in God, it would 
 not please him if it came to him through an image. The best and most 
 ancient lawgivers among the heathen forbade the setting up of images in 
 their temples. This practice was forbidden in Rome by Numa, a pagan 
 prince; yet commanded in Rome by the pope, a Christian bishop, but, in 
 this, anti-christian. The use of images in the church of Rome, at this 
 day, is so plainly contrary to the letter of this command, and so 
 impossible to be reconciled to it, that in all their catechisms and 
 books of devotion, which they put into the hands of the people, they 
 leave out this commandment, joining the reason of it to the first; and 
 so the third commandment they call the second, the fourth the third, 
 &c.; only, to make up the number ten, they divide the tenth into two.
 Thus have they committed two great evils, in which they persist, and 
 from which they hate to be reformed; they take away from God's word, 
 and add to his worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reasons to enforce this prohibition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 which are, 

 [1.] God's jealousy in the matters of his worship: "<I>I am the 
 Lord</I> Jehovah, and <I>thy God, am a jealous God,</I> especially in 
 things of this nature." This intimates the care he has of his own 
 institutions, his hatred of idolatry and all false worship, his 
 displeasure against idolaters, and that he resents every thing in his 
 worship that looks like, or leads to, idolatry. Jealousy is 
 quicksighted. Idolatry being spiritual adultery, as it is very often 
 represented in scripture, the displeasure of God against it is fitly 
 called <I>jealousy.</I> If God is jealous herein, we should be so, 
 afraid of offering any worship to God otherwise than as he has 
 appointed in his word. 

 [2.] The punishment of idolaters. God looks upon them as haters of him,
 though they perhaps pretend love to him; he will <I>visit their 
 iniquity,</I> that is, he will very severely punish it, not only as a 
 breach of his law, but as an affront to his majesty, a violation of the 
 covenant, and a blow at the root of all religion. He will <I>visit it 
 upon the children,</I> that is, this being a sin for which churches 
 shall be unchurched and a bill of divorce given them, the children 
 shall be cast out of covenant and communion together with the parents, 
 as with the parents the children were at first taken in. Or he will
 bring such judgments upon a people as shall be the total ruin of 
 families. If idolaters live to be old, so as to see their children of 
 the third or fourth generation, it shall be the vexation of their eyes, 
 and the breaking of their hearts, to see them fall by the sword, 
 carried captive, and enslaved. Nor is it an unrighteous thing with God 
 (if the parents died in their iniquity, and the children tread in their 
 steps, and keep up false worships, because they received them by 
 tradition from their fathers), when the measure is full, and God comes 
 by his judgments to reckon with them, to bring into the account the 
 idolatries their fathers were guilty of. Though he bear long with an
 idolatrous people, he will not bear always, but by the fourth 
 generation, at furthest, he will begin to visit. Children are dear to
 their parents; therefore, to deter men from idolatry, and to show how 
 much God is displeased with it, not only a brand of infamy is by it 
 entailed upon families, but the judgments of God may for it be executed 
 upon the poor children when the parents are dead and gone. 

 [3.] The favour God would show to his faithful worshippers: <I>Keeping
 mercy for thousands</I> of persons, thousands of generations <I>of 
 those that love me, and keep my commandments.</I> This intimates that 
 the second commandment, though, in the letter of it, it is only a 
 prohibition of false worships, yet includes a precept of worshipping 
 God in all those ordinances which he has instituted. As the first 
 commandment requires the inward worship of love, desire, joy, hope, and 
 admiration, so the second requires the outward worship of prayer and 
 praise, and solemn attendance on God's word. Note, <I>First,</I> Those 
 that truly love God will make it their constant care and endeavour to 
 keep his commandments, particularly those that relate to his worship. 
 Those that love God, and keep those commandments, shall receive grace 
 to keep his other commandments. Gospel worship will have a good
 influence upon all manner of gospel obedience. <I>Secondly,</I> God has 
 mercy in store for such. Even they need mercy, and cannot plead merit; 
 and mercy they shall find with God, merciful protection in their 
 obedience and a merciful recompence of it. <I>Thirdly,</I> This mercy
 shall extend to thousands, much further than the wrath threatened to 
 those that hate him, for that reaches but to the third or fourth 
 generation. The streams of mercy run now as full, as free, and as 
 fresh, as ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The third commandment concerns the manner of our worship, that it be 
 done with all possible reverence and seriousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A strict prohibition: <I>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord 
 thy God in vain.</I> It is supposed that, having taken Jehovah for 
 their God, they would make mention of his name (for thus <I>all people 
 will walk every one in the name of his god</I>); this command gives a 
 needful caution not to mention it in vain, and it is still as needful 
 as ever. We take God's name in vain, 

 [1.] By hypocrisy, making a profession of God's name, but not living up
 to that profession. Those that name the name of Christ, but do not 
 depart from iniquity, as that name binds them to do, name it in vain; 
 their worship is vain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:7-9">Matt. xv. 7-9</A>),

 their oblations are vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11,13">Isa. i. 11, 13</A>),

 their religion is vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:26">Jam. i. 26</A>.

 [2.] By covenant-breaking; if we make promises to God, binding our
 souls with those bonds to that which is good, and yet perform not to 
 the Lord our vows, we take his name in vain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:33">Matt. v. 33</A>),

 it is folly, and God <I>has no pleasure in fools</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:4">Eccl. v. 4</A>),

 nor will he be <I>mocked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7">Gal. vi. 7</A>.

 [3.] By rash swearing, mentioning the name of God, or any of his
 attributes, in the form of an oath, without any just occasion for it, 
 or due application of mind to it, but as a by-word, to no purpose at 
 all, or to no good purpose. 

 [4.] By false swearing, which, some think, is chiefly intended in the
 letter of the commandment; so it was expounded by those of old time. 
 <I>Thou shalt not forswear thyself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:33">Matt. v. 33</A>.

 One part of the religious regard the Jews were taught to pay to their
 God was to <I>swear by his name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:20">Deut. x. 20</A>.

 But they affronted him, instead of doing him honour, if they called him
 to be witness to a lie. 

 [5.] By using the name of God lightly and carelessly, and without any
 regard to its awful significancy. The profanation of the forms of 
 devotion is forbidden, as well as the profanation of the forms of 
 swearing; as also the profanation of any of those things whereby God 
 makes himself known, his word, or any of his institutions; when they 
 are either turned into charms and spells, or into jest and sport, the 
 name of God is taken in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A severe penalty: <I>The Lord will not hold him guiltless;</I> 
 magistrates, who punish other offences, may not think themselves 
 concerned to take notice of this, because it does not immediately offer 
 injury either to private property or the public peace; but God, who is 
 jealous for his honour, will not thus connive at it. The sinner may 
 perhaps hold himself guiltless, and think there is no harm in it, and 
 that God will never call him to an account for it. To obviate this 
 suggestion, the threatening is thus expressed, God will <I>not hold him 
 guiltless,</I> as he hopes he will; but more is implied, namely, that 
 God will himself be the avenger of those that take his name in vain, 
 and they will find it a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the 
 living God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The fourth commandment concerns the time of worship. God is to be 
 served and honoured daily, but one day in seven is to be particularly 
 dedicated to his honour and spent in his service. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The command itself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy;</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>In it thou shalt do no manner of work.</I> It is taken for granted 
 that the sabbath was instituted before; we read of God's blessing and 
 sanctifying a seventh day from the beginning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:3">Gen. ii. 3</A>),

 so that this was not the enacting of a new law, but the reviving of an
 old law. 

 [1.] They are told what is the day they must religiously observe--<I>a
 seventh, after six days' labour;</I> whether this was the seventh by 
 computation from the first seventh, or from the day of their coming out 
 of Egypt, or both, is not certain: now the precise day was notified to 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:23"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 23</A>),

 and from this they were to observe the seventh. 

 [2.] How it must be observed. <I>First,</I> As a day of rest; they were
 to do no manner of work on this day in their callings or worldly 
 business. <I>Secondly,</I> As a holy day, set apart to the honour of
 the holy God, and to be spent in holy exercises. God, by blessing it, 
 had made it holy; they, by solemnly blessing him, must keep it holy, 
 and not alienate it to any other purpose than that for which the 
 difference between it and other days was instituted. 

 [3.] Who must observe it: <I>Thou, and thy son, and thy daughter;</I>
 the wife is not mentioned, because she is supposed to be one with the 
 husband and present with him, and, if he sanctify the sabbath, it is 
 taken for granted that she will join with him; but the rest of the 
 family are specified. Children and servants must keep the sabbath, 
 according to their age and capacity: in this, as in other instances of 
 religion, it is expected that masters of families should take care, not 
 only to serve the Lord themselves, but that their houses also should 
 serve him, at least that it may not be through their neglect if they do 
 not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15">Josh. xxiv. 15</A>.

 Even the proselyted strangers must observe a difference between this
 day and other days, which, if it laid some restraint upon them then, 
 yet proved a happy indication of God's gracious purpose, in process of 
 time, to bring the Gentiles into the church, that they might share in 
 the benefit of sabbaths. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:6,7">Isa. lvi. 6, 7</A>.

 God takes notice of what we do, particularly what we do on sabbath
 days, though we should be where we are strangers. 

 [4.] A particular memorandum put upon this duty: <I>Remember it.</I> It
 is intimated that the sabbath was instituted and observed before; but 
 in their bondage in Egypt they had lost their computation, or were 
 restrained by their task-masters, or, through a great degeneracy and 
 indifference in religion, they had let fall the observance of it, and 
 therefore it was requisite they should be reminded of it. Note, 
 Neglected duties remain duties still, notwithstanding our neglect. It 
 also intimates that we are both apt to forget it and concerned to 
 remember it. Some think it denotes the preparation we are to make for 
 the sabbath; we must think of it before it comes, that, when it does 
 come, we may keep it holy, and do the duty of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reasons of this command. 

 [1.] We have time enough for ourselves in those six days, on the
 seventh day let us serve God; and time enough to tire ourselves, on the 
 seventh it will be a kindness to us to be obliged to rest. 

 [2.] This is God's day: it is the <I>sabbath of the Lord thy God,</I>
 not only instituted by him, but consecrated to him. It is sacrilege to 
 alienate it; the sanctification of it is a debt. 

 [3.] It is designed for a memorial of the creation of the world, and
 therefore to be observed to the glory of the Creator, as an engagement 
 upon ourselves to serve him and an encouragement to us to trust in him 
 who made heaven and earth. By the sanctification of the sabbath, the
 Jews declared that they worshipped the God that made the world, and so 
 distinguished themselves from all other nations, who worshipped gods 
 which they themselves made.

 [4.] God has given us an example of rest, after six days' work: he
 <I>rested the seventh day,</I> took a complacency in himself, and 
 <I>rejoiced in the work of his hand,</I> to teach us, on that day, to 
 take a complacency in him, and to give him the glory of his works,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:4">Ps. xcii. 4</A>.

 The sabbath began in the finishing of the work of creation, so will the
 everlasting sabbath in the finishing of the work of providence and 
 redemption; and we observe the weekly sabbath in expectation of that, 
 as well as in remembrance of the former, in both conforming ourselves 
 to him we worship. 

 [5.] He has himself <I>blessed the sabbath day and sanctified it.</I>
 He has put an honour upon it by setting it apart for himself; it is the 
 holy of the Lord and honourable: and he has put blessings into it, 
 which he has encouraged us to expect from him in the religious 
 observance of that day. It is <I>the day which the Lord hath made,</I> 
 let not us do what we can to unmake it. He has blessed, honoured, and 
 sanctified it, let not us profane it, dishonour it, and level that with 
 common time which God's blessing has thus dignified and 
 distinguished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the laws of the second table, as they are commonly called, 
 the last six of the ten commandments, comprehending our duty to 
 ourselves and to one another, and constituting a comment upon the 
 second great commandment, <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
 thyself.</I> As religion towards God is an essential branch of 
 universal righteousness, so righteousness towards men is an essential 
 branch of true religion. Godliness and honesty must go together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we owe to our relations; 
 those of children to their parents are alone specified: <I>Honour thy 
 father and thy mother,</I> which includes, 

 1. A decent respect to their persons, an inward esteem of them 
 outwardly expressed upon all occasions in our conduct towards them. 
 <I>Fear them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:3">Lev. xix. 3</A>),
 
 <I>give them reverence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 The contrary to this is mocking at them and despising them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>.

 2. Obedience to their lawful commands; so it is expounded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:1-3">Eph. vi. 1-3</A>):

 "<I>Children, obey your parents,</I> come when they call you, go where 
 they send you, do what they bid you, refrain from what they forbid you; 
 and this, as children, cheerfully, and from a principle of love." 
 Though you have said, "We will not," yet afterwards repent and obey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:29">Matt. xxi. 29</A>.

 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions, and corrections; not only
 to the good and gentle, but also to the froward, out of conscience 
 towards God. 

 4. Disposing of themselves with the advice, direction, and consent, of
 parents, not alienating their property, but with their approbation. 

 5. Endeavouring, in every thing, to be the comfort of their parents,
 and to make their old age easy to them, maintaining them if they stand 
 in need of support, which our Saviour makes to be particularly intended 
 in this commandment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:4-6">Matt. xv. 4-6</A>.

 The reason annexed to this commandment is a promise: <I>That thy days
 may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</I> Having 
 mentioned, in the preface to the commandments, has bringing them out of 
 Egypt as a reason for their obedience, he here, in the beginning of the 
 second table, mentions his bringing them into Canaan, as another 
 reason; that good land they must have upon their thoughts and in their 
 eye, now that they were in the wilderness. They must also remember, 
 when they came to that land, that they were upon their good behaviour, 
 and that, if they did not conduct themselves well, their days should be 
 shortened in that land, both the days of particular persons who should 
 be cut off from it, and the days of their nation which should be 
 removed out of it. But here a long life in that good land is promised 
 particularly to obedient children. Those that do their duty to their 
 parents are most likely to have the comfort of that which their parents 
 gather for them and leave to them; those that support their parents 
 shall find that God, the common Father, will support them. This promise 
 is expounded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:3">Eph. vi. 3</A>),

 <I>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
 earth.</I> Those who, in conscience towards God, keep this and the rest 
 of God's commandments, may be sure that it shall be well with them, and 
 that they shall live as long on earth as Infinite Wisdom sees good for 
 them, and that what they may seem to be cut short of on earth shall be 
 abundantly made up in eternal life, the heavenly Canaan which God will 
 give them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sixth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt not kill;</I> thou shalt not do any thing hurtful or 
 injurious to the health, ease, and life, of thy own body, or any other 
 person's unjustly." This is one of the laws of nature, and was strongly 
 enforced by the precepts given to Noah and his sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:5,6">Gen. ix. 5, 6</A>.

 It does not forbid killing in lawful war, or in our own necessary
 defence, nor the magistrate's putting offenders to death, for those 
 things tend to the preserving of life; but it forbids all malice and 
 hatred to the person of any (for <I>he that hateth his brother is a 
 murderer</I>), and all personal revenge arising therefrom; also all 
 rash anger upon sudden provocations, and hurt said or done, or aimed to 
 be done, in passion: of this our Saviour expounds this commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:22">Matt. v. 22</A>.

 And, as that which is worst of all, it forbids persecution, laying wait
 for the blood of the innocent and excellent ones of the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The seventh commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's 
 chastity: <I>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This is put before the sixth by our Saviour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:19">Mark. x. 19</A>):

 <I>Do not commit adultery, do not kill;</I> for our chastity should be
 as dear to us as our lives, and we should be as much afraid of that 
 which defiles the body as of that which destroys it. This commandment 
 forbids all acts of uncleanness, with all those fleshly lusts which 
 produce those acts and war against the soul, and all those practices 
 which cherish and excite those fleshly lusts, as looking, in order to 
 lust, which, Christ tells us, is forbidden in this commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28">Matt. v. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The eighth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's wealth, 
 estate, and goods: <I>Thou shalt not steal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though God had lately allowed and appointed them to spoil the Egyptians 
 in a way of just reprisal, yet he did not intend that it should be 
 drawn into a precedent and that they should be allowed thus to spoil 
 one another. This command forbids us to rob ourselves of what we have
 by sinful spending, or of the use and comfort of it by sinful sparing, 
 and to rob others by removing the ancient landmarks, invading our 
 neighbour's rights, taking his goods from his person, or house, or 
 field, forcibly or clandestinely, over-reaching in bargains, nor 
 restoring what is borrowed or found, withholding just debts, rents, or 
 wages, and (which is worst of all) to rob the public in the coin or 
 revenue, or that which is dedicated to the service of religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The ninth commandment concerns our own and our neighbour's good 
 name: <I>Thou shalt not bear false witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 This forbids, 

 1. Speaking falsely in any matter, lying, equivocating, and any way 
 devising and designing to deceive our neighbour. 

 2. Speaking unjustly against our neighbour, to the prejudice of his 
 reputation; and (which involves the guilty of both), 

 3. Bearing false witness against him, laying to his charge things that 
 he knows not, either judicially, upon oath (by which the third 
 commandment, and the sixth of eighth, as well as this, are broken), or 
 extrajudicially, in common converse, slandering, backbiting, 
 tale-bearing, aggravating what is done amiss and making it worse than 
 it is, and any way endeavouring to raise our own reputation upon the 
 ruin of our neighbour's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The tenth commandment strikes at the root: <I>Thou shalt not 
 covet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The foregoing commands implicitly forbid all desire of doing that which 
 will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all inordinate desire 
 of having that which will be a gratification to ourselves. "O that such 
 a man's house were mine! Such a man's wife mine! Such a man's estate 
 mine!" This is certainly the language of discontent at our own lot, and 
 envy at our neighbour's; and these are the sins principally forbidden 
 here. St. Paul, when the grace of God caused the scales to fall from 
 his eyes, perceived that this law, <I>Thou shalt not covet,</I> forbade 
 all those irregular appetites and desires which are the first-born of 
 the corrupt nature, the first risings of the sin that dwelleth in us, 
 and the beginnings of all the sin that is committed by us: this is that 
 lust which, he says, he had not known the evil of, if this commandment, 
 when it came to his conscience in the power of it, had not shown it to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:7">Rom. vii. 7</A>.

 God give us all to see our face in the glass of this law, and to lay
 our hearts under the government of it!</P>

 &nbsp; 18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
 and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when
 the people saw <I>it,</I> they removed, and stood afar off.
 &nbsp; 19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
 hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
 &nbsp; 20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
 prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
 sin not.
 &nbsp; 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
 thick darkness where God <I>was.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The extraordinary terror with which the law was given. Never was any 
 thing delivered with such awful pomp; every word was accented, and 
 every sentence paused, with thunder and lightning, much louder and 
 brighter, no doubt, than ordinary. And why was the law given in this 
 dreadful manner, and with all this tremendous ceremony? 

 1. It was designed (once for all) to give a sensible discovery of the 
 glorious majesty of God, for the assistance of our faith concerning it, 
 that, <I>knowing the terror of the Lord,</I> we may be persuaded to 
 live in his fear. 

 2. It was a specimen of the terrors of the general judgment, in which 
 sinners will be called to an account for the breach of this law: the 
 archangel's trumpet will then sound an alarm, to give notice of the 
 Judge's coming, and a <I>fire shall devour before him.</I> 

 3. It was an indication of the terror of those convictions which the 
 law brings into conscience, to prepare the soul for the comforts of the 
 gospel. Thus was the law given by Moses in such a way as might startle, 
 affright, and humble men, that the <I>grace and truth which came by 
 Jesus Christ</I> might be the more welcome. The apostle largely 
 describes this instance of the terror of that dispensation, as a foil 
 to set off our privileges, as Christians, in the light, liberty, and 
 joy, of the New-Testament dispensation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The impression which this made, for the present, upon the people; 
 they must have had stupid hearts indeed, if this had not affected them. 
 
 1. <I>They removed, and stood afar off,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Before God began to speak, they were thrusting forward to gaze 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:21"><I>ch.</I> xix. 21</A>);

 but now they were effectually cured of their presumption, and taught to
 keep their distance.

 2. <I>They entreated that the word should not be so spoken to them any 
 more</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:19">Heb. xii. 19</A>),

 but begged that God would speak to them by Moses,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Hereby they obliged themselves to acquiesce in the mediation of Moses, 
 they themselves nominating him as a fit person to deal between them and 
 God, and promising to hearken to him as to God's messenger; hereby also 
 they teach us to acquiesce in that method which Infinite Wisdom takes, 
 of speaking to us by men like ourselves, whose <I>terror shall not make 
 us afraid, nor their hand be heavy upon us.</I> Once God tried the 
 expedient of speaking to the children of men immediately, but it was 
 found that they could not bear it; it rather drove men from God than 
 brought them to him, and, as it proved in the issue, though it 
 terrified them, it did not deter them from idolatry, for soon after 
 this they worshipped the golden calf. Let us therefore rest satisfied 
 with the instructions given us by the scriptures and the ministry; for, 
 if we believe not them, neither should we be persuaded though God 
 should speak to us in thunder and lightning, as he did from Mount 
 Sinai: here that matter was determined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The encouragement Moses gave them, by explaining the design of God 
 in his terror 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Fear not,</I> that is, "Think not that the thunder and fire are 
 designed to consume you," which was the thing they feared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 <I>lest we die</I>); thunder and lightning constituted one of the 
 plagues of Egypt, but Moses would not have them think they were sent to 
 them on the same errand on which they were sent to the Egyptians: no, 
 they were intended, 

 1. To prove them, to try how they would like dealing with God 
 immediately, without a mediator, and so to convince them how admirably 
 well God had chosen for them, in putting Moses into that office. Ever 
 since Adam fled, upon hearing God's voice in the garden, sinful man 
 could not bear either to speak to God or hear from him immediately. 

 2. To keep them to their duty, and prevent their sinning against God.
 He encourages them, saying, <I>Fear not,</I> and yet tells them that 
 God thus spoke to them, <I>that his fear might be before their 
 face.</I> We must not fear with amazement--with that fear which has 
 torment, which only works upon the fancy for the present, sets us a 
 trembling, genders to bondage, betrays us to Satan, and alienates us 
 from God; but we must always have in our minds a reverence of God's 
 majesty, a dread of his displeasure, and an obedient regard to his 
 sovereign authority over us: this fear will quicken us to our duty and 
 make us circumspect in our walking. Thus <I>stand in awe, and sin 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:4">Ps. iv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The progress of their communion with God by the mediation of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 While the people continued to stand afar off, conscious of guilt and 
 afraid of God's wrath, <I>Moses drew near unto the thick darkness;</I> 
 he <I>was made to draw near,</I> so the word is: Moses, of himself, 
 durst not have ventured into the thick darkness, if God had not called 
 him, and encouraged him, and, as some of the rabbies suppose, sent an 
 angel to take him by the hand, and lead him up. Thus it is said of the 
 great Mediator, <I>I will cause him to draw near</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>),

 and by him it is that we also are introduced,

 build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
 thou hast polluted it.

 nakedness be not discovered thereon.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses having gone into <I>the thick darkness, where God was,</I> God 
 there spoke in his hearing only, privately and without terror, all that 
 follows hence to the end of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:1-32"><I>ch.</I> xxiii</A>,

 which is mostly an exposition of
 the ten commandments; and he was to transmit it by word of mouth first, 
 and afterwards in writing, to the people. The laws in these verses 
 related to God's worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are here forbidden to make images for worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):

 <I>You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven</I> (such was 
 his wonderful condescension, much more than for some mighty prince to 
 talk familiarly with a company of poor beggars); now <I>you shall not 
 make gods of silver.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This repetition of the second commandment comes in here, either 

 (1.) As pointing to that which God had chiefly in view in giving them
 this law in this manner, that is, their peculiar addictedness to 
 idolatry, and the peculiar sinfulness of that crime. Ten commandments 
 God had given them, but Moses is ordered to inculcate upon them 
 especially the first two. They must not forget any of them, but they 
 must be sure to remember those. Or, 

 (2.) As pointing to that which might properly be inferred from God's
 speaking to them as he had done. He had given them sufficient
 demonstration of his presence among them; they needed not to make 
 images of him, as if he were absent. Besides, they had only seen that 
 he talked with them; they had seen no manner of similitude, so that 
 they could not make any image of God; and his manifesting himself to 
 them only by a voice plainly showed them that they must not make any 
 such image, but keep up their communion with God by his word, and not 
 otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two arguments are here hinted against image-worship:--

 (1.) That thereby they would affront God, intimated in that, <I>You
 shall not make with me gods.</I> Though they pretended to worship them 
 but as representations of God, yet really they made them rivals with 
 God, which he would not endure. 

 (2.) That thereby they would abuse themselves, intimated in that,
 "<I>You shall not make unto you gods;</I> while you think by them to 
 assist your devotion, you will really corrupt it, and put a cheat upon 
 yourselves." At first, it should seem, they made their images for 
 worship of gold and silver, pretending, by the richness of those 
 metals, to honour God, and, by the brightness of them, to affect 
 themselves with his glory; but, even in these, they <I>changed the 
 truth of God into a lie,</I> and so, by degrees, were justly given up 
 to such strong delusions as to worship images of wood or stone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are here directed in making altars for worship: it is meant of 
 occasional altars, such as they reared now in the wilderness, before 
 the tabernacle was erected, and afterwards upon special emergencies, 
 for present use, such as Gideon built 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:24">Judg. vi. 24</A>),

 Manoah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19">Judg. xiii. 19</A>),

 Samuel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:17">1 Sam. vii. 17</A>),

 and many others. We may suppose, now that the people of Israel were,
 with this glorious discovery which God had made of himself to them, 
 that many of them would incline, in this pang of devotion, to offer 
 sacrifice to God; and, it being necessary to a sacrifice that there be 
 an alter, they are here appointed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To make their altars very plain, either of <I>earth</I> or of 
 <I>unhewn stone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 That they might not be tempted to think of a graven image, they must 
 not so much as hew into shape the stones that they made their altars 
 of, but pile them up as they were, in the rough. This rule being 
 prescribed before the establishment of the ceremonial law, which 
 appointed altars much more costly, intimates that, after the period of 
 that law, plainness should be accepted as the best ornament of the 
 external services of religion, and that gospel-worship should not be 
 performed with external pomp and gaiety. The beauty of holiness needs
 no paint, nor do those do any service to the spouse of Christ that 
 dress her in the attire of a harlot, as the church of Rome does: an 
 <I>altar of earth</I> does best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To make their altars very low 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 so that they might not go up by steps to them. That the higher the 
 altar was, and the nearer heaven, the more acceptable the sacrifice 
 was, was a foolish fancy of the heathen, who therefore chose high 
 places; in opposition to this, and to show that it is the elevation of 
 the heart, not of the sacrifice, that God looks at, they were here 
 ordered to make their altars low. We may suppose that the altars they 
 reared in the wilderness, and other occasional altars, were designed 
 only for the sacrifice of one beast at a time; but the altar in 
 Solomon's temple, which was to be made much longer and broader, that it 
 might contain many sacrifices at once, was made ten cubits high, that 
 the height might bear a decent proportion to the length and breadth; 
 and to that it was requisite they should go up by steps, which yet, no 
 doubt, were so contrived as to prevent the inconvenience here spoken 
 of, the <I>discovering of their nakedness</I> thereon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are here assured of God's gracious acceptance of their 
 devotions, wherever they were paid according to his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>In all places where I record my name,</I> or where my name is 
 recorded (that is, where I am worshipped in sincerity), <I>I will come 
 unto thee, and I will bless thee.</I> Afterwards, God chose one 
 particular place wherein to record his name: but that being taken away 
 now under the gospel, when men are encouraged to pray every where, this 
 promise revives in its full extent, that, wherever God's people meet in 
 his name to worship him, he will be <I>in the midst of them,</I> he 
 will honour them with his presence, and reward them with the gifts of 
 his grace; there he will come unto them, and will bless them, and more 
 than this we need not desire for the beautifying of our solemn 
 assemblies.</P>
