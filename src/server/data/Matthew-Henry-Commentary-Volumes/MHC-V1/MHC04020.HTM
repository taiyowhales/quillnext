 At this chapter begins the history of the fortieth year (which was the 
 last year) of the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness. And since 
 the beginning of their second year, when they were sentenced to perform 
 their quarantine in the desert, there to wear away the tedious 
 revolution of forty years, there is little recorded concerning them 
 till this last year, which brought them to the borders of Canaan, and 
 the history of this year is almost as large as the history of the first 
 year. This chapter gives an account of, 
 
 I. The death of Miriam,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The fetching of water out of the rock, in which observe, 

 1. The distress Israel was in, for want of water,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. Their discontent and murmuring in that distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 3.  God's pity and power engaged for their supply with water out of the
 rock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 4. The infirmity of Moses and Aaron upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 5. God's displeasure against them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then came the children of Israel, <I>even</I> the whole
 congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the
 people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried
 there.
 &nbsp; 2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they
 gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
 &nbsp; 3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
 that we had died when our brethren died before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>!
 &nbsp; 4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> into
 this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
 &nbsp; 5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
 bring us in unto this evil place? it <I>is</I> no place of seed, or of
 figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither <I>is</I> there any
 water to drink.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
 unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
 fell upon their faces: and the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou,
 and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
 eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
 forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
 congregation and their beasts drink.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses took the rod from before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as he commanded
 him.
 &nbsp; 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together
 before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must
 we fetch you water out of this rock?
 &nbsp; 11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
 rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
 congregation drank, and their beasts <I>also.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
 me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
 therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
 which I have given them.
 &nbsp; 13 This <I>is</I> the water of Meribah; because the children of
 Israel strove with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and he was sanctified in them.

 After thirty-eight years' tedious marches, or rather tedious rests, in 
 the wilderness, backward towards the Red Sea, the armies of Israel now 
 at length set their faces towards Canaan again, and had come not far 
 off from the place where they were when, by the righteous sentence of 
 divine Justice, they were made to begin their wanderings. Hitherto they 
 had been led about as in a maze or labyrinth, while execution was doing 
 upon the rebels that were sentenced; but they were now brought into the 
 right way again: they abode in Kadesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not Kadesh-barnea, which was near the borders of Canaan, but another 
 Kadesh on the confines of Edom, further off from the land of promise, 
 yet in the way to it from the Red Sea, to which they had been hurried 
 back.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here dies Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron, and as it should 
 seem older than either of them. She must have been so if she was that 
 sister that was set to watch Moses when he was put into the ark of 
 bulrushes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:4">Exod. ii. 4</A>.

 <I>Miriam died there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 She was a prophetess, and had been an instrument of much good to 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4">Mic. vi. 4</A>.

 When Moses and Aaron with their rod went before them, to work wonders
 for them, Miriam with her timbrel went before them in praising God for 
 these wondrous works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20">Exod. xv. 20</A>),

 and therein did them real service; yet she had once been a murmurer
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:1"><I>ch.</I> xii. 1</A>),

 and must not enter Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here there is another Meribah. one place we met with before of that 
 name, in the beginning of their march through the wilderness, which was 
 so called <I>because of the chiding of the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7">Exod. xvii. 7</A>.

 And now we have another place, at the latter end of their march, which
 bears the same name for the same reason: <I>This is the water of 
 Meribah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 What was there done was here re-acted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>There was no water for the congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The water out of the rock of Rephidim had followed them while there was 
 need of it; but it is probable that for some time they had been in a 
 country where they were supplied in an ordinary way, and when common 
 providence supplied them it was fit that the miracle should cease. But 
 in this place it fell out that there was no water, or not sufficient 
 for the congregation. Note, We live in a wanting world, and, wherever 
 we are, must expect to meet with some inconvenience or other. It is a 
 great mercy to have plenty of water, a mercy which if we found the want 
 of we should own the worth of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hereupon they murmured, mutinied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>gathered themselves together,</I> and took up arms <I>against Moses 
 and Aaron.</I> They chid with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 spoke the same absurd and brutish language that their fathers had done 
 before them.

 (1.) They wished they had died as malefactors by the hands of divine
 justice, rather than thus seem for a while neglected by the divine 
 mercy: <I>Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the 
 Lord!</I> Instead of giving God thanks, as they ought to have done, for 
 sparing them, they not only despise the mercy of their reprieve, but 
 quarrel with it, as if God had done them a great deal of wrong in 
 giving them their lives for a prey, and snatching them as brands out of 
 the burning. But they need not wish that they had died with their 
 brethren, they are here taking the ready way to die like their brethren 
 in a little while. <I>Woe unto those that desire the day of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18">Amos v. 18</A>.

 (2.) They were angry that they were brought out of Egypt, and led
 through this wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 They quarrelled with Moses for that which they knew was the Lord's 
 doing; they represented that as an injury which was the greatest favour 
 that ever was done to any people.  They prefer slavery before liberty, 
 the house of bondage before the land of promise; and though, the 
 present want was of water only, yet, now that they are disposed to find 
 fault, it shall be looked upon as an insufferable hardship put upon 
 them that they have not vines and figs.  It was an aggravation of their 
 crime,

 [1.] that they had smarted so long for the discontents and distrusts of
 their fathers. <I>They had borne their whoredoms</I> now almost 
 <I>forty years in the wilderness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:33"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 33</A>);

 and yet they ventured in the same steps, and, as is charged upon
 Belshazzar, <I>humbled not their hearts, though they knew all this,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:22">Dan. v. 22</A>.

 [2.] That they had had such long and constant experience of God's
 goodness to them, and of the tenderness and faithfulness of Moses and 
 Aaron. 

 [3.] That Miriam was now lately dead; and, having lost one of their
 leaders, they ought to have been more respectful to those that were 
 left; but, as if they were resolved to provoke God to leave them as 
 sheep without any shepherd, they grow outrageous against them: instead 
 of condoling with Moses and Aaron for the death of their sister, they 
 add affliction to their grief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Moses and Aaron made them no reply, but retired to the door of the 
 tabernacle to know God's mind in this case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 There they <I>fell on their faces,</I> as formerly on the like 
 occasion, to deprecate the wrath of God and to entreat direction from 
 him. Here is no mention of any thing they said; they knew that God 
 heard the murmurings of the people, and before him they humbly 
 prostrate themselves, making intercessions with <I>groanings that 
 cannot be uttered.</I> There they lay waiting for orders <I>Speak, 
 Lord, for thy servants hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God appeared, to determine the matter; not on his tribunal of 
 justice, to sentence the rebels according to their deserts; no, he 
 <I>will not return to destroy Ephraim</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hosea xi. 9</A>),

 will <I>not always chide;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>.

 But he appeared,

 (1.) On his throne of glory, to silence their unjust murmuring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 The <I>glory of the Lord appeared,</I> to <I>still the tumult of the 
 people,</I> by striking an awe upon them. Note, A believing sight of 
 the glory of the Lord would be an effectual check to our lusts and 
 passions, and would keep our mouths as with a bridle.

 (2.) On his throne of grace, to satisfy their just desires. It was
 requisite that they should have water, and therefore, thought the 
 manner of their petitioning for it was irregular and disorderly, yet 
 God did not take that advantage against them to deny it to them, but 
 gave immediate orders for their supply, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Moses must a second time in God's name command water out of a rock for 
 them, to show that God is as able as ever to supply his people with 
 good things, even in their greatest straits an in the utmost failure of 
 second causes. Almighty power can bring water out of a rock, has done 
 it, and can again, for his arm is not shortened. Lest it should be 
 thought that there was some thing peculiar in the former rock itself, 
 some secret spring which nature hid before in it, God here bids him 
 broach another, and does not, as then, direct him which he must apply 
 to, but lets him make use of which he pleased, or the first he came to; 
 all alike to Omnipotence.

 [1.] God bids him take the rod, that famous rod with which he summoned
 the plagues of Egypt, and divided the sea, that, having that in his 
 hand, both he and the people might be reminded of the great things God 
 had formerly done for them, and might be encouraged to trust in him 
 now. This rod, it seems, was kept in the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for it was the <I>rod of God,</I> the <I>rod of his strength,</I> as 
 the gospel is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2">Ps. cx. 2</A>),

 perhaps in allusion to it. 

 [2.] God bids him gather the assembly, not the elders only, but the
 people, to be witnesses of what was done, that by their own eyes they 
 might be convinced and made ashamed of their unbelief. There is no 
 fallacy in God's works of wonder, and therefore they shun not the 
 light, nor the inspection and enquiry of many witnesses. 

 [3.] He bids him speak to the rock, which would do as it was bidden, to
 shame the people who had been so often spoken to, and would not hear 
 nor obey.  Their hearts were harder than this rock, not so tender, not 
 so yielding, not so obedient.  

 [4.] He promises that the rock should give forth water 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and it did so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The water came out abundantly.</I> This is an instance, not only of 
 the power of God, that he could thus fetch <I>honey out of the 
 rock,</I> and <I>oil out of the flinty rock,</I> but of his mercy and 
 grace, that he would do it for such a provoking people. This was a new 
 generation (most of the old stock were by this time worn off), yet they 
 were as bad as those that went before them; murmuring ran in the blood, 
 yet the entail of the divine favour was not cut off, but in this 
 instance of it the divine patience shines as brightly as the divine 
 power. He is God and not man, in sparing and pardoning; nay, he not 
 only here gave them the drink which they drank of in common with their 
 beasts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8, 11</A>),

 but in it he made them to drink spiritual drink, which typified 
 spiritual blessings, <I>for that rock was Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Moses and Aaron acted improperly in the management of this matter, 
 so much so that God in displeasure told them immediately that they 
 should not have the honour of bringing Israel into Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is a strange passage of story, yet very instructive. 

 [1.] It is certain that God was greatly offended, and justly, for he is
 never angry without cause. Though they were his servants, and had 
 obtained mercy to be faithful, though they were his favourites, and 
 such as he had highly honoured, yet for something they thought, or 
 said, or did, upon this occasion, he put them under the disgrace and 
 mortification of dying, as other unbelieving Israelites did, short of 
 Canaan. And no doubt the crime deserved the punishment. 

 [2.] Yet it is uncertain what it was in this management that was so
 provoking to God.  The fault was complicated. <I>First,</I> They did 
 not punctually observe their orders, but in some things varied from 
 their commission; God bade them <I>speak to the rock,</I> and they 
 spoke <I>to the people,</I> and <I>smote the rock,</I> which at this 
 time they were not ordered to do, but they thought speaking would not 
 do. When, in distrust of the power of the word, we have recourse to the 
 secular power in matters of pure conscience, we do, as Moses here, 
 smite the rock to which we should only speak, <I>Secondly,</I> They 
 assumed too much of the glory of this work of wonder to themselves: 
 <I>Must we fetch water?</I> as if it were done by some power or 
 worthiness of theirs. Therefore it is charged upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)
 
 that <I>they did not sanctify God,</I> that is, they did not give him 
 that glory of this miracle which was due unto his name. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 Unbelief was the great transgression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>You believed me not;</I> nay, it is called <I>rebelling against 
 God's commandment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:14"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 14</A>.

 The command was to bring water out of the rock, but they rebelled
 against this command, by distrusting it, and doubting whether it would 
 take effect or no. They speak doubtfully: <I>Must we fetch water?</I> 
 And probably they did in some other ways discover an uncertainty in 
 their own minds whether water would come or no for such a rebellious 
 generation as this was. And perhaps they the rather questioned it, 
 though God had promised it, because the glory of the Lord did not 
 appear before them upon this rock, as it had done upon the rock in 
 Rephidim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:6">Exod. xvii. 6</A>.

 They would not take God's word without a sign.  Dr. Lightfoot's notion
 of their unbelief is that they doubted whether now at last, when the 
 forty years had expired, they should enter Canaan, and whether they 
 must not for the murmurings of the people be condemned to another 
 period of toil, because a new rock was now opened for their supply, 
 which they took for an indication of their longer stay. And, if so, 
 justly were they kept out of Canaan themselves, while the people 
 entered at the time appointed.  <I>Fourthly,</I> They said and did all 
 in heat and passion; this is the account given of the sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:33">Ps. cvi. 33</A>):

 <I>They provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his
 lips.</I> It was in his passion that he called them <I>rebels.</I> It 
 is true they were so; God had called them so; and Moses afterwards, in 
 the way of a just reproof 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:24">Deut. ix. 24</A>), 

 calls them so without offence; but now it came from a provoked spirit,
 and was spoken unadvisedly: it was too much like <I>Raca,</I> and 
 <I>Thou fool.</I> His smiting the rock twice (it should seem, not 
 waiting at all for the eruption of the water upon the first stroke) 
 shows that he was in a heat. The same thing said and done with meekness 
 may be justifiable which when said and done in anger may be highly 
 culpable; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20">Jam. i. 20</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> That which aggravated all the rest, and made it the
 more provoking, was that it was public, <I>before the eyes of the 
 children of Israel,</I> to whom they should have been examples of 
 faith, and hope, and meekness. We find Moses guilty of sinful distrust,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:22,23"><I>ch.</I> xi. 22, 23</A>.

 That was private between God and him, and
 therefore was only checked. But his was public; it dishonoured God 
 before Israel, as if he grudged them his favours, and discouraged the 
 people's hope in God, and therefore this was severely punished, and the 
 more because of the dignity and eminency of those that offended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From the whole we may learn, 

 [1.] That the best of men have their failings, even in those graces
 that they are most eminent for. The man Moses was very meek, and yet 
 here he sinned in passion; wherefore <I>let him that thinks he stands 
 take heed lest he fall.</I> 

 [2.] That God judges not as man judges concerning sins; we might think
 that there was not much amiss in what Moses said and did, yet God saw 
 cause to animadvert severely upon it.  He knows the frame of men's 
 spirits, what temper they are of, and what temper they are in upon 
 particular occasions, and from what thoughts and intents words and 
 actions do proceed; and we are sure that therefore <I>his judgment is 
 according to truth,</I> when it agrees not with ours. 

 [3.] that God not only takes notice of, and is displeased with, the
 sins of his people, but that the nearer any are to him the more 
 offensive are their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 It should seem, the Psalmist refers to this sin of Moses and Aaron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:8">Ps. xcix. 8</A>):

 <I>Thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance
 on their inventions.</I> As many are spared in this life and punished 
 in the other, so many are punished in this life and saved in the other.

 [4.] That, when our heart is hot within us, we are concerned to take
 heed that we offend not with our tongue. Yet, 

 [5.] It is an evidence of the sincerity of Moses, and his impartiality
 in writing, that he himself left this upon record concerning himself, 
 and drew not a veil over his own infirmity, by which it appeared that 
 in what he wrote, as well as what he did, he sought God's glory more 
 than his own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The place is hereupon called <I>Meribah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is called <I>Meribah-Kadesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:51">Deut. xxxii. 51</A>), 

 to distinguish it from the other Meribah. It is the <I>water of
 strife;</I> to perpetuate the remembrance of the people's sin, and 
 Moses's, and yet of God's mercy, who supplied them with water, and 
 owned and honoured Moses notwithstanding. Thus he was sanctified in 
 the, as the <I>Holy One of Israel,</I> so he is called when his mercy 
 rejoices against judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:9">Hos. xi. 9</A>.

 Moses and Aaron did not sanctify God as they ought in the eyes of
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but God was sanctified in them; for he will not be a loser in his 
 honour by any man. If he be not glorified by us, he will be glorified 
 upon us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
 Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that
 hath befallen us:
 &nbsp; 15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
 Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
 &nbsp; 16 And when we cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he heard our voice, and
 sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,
 behold, we <I>are</I> in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy
 border:
 &nbsp; 17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
 pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will
 we drink <I>of</I> the water of the wells: we will go by the king's
 <I>high</I> way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left,
 until we have passed thy borders.
 &nbsp; 18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I
 come out against thee with the sword.
 &nbsp; 19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
 high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will
 pay for it: I will only, without <I>doing</I> any thing <I>else,</I> go
 through on my feet.
 &nbsp; 20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
 against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
 &nbsp; 21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
 wherefore Israel turned away from him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the application made by Israel to the Edomites. The 
 nearest way to Canaan from the place where Israel now lay encamped was 
 through the country of Edom.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Moses sends ambassadors to treat with the king of Edom for leave to 
 pass through his country, and gives them instructions what to say, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:14-17"><I>v.</I> 14-17</A>.

 1. They are to claim kindred with the Edomites: <I>Thus saith thy
 brother Israel.</I> Both nations descended from Abraham and Isaac, 
 their common ancestors; Esau and Jacob, the two fathers of their 
 respective nations, were twin-brothers; and therefore, for 
 relation-sake, they might reasonably expect this kindness from them; 
 nor needed the Edomites to fear that their brother Israel had any ill 
 design upon them, or would take any advantages against them. 

 2. They are to give a short account of the history and present state of
 Israel, which, they take it for granted, the Edomites were no strangers 
 to. And in this there was a double plea:--

 (1.) Israel had been abused by the Egyptians, and therefore ought to be
 pitied and succoured by their relations: "<I>The Egyptians vexed us and 
 our fathers,</I> but we may hope our brethren the Edomites will not be 
 so vexatious."

 (2.) Israel had been wonderfully saved by the Lord, and therefore ought
 to be countenanced and favoured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>We cried unto the Lord, and he sent an angel,</I> the angel of his 
 presence, the angel of the covenant, the eternal Word, who had 
 <I>brought us forth out of Egypt,</I> and led us hither." It was 
 therefore the interest of the Edomites to ingratiate themselves with a 
 people that had so great an interest in heaven and were so much its 
 favourites, and it was at their peril if they offered them any injury. 
 It is our wisdom and duty to be kind to those whom God is pleased to 
 own, and to take his people for our people. <I>Come in, thou blessed of 
 the Lord.</I>

 3. They are humbly to beg a passport through their country. Though God
 himself, in the pillar of cloud and fire, was Israel's guide, in 
 following which they might have justified their passing through any 
 man's ground against all the world, yet God would have this respect 
 paid to the Edomites, to show that no man's property ought to be 
 invaded under colour of religion. Dominion is founded in providence, 
 not in grace.  Thus when Christ was to pass through a village of the 
 Samaritans, to whom his coming was likely to be offensive, he <I>sent 
 messengers before his face</I> to ask leave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:52">Luke ix. 52</A>.

 Those that would receive kindness must not disdain to request it.

 4. They are to give security for the good behaviour of the Israelites
 in this march, that they would keep in the king's high road, that they 
 would commit no trespass upon any man's property, either in ground or 
 water, that they would not so much as make use of a well without paying 
 for it, and that they would make all convenient speed, as fast as they 
 could well go on their feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:17,19"><I>v.</I> 17, 19</A>.

 Nothing could be offered more fair and neighbourly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ambassadors returned with a denial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Edom, that is, the king of Edom, as protector of his country, said, 
 <I>Thou shalt not pass by me;</I> and, when the ambassadors urged it 
 further, he repeated the denial

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 and threatened, if they offered to enter his country, it should be at 
 their peril; he raised his trained bands to oppose them.  <I>Thus Edom 
 refused to give Israel passage.</I> This was owing,

 1. To their jealousy of the Israelites; they feared they should receive
 promises. And truly, had this numerous army been under any other 
 discipline and command than that of the righteous God himself, who 
 would no more suffer them to do wrong than to take wrong, there might 
 have been cause for this jealousy; but what could they fear from a 
 nation that had <I>statutes and judgments so righteous?</I> 

 2. It was owing to the old enmity which Esau bore to Israel. If they
 had no reason to fear damage by them, yet they were not willing to show 
 so much kindness to them. Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing, and 
 now the hatred revived, when the blessing was ready to be inherited.  
 God would hereby discover the ill-nature of the Edomites to their 
 shame, and try the good-nature of the Israelites to their honour: they 
 <I>turned away from him,</I> and did not take this occasion to quarrel 
 with him. Note, We must not think it strange if the most reasonable 
 requests be denied by unreasonable men, and if those be affronted by 
 men whom God favours. <I>I as a deaf man heard not.</I> After this 
 indignity which the Edomites offered to Israel God gave them a 
 particular caution <I>not to abhor an Edomite</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:7">Deut. xxiii. 7</A>),

 though the Edomites had shown such an abhorrence of them, to teach us
 in such cases not to meditate revenge.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And the children of Israel, <I>even</I> the whole congregation,
 journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
 coast of the land of Edom, saying,
 &nbsp; 24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
 enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
 Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
 Meribah.
 &nbsp; 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
 Hor:
 &nbsp; 26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
 his son: and Aaron shall be gathered <I>unto his people,</I> and shall
 die there.
 &nbsp; 27 And Moses did as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded: and they went up into
 mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
 &nbsp; 28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
 Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
 and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
 &nbsp; 29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
 mourned for Aaron thirty days, <I>even</I> all the house of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The chapter began with the funeral of Miriam, and it ends with the 
 funeral of her brother Aaron. When death comes into a family, it often 
 strikes double. Israel had not improved the former affliction they were 
 under, by the death of the prophetess, and therefore, soon after, God 
 took away their priest, to try if they would lay that to heart. This 
 happened at the very next stage, when they removed to Mount Hor, 
 fetching a compass round the Edomites' country, leaving it on their 
 left hand. Wherever we go, death attends us, and the graves are ready 
 for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God bids Aaron die, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 God takes Moses and Aaron aside, and tells them, <I>Aaron shall be 
 gathered to his people.</I> These two dear brothers are told that they 
 must part. Aaron the elder must die first, but Moses is not likely to 
 be long after him; so that it is but for a while, a little while, that 
 they are parted.

 1. There is something of displeasure in these orders. Aaron must not
 enter Canaan, because he had failed in his duty at the waters of 
 strife. The mention of this, no doubt, went to the heart of Moses, who 
 knew himself, perhaps, at that time, to be the guiltier of the two. 

 2.  There is much of mercy in them. Aaron, though he dies for his
 transgression, is not put to death as a malefactor, by a plague, or 
 fire from heaven, but dies with ease and in honour. He is not <I>cut 
 off from his people,</I> as the expression usually is concerning those 
 that die by the hand of divine justice, but he is <I>gathered to his 
 people,</I> as one that died in the arms of divine grace. 

 3. There is much of type and significancy in them. Aaron must not enter
 Canaan, to show that the Levitical priesthood could make nothing 
 perfect: that must be done by the bringing in of a better hope. Those 
 priests could not continue by reason of sin and death, but the 
 priesthood of Christ, being undefiled, is unchangeable, and to this, 
 which abides for ever, Aaron must resign all his honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:23-25">Heb. vii. 23-25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Aaron submits, and dies in the method and manner appointed, and, 
 for aught that appears, with as much cheerfulness as if he had been 
 going to bed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He puts on his holy garments to take his leave of them, and goes up 
 with his brother and son to the top of Mount Hor, and probably some of 
 the elders of Israel with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They went up <I>in the sight of all the congregation,</I> who, it is 
 likely, were told on what errand they went up; by this solemn 
 procession Aaron lets Israel know that he is neither afraid nor ashamed 
 to die, but, when the bridegroom comes, can trim his lamp and go forth 
 to meet him. His going up the hill to die signified that the death of 
 saints (and Aaron is called <I>the saint of the Lord</I>) is their 
 ascension; they rather go up than go down to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses, whose hands had first clothed Aaron with his priestly 
 garments, now strips him of them; for, in reverence to the priesthood, 
 it was not fit that he should die in them. Note, Death will strip us; 
 naked we came into the world, and naked we must go out. We shall see 
 little reason to be proud of our clothes, our ornaments, or marks of 
 honour, if we consider how soon death will strip us of our glory, 
 divest us of all our offices and honours, and take the crown off from 
 our head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Moses immediately puts the priestly garments upon Eleazar his son, 
 clothes him with his father's robe, and <I>strengthens him with his 
 girdle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:21">Isa. xxii. 21</A>.

 Now,

 (1.) This was a great comfort to Moses, by whose hand the law of the
 priesthood was given to see that it should be kept up in a succession, 
 and that a lamp was ordained for the anointed, which should not be 
 extinguished by death itself. This was a happy earnest and indication 
 to the church of the care God would take that as one generation of 
 ministers and Christians (spiritual priests) passes away another 
 generation should come up instead of it.

 (2.) It was a great satisfaction to Aaron to see his son, who was dear
 to him, thus preferred, and his office, which was dearer, thus 
 preserved and secured, and especially to see in this a figure of 
 Christ's everlasting priesthood, in which alone his would be 
 perpetuated. <I>Now,</I> Lord, might Aaron say, <I>let thy servant 
 depart in peace, for my eyes have seen thy salvation.</I>

 (3.) It was a great kindness to the people. The installing of Eleazar
 before Aaron was dead would prevent those who bore ill-will to Aaron's 
 family from attempting to set up another upon his death, in competition 
 with his son. What could they do when the matter was already settled? 
 It would likewise encourage those among them that feared God, and be a 
 token for good to them, that he would not leave them, nor suffer his 
 faithfulness to fail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>Aaron died there.</I> Quickly after he was stripped of his 
 priestly garments, he laid himself down and died contentedly; for a 
 good man would desire, if it were the will of God, not to outlive his 
 usefulness. Why should we covet to continue any longer in this world 
 than while we may do God and our generation some service in it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Moses and Eleazar, with those that attended them, buried Aaron where 
 he died, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:6">Deut. x. 6</A>,

 and then <I>came down from the mount.</I> And now, when they came down,
 and had left Aaron behind, it might be proper for them to think that he 
 had rather gone up to the better world and had left them behind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. All the congregation <I>mourned for Aaron thirty days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 Though the loss was well made up in Eleazar, who, being in the prime of 
 life, was fitter from public service that Aaron would have been if he 
 had lived, yet it was a debt owing to their deceased high priest to 
 mourn for him. While he lived, they were murmuring at him upon all
 occasions, but now that he was dead they mourned for him. Thus many are 
 taught to lament the loss of those mercies which they would not learn 
 to be thankful for the enjoyment of. Many good men have had more honour 
 done to their memories than ever they had to their persons, witness 
 those that were persecuted while they lived, but when they were dead 
 had their sepulchres garnished.</P>
