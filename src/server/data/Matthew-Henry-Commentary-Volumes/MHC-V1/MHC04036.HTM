 We have in this chapter the determination of another question that 
 arose upon the case of the daughters of Zelophehad. God had appointed 
 that they should inherit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:7"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 7</A>.

 Now here, 

 I. An inconvenience is suggested, in case they should marry into any
 other tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II.  It is prevented by a divine appointment that they should marry in
 their own tribe and family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>),

 and this is settled for a rule in like cases 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>);

 and they did marry accordingly to some of their own relations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>),

 and with this the book concludes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:13">ver. 13</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
 Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families
 of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and
 before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 2 And they said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded my lord to give the land
 for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
 was commanded by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to give the inheritance of Zelophehad
 our brother unto his daughters.
 &nbsp; 3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the <I>other</I>
 tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
 taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
 the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
 shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then
 shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
 whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken
 away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the humble address which the heads of the tribe of 
 Manasseh made to Moses and the princes, on occasion of the order lately 
 made concerning the daughters of Zelophehad. The family they belonged 
 to was part of that half of the tribe of Manasseh which we yet to have 
 their lot within Jordan, not that half that was already settled; and 
 yet they speak of the land of their possession, and the inheritance of 
 their fathers, with as great assurance as if they had it already in 
 their hands, knowing whom they had trusted. In their appeal observe, 

 1.  They fairly recite the former order made in this case, and do not 
 move to have that set aside, but are very willing to acquiesce in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord commanded to give the inheritance of Zelophehad to his 
 daughters;</I> and they are very well pleased that it should be so, 
 none of them knowing but that hereafter it might be the case of their 
 own families, and then their daughters would have the benefit of this 
 law. 

 2. They represent the inconvenience which might, possibly, follow 
 hereupon, if the daughters of Zelophehad should see cause to marry into 
 any other tribes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And it is probable that this was not a bare surmise, or supposition,
 but that they knew, at this time, great court was made to them by some 
 young gentlemen of other tribes, because they were heiresses, that they 
 might get footing in this tribe, and so enlarge their own inheritance. 
 This truly is often aimed at more than it should be in making 
 marriages, not the meetness of the person, but the convenience of the 
 estate, to <I>lay house to house, and field to field. Wisdom indeed is 
 good with an inheritance;</I> but what is an inheritance good for in 
 that relation without wisdom? But here, we may presume, the personal 
 merit of these daughters recommended them as well as their fortunes; 
 however, the heads of their tribe foresaw the mischief that would 
 follow, and brought the case to Moses, that he might consult the oracle 
 of God concerning it. The difficulty they start God could have obviated 
 and provided against in the former order given in this case; but to 
 teach us that we must, in our affairs, not only attend God's 
 providence, but make use of our own prudence, God did not direct in it 
 till the themselves that were concerned wisely foresaw the 
 inconvenience, and piously applied to Moses for a rule in it. For 
 though they were chief fathers in their families, and might have 
 assumed a power to overrule these daughters of Zelophehad in disposing 
 of themselves, especially their father being dead and the common 
 interest of their tribe being concerned in it, yet they chose rather to 
 refer the matter to Moses, and it issued well. We should not covet to 
 be judges in our own case, for it is difficult to be so without being 
 partial. It is easier in many cases to take good advice than to give 
 it, and it is a satisfaction to be under direction. Two things they 
 aimed at in their representation:--

 (1.) To preserve the divine appointment of inheritances. They urged the
 command 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that the land should be given by lot to the respective tribes, and 
 urged that it would break in upon the divine appointment if such a 
 considerable part of the lot of Manasseh should, by their marriage, be 
 transferred to any other tribe; for the issue would be denominated from 
 the father's tribe, not the mother's. This indeed would not lessen the 
 lot of the particular persons of that tribe (they would have their own 
 still), but it would lessen the lot of the tribe in general, and render 
 it less strong and considerable; they therefore thought themselves 
 concerned for the reputation of their tribe, and perhaps were the more 
 jealous for it because it was already very much weakened by the sitting 
 down of the one half of it on this side Jordan.

 (2.) To prevent contests and quarrels among posterity. If those of 
 other tribes should come among them perhaps it might occasion some 
 contests. They would be apt to give and receive disturbance, and their 
 title might, in process of time, come to be questioned; and how great a 
 matter would this fire kindle!  It is the wisdom and duty of those that 
 have estates in the world to settle them, and dispose of them, so as 
 that no strife and contention may arise about them among posterity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
 word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
 said well.
 &nbsp; 6 This <I>is</I> the thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth command concerning
 the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
 think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall
 they marry.
 &nbsp; 7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
 from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
 shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
 fathers.
 &nbsp; 8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
 tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
 family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
 may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
 &nbsp; 9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from <I>one</I> tribe to
 another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of
 Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
 &nbsp; 10 Even as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
 Zelophehad:
 &nbsp; 11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
 daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
 brothers' sons:
 &nbsp; 12 <I>And</I> they were married into the families of the sons of
 Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the
 tribe of the family of their father.
 &nbsp; 13 These <I>are</I> the commandments and the judgments, which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel
 in the plains of Moab by Jordan <I>near</I> Jericho.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The matter settled by express order from God between the daughters 
 of Zelophehad and the rest of the tribe of Manasseh. The petition is 
 assented to, and care taken to prevent the inconvenience feared: <I>The 
 tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Thus those that consult the oracles of God concerning the making of
 their heavenly inheritance sure shall not only be directed what to do, 
 but their enquiries shall be graciously accepted, and they shall have 
 not only their <I>well done,</I> but their <I>well said,</I> good and 
 faithful servant. Now the matter is thus accommodated: these heiresses 
 must be obliged to marry, not only within their own tribe of Manasseh, 
 but within the particular family of the Hepherites, to which they did 
 belong. 

 1. They are not determined to any particular persons; there was choice 
 enough in the family of their father: <I>Let them marry to whom they 
 think best.</I> As children must preserve the authority of their 
 parents, and not marry against their minds, so parents must consult the 
 affections of their children in disposing of them, and not compel them 
 to marry such as they cannot love. Forced marriages are not likely to 
 prove blessings. 

 2. Yet they are confined to their own relations, that their inheritance 
 may not go to another family. God would have them know that the land 
 being to be divided by lot, the disposal whereof was of the Lord, they 
 could not mend, and therefore should not alter, his appointment. The 
 inheritances must not <I>remove from tribe to tribe</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 lest there should be confusion among them, their estates entangled, and
 their genealogies perplexed. God would not have one tribe to be 
 enriched by the straitening and impoverishing of another, since they 
 were all alike the seed of Abraham his friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The law, in this particular case, was made perpetual, and to be 
 observed whenever hereafter the like case should happen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Those that were not heiresses might marry into what tribe they pleased
 (though we may suppose that, ordinarily, they kept within their own 
 tribe), but those that were must either quit their claim to the 
 inheritance or marry one of their own family, that each of the tribes 
 might keep to its own inheritance, and one tribe might not encroach 
 upon another, but throughout their generations there might remain 
 immovable the ancient landmarks, set, not by their fathers, but by the 
 <I>God of their fathers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The submission of the daughters of Zelophehad to this appointment. 
 How could they but marry well, and to their satisfaction, when God 
 himself directed them? They married their father's brothers' sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.
 
 By this it appears, 

 1. That the marriage of cousin-germans is not in itself unlawful, nor
 within the degrees prohibited, for then God would not have countenanced 
 these marriages. But, 

 2. That ordinarily it is not advisable; for, if there had not been a
 particular reason for it (which cannot hold in any case now, 
 inheritances being not disposed of as then by the special designation 
 of Heaven), they would not have married such near relations. The world 
 is wide, and he that walks uprightly will endeavour to walk surely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The conclusion of this whole book, referring to the latter part of 
 it: <I>These are the judgments which the Lord commanded in the plains 
 of Moab</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 these foregoing, ever since

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:1-3"><I>ch.</I> xxvi.</A>,

 most of which related to their settlement in Canaan, into which they
 were now entering. Whatever new condition God is by his providence 
 bringing us into, we must beg of him to teach us the duty of it, and to 
 enable us to do it, that we may do the work of the day in its day, of 
 the place in its place.</P>
