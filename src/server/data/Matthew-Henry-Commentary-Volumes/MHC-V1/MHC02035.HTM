 What should have been said and done upon Moses' coming down the first
 time from the mount, if the golden calf had not broken the measures and
 put all into disorder, now at last, when with great difficulty
 reconciliation was made, begins to be said and done; and that great
 affair of the setting up of God's worship is put into its former
 channel again, and goes on now without interruption. 

 I. Moses gives Israel those instructions, received from God, which
 required immediate observance.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
 Israel together, and said unto them, These <I>are</I> the words which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded, that <I>ye</I> should do them.
 &nbsp; 2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
 shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.
 &nbsp; 3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
 sabbath day.
 &nbsp; 4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
 Israel, saying, This <I>is</I> the thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: whosoever
 <I>is</I> of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; gold, and silver, and brass,
 &nbsp; 6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
 <I>hair,</I>
 &nbsp; 7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
 wood,
 &nbsp; 8 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
 the sweet incense,
 &nbsp; 9 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
 the breastplate.
 &nbsp; 10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded;
 &nbsp; 11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
 his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,
 &nbsp; 12 The ark, and the staves thereof, <I>with</I> the mercy seat, and
 the vail of the covering,
 &nbsp; 13 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
 showbread,
 &nbsp; 14 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and
 his lamps, with the oil for the light,
 &nbsp; 15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing
 oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
 entering in of the tabernacle,
 &nbsp; 16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brazen grate, his
 staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
 &nbsp; 17 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets,
 and the hanging for the door of the court,
 &nbsp; 18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
 their cords,
 &nbsp; 19 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy <I>place,</I>
 the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
 sons, to minister in the priest's office.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was said in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:32"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 32</A>),

 <I>Moses gave them in commandment all that the Lord has spoken with
 him.</I> But, the erecting and furnishing of the tabernacle being the 
 work to which they were now immediately to apply themselves, there is 
 particular mention of the orders given concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. All the congregation is summoned to attend 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 that is, the heads and rulers of the congregation, the representatives 
 of the several tribes, who must receive instructions from Moses as he 
 had received them from the Lord, and must communicate them to the 
 people.  Thus John, being commanded to write to the seven churches what 
 had been revealed to him, writes it to the angels, or ministers, of the 
 churches.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses gave them in charge all that (and that only) which God had 
 commanded him; thus he approved himself faithful both to God and 
 Israel, between whom he was a messenger or mediator. If he had added, 
 altered, or diminished, he would have been false to both. But, both 
 sides having reposed a trust in him, he was true to the trust; yet he 
 was faithful as a servant only, but <I>Christ as a Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5,6">Heb. iii. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He begins with the law of the sabbath, because that was much 
 insisted on in the instructions he had received

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 <I>Six days shall work be done,</I> work for the tabernacle, the work 
 of the day that was now to be done in its day; and they had little else 
 to do here in the wilderness, where they had neither husbandry nor 
 merchandise, neither food to get nor clothes to make: <I>but on the 
 seventh day</I> you must not strike a stroke, no, not at the 
 tabernacle-work; the honour of the sabbath was above that of the 
 sanctuary, more ancient and more lasting; that must be to you a holy 
 day, devoted to God, and not be spent in common business. It is a 
 sabbath of rest. It is a <I>sabbath of sabbaths</I> (so some read it), 
 more honourable and excellent than any of the other feasts, and should 
 survive them all. A <I>sabbath of sabbatism,</I> so others read it, 
 being typical of that sabbatism or rest, both spiritual and eternal, 
 which <I>remains for the people of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:9">Heb. iv. 9</A>.

 It is a sabbath of rest, that is, in which a rest from all worldly
 labour must be very carefully and strictly observed. It is a sabbath 
 and a little sabbath, so some of the Jews would have it read; not only 
 observing the whole day as a sabbath, but an hour before the beginning 
 of it, and an hour after the ending of it, which they throw in over and 
 above out of their own time, and call <I>a little sabbath,</I> to show 
 how glad they are of the approach of the sabbath and how loth to part 
 with it. It is a sabbath of rest, but it is rest to the Lord, to whose 
 honour it must be devoted. A penalty is here annexed to the breach of 
 it: <I>Whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.</I> Also a 
 particular prohibition of kindling fires on the sabbath day for any 
 servile work, as smith's work, or plumbers, &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He orders preparation to be made for the setting up of the 
 tabernacle. Two things were to be done:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All that were able must contribute: <I>Take you from among you an 
 offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The tabernacle was to be dedicated to the honour of God, and used in 
 his service; and therefore what was brought for the setting up and 
 furnishing of that was <I>an offering to the Lord.</I> Our goodness 
 extends not to God, but what is laid out for the support of his kingdom 
 and interest among men he is pleased to accept as an offering to 
 himself; and he requires such acknowledgements of our receiving our all 
 from him and such instances of our dedicating our all to him. The rule 
 is, <I>Whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring.</I> It was not to 
 be a tax imposed upon them, but a benevolence or voluntary 
 contribution, to intimate to us,

 (1.) That God has not made our yoke heavy. He is a prince that does not
 burden his subjects with taxes, nor <I>make them to serve with an 
 offering,</I> but <I>draws with the cords of a man,</I> and leaves it 
 to ourselves to <I>judge what is right;</I> his is a government that 
 there is no cause to complain of, for he does not rule with rigour. 
 
 (2.) That God loves a cheerful giver, and is best pleased with the
 free-will offering. Those services are acceptable to him that come from 
 the willing heart of a willing people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. All that were skilful must work: <I>Every wise-hearted among you 
 shall come, and make,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See how God dispenses his gifts variously; and, <I>as every man hath 
 received the gift, so he must minister,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 Those that were rich must bring in materials to work on; those that
 were ingenious must serve the tabernacle with their ingenuity; as they 
 needed one another, so the tabernacle needed them both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12"7-21">1 Cor. xii. 7-21</A>.

 The work was likely to go on when some helped with their purses, others
 with their hands, and both with a willing heart. Moses, as he had told 
 them what must be given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:5-9"><I>v.</I> 5-9</A>),

 so he gives them the general heads of what must be made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:11-19"><I>v.</I> 11-19</A>),
 
 that, seeing how much work was before them, they might apply themselves 
 to it the more vigorously, and every hand might be busy; and it gave 
 them such an idea of the fabric designed that they could not but long 
 to see it finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
 from the presence of Moses.
 &nbsp; 21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and
 every one whom his spirit made willing, <I>and</I> they brought the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s offering to the work of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.
 &nbsp; 22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
 hearted, <I>and</I> brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
 tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered <I>offered</I>
 an offering of gold unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' <I>hair,</I> and red skins of
 rams, and badgers' skins, brought <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
 brought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s offering: and every man, with whom was found
 shittim wood for any work of the service, brought <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
 hands, and brought that which they had spun, <I>both</I> of blue, and
 of purple, <I>and</I> of scarlet, and of fine linen.
 &nbsp; 26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
 goats' <I>hair.</I>
 &nbsp; 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set,
 for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
 &nbsp; 28 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
 and for the sweet incense.
 &nbsp; 29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring
 for all manner of work, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded to be made
 by the hand of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses having made known to them the will of God, they went home and 
 immediately put in practice what they had heard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 O that every congregation would thus depart from the hearing of the 
 word of God, with a full resolution to be <I>doers of the same!</I> 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The offerings that were brought for the service of the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>,
 
 &c.), concerning which many things may be noted.

 1. It is intimated that they brought their offerings immediately; they
 departed to their tents immediately to fetch their offering, and did 
 not desire time to consider of it, lest their zeal should be cooled by 
 delays.  What duty God convinces us of, and calls us to, we should set 
 about speedily. No season will be more convenient than the present 
 season. 

 2.  It is said that <I>their spirits made them willing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 <I>and their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 What they did they did cheerfully, and from a good principle. They were 
 willing, and it was not any external inducement that made them so, but 
 their spirits. It was from a principle of love to God and his service, 
 a desire of his presence with them in his ordinances, gratitude for the 
 great things he had done for them, faith in his promise of what he 
 would further do (or, at least, from the present consideration of these 
 things), that they were willing to offer. What we give and do for God 
 is then acceptable when it comes from a good principle in the heart and 
 spirit.

 3. When it is said that as many as were willing-hearted brought their
 offerings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 it should seem as if there were some who were not, who loved their gold 
 better than their God, and would not part with it, no, not for the 
 service of the tabernacle. Such there are, who will be called 
 Israelites, and yet will not be moved by the equity of the thing, God's 
 expectations from them, and the good examples of those about them, to 
 part with any thing for the interests of God's kingdom: they are for 
 the true religion, provided it be cheap and will cost them nothing.

 4.  The offerings were of divers kinds, according as they had; those
 that had gold and precious stones brought them, not thinking any thing 
 too good and too rich to part with for the honour of God. Those that 
 had not precious stones to bring brought goats' hair, and rams' skins. 
 If we cannot do as much as others for God, we must not therefore sit 
 still and do nothing: if the meaner offerings which are according to 
 our ability gain us not such a reputation among men, yet they shall not 
 fail of acceptance with God, who requires <I>according to what a man 
 hath, and not according to what he hath not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:12,2Ki+5:23">2 Cor. viii. 12; 2 Kings v. 23</A>.

 Two mites from a pauper were more pleasing than so many talents from a
 Dives. God has an eye to the heart of the giver more than to the value 
 of the gift.

 5. Many of the things they offered were their ornaments, bracelets and
 rings, and tablets or lockets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:22"><I>v.</I>  22</A>);

 and even the women parted with these. <I>Can a maid forget her 
 ornaments?</I> Thus far they forgot them that they preferred the 
 beautifying of the sanctuary before their own adorning. Let this teach 
 us, in general, to part with that for God, when he calls for it, which 
 is very dear to us, which we value, and value ourselves by; and 
 particularly to lay aside our ornaments, and deny ourselves in them, 
 when either they occasion offence to others or feed our own pride. If 
 we think those gospel rules concerning our clothing too strict 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9,10,1Pe+3:3,4">1 Tim. ii. 9, 10; 
 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4</A>),

 I fear we should scarcely have done as these Israelites did. If they
 thought their ornaments well bestowed upon the tabernacle, shall not we 
 think the want of ornaments well made up by the graces of the Spirit? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:9">Prov. i. 9</A>.

 6. These rich things that they offered, we may suppose, were mostly the
 spoils of the Egyptians; for the Israelites in Egypt were kept poor, 
 till they borrowed at parting.  And we may suppose the rulers had 
 better things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 because, having more influence among the Egyptians, they borrowed 
 larger sums.  Who would have thought that ever the wealth of Egypt 
 should have been so well employed? but thus God has often made <I>the 
 earth to help the woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>.

 It was by a special providence and promise of God that the Israelites
 got all that spoil, and therefore it was highly fit that they should 
 devote a part of it to the service of that God to whom they owed it 
 all. Let every man give <I>according as God hath prospered him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 Extraordinary successes should be acknowledged by extraordinary
 offerings. Apply it to human learning, arts and sciences, which are 
 borrowed, as it were, from the Egyptians.  Those that are enriched with 
 these must devote them to the service of God and his tabernacle: they 
 may be used as helps to understand the scriptures, as ornaments or 
 handmaids to divinity. But then great care must be taken that Egypt's 
 gods mingle not with Egypt's gold. Moses, though learned in all the 
 learning of the Egyptians, did not therefore pretend, in the least 
 instance, to correct the pattern shown him in the mount. The furnishing 
 of the tabernacle with the riches of Egypt was perhaps a good omen to 
 the Gentiles, who, in the fulness of time, should be brought into the 
 gospel tabernacle, and their silver and their gold with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:9">Isa. lx. 9</A>),

 and it should be said, <I>Blessed be Egypt my people,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:25">Isa. xix. 25</A>.

 7. We may suppose that the remembrance of the offerings made for the
 golden calf made them the more forward in these offerings.  Those that 
 had then parted with their ear-rings would not testify their repentance 
 by giving the rest of their jewels to the service of God: godly sorrow 
 worketh such a revenge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>.

 And those that had kept themselves pure from that idolatry yet argued
 with themselves, "Were they so forward in contributing to an idol, and 
 shall we be backward or sneaking in our offerings to the Lord?" Thus 
 some good was brought even out of that evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The work that was done for the service of the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>The women did spin with their hands.</I> Some spun fine work, of 
 blue and purple; others coarse work, of goats' hair, and yet theirs 
 also is said to be done in wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 As it is not only rich gifts, so it is not only fine work that God
 accepts. Notice is here taken of the good women's work for God, as well 
 as of Bezaleel's and Aholiab's.  The meanest hand for the honour of 
 God, shall have an honourable recompence. Mary's anointing of Christ's 
 head shall be told for a memorial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:13">Matt. xxvi. 13</A>);

 and a record is kept of the women that laboured in the gospel
 tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Phil. iv. 3</A>),

 and were helpers to Paul in Christ Jesus,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3">Rom. xvi. 3</A>.

 It is part of the character of the virtuous woman that she layeth
 <I>her hands to the spindle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:19">Prov. xxxi. 19</A>.

 This employment was here turned to a pious use, as it may be still
 (though we have no hangings to make for the tabernacle) by the 
 imitation of the charity of Dorcas, who made coats and garments for 
 poor widows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:39">Acts ix. 39</A>.

 Even those that are not in a capacity to give in charity may yet work
 in charity; and thus the poor may relieve the poor, and those that have 
 nothing but their limbs and senses may be very charitable in the labour 
 of love.</P>

 hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of
 the tribe of Judah;
 &nbsp; 31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
 understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
 workmanship;
 &nbsp; 32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
 and in brass,
 &nbsp; 33 And in the cutting of stones, to set <I>them,</I> and in carving
 of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

 and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
 &nbsp; 35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
 of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the
 embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine
 linen, and of the weaver, <I>even</I> of them that do any work, and of
 those that devise cunning work.

 Here is the divine appointment of the master-workmen, that there might 
 be no strife for the office, and that all who were employed in the work 
 might take direction from, and give account to, these general 
 inspectors; for God is the God of order and not of confusion. Observe, 
 
 1. Those whom God called by name to this service he <I>filled with the
 Spirit of God,</I> to qualify them for it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 Skill in secular employments is God's gift, and comes from above, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">Jam. i. 17</A>.

 From him the faculty is, and the improvement of it. To his honour
 therefore all knowledge must be devoted, and we must study how to serve 
 him with it.  The work was extraordinary which Bezaleel was designed 
 for, and therefore he was qualified in an extraordinary manner for it; 
 thus when the apostles were appointed to be master-builders in setting 
 up the gospel tabernacle they were <I>filled with the Spirit of God in 
 wisdom and understanding.</I>

 2. The were appointed, not only to devise, but to work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 <I>to work all manner of work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Those of eminent gifts, that are capable of directing others, must not 
 thing that these will excuse them in idleness. Many are ingenious 
 enough in cutting out work for other people, and can tell what this man 
 and that man should do, but the burdens they bind on others they 
 themselves <I>will not touch with one of their fingers.</I> These will 
 fall under the character of slothful servants.

 3. They were not only to devise and work themselves, but they were to
 teach others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Not only had Bezaleel power to command, but he was to take pains to 
 instruct. Those that rule should teach; and those to whom God had given 
 knowledge should be willing to communicate it for the benefit of 
 others, not coveting to monopolize it.</P>
