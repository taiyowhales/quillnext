 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The design of Moses in this chapter is to convince the people of Israel 
 of their utter unworthiness to receive from God those great favours 
 that were now to be conferred upon them, writing this, as it were, in 
 capital letters at the head of their charter, "Not for your sake, be it 
 known unto you," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:32">Ezek. xxxvi. 32</A>.

 I. He assures them of victory over their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He cautions them not to attribute their successes to their own
 merit, but to God's justice, which was engaged against their enemies, 
 and his faithfulness, which was engaged to their fathers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.
 
 III. To make it evident that they had no reason to boast of their own
 righteousness, he mentions their faults, shows Israel their 
 transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. In general, they
 had been all along a provoking people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:7-24">ver. 7-24</A>.

 In particular, 

 1. In the matter of the golden calf, the story of which he largely
 relates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:8-21">ver. 8-21</A>. 

 2. He mentions some other instances of their rebellion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.
 
 And, 

 3. Returns, at
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:25">ver. 25</A>,

 to speak of the intercession he had made for them at Horeb, to prevent
 their being ruined for the golden calf.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear, O Israel: Thou <I>art</I> to pass over Jordan this day, to
 go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
 cities great and fenced up to heaven,
 &nbsp; 2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
 thou knowest, and <I>of whom</I> thou hast heard <I>say,</I> Who can stand
 before the children of Anak!
 &nbsp; 3 Understand therefore this day, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>is</I> he
 which goeth over before thee; <I>as</I> a consuming fire he shall
 destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
 shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath said unto thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the
 wickedness of these nations the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth drive them out from
 before thee.
 &nbsp; 5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
 heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness
 of these nations the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God doth drive them out from before
 thee, and that he may perform the word which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto
 thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
 &nbsp; 6 Understand therefore, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee not
 this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
 <I>art</I> a stiffnecked people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The call to attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Hear, O Israel,</I> intimates that this was a new discourse, 
 delivered at some distance of time after the former, probably the next 
 sabbath day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Moses represents to the people the formidable strength of the 
 enemies which they were now to encounter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The nations they were to dispossess were mightier than themselves, not 
 a rude and undisciplined rout, like the natives of America, that were 
 easily made a prey of. But, should they besiege them, they would find 
 their cities well fortified, according as the art of fortification then 
 was; should they engage them in the field, they would find the people 
 great and tall, of whom common fame had reported that there was no 
 standing before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This representation is much the same with that which the evil spies had 
 made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:28,33">Num. xiii. 28, 33</A>),

 but made with a very different intention: that was designed to drive
 them from God and to discourage their hope in him; this to drive them 
 to God and to engage their hope in him, since no power less than that 
 which is almighty could secure and prosper them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assures them of victory, by the presence of God with them, 
 notwithstanding the strength of the enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "Understand therefore what thou must trust to for success, and which 
 way thou must look; it is the Lord thy God that goes before thee, not 
 only as thy captain, or commander-in-chief, to give direction, but as a 
 consuming fire, to do execution among them. Observe, He shall destroy 
 them, and then thou shalt drive them out. Thou canst not drive them 
 out, unless he destroy them and bring them down. But he will not 
 destroy them and bring them down, unless thou set thyself in good 
 earnest to drive them out." We must do our endeavour in dependence upon 
 God's grace, and we shall have that grace if we do our endeavour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He cautions them not to entertain the least thought of their own 
 righteousness, as if that had procured them this favour at God's hand: 
 "Say not. <I>For my righteousness</I> (either with regard to my good 
 character or in recompence for any good service) <I>the Lord hath 
 brought me in to possess this land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 never think it is for thy righteousness or the uprightness of thy 
 heart, that it is in consideration either of thy good conversation or 
 of they good disposition," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 And again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 it is insisted on, because it is hard to bring people from a conceit of 
 their own merit, and yet very necessary that it be done: 
 "<I>Understand</I> (know it, and believe it, and consider it) that 
 <I>the Lord thy God giveth thee not this land for thy 
 righteousness.</I> Hadst thou been to come to it upon that condition, 
 thou wouldst have been for ever shut out of it, <I>for thou art a 
 stiff-necked people.</I>" Note, Our gaining possession of the heavenly 
 Canaan, as it must be attributed to God's power and not to our own 
 might, so it must be ascribed to God's grace and not to our own merit: 
 in Christ we have both righteousness and strength; in him therefore we 
 must glory, and not in ourselves, or any sufficiency of our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He intimates to them the true reasons why God would take this good 
 land out of the hands of the Canaanites, and settle it upon Israel, and 
 they are borrowed from his own honour, not from Israel's deserts. 

 1. He will be honoured in the destruction of idolaters; they are justly
 looked upon as haters of him, and therefore he will visit their 
 iniquity upon them. It is <I>for the wickedness of these nations</I> 
 that God <I>drives them out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 All those whom God rejects are rejected for their own wickedness: but 
 none of those whom he accepts are accepted for their own righteousness. 

 2. He will be honoured in the performance of his promise to those that
 are in covenant with him: God swore to the patriarchs, who loved him 
 and left all to follow him, that he would give this land to their seed; 
 and therefore he would <I>keep that promised mercy for thousands of 
 those that loved him and kept his commandments;</I> he would not suffer 
 his promise to fail. It was for their fathers' sakes that they were 
 beloved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.
 
 Thus boasting is for ever excluded. See

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Remember, <I>and</I> forget not, how thou provokedst the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
 depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place,
 ye have been rebellious against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to wrath, so that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 was angry with you to have destroyed you.
 &nbsp; 9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
 stone, <I>even</I> the tables of the covenant which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made with
 you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I
 neither did eat bread nor drink water:
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered unto me two tables of stone written
 with the finger of God; and on them <I>was written</I> according to
 all the words, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake with you in the mount out of
 the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty
 nights, <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave me the two tables of stone, <I>even</I>
 the tables of the covenant.
 &nbsp; 12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
 hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt
 have corrupted <I>themselves;</I> they are quickly turned aside out of
 the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten
 image.
 &nbsp; 13 Furthermore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
 people, and, behold, it <I>is</I> a stiffnecked people:
 &nbsp; 14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their
 name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
 and greater than they.
 &nbsp; 15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount
 burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <I>were</I> in my
 two hands.
 &nbsp; 16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God, <I>and</I> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
 quickly out of the way which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded you.
 &nbsp; 17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two
 hands, and brake them before your eyes.
 &nbsp; 18 And I fell down before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as at the first, forty days
 and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
 because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
 the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to provoke him to anger.
 &nbsp; 19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was wroth against you to destroy you. But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hearkened unto me at that time also.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed
 him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
 &nbsp; 21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt
 it with fire, and stamped it, <I>and</I> ground <I>it</I> very small,
 <I>even</I> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
 into the brook that descended out of the mount.
 &nbsp; 22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye
 provoked the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to wrath.
 &nbsp; 23 Likewise when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying,
 Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
 rebelled against the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and ye
 believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
 &nbsp; 24 Ye have been rebellious against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> from the day that I
 knew you.
 &nbsp; 25 Thus I fell down before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> forty days and forty
 nights, as I fell down <I>at the first;</I> because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said
 he would destroy you.
 &nbsp; 26 I prayed therefore unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>,
 destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
 redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out
 of Egypt with a mighty hand.
 &nbsp; 27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
 unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
 nor to their sin:
 &nbsp; 28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was not able to bring them into the land which he promised
 them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay
 them in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 29 Yet they <I>are</I> thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
 broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That they might have no pretence to think that God brought them to 
 Canaan <I>for their righteousness,</I> Moses here shows them what a 
 miracle of mercy it was that they had not long ere this been destroyed 
 in the wilderness: "<I>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst 
 the Lord thy God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 so far from purchasing his favour, thou hast many a time laid thyself 
 open to his displeasure." Their fathers' provocations are here charged 
 upon them; for, if God had dealt with their fathers according to their 
 deserts, this generation would never have been, much less would they 
 have entered Canaan. We are apt to forget our provocations, especially 
 when the smart of the rod is over, and have need to be often put in 
 mind of them, that we may never entertain any conceit of our own 
 righteousness. Paul argues from the guilt which all mankind is under to 
 prove that we cannot be <I>justified before God</I> by our own works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:19,20">Rom. iii. 19, 20</A>.

 If our works condemn us, they will not justify us. Observe,

 1. They had been a provoking people ever since they came out of Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Forty years long,</I> from first to last, were God and Moses grieved 
 with them. It is a very sad character Moses now at parting leaves of 
 them: <I>You have been rebellious since the day I knew you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 No sooner were they formed into a people than there was a faction 
 formed among them, which upon all occasions made head against God and 
 his government. Though the Mosaic history records little more than the 
 occurrences of the first and last year of the forty, yet it seems by 
 this general account that the rest of the years were not much better, 
 but one continued provocation. 

 2. Even in Horeb they made a calf and worshipped it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 &c. That was a sin so heinous, and by several aggravations made so 
 exceedingly sinful, that they deserved upon all occasions to be 
 upbraided with it. It was done in the very place where the law was 
 given by which they were expressly forbidden to worship God by images, 
 and while the mountain was yet burning before their eyes, and Moses had 
 gone up to fetch them the law in writing. They <I>turned aside 
 quickly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 3. God was very angry with them for their sin. Let them not think that 
 God overlooked what they did amiss, and gave them Canaan for what was 
 good among them. No, God had determined to destroy them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 could easily have done it, and would have been no loser by it; he even 
 desired Moses to let him alone that he might do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 By this it appeared how heinous their sin was, for God is never angry 
 with any above what there is cause for, as men often are. Moses 
 himself, though a friend and favourite, trembled at the revelation of 
 God's wrath from heaven against their ungodliness and unrighteousness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>I was afraid of the anger of the Lord,</I> afraid perhaps not for 
 them only, but for himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 4. They had by their sin broken covenant with God, and forfeited all
 the privileges of the covenant, which Moses signified to them by 
 <I>breaking the tables,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 A bill of divorce was given them, and thenceforward they might justly 
 have been abandoned for ever, so that their mouth was certainly stopped 
 from pleading any righteousness of their own. God had, in effect, 
 disowned them, when he said to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 "They are thy people, they are none of mine, nor shall they be dealt 
 with as mine." 

 5. Aaron himself fell under God's displeasure for it, though he was the
 saint of the Lord, and was only brought by surprise or terror to be 
 confederate with them in the sin: <I>The Lord was very angry with 
 Aaron,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 No man's place or character can shelter him from the wrath of God if he 
 have <I>fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.</I> Aaron, 
 that should have made atonement for them if the iniquity could have 
 been purged away by sacrifice and offering, did himself fall under the 
 wrath of God: so little did they consider what they did when they drew 
 him in. 

 6. It was with great difficulty and very long attendance that Moses
 himself prevailed to turn away the wrath of God, and prevent their 
 utter ruin. He fasted and prayed full forty days and forty nights
 before he could obtain their pardon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 And some think twice forty days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 because it is said, <I>as I fell down before,</I> whereas his errand in 
 the first forty was not of that nature. Others think it was but one 
 forty, though twice mentioned (as also in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:10"><I>ch.</I> x. 10</A>);

 but this was enough to make them sensible how great God's displeasure
 was against them, and what a narrow escape they had for their lives. 
 And in this appears the greatness of God's anger against all mankind 
 that no less a person than his Son, and no less a price than his own 
 blood, would serve to turn it away. Moses here tells them the substance 
 of his intercession for them. He was obliged to own their
 stubbornness, and their wickedness, and their sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Their character was bad indeed when he that appeared an advocate for 
 them could not give them a good word, and had nothing else to say in 
 their behalf but that God had done great things for them, which really 
 did but aggravate their crime

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),--that

 they were the posterity of good ancestors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 which might also have been turned upon him, as making the matter worse 
 and not better,--and that the Egyptians would reproach God, if he 
 should destroy them, as unable to perfect what he had wrought for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 a plea which might easily enough have been answered: no matter what the 
 Egyptians say, while the heavens declare God's righteousness; so that 
 the saving of them from ruin at that time was owing purely to the mercy 
 of God, and the importunity of Moses, and not to any merit of theirs, 
 that could be offered so much as in mitigation of their offence. 

 7. To affect them the more with the destruction they were then at the
 brink of, he describes very particularly the destruction of the calf 
 they had made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He calls it their <I>sin:</I> perhaps not only because it had been the
 matter of their sin, but because the destroying of it was intended for 
 a testimony against their sin, and an indication to them what the 
 sinners themselves did deserve. Those that made it were like unto it, 
 and would have had no wrong done them if they had been thus stamped to 
 dust, and consumed, and scattered, and no remains of them left. It was 
 infinite mercy that accepted the destruction of the idol instead of the 
 destruction of the idolaters. 

 8. Even after this fair escape that they had, in many other instances
 they provoked the Lord again and again. He needed only to name the 
 places, for they carried the memorials either of the sin or of the 
 punishment in their names

 at <I>Taberah, burning,</I> where God set fire to them for their 
 murmuring,--at <I>Massah, the temptation,</I> where they challenged 
 almighty power to help them,--and at <I>Kibroth-hattaavah, the graves 
 of lusters,</I> where the dainties they coveted were their poison; and, 
 after these, their unbelief and distrust at Kadesh-barnea, of which he 
 had already told them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:1-46"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 and which he here mentions again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 would certainly have completed their ruin if they had been dealt with 
 according to their own merits.</P>

 Now let them lay all this together, and it will appear that whatever 
 favour God should hereafter show them, in subduing their enemies and 
 putting them in possession of the land of Canaan, it was not for their
 righteousness. It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, 
 with sorrow and shame, our former sins, and to review the records 
 conscience keeps of them, that we may see how much we are indebted to 
 free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited at God's hand any 
 thing but wrath and the curse.</P>
