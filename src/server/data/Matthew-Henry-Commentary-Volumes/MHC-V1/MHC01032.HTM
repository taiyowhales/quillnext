 We have here Jacob still upon his journey towards Canaan. Never 
 did so many memorable things occur in any march as in this of 
 Jacob's little family. By the way he meets, 
 
 I. With good tidings 
 from his God,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II. With bad tidings from his brother, 
 to whom he sent a message to notify his return,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.
 In his distress, 
 
 1. He divides his company,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.
 
 2. He makes his prayer to God,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.
 
 3. He sends a present to his brother,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:13-23">ver. 13-23</A>.
 
 4. He wrestles with the angel,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Jacob went on his way, and 
 the angels of God met him. 
 &nbsp; 2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, 
 This <I>is</I> God's host: and he called the 
 name of that place Mahanaim.

 Jacob, having got clear of Laban, pursues 
 his journey homewards towards Canaan: 
 when God has helped us through difficulties 
 we should go on our way heaven-ward with 
 so much the more cheerfulness and resolution. 
 Now, 
 
 1. Here is Jacob's convoy in 
 his journey
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 <I>The angels of God met 
 him,</I> in a visible appearance, whether in a 
 vision by day or in a dream by night, as 
 when he saw them upon the ladder
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:12"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 12</A>),
 is uncertain. Note, Those that 
 keep in a good way have always a good 
 guard; angels themselves are ministering 
 spirits for their safety, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb. i. 14</A>.
 Where
 Jacob pitched his tents, they pitched theirs
 about him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7">Ps. xxxiv. 7</A>.
 They met him, to 
 bid him welcome to Canaan again; a more 
 honourable reception this was than ever any 
 prince had, that was met by the magistrates 
 of a city in their formalities. They met him 
 to congratulate him on his arrival, as well as 
 on his escape from Laban; for they have 
 pleasure in the prosperity of God's servants. 
 They had invisibly attended him all along, 
 but now they appeared to him, because he 
 had greater dangers before him than those he 
 had hitherto encountered. Note, When 
 God designs his people for extraordinary 
 trials, he prepares them by extraordinary 
 comforts. We should think it had been 
 more seasonable for these angels to have appeared 
 to him amidst the perplexity and agitation 
 occasioned first by Laban, and afterwards 
 by Esau, than in this calm and quiet 
 interval, when he saw not himself in any 
 imminent peril; but God will have us, when 
 we are in peace, to provide for trouble, and, 
 when trouble comes, to live upon former observations 
 and experiences; for <I>we walk by 
 faith, not by sight.</I> God's people, at death, 
 are returning to Canaan, to their Father's 
 house; and then the angels of God will meet 
 them, to congratulate them on the happy 
 finishing of their servitude, and to carry 
 them to their rest. 
 
 2. The comfortable notice 
 he took of this convoy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 <I>This is 
 God's host,</I> and therefore, 
 
 (1.) It is a powerful 
 host; very great is he that is thus attended, 
 and very safe that is thus guarded. 
 
 (2.) God must have the praise of this protection: 
 "This I may thank God for, for it 
 is his host." A good man may with an eye 
 of faith see the same that Jacob saw with his 
 bodily eyes, by believing that promise 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:11">Ps. xci. 11</A>),
 <I>He shall give his angels charge over 
 thee.</I> What need have we to dispute whether 
 every particular saint has a guardian 
 angel, when we are sure he has a guard of 
 angels about him? To preserve the remembrance 
 of this favour, Jacob gave a name to 
 the place from it, <I>Mahanaim, two hosts,</I> or 
 <I>two camps.</I> That is, say some of the rabbin, 
 one host of the guardian angels of Mesopotamia, 
 who conducted Jacob thence, and delivered 
 him safely to the other host of the 
 angels of Canaan, who met him upon the 
 borders where he now was. Rather, they 
 appeared to him in two hosts, one on either 
 side, or one in the front and the other in the 
 rear, to protect him from Laban behind and 
 Esau before, that they might be a complete 
 guard. Thus he is <I>compassed</I> with God's 
 favour. Perhaps in allusion to this the 
 church is called <I>Mahanaim, two armies,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:13">Cant. vi. 13</A>.
 Here were Jacob's family, which 
 made one army, representing the church 
 militant and itinerant on earth; and the 
 angels, another army, representing the church 
 triumphant and at rest in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And Jacob sent messengers before 
 him to Esau his brother unto the 
 land of Seir, the country of Edom.
 &nbsp; 4 And he commanded them, saying, 
 Thus shall ye speak unto my lord 
 Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, 
 I have sojourned with Laban, and 
 stayed there until now:
 &nbsp; 5 And I have 
 oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, 
 and womenservants: and I have 
 sent to tell my lord, that I may find
 grace in thy sight.
 &nbsp; 6 And the messengers 
 returned to Jacob, saying, We 
 came to thy brother Esau, and also he 
 cometh to meet thee, and four hundred
 men with him.
 &nbsp; 7 Then Jacob 
 was greatly afraid and distressed: and 
 he divided the people that <I>was</I> with 
 him, and the flocks, and herds, and
 the camels, into two bands;
 &nbsp; 8 And 
 said, If Esau come to the one company, 
 and smite it, then the other 
 company which is left shall escape.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that Jacob was re-entering Canaan 
 God, by the vision of angels, reminded him 
 of the friends he had when he left it, and 
 thence he takes occasion to remind himself 
 of the enemies he had, particularly Esau. It 
 is probable that Rebekah had sent him word 
 of Esau's settlement in Seir, and of the continuance 
 of his enmity to him. What shall 
 poor Jacob do? He longs to see his father, 
 and yet he dreads to see his brother. He 
 rejoices to see Canaan again, and yet cannot 
 but rejoice with trembling because of Esau.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sends a very kind and humble 
 
 <A NAME="Page192"> </A>

 message to Esau. It does not appear that 
 his way lay through Esau's country, or that 
 he needed to ask his leave for a passage; 
 but his way lay near it, and he would not 
 go by him without paying him the respect 
 due to a brother, a twin-brother, an only 
 brother, an elder brother, a brother offended. 
 Note, 
 
 1. Though our relations fail in their 
 duty to us, yet we must make conscience of 
 doing our duty to them. 
 
 2. It is a piece of 
 friendship and brotherly love to acquaint our 
 friends with our condition, and enquire into 
 theirs. Acts of civility may help to slay 
 enmities. Jacob's message to him is very 
 obliging,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 (1.) He calls Esau his 
 lord, himself his servant, to intimate that he 
 did not insist upon the prerogatives of the 
 birthright and blessing he had obtained for 
 himself, but left it to God to fulfil his own 
 purpose in his seed. Note, <I>Yielding pacifies 
 great offences,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4">Eccl. x. 4</A>.
 We must not refuse 
 to speak in a respectful and submissive manner 
 to those that are ever so unjustly exasperated 
 against it.

 (2.) He gives him a short account 
 of himself, that he was not a fugitive and a 
 vagabond, but, though long absent, had had a 
 certain dwelling-place, with his own relations: 
 <I>I have sojourned with Laban, and staid there 
 till now;</I> and that he was not a beggar, nor 
 did he come home, as the prodigal son, destitute 
 of necessaries and likely to be a charge 
 to his relations; no, <I>I have oxen and asses.</I> 
 This he knew would (if any thing) recommend 
 him to Esau's good opinion. And, 
 
 (3.) He courts his favour: <I>I have sent, that I 
 might find grace in thy sight.</I> Note, It is no 
 disparagement to those that have the better 
 cause to become petitioners for reconciliation, 
 and to sue for peace as well as right.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He receives a very formidable account 
 of Esau's warlike preparations against him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 not a word, but a blow, a very coarse 
 return to his kind message, and a sorry welcome 
 home to a poor brother: <I>He comes to 
 meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</I> 
 He is now weary of waiting for the days of 
 mourning for this good father, and even before 
 they come he resolves to slay his brother. 
 
 1. He remembers the old quarrel, and will now 
 be avenged on him for the birthright and 
 blessing, and, if possible, defeat Jacob's 
 expectations from both. Note, malice harboured 
 will last long, and find an occasion to 
 break out with violence a great while after 
 the provocations given. Angry men have 
 good memories. 
 
 2. He envies Jacob what 
 little estate he had, and, though he himself 
 was now possessed of a much better, yet nothing 
 will serve him but to feed his eyes upon 
 Jacob's ruin, and fill his fields with Jacob's 
 spoils. Perhaps the account Jacob sent him 
 of his wealth did but provoke him the more. 
 
 3. He concludes it easy to destroy him, now 
 that he was upon the road, a poor weary 
 traveller, unfixed, and (as he thinks) unguarded. 
 Those that have the serpent's poison 
 have commonly the serpent's policy, to 
 take the first and fairest opportunity that offers 
 itself for revenge. 
 
 4. He resolves to do it suddenly, 
 and before Jacob had come to his father, 
 lest he should interpose and mediate between 
 them. Esau was one of those that hated peace; 
 when Jacob speaks, speaks peaceably, <I>he</I> is for 
 war, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:6,7">Ps. cxx. 6, 7</A>.
 Out he marches, spurred on 
 with rage, and intent on blood and murders; 
 four hundred men he had with him, probably 
 such as used to hunt with him, armed, no 
 doubt, rough and cruel like their leader, ready 
 to execute the word of command though ever 
 so barbarous, and now breathing nothing but 
 threatenings and slaughter. The tenth part 
 of these were enough to cut off poor Jacob, 
 and his guiltless helpless family, root and 
 branch. No marvel therefore that it follows
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 <I>then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed,</I> 
 perhaps the more so from having 
 scarcely recovered the fright Laban had put 
 him in. Note, Many are the troubles of the 
 righteous in this world, and sometimes the 
 end of one is but the beginning of another. 
 The clouds return after the rain. Jacob, 
 though a man of great faith, yet was now 
 greatly afraid. Note, A lively apprehension 
 of danger, and a quickening fear arising from 
 it, may very well consist with a humble confidence 
 in God's power and promise. Christ 
 himself, in his agony, was sorely amazed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He puts himself into the best posture 
 of defence that his present circumstances will 
 admit. It was absurd to think of making 
 resistance, all his contrivance is to make an 
 escape,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 He thinks it prudent not to 
 venture all in one bottom, and therefore 
 divides what he had into two companies, that, 
 if one were smitten, the other might escape. 
 Like a tender careful master of a family, he 
 is more solicitous for their safety than for his 
 own. He divided his company, not as Abraham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>),
 for fight, but for flight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And Jacob said, O God of my 
 father Abraham, and God of my father 
 Isaac, the L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT> which saidst 
 unto me, Return unto thy country, and 
 to thy kindred, and I will deal well 
 with thee:
 &nbsp; 10 I am not worthy of the 
 least of all the mercies, and of all the 
 truth, which thou hast showed unto 
 thy servant; for with my staff I passed 
 over this Jordan; and now I am become 
 two bands.
 &nbsp; 11 Deliver me, I pray 
 thee, from the hand of my brother, from
 the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest 
 he will come and smite me, <I>and</I> the mother 
 with the children.
 &nbsp; 12 And thou 
 saidst, I will surely do thee good, and 
 make thy seed as the sand of the sea, 
 which cannot be numbered for multitude.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our rule is to call upon God in the time of 
 
 <A NAME="Page193"> </A>

 trouble; we have here an example to this 
 rule, and the success encourages us to follow 
 this example. It was now a time of Jacob's 
 trouble, but he shall be saved out of it; and 
 here we have him praying for that salvation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:7">Jer. xxx. 7</A>.
 In his distress he sought the 
 Lord, and he heard him. Note, Times of 
 fear should be times of prayer; whatever 
 frightens us should drive us to our knees, to 
 our God. Jacob had lately seen his guard of 
 angels, but, in this distress, he applied to 
 God, not to them; he knew they were his 
 fellow-servants, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:9">Rev. xxii. 9</A>.
 Nor did he 
 consult Laban's <I>teraphim;</I> it was enough for 
 him that he had a God to go to. To him he 
 addresses himself with all possible solemnity, 
 so running for safety into the name of the 
 Lord, <I>as a strong tower,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.
 This prayer is the more remarkable because 
 it won him the honour of being an <I>Israel, a 
 prince with God,</I> and the father of the praying 
 remnant, who are hence called <I>the seed of Jacob,</I> 
 to whom he never said, <I>Seek you me in vain.</I> 
 Now it is worth while to enquire what there 
 was extraordinary in this prayer, that it should 
 gain the petitioner all this honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The request itself is one, and very express: 
 <I>Deliver me from the hand of my brother,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 Though there was no human probability 
 on his side, yet he believed the power of 
 God could rescue him as a lamb out of the 
 bloody jaws of the loin. Note, 
 
 1. We have 
 leave to be particular in our addresses to God, 
 to mention the particular straits and difficulties 
 we are in; for the God with whom we 
 have to do is one we may be free with: <I>we 
 have liberty of speech</I> (<B><I>parresia</I></B>) at the throne 
 of grace. 
 
 2. When our brethren aim to be 
 our destroyers, it is our comfort that we have a 
 Father to whom we may apply as our deliverer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pleas are many, and very powerful; 
 never was cause better ordered, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:4">Job xxiii. 4</A>.
 He offers up his request with great faith, fervency, 
 and humility. How earnestly does 
 he beg! <I>Deliver me, I pray thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 His 
 fear made him importunate. With what 
 holy logic does he argue! With what divine 
 eloquence does he plead! Here is a noble 
 copy to write after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He addresses himself to God as the God 
 of his fathers,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Such was the humble 
 self-denying sense he had of his own unworthiness 
 that he did not call God his own God, 
 but a God in covenant with his ancestors: <I>O 
 God of my father Abraham, and God of my 
 father Isaac;</I> and this he could the better 
 plead because the covenant, by divine designation, 
 was entailed upon him. Note, God's 
 covenant with our fathers may be a comfort 
 to us when we are in distress. It has often
 been so to the Lord's people, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:4,5">Ps. xxii. 4, 5</A>.
 Being born in God's house, we are taken 
 under his special protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He produces his warrant: <I>Thou saidst 
 unto me, Return unto thy country.</I> He did 
 not rashly leave his place with Laban, nor 
 undertake this journey out of a fickle humour, 
 or a foolish fondness for his native country, 
 but in obedience to God's command. Note, 
 
 (1.) We may be in the way of our duty, and yet 
 may meet with trouble and distress in that way. 
 As prosperity will not prove us in the right, so 
 cross events will not prove us in the wrong; 
 we may be going whither God calls us, and 
 yet may think our way hedged up with thorns. 
 
 (2.) We may comfortably trust God with our 
 safety, while we carefully keep to our duty. 
 If God be our guide, he will be our guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He humbly acknowledges his own unworthiness 
 to receive any favour from God
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 <I>I am not worthy;</I> it is an unusual 
 plea. Some would think he should have 
 pleaded that what was now in danger was his 
 own, against all the world, and that he had 
 earned it dear enough; no, he pleads, <I>Lord, 
 I am not worthy of it.</I> Note, Self-denial and 
 self-abasement well become us in all our addresses 
 to the throne of grace. Christ never 
 commended any of his petitioners so much as 
 him who said, <I>Lord, I am not worthy</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:8">Matt. viii. 8</A>),
 and her who said, <I>Truth, Lord, yet 
 the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from 
 their master's table,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:27">Matt. xv. 27</A>.
 Now observe 
 here,

 (1.) How magnificently and honourably 
 he speaks of the mercies of God to 
 him. We have here, <I>mercies,</I> in the plural 
 number, and inexhaustible spring, and innumerable 
 streams; <I>mercies and truth,</I> that is, 
 past mercies given according to the promise, 
 and further mercies secured by the promise. 
 Note, What is laid up in God's truth, as well 
 as what is laid out in God's mercies, is the 
 matter both of the comforts and the praises 
 of active believers. Nay, observe, it is <I>all</I> the 
 mercies, and <I>all</I> the truth; the manner of expression 
 is copious, and intimates that his 
 heart was full of God's goodness. 
 
 (2.) How 
 meanly and humbly he speaks of himself, disclaiming 
 all thought of his own merit: "<I>I am 
 not worthy of the least of all thy mercies,</I> 
 much less am I worthy of so great a favour 
 as this I am now suing for." Jacob was a 
 considerable man, and, upon many accounts, 
 very deserving, and, in treating with Laban, 
 had justly insisted on his merits, but not before 
 God. <I>I am less than all thy mercies;</I> so 
 the word is. Note, The best and greatest of 
 men are utterly unworthy of the least favour 
 from God, and just be ready to own it upon 
 all occasions. It was the excellent Mr. Herbert's 
 motto, <I>Less than the least of all God's 
 mercies.</I> Those are best prepared for the 
 greatest mercies that see themselves unworthy 
 of the least.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He thankfully owns God's goodness to 
 him in his banishment, and how much it had 
 outdone his expectations: "<I>With my staff I 
 passed over this Jordan,</I> poor and desolate, 
 like a forlorn and despised pilgrim;" he had 
 no guides, no companions, no attendants, no 
 conveniences for travel, but his staff only, 
 nothing else to stay himself upon; "<I>and now 
 I have become two bands,</I> now I am surrounded 
 with a numerous and comfortable retinue of 
 
 <A NAME="Page194"> </A>

 children and servants:" though it was his 
 distress that had now obliged him to divide 
 his family into two bands, yet he makes use 
 of that for the magnifying of the mercy of his 
 increase. Note, 
 
 (1.) The increase of our families 
 is then comfortable indeed to us when 
 we see God's mercies, and his truth, in it. 
 
 (2.) Those whose latter end greatly increases 
 ought, with humility and thankfulness, to 
 remember how small their beginning was. 
 Jacob pleads, "Lord, thou didst keep me 
 when I went out with only my staff, and had 
 but one life to lose; wilt thou not keep me
 now that so many are embarked with me?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He urges the extremity of the peril he 
 was in: <I>Lord, deliver me from Esau, for I 
 fear him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 The people of God have not 
 been shy of telling God their fears; for they 
 know he takes cognizance of them, and considers 
 them. The fear that quickens prayer 
 is itself pleadable. It was not a robber, but 
 a murderer, that he was afraid of; nor was it 
 his own life only that lay at stake, but the 
 mothers' and the children's, that had left 
 their native soil to go along with him. Note, 
 Natural affection may furnish us with allowable 
 acceptable pleas in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He insists especially upon the promise 
 God had made him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 <I>Thou saidst, I will 
 deal well with thee,</I> and again, in the close
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 <I>Thou saidst, I will surely do thee good.</I> 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) The best we can say to God in 
 prayer is what he has said to us. God's promises, 
 as they are the surest guide of our desires 
 in prayer, and furnish us with the best 
 petitions, so they are the firmest ground of 
 our hopes, and furnish us with the best 
 pleas. "Lord, thou saidst thus and thus; 
 and wilt thou not be as good as thy word, 
 the word upon which thou had <I>caused me to 
 hope?</I>" 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:49">Ps. cxix. 49</A>.

 (2.) The most general 
 promises are applicable to particular cases. 
 "Thou saidst, <I>I will do thee good;</I> Lord, do 
 me good in this matter." He pleads also a 
 particular promise, that of <I>the multiplying of 
 his seed.</I> "Lord, what will become of that 
 promise, if they be all cut off?" Note, 
 
 [1.] There are promises to the families of good 
 people, which are improvable in prayer for family-mercies, 
 ordinary and extraordinary,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17,Ps+112:2,Ps+102:28"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 7; Ps. cxii. 2; cii. 28</A>.

 [2.] The world's 
 threatenings should drive us to God's promises.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And he lodged there that same 
 night; and took of that which came 
 to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
 &nbsp; 14 Two hundred she goats, and 
 twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, 
 and twenty rams,
 &nbsp; 15 Thirty milch 
 camels with their colts, forty kine, and 
 ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten 
 foals.
 &nbsp; 16 And he delivered <I>them</I> into 
 the hand of his servants, every drove 
 by themselves; and said unto his servants, 
 Pass over before me, and put 
 a space betwixt drove and drove.
 &nbsp; 17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, 
 When Esau my brother meeteth 
 thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose 
 <I>art</I> thou? and whither goest thou? 
 and whose <I>are</I> these before thee?
 &nbsp; 18 Then thou shalt say, <I>They be</I> thy servant 
 Jacob's; it <I>is</I> a present sent unto 
 my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <I>is</I>
 behind us.
 &nbsp; 19 And so commanded 
 he the second, and the third, and all 
 that followed the droves, saying, On 
 this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, 
 when ye find him.
 &nbsp; 20 And say ye 
 moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob 
 <I>is</I> behind us. For he said, I will appease 
 him with the present that goeth 
 before me, and afterward I will see 
 his face; peradventure he will accept 
 of me.
 &nbsp; 21 So went the present over 
 before him: and himself lodged that
 night in the company.
 &nbsp; 22 And he 
 rose up that night, and took his 
 two wives, and his two womenservants, 
 and his eleven sons, and passed over 
 the ford Jabbok.
 &nbsp; 23 And he took 
 them, and sent them over the brook, 
 and sent over that he had.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jacob, having piously made God his friend 
 by a prayer, is here prudently endeavouring 
 to make Esau his friend by a present. He 
 had prayed to God to deliver him from the 
 hand of Esau, for he feared him; but neither 
 did his fear sink into such a despair as dispirits 
 for the use of means, nor did his prayer make 
 him presume upon God's mercy, without the 
 use of means. Note, When we have prayed 
 to God for any mercy, we must second our 
 prayers with our endeavours; else, instead of 
 trusting god, we tempt him; we must so 
 depend upon God's providence as to make 
 use of our own prudence. "Help thyself, 
 and God will help thee;" God answers our 
 prayers by teaching us to order our affairs 
 with discretion. To pacify Esau,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jacob sent him a very noble present, 
 not of jewels or fine garments (he had them 
 not), but of cattle, to the number of 580 in 
 all,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.
 Now, 
 
 1. It was an evidence 
 of the great increase with which God had 
 blessed Jacob that he could spare such a
 number of cattle out of his stock. 
 
 2. It was 
 an evidence of his wisdom that he would 
 willingly part with some, to secure the rest; 
 some men's covetousness loses them more 
 than ever it gained them, and, by grudging 
 a little expense, they expose themselves to
 great damage; <I>skin for skin, and all that a 
 man has,</I> if he be a wise man, <I>he will give for 
 his life.</I> 
 
 3. It was a present that he thought 
 would be acceptable to Esau, who had traded 
 
 <A NAME="Page195"> </A>

 so much in hunting wild beasts that perhaps 
 he was but ill furnished with tame cattle with 
 which to stock his new conquests. And we 
 may suppose that the mixed colours of Jacob's 
 cattle, ring-straked, speckled, and 
 spotted, would please Esau's fancy. 
 
 4. He 
 promised himself that by this present 
 he should gain Esau's favour; for a gift commonly 
 <I>prospers, which way soever it turns</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:8">Prov. xvii. 8</A>),
 <I>and makes room for a man</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:16">Prov. xviii. 16</A>);
 nay, <I>it pacifies anger and 
 strong wrath,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:14">Prov. xxi. 14</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] We 
 must not despair of reconciling ourselves 
 even to those that have been most exasperated 
 against us; we ought not to judge men 
 unappeasable, till we have tried to appease them. 
 
 [2.] Peace and love, though purchased dearly, 
 will prove a good bargain to the purchaser. 
 Many a morose ill-natured man would have 
 said, in Jacob's case, "Esau has vowed my 
 death without cause, and he shall never be a 
 farthing the better for me; I will see him far 
 enough before I will send him a present:" 
 but Jacob forgives and forgets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sent him a very humble message, 
 which he ordered his servants to deliver in 
 the best manner,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 They must call 
 Esau their <I>lord,</I> and Jacob his <I>servant;</I> they 
 must tell him the cattle they had was a small 
 present which Jacob had sent him, as a specimen 
 of his acquisitions while he was abroad. 
 The cattle he sent were to be disposed of in 
 several droves, and the servants that attended 
 each drove were to deliver the same message, 
 that the present might appear the more valuable, 
 and his submission, so often repeated, 
 might be the more likely to influence Esau. 
 They must especially take care to tell him 
 that Jacob was coming after
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>),
 that he might not suspect he had fled through fear. 
 Note, A friendly confidence in men's goodness 
 may help to prevent the mischief designed 
 us by their badness: if Jacob will seem 
 not to be afraid of Esau, Esau, it may be 
 hoped, will not be a terror to Jacob.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And Jacob was left alone; and 
 there wrestled a man with him until 
 the breaking of the day.
 &nbsp; 25 And when 
 he saw that he prevailed not against 
 him, he touched the hollow of his 
 thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
 was out of joint, as he wrestled with 
 him.
 &nbsp; 26 And he said, Let me go, 
 for the day breaketh. And he said, I
 will not let thee go, except thou bless 
 me.
 &nbsp; 27 And he said unto him, What 
 <I>is</I> thy name? And he said, Jacob.
 &nbsp; 28 And he said, Thy name shall be 
 called no more Jacob, but Israel: for 
 as a prince hast thou power with God 
 and with men, and hast prevailed.
 &nbsp; 29 And Jacob asked <I>him,</I> and said, Tell 
 <I>me,</I> I pray thee, thy name. And he 
 said, Wherefore <I>is</I> it <I>that</I> thou dost 
 ask after my name? And he blessed 
 him there.
 &nbsp; 30 And Jacob called the 
 name of the place Peniel: for I have
 seen God face to face, and my life is 
 preserved.
 &nbsp; 31 And as he passed over 
 Penuel the sun rose upon him, and 
 he halted upon his thigh.
 &nbsp; 32 Therefore the 
 children of Israel eat not <I>of</I>

 because he touched the hollow of Jacob's 
 thigh in the sinew that shrank.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the remarkable story of Jacob's 
 wrestling with the angel and prevailing, 
 which is referred to,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hos. xii. 4</A>.
 Very early
 in the morning, a great while before day,
 Jacob had helped his wives and his children
 over the river, and he desired to be private,
 and was left alone, that he might again more
 fully spread his cares and fears before God
 in prayer. Note, We ought to continue instant
 in prayer, always to pray and not to
 faint: frequency and importunity in prayer
 prepare us for mercy. While Jacob was
 earnest in prayer, <I>stirring up himself to take
 hold on God,</I> an angel takes hold on him.
 Some think this was a created angel, the <I>angel
 of his presence</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>),
 one of those that 
 <I>always behold the face of our Father</I> and attend 
 on the <I>shechinah,</I> or the divine Majesty, 
 which probably Jacob had also in view. 
 Others think it was Michael our prince, the 
 eternal Word, the angel of the covenant, who 
 is indeed the Lord of the angels, who often 
 appeared in a human shape before he assumed 
 the human nature for a perpetuity; 
 whichsoever it was, we are sure <I>God's name 
 was in him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21">Exod. xxiii. 21</A>. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Jacob and this angel engaged,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 It was a single combat, hand to hand; 
 they had neither of them any seconds. Jacob 
 was now full of care and fear about the interview 
 he expected, next day, with his brother, 
 and, to aggravate the trial, God himself 
 seemed to come forth against him as an 
 enemy, to oppose his entrance into the land 
 of promise, and to dispute the pass with him, 
 not suffering him to follow his wives and 
 children whom he had sent before. Note, 
 Strong believers must expect divers temptations, 
 and strong ones. We are told by the 
 prophet 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hos. xii. 4</A>)
 how <I>Jacob wrestled:</I> he 
 <I>wept, and made supplication;</I> prayers and 
 tears were his weapons. It was not only a corporal, 
 but a spiritual, wrestling, by the vigorous 
 actings of faith and holy desire; and 
 thus all the spiritual seed of Jacob, that pray 
 in praying, still wrestle with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was the success of the engagement. 
 
 1. Jacob kept his ground; though 
 the struggle continued long, the angel, <I>prevailed 
 not against him</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 that is, this 
 discouragement did not shake his faith, nor 
 
 <A NAME="Page196"> </A>

 silence his prayer. It was not in his own 
 strength that he wrestled, nor by his own 
 strength that he prevailed, but in and by 
 strength derived from Heaven. That of 
 Job illustrates this 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6">Job xxiii. 6</A>),
 <I>Will he 
 plead against me with his great power?</I> No 
 (had the angel done so, Jacob had been 
 crushed), <I>but he will put strength in me;</I> and 
 by that <I>strength Jacob had power over the 
 angel,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hos. xii. 4</A>.
 Note, We cannot prevail 
 with God but in his own strength. It is his 
 Spirit that intercedes in us, and <I>helps our infirmities,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:26">Rom. viii. 26</A>.

 2. The angel put 
 out Jacob's thigh, to show him what he 
 could do, and that it was God he was wrestling 
 with, for no man could disjoint his thigh 
 with a touch. Some think that Jacob felt 
 little or no pain from this hurt; it is probable 
 that he did not, for he did not so much 
 as halt till the struggle was over
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 and, 
 if so, this was an evidence of a divine touch 
 indeed, which wounded and healed at the 
 same time. Jacob prevailed, and yet had 
 his thigh put out. Note, Wrestling believers 
 may obtain glorious victories, and yet come 
 off with broken bones; for <I>when they are 
 weak then are they strong,</I> weak in themselves, 
 but strong in Christ,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:10">2 Cor. xii. 10</A>.
 Our honours and comforts in this world have 
 their alloys. 
 
 3. The angel, by an admirable 
 condescension, mildly requests Jacob to let 
 him go
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 as God said to Moses
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:10">Exod. xxxii. 10</A>),
 <I>Let me alone.</I> Could not a mighty 
 angel get clear of Jacob's grapples? He 
 could; but thus he would put an honour on 
 Jacob's faith and prayer, and further try his 
 constancy. <I>The king is held in the galleries</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:5">Cant. vii. 5</A>);
 <I>I held him</I> (says the spouse) 
 <I>and would not let him go,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4">Cant. iii. 4</A>.
 The 
 reason the angel gives why he would be gone 
 is <I>because the day breaks,</I> and therefore he 
 would not any longer detain Jacob, who had 
 business to do, a journey to go, a family to 
 look after, which, especially in this critical 
 juncture, called for his attendance. Note, 
 Every thing is beautiful in its season; even 
 the business of religion, and the comforts of 
 communion with God, must sometimes give 
 way to the necessary affairs of this life: God 
 <I>will have mercy, and not sacrifice.</I> 
 
 4. Jacob 
 persists in his holy importunity: <I>I will not 
 let thee go, except thou bless me;</I> whatever 
 becomes of his family and journey, he resolves 
 to make the best he can of this opportunity, 
 and not to lose the advantage of his 
 victory: he does not mean to wrestle all 
 night for nothing, but humbly resolves he 
 will have a blessing, and rather shall all his 
 bones be put out of joint than he will go 
 away without one. The credit of a conquest 
 will do him no good without the comfort of 
 a blessing. In begging this blessing he owns 
 his inferiority, though he seemed to have the 
 upper hand in the struggle; for <I>the less is 
 blessed of the better.</I> Note, Those that would 
 have the blessing of Christ must be in good 
 earnest, and be importunate for it, as those 
 that resolve to have no denial. It is the fervent 
 prayer that is the effectual prayer. 
 
 5. The angel puts a perpetual mark of honour 
 upon him, by changing his name
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>):
 "Thou art a brave combatant" (says the 
 angel), "a man of heroic resolution; what 
 is thy name?" "Jacob," says he, a <I>supplanter;</I> 
 so <I>Jacob</I> signifies: "Well," says 
 the angel, "be thou never so called any more; 
 henceforth thou shalt be celebrated, not for 
 craft and artful management, but for true 
 valour; thou shalt be called <I>Israel, a prince 
 with God,</I> a name greater than those of the 
 great men of the earth." He is a prince indeed 
 that is a prince with God, and those 
 are truly honourable that are mighty in 
 prayer, Israels, Israelites indeed. Jacob is 
 here knighted in the field, as it were, and 
 has a title of honour given him by him that 
 is the fountain of honour, which will remain, 
 to his praise, to the end of time. Yet this 
 was not all; having power with God, he shall 
 have power with men too. Having prevailed 
 for a blessing from heaven, he shall, no 
 doubt, prevail for Esau's favour. Note, 
 Whatever enemies we have, if we can but 
 make God our friend, we are well off; those 
 that by faith have power  in heaven have
 thereby as much on earth as they 
 have occasion for. 
 
 6. He dismisses him 
 with a blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 Jacob desired to 
 know the angel's name, that he might, according 
 to his capacity, do him honour, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:17">Judg. xiii. 17</A>.
 But that request was denied, 
 that he might not be too proud of his conquest, 
 nor think he had the angel at such an 
 advantage as to oblige him to what he 
 pleased. No, "<I>Wherefore dost thou ask after 
 my name?</I> What good will it do thee to
 know that?" The discovery of that was reserved 
 for his death-bed, upon which he was 
 taught to call him <I>Shiloh.</I> But, instead of 
 telling him his name, he gave him his blessing, 
 which was the thing he wrestled for: 
 <I>He blessed him there,</I> repeated and ratified 
 the blessing formerly given him. Note, Spiritual 
 blessings, which secure our felicity, are 
 better and much more desirable than fine 
 notions which satisfy our curiosity. An interest 
 in the angel's blessing is better than 
 an acquaintance with his name. The tree of 
 life is better than the tree of knowledge. 
 Thus Jacob carried his point; a blessing he 
 wrestled for, and a blessing he had; nor did 
 ever any of his praying seed seek in vain. 
 See how wonderfully God condescends to 
 countenance and crown importunate prayer: 
 those that resolve, though God slay them, 
 yet to trust in him, will, at length, be more 
 than conquerors. 
 
 7. Jacob gives a new name 
 to the place; he calls it <I>Peniel,</I> the <I>face of 
 God</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 because there he had seen the 
 appearance of God, and obtained the favour 
 of God. Observe, The name he gives to the 
 place preserves and perpetuates, not the honour 
 of his valour or victory, but only the 
 honour of God's free grace. He does not 
 
 <A NAME="Page197"> </A>

 say, "In this place I wrestled with God, and 
 prevailed;" but, "In this place I saw God 
 face to face, and my life was preserved;" not, 
 "It was my praise that I came off a conqueror, 
 but it was God's mercy that I escaped 
 with my life." Note, It becomes those whom 
 God honours to take shame to themselves, 
 and to admire the condescensions of his grace 
 to them. Thus David did, after God had 
 sent him a gracious message
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:18">2 Sam. vii. 18</A>),
 <I>Who am I, O Lord God?</I> 
 
 8. The memorandum 
 Jacob carried of this in his bones: 
 <I>He halted on his thigh</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);
 some think he 
 continued to do so to his dying-day; and, if 
 he did, he had no reason to complain, 
 for the honour and comfort he obtained by 
 this struggle were abundantly sufficient to 
 countervail the damage, though he went 
 limping to his grave. He had no reason to 
 look upon it as his reproach thus <I>to bear in 
 his body the marks of the Lord Jesus</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:17">Gal. vi. 17</A>);
 yet it might serve, like Paul's thorn in 
 the flesh, to keep him from being lifted up 
 with the abundance of the revelations. Notice 
 is taken of the sun's rising upon him 
 when he passed over <I>Penuel;</I> for it is sunrise 
 with that soul that has communion with 
 God. The inspired penman mentions a traditional 
 custom which the seed of Jacob had, 
 in remembrance of this, never to eat of that 
 sinew, or muscle, in any beast, by which the 
 hip-bone is fixed in its cup: thus they preserved 
 the memorial of this story, and gave 
 occasion to their children to enquire concerning 
 it; they also did honour to the memory of 
 Jacob. And this use we may still make of it, 
 to acknowledge the mercy of God, and our 
 obligations to Jesus Christ, that we may now 
 keep up our communion with God, in faith, 
 hope, and love, without peril either of life or limb.</P>
