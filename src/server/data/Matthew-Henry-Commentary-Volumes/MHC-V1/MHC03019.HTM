 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some ceremonial precepts there are in this chapter, but most of them 
 are moral. One would wonder that when some of the lighter matters of 
 the law are greatly enlarged upon (witness two long chapters concerning 
 the leprosy) many of the weightier matters are put into a little
 compass: divers of the single verses of this chapter contain whole laws
 concerning judgment and mercy; for these are things which are manifest
 in every man's conscience; men's own thoughts are able to explain
 these, and to comment upon them. 

 I. The laws of this chapter, which were peculiar to the Jews, are, 

 1. Concerning their peace-offerings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 2. Concerning the gleanings of their fields, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 3. Against mixtures of their cattle, seed, and cloth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:19">ver. 19</A>.

 4. Concerning their trees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.

 5. Against some superstitious usages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 But, 

 II. Most of these precepts are binding on us, for they are expositions 
 of most of the ten commandments. 

 1. Here is the preface to the ten commandments, "I am the Lord," 
 repeated fifteen times. 

 2. A sum of the ten commandments. All the first table in this, "Be you 
 holy," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:2">ver.  2</A>.

 All the second table in this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:18">ver. 18</A>),
 
 and an answer to the question, "Who is my neighbour?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>.

 3. Something of each commandment. 

 (1.) The first commandment implied in that which is often repeated
 here, "I am your God." And here is a prohibition of enchantment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:26">ver. 26</A>)

 and witchcraft

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:31">ver. 31</A>), 
 
 which make a god of the devil.

 (2.) Idolatry, against the second commandment, is forbidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:4">ver. 4</A>.

 (3.) Profanation of God's name, against the third, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:12">ver. 12</A>.  

 (4.) Sabbath-sanctification is pressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:3,30">ver. 3, 30</A>.

 (5.) Children are required to honour their parents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and the aged,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:32">ver. 32</A>.

 (6.) Hatred and revenge are here forbidden, against the sixth
 commandment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.

 (7.) Adultery

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>),
 
 and whoredom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:29">ver. 29</A>.

 (8.) Justice is here required in judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:15">ver.  15</A>),

 theft forbidden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:11">ver.  11</A>),

 fraud and withholding dues 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:13">ver. 13</A>),

 and false weights, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:35,36">ver. 35, 36</A>.

 (9.) Lying,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:11">ver. 11</A>.

 Slandering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:14">ver. 14</A>.

 Tale-bearing, and false-witness bearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:16">ver. 16</A>.

 (10.) The tenth commandment laying a restraint upon the heart, so does
 that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">ver. 17</A>),

 "Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart." And here is a solemn
 charge to observe all these statutes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:37">ver. 37</A>.

 Now these are things which need not much help for the understanding of
 them, but require constant care and watchfulness for the observing of 
 them. "A good understanding have all those that do these 
 commandments."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
 and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God <I>am</I>
 holy.
 &nbsp; 3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
 my sabbaths: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
 <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 ye shall offer it at your own will.
 &nbsp; 6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the
 morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be
 burnt in the fire.
 &nbsp; 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it <I>is</I>
 abominable; it shall not be accepted.
 &nbsp; 8 Therefore <I>every one</I> that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
 because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and that
 soul shall be cut off from among his people.
 &nbsp; 9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
 wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather
 the gleanings of thy harvest.
 &nbsp; 10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
 gather <I>every</I> grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
 the poor and stranger: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses is ordered to deliver the summary of the laws <I>to all the 
 congregation of the children of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 not to Aaron and his sons only, but to all the people, for they were 
 all concerned to know their duty. Even in the darker ages of the law, 
 that religion could not be of God which boasted of ignorance as its 
 mother. Moses must make known God's statutes to all the congregation, 
 and proclaim them through the camp. These laws, it is probable, he 
 delivered himself to as many of the people as could be within hearing 
 at once, and so by degrees at several times to them all. Many of the 
 precepts here given they had received before, but it was requisite that 
 they should be repeated, that they might be remembered. Precept must be 
 upon precept, and line upon line, and all little enough. In these 
 verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is required that Israel be a holy people, because the God of 
 Israel is a holy God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Their being distinguished from all other people by peculiar laws and 
 customs was intended to teach them a real separation from the world and 
 the flesh, and an entire devotedness to God. And this is now the law of 
 Christ (the Lord bring every thought within us into obedience to it!) 
 <I>You shall be holy, for I am holy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:15,16">1 Pet. i. 15, 16</A>.

 We are the followers of the holy Jesus, and therefore must be,
 according to our capacity, consecrated to God's honour, and conformed 
 to his nature and will. Israel was sanctified by the types and shadows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:8"><I>ch.</I> xx. 8</A>),

 but we are <I>sanctified by the truth,</I> or substance of all those
 shadows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17,Tit+2:14">John xvii. 17; Tit. ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That children be obedient to their parents: "<I>You shall fear 
 every man his mother and his father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 1. The fear here required is the same with the honour commanded by the
 fifth commandment; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:6">Mal. i. 6</A>.

 It includes inward reverence and esteem, outward expressions of
 respect, obedience to the lawful commands of parents, care and 
 endeavour to please them and make them easy, and to avoid every thing 
 that may offend and grieve them, and incur their displeasure. The 
 Jewish doctors ask, "What is this fear that is owing to a father?" And 
 they answer, "It is not to stand in his way nor to sit in his place, 
 not to contradict what he says nor to carp at it, not to call him by 
 his name, either living or dead, but 'My Father,' or 'Sir;' it is to 
 provide for him if he be poor, and the like."

 2.  Children, when they grow up to be men, must not think themselves
 discharged from this duty: every man, though he be a wise man, and a 
 great man, yet must reverence his parents, because they are his 
 parents.  

 3. The mother is put first, which is not usual, to show that the duty
 is equally owing to both; if the mother survive the father, still she 
 must be reverenced and obeyed. 

 4. It is added, <I>and keep my sabbaths.</I> If God provides by his law
 for the preserving of the honour of parents, parents must use their 
 authority over their children for the preserving of the honour of God, 
 particularly the honour of his sabbaths, the custody of which is very 
 much committed to parents by the fourth commandment, <I>Thou, and thy 
 son, and thy daughter.</I> The ruin of young people has often been 
 observed to begin in the contempt of their parents and the profanation 
 of the sabbath day. Fitly therefore are these two precepts here put 
 together in the beginning of this abridgment of the statutes: "<I>You 
 shall fear, every man, his mother and his father, and keep my 
 sabbaths.</I> Those are hopeful children, and likely to do well, that 
 make conscience of honouring their parents and keeping holy the sabbath 
 day. 

 5. The reason added to both these precepts is, "<I>I am the Lord your
 God;</I> the Lord of the sabbath and the God of your parents."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That God only be worshipped, and not by images 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Turn you not to idols,</I> to <I>Elilim,</I> to vanities, things of 
 no power, no value, gods that are no gods. Turn not from the true God 
 to false ones, from the mighty God to impotent ones, from the God that 
 will make you holy and happy to those that will deceive you, debauch 
 you, ruin you, and make you for ever miserable. Turn not your eye to 
 them, much less your heart. <I>Make not to yourselves gods,</I> the 
 creatures of your own fancy, nor think to worship the Creator by molten 
 gods. You are the work of God's hands, be not so absurd as to worship 
 gods <I>the work of your own hands.</I>" Molten gods are specified for 
 the sake of the molten calf.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the sacrifices of their peace-offerings should always be 
 offered, and eaten, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.

 There was some particular reason, it is likely, for the repetition of 
 this law rather than any other relating to the sacrifices. The eating 
 of the peace-offerings was the people's part, and was done from under 
 the eye of the priests, and perhaps some of them had kept the cold meat 
 of their peace-offerings, as they had done the manna 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:20">Exod. xvi. 20</A>),

 longer than was appointed, which occasioned this caution; see the law
 itself before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:16-18"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16-18</A>.

 God will have his own work done in his own time.  Though the sacrifice
 was offered according to the law, if it was not eaten according to the 
 law, it was not accepted.  Though ministers do their part, what the 
 better if people do not theirs? There is work to be done after our 
 spiritual sacrifices, in a due improvement of them; and, if this be 
 neglected, all is in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That they should leave the gleanings of their harvest and vintage 
 for the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Note, Works of piety must be always attended with works of charity, 
 according as our ability is. When they gathered in their corn, they 
 must leave some standing in the corner of the field; the Jewish doctors 
 say, "It should be a sixtieth part of the field;" and they must also 
 leave the gleanings and the small clusters of their grapes, which at 
 first were overlooked. This law, though not binding now in the letter 
 of it, yet teaches us,

 1. That we must not be covetous and griping, and greedy of every thing
 we can lay any claim to; nor insist upon our right in things small and 
 trivial. 

 2. That we must be well pleased to see the poor supplied and refreshed
 with the fruit of our labours. We must not think every thing lost that 
 goes beside ourselves, nor any thing wasted that goes to the poor. 

 3.  That times of joy, such as harvest-time is, are proper times for
 charity; that, when we rejoice, the poor may rejoice with us, and when 
 our hearts are blessing God their loins may bless us.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are taught here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To be honest and true in all our dealings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God, who has appointed every man's property by his providence, forbids 
 by his law the invading of that appointment, either by downright theft, 
 <I>You shall not steal,</I> or by fraudulent dealing, "You shall not 
 cheat, or deal falsely." Whatever we have in the world, we must see to 
 it that it be honestly come by, for we cannot be truly rich, nor long 
 rich, with that which is not. The God of truth, who requires truth in 
 the heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:6">Ps. li. 6</A>), 

 requires it also in the tongue: <I>Neither lie one to another,</I>
 either in bargaining or common converse. This is one of the laws of 
 Christianity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:9">Col. iii. 9</A>): 

 <I>Lie not one to another.</I> Those that do not speak truth do not
 deserve to be told truth; those that sin by lying justly suffer by it; 
 therefore we are forbidden to <I>lie one to another;</I> for, if we lie 
 to others, we teach them to lie to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To maintain a very reverent regard to the sacred name of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 and not to call him to be witness either,

 1. To a lie: <I>You shall not swear falsely.</I> It is bad to tell a
 lie, but it is much worse to swear it. Or, 

 2. To a trifle, and every impertinence: <I>Neither shalt thou profane
 the name of thy God,</I> by alienating it to any other purpose than 
 that for which it is to be religiously used.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Neither to take nor keep any one's right from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We must not take that which is none of our own, either by fraud or 
 robbery; nor detain that which belongs to another, particularly the 
 <I>wages of the hireling,</I> let it not <I>abide with thee all 
 night.</I> Let the day-labourer have his wages as soon as he has done 
 his day's work, if he desire it. It is a great sin to deny the payment 
 of it, nay, to defer it, to his damage, a sin that cries to heaven for 
 vengeance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To be particularly tender of the credit and safety of those that 
 cannot help themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. The credit of the deaf: <I>Thou shalt not curse the deaf;</I> that
 is, not only those that are naturally deaf, that cannot hear at all, 
 but also those that are absent, and at present out of hearing of the 
 curse, and so cannot show their resentment, return the affront, nor 
 right themselves, and those that are patient, that seem as if they 
 heard not, and are not willing to take notice of it, as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13">Ps. xxxviii. 13</A>.

 Do not injure any because they are unwilling, or unable, to avenge
 themselves, for God sees and hears, though they do not.

 2. The safety of the blind we must likewise be tender of, and not put a
 stumbling-block before them; for this is to add affliction to the 
 afflicted, and to make God's providence a servant to our malice. This 
 prohibition implies a precept to help the blind, and remove 
 stumbling-blocks out of their way. The Jewish writers, thinking it 
 impossible that any should be so barbarous as to put a 
 <I>stumbling-block in the way of the blind,</I> understood it 
 figuratively, that it forbids giving bad counsel to those that are 
 simple and easily imposed upon, by which they may be led to do 
 something to their own prejudice. We ought to take heed of doing any 
 thing which may occasion our weak brother to fall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:13,1Co+8:9">Rom. xiv. 13; 1 Cor. viii. 9</A>.

 It is added, as a preservative from these sins, <I>but fear thou
 God.</I> "Thou dost not fear the deaf and blind, they cannot right 
 themselves; but remember it is the glory of God to help the helpless, 
 and he will plead their cause." Note, The fear of God will restrain us 
 from doing that which will not expose us to men's resentments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Judges and all in authority are here commanded to give verdict and 
 judgment without partiality 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 whether they were constituted judges by commission or made so in a 
 particular case by the consent of both parties, as referees or 
 arbitrators, they must do no wrong to either side, but, to the utmost 
 of their skill, must go according to the rules of equity, having 
 respect purely to the merits of the cause, and not to the characters of 
 the person. Justice must never be perverted, either,

 1. In pity to the poor: <I>Thou shalt not respect the person of the
 poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:3">Exod. xxiii. 3</A>.

 Whatever may be given to a poor man as an alms, yet let nothing be
 awarded him as his right but what he is legally entitled to, nor let 
 his poverty excuse him from any just punishment for a fault. Or,

 2. In veneration or fear of the mighty, in whose favour judges would be
 most frequently biased. The Jews say, "Judges were obliged by this law 
 to be so impartial as not to let one of the contending parties sit 
 while the other stood, nor permit one to say what he pleased and bid 
 the other be short; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1-4">James ii. 1-4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. We are all forbidden to do any thing injurious to our neighbour's 
 good name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 either,

 1. In common conversation: <I>Thou shalt not go up and down as a
 tale-bearer.</I> It is as bad an office as a man can put himself into 
 to be the publisher of every man's faults, divulging what was secret, 
 aggravating crimes, and making the worst of every thing that was amiss, 
 with design to blast and ruin men's reputation, and to sow discord 
 among neighbours. The word used for a tale-bearer signifies a 
 <I>pedlar,</I> or <I>petty chapman,</I> the interlopers of trade; for 
 tale-bearers pick up ill-natured stories at one house and utter them at 
 another, and commonly barter slanders by way of exchange. See this sin 
 condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:13,20:19,Jer+9:4,Eze+22:9">Prov. xi. 13; xx. 19; 
 Jer. ix. 4, 5; Ezek. xxii. 9</A>.

 Or,

 2, In witness-bearing: Neither <I>shalt thou stand</I> as a witness

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:11,12">Prov. i. 11, 12</A>.

 The Jewish doctors put this further sense upon it: "Thou shalt not
 stand by and see thy brother in danger, but thou shalt come in to his 
 relief and succour, though it be with the peril of thy own life or 
 limb;" they add, "He that can by his testimony clear one that is 
 accused is obliged by this law to do it;" see

 VII. We are commanded to rebuke our neighbour in love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour.</I>

 1. Rather rebuke him than hate him for an injury done to thyself. If we
 apprehend that our neighbour has any way wronged us, we must not 
 conceive a secret grudge against him, and estrange ourselves from him, 
 speaking to him neither bad nor good, as the manner of some is, who 
 have the art of concealing their displeasure till they have an 
 opportunity of a full revenge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:22">2 Sam. xiii. 22</A>);

 but we must rather give vent to our resentments with the meekness of
 wisdom, endeavour to convince our brother of the injury, reason the 
 case fairly with him, and so put an end to the disgust conceived: this 
 is the rule our Saviour gives in this case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:3">Luke xvii. 3</A>.

 2. Therefore rebuke him for his sin against God, because thou lovest
 him; endeavour to bring him to repentance, that his sin may be 
 pardoned, and he may turn from it, and it may not be suffered to lie 
 upon him. Note, Friendly reproof is a duty we owe to one another, and 
 we ought both to give it and take it in love. <I>Let the righteous 
 smite me, and it shall be a kindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5">Ps. cxli. 5</A>.

 Faithful and useful are those <I>wounds of a friend,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:5,6">Prov. xxvii. 5, 6</A>.

 It is here strictly commanded, "<I>Thou shalt in any wise</I> do it,
 and not omit it under any pretence." Consider,

 (1.) The guilt we incur by not reproving: it is construed here into a 
 hating of our brother. We are ready to argue thus, "Such a one is a 
 friend I love, therefore I will not make him uneasy by telling him of 
 his faults;" but we should rather say, "therefore I will do him the 
 kindness to tell him of them." Love covers sin from others, but not 
 from the sinner himself. 

 (2.) The mischief we do by not reproving: we <I>suffer sin upon 
 him.</I> Must we help the ass of an enemy that has fallen under his 
 burden, and shall we not help the soul of a friend?  
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:5">Exod. xxiii. 5</A>.

 And by <I>suffering sin upon him</I> we are in danger of <I>bearing sin
 for him,</I> as the margin reads it. If we reprove not the 
 <I>unfruitful works of darkness,</I> we have fellowship with them, and 
 become accessaries <I>ex post facto--after the fact,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:11">Eph. v. 11</A>.

 It is thy brother, thy neighbour, that is concerned; and he was a Cain
 that said, <I>Am I my brother's keeper?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. We are here required to put off all malice, and to put on 
 brotherly love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1. We must be ill-affected to none: <I>Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear
 any grudge;</I> to the same purport with that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart;</I> for malice is
 murder begun. If our brother has done us an injury, we must not return 
 it upon him, that is avenging; we must not upon every occasion upbraid 
 him with it, that is bearing a grudge; but we must both forgive it and 
 forget it, for thus we are forgiven of God. It is a most ill-natured 
 thing, and the bane of friendship, to retain the resentment of affronts 
 and injuries, and to let that <I>word devour for ever.</I>

 2. We must be well-affected to all: <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
 thyself.</I> We often wrong ourselves, but we soon forgive ourselves 
 those wrongs, and they do not at all lessen our love to ourselves; and 
 in like manner we should love our neighbour. Our Saviour has made this 
 the second great commandment of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:39">Matt. xxii. 39</A>),

 and the apostle shows how it is the summary of all the laws of the
 second table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:9,10,Ga+5:14">Rom. xiii. 9, 10; Gal. v. 14</A>.

 We must love our neighbour as truly as we love ourselves, and without
 dissimulation; we must evidence our love to our neighbour in the same 
 way as that by which we evidence our love to ourselves, preventing his 
 hurt, and procuring his good, to the utmost of our power. We must do to 
 our neighbour as we would be done to ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:12">Matt. vii. 12</A>),

 putting <I>our souls into his soul's stead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:4,5">Job xvi. 4, 5</A>.

 Nay, we must in many cases deny ourselves for the good of our
 neighbour, as Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>,

 &c.  Herein the gospel goes beyond even that excellent precept of the
 law; for Christ, by laying down his life for us, has taught us even to 
 <I>lay down our lives for the brethren,</I> in some cases 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16">1 John iii. 16</A>),

 and so to love our neighbour better than ourselves.</P>

 Here is, 
 
 I. A law against mixtures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 God in the beginning made the cattle <I>after their kind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:25">Gen. i. 25</A>),

 and we must acquiesce in the order of nature God hath established,
 believing that is best and sufficient, and not covet monsters.  <I>Add 
 thou not unto his works, lest he reprove thee;</I> for it is the 
 excellency of the work of God that nothing can, without making it 
 worse, be either put to it or taken from it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 As what God has joined we must not separate, so what he has separated
 we must not join. The sowing of mingled corn and the wearing of 
 linsey-woolsey garments are forbidden, either as superstitious customs 
 of the heathen or to intimate how careful they should be not to mingle 
 themselves with the heathen nor to weave any of the usages of the 
 Gentiles into God's ordinances. Ainsworth suggests that it was to lead 
 Israel to the simplicity and sincerity of religion, and to all the 
 parts and doctrines of the law and gospel in their distinct kinds. As 
 faith is necessary, good works are necessary, but to mingle these 
 together in the cause of our justification before God is forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:16">Gal. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law for punishing adultery committed with one that was a bondmaid 
 that was espoused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>.

 If she had not been espoused, the law appointed no punishment at all; 
 being espoused, if she had not been a bondmaid, the punishment had been 
 no less than death: but, being as yet a bondmaid (though before the 
 completing of her espousals she must have been made free), the capital 
 punishment is remitted, and they shall both be scourged; or, as some 
 think, the woman only, and the man was to bring a sacrifice. It was for 
 the honour of marriage, though but begun by betrothing, that the crime 
 should be punished; but it was for the honour of freedom that it should 
 not be punished as the debauching of a free woman was, so great was the 
 difference then made between bond and free 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:30">Gal. iv. 30</A>);

 but the gospel of Christ knows no such distinction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A law concerning fruit-trees, that for the first three years after 
 they were planted, if they should happen to be so forward as to bear in 
 that time, yet no use should be made of the fruit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 It was therefore the practice of the Jews to pluck off the fruit, as 
 soon as they perceived it knit, from their young trees, as gardeners do 
 sometimes, because their early bearing hinders their growing. If any 
 did come to perfection, it was not to be used in the service either of 
 God or man; but what they bore the fourth year was to be holy to the 
 Lord, either given to the priests, or eaten before the Lord with joy, 
 as their second tithe was, and thenceforward it was all their own. Now,

 1. Some think this taught them not to follow the custom of the heathen,
 who, they say, consecrated the very first products of their fruit-trees 
 to their idols, saying that otherwise all the fruits would be blasted. 
 
 2. This law in the case of fruit-trees seems to be parallel with that
 in the case of animals, that no creature should be accepted as an 
 offering till it was past eight days old, nor till that day were 
 children to be circumcised; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+22:27"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 27</A>.

 God would have the first-fruits of their trees, but, because for the
 first three years they were as inconsiderable as a lamb or a calf under 
 eight days old, therefore God would not have them, for it is fit he 
 should have every thing at its best; and yet he would not allow them to 
 be used, because his first-fruits were not as yet offered: they must 
 therefore be accounted as uncircumcised, that is, as an animal under 
 eight days' old, not fit for any use.

 3. We are hereby taught not to be over-hasty in catching at any
 comfort, but to be willing with patience to wait the time for the 
 enjoyment of it, and particularly to acknowledge ourselves unworthy of 
 the increase of the earth, our right to the fruits of which was 
 forfeited by our first parents eating forbidden fruit, and we are 
 restored to it only <I>by the word of God and prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:5">1 Tim. iv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A law against the superstitious usages of the heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 1.  Eating upon the blood, as the Gentiles did, who gathered the blood
 of their sacrifices into a vessel for their demons (as they fancied) to 
 drink, and then sat about it, eating the flesh themselves, signifying 
 their communion with devils by their feasting with them. Let not this 
 custom be used, for the blood of God's sacrifices was to be sprinkled 
 on the altar, and then poured at the foot of it, and conveyed away. 

 2.  Enchantment and divination, and a superstitious observation of the
 times, some days and hours lucky and others unlucky. Curious arts of 
 this kind, it is likely, had been of late invented by the Egyptian 
 priests, to amuse the people, and support their own credit. The 
 Israelites had seen them practised, but must by no means imitate them.  
 It would be unpardonable in those <I>to whom were committed the oracles 
 of God</I> to ask counsel of the devil, and yet worse in Christians, to 
 whom <I>the Son of God is manifested,</I> who has <I>destroyed the 
 works of the devil.</I> For Christians to have their nativities cast, 
 and their fortunes told them, to use spells and charms for the cure of 
 diseases and the driving away of evil spirits, to be affected with the 
 falling of the salt, a hare crossing the way, cross days, or the like, 
 is an intolerable affront to the Lord Jesus, a support of paganism and 
 idolatry, and a reproach both to themselves and to that worthy name by 
 which they are called: and those must be grossly ignorant, both of the 
 law and the gospel, that ask, "What harm is there in these things?" Is 
 it no harm for those that have fellowship with Christ to have 
 fellowship with devils, or to learn the ways of those that have? Surely 
 <I>we have not so learned Christ.</I> 

 3. There was a superstition even in trimming themselves used by the
 heathen, which must not be imitated by the people of God: <I>You shall 
 not round the corners of your heads.</I> Those that worshipped the 
 hosts of heaven, in honour of them, cut their hair so as that their 
 heads might resemble the celestial globe; but, as the custom was 
 foolish itself, so, being done with respect to their false gods, it was 
 idolatrous. 

 4. The rites and ceremonies by which they expressed their sorrow at
 their funerals must not be imitated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 They must not make cuts or prints in their flesh for the dead; for the 
 heathen did so to pacify the infernal deities they dreamt of, and to 
 render them propitious to their deceased friends. Christ by his 
 sufferings has altered the property of death, and made it a true friend 
 to every true Israelite; and now, as there needs nothing to make death 
 propitious to us (for, if God be so, death is so of course), so we 
 sorrow not as those that have no hope. Those whom the God of Israel had 
 set apart for himself must not receive the image and superscription of 
 these dunghill deities.  <I>Lastly,</I> The prostituting of their 
 daughters to uncleanness, which is here forbidden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 seems to have been practised by the heathen in their idolatrous 
 worships, for with such abominations those unclean spirits which they 
 worshipped were well pleased. And when lewdness obtained as a religious 
 rite, and was committed in their temples, no marvel that the land 
 became full of that wickedness, which, when it entered at the 
 temple-doors, overspread the land like a mighty torrent, and bore down 
 all the fences of virtue and modesty. The devil himself could not have 
 brought such abominations into their lives if he had not first brought 
 them into their worships.  And justly were those given up to vile 
 affections who forsook the holy God, and gave divine honours to impure 
 spirits. Those that dishonour God are thus suffered to dishonour 
 themselves and their families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law for the preserving of the honour of the time and place 
 appropriated to the service of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 This would be a means to secure them both from the idolatries and 
 superstitions of the heathen and from all immoralities in conversation.

 1. Sabbaths must be religiously observed, and not those times mentioned
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)
 
 to which the heathen had a superstitious regard.

 2. The sanctuary must be reverenced: great care must be taken to
 approach the tabernacle with that purity and preparation which the law 
 required, and to attend there with that humility, decency, and 
 closeness of application which became them in the immediate presence of 
 such an awful majesty. Though now there is no place holy by divine 
 institution, as the tabernacle and temple then were, yet this law 
 obliges us to respect the solemn assemblies of Christians for religious 
 worship, as being held under a promise of Christ's special presence in 
 them, and to carry ourselves with a due decorum while in those 
 assemblies we attend the administration of holy ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A caution against all communion with witches, and those that were 
 in league with familiar spirits: "<I>Regard them not, seek not after 
 them,</I> be not in fear of any evil from them nor in hopes of any good 
 from them. Regard not their threatenings, or promises, or predictions; 
 seek not to them for discovery or advice, for, if you do, you are 
 defiled by it, and rendered abominable both to God and your own 
 consciences." This was the sin that completed Saul's wickedness, for 
 which he was rejected of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+10:13">1 Chron. x. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A charge to young people to show respect to the aged: <I>Thou 
 shall rise up before the hoary head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Age is honourable, and he that is the Ancient of days requires that 
 honour be paid to it.  <I>The hoary head is a crown of glory.</I> Those 
 whom God has honoured with the common blessing of long life we ought to 
 honour with the distinguishing expressions of civility; and those who 
 in age are wise and good are worthy of double honour: more respect is 
 owing to such old men than merely to rise up before them; their credit 
 and comfort must be carefully consulted, their experience and 
 observations improved, and their counsels asked and hearkened to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:6,7">Job xxxii. 6, 7</A>.

 Some, by the old man whose face or presence is to be honoured,
 understand the elder in office, as by the hoary head the elder in age; 
 both ought to be respected as fathers, and in the fear of God, who has 
 put some of his honour upon both. Note, Religion teaches good manners, 
 and obliges us to give honour to those to whom honour is due.  It is an 
 instance of great degeneracy and disorder in a land when <I>the child 
 behaves himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the 
 honourable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:5,Job+30:1,12">Isa. iii. 5; Job xxx. 1, 12</A>.

 It becomes the aged to receive this honour, and the younger to give it;
 for it is the ornament as well as duty of their youth to <I>order 
 themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A charge to the Israelites to be very tender of strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.

 Both the law of God and his providence had vastly dignified Israel 
 above any other people, yet they must not therefore think themselves 
 authorized to trample upon all mankind but those of their own nation, 
 and to insult them at their pleasure; no, "<I>Thou shall not vex a 
 stranger, but love him as thyself,</I> and as one of thy own people." 
 It is supposed that this stranger was not an idolater, but a worshipper 
 of the God of Israel, though not circumcised, a proselyte of the gate 
 at least, though not a proselyte of righteousness: if such a one 
 sojourned among them, they must not vex him, nor oppress, nor 
 over-reach him in a bargain, taking advantage of his ignorance of their 
 laws and customs; they must reckon it as great a sin to cheat a 
 stranger as to cheat an Israelite; "nay" (say the Jewish doctors) "they 
 must not so much as upbraid him with his being a stranger, and his 
 having been formerly an idolater." Strangers are God's particular care, 
 as the widow and the fatherless are, because it is his honour to help 
 the helpless, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:9">Ps. cxlvi. 9</A>.

 It is therefore at our peril if we do them any wrong, or put any
 hardships upon them. Strangers shall be welcome to God's grace, and 
 therefore we should do what we can to invite them to it, and to 
 recommend religion to their good opinion. It argues a generous 
 disposition, and a pious regard to God, as a common Father, to be kind 
 to strangers; for those of different countries, customs, and languages, 
 are all made of one blood. But here is a reason added peculiar to the 
 Jews: "<I>For you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</I> God then 
 favoured you, therefore do you now favour the strangers, and do to them 
 as you then wished to be done to.  You were strangers, and yet are now 
 thus highly advanced; therefore you know not what these strangers may 
 come to, whom you are apt to despise."</P>

 V. Justice in weights and measures is here commanded. That there should 
 be no cheat in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 That they should be very exact, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 In weighing and measuring, we pretend a design to give all those their 
 own whom we deal with; but, if the weights and measures be false, it is 
 like a corruption in judgment, it cheats under colour of justice; and 
 thus to deceive a man to his damage is worse than picking his pocket or 
 robbing him on the highway. He that sells is bound to give the full of 
 the commodity, and he that buys the full of the price agreed upon, 
 which cannot be done without just balances, weights, and measures.  
 <I>Let no man go beyond or defraud his brother,</I> for, though it be 
 hidden from man, it will be found that <I>God is the avenger of all 
 such.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The chapter concludes with a general command 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>You shall observe all my statutes, and do them.</I> Note,

 1. We are not likely to do God's statutes, unless we observe them with
 great care and consideration. 

 2. Yet it is not enough barely to observe God's precepts, but we must
 make conscience of obeying them. What will it avail us to be critical 
 in our notions, if we be not conscientious in our conversations? 

 3. An upright heart has respect to all God's commandments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:6">Ps. cxix. 6</A>.

 Though in many instances the hand fails in doing what should be done,
 yet the eye observes all God's statutes. We are not allowed to pick and 
 choose our duty, but must aim at standing complete in all the will of 
 God.</P>
