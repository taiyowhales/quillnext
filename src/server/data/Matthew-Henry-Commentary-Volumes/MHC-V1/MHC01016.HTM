 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hagar is the person mostly concerned in the story of this chapter, an 
 obscure Egyptian woman, whose name and story we never should 
 have heard of if Providence had not brought her into the family of 
 Abram. Probably she was one of those maid-servants whom the 
 king of Egypt, among other gifts, bestowed upon Abram,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:16"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16</A>.
 Concerning her, we have four things in this chapter:--
 
 I. Her marriage to Abram her master,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.
 
 II. Her 
 misbehaviour towards Sarai her mistress,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.
 
 III. Her discourse 
 with an angel that met her in her flight,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:7-14">ver. 7-14</A>.
 
 IV. Her delivery of a son,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare 
 him no children: and she had 
 a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose 
 name <I>was</I> Hagar.
 &nbsp; 2 And Sarai said 
 unto Abram, Behold now, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 hath restrained me from bearing: I 
 pray thee, go in unto my maid; it
 may be that I may obtain children by 
 her. And Abram hearkened to the 
 voice of Sarai.
 &nbsp; 3 And Sarai Abram's 
 wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian,
 after Abram had dwelt ten years 
 in the land of Canaan, and gave her 
 to her husband Abram to be his wife.
 </FONT></P>

 <A NAME="Page106"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the marriage of Abram to 
 Hagar, who was his secondary wife. Herein, 
 though some excuse may be made for him, 
 he cannot be justified, for <I>from the beginning 
 it was not so;</I> and, when it was so, it seems 
 to have proceeded from an irregular desire to 
 build up families for the speedier peopling 
 of the world and the church. Certainly it 
 must not be so now. Christ has reduced 
 this matter to the first institution, and makes 
 the marriage union to be between one man 
 and one woman only. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The maker of this match (would one 
 think it?) was Sarai herself: she said to 
 Abram, <I>I pray thee, go in unto my maid,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Note, 
 
 1. It is the policy of Satan to tempt us 
 by our nearest and dearest relations, or those 
 friends that we have an opinion of and an 
 affection for. The temptation is most dangerous 
 when it is sent by a hand that is least 
 suspected: it is our wisdom therefore to consider, 
 not so much who speaks as what is 
 spoken. 
 
 2. God's commands consult our 
 comfort and honour much better than our 
 own contrivances do. It would have been 
 much more for Sarai's interest if Abram had 
 kept to the rule of God's law instead of being 
 guided by her foolish projects; but we often 
 do ill for ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The inducement to it was Sarai's barrenness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Sarai bare Abram no children.</I> She was 
 very fair 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:14"><I>ch.</I> xii. 14</A>),
 was a very agreeable,
 dutiful wife, and a sharer with him in his 
 large possessions; and yet written childless. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) God dispenses his gifts variously, 
 loading us with benefits, but not overloading 
 us: some cross or other is appointed to be an 
 alloy to great enjoyments. 
 
 (2.) The mercy 
 of children is often given to the poor and 
 denied to the rich, given to the wicked and 
 denied to good people, though the rich have 
 most to leave them and good people would 
 take most care of their education. God does 
 herein as it has pleased him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She owned God's providence in this 
 affliction: <I>The Lord hath restrained me from 
 bearing.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) As, where children are, 
 it is God that gives them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 5</A>),
 so where they are wanted it is he that withholds 
 them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:2"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 2</A>.
 This evil is of the Lord. 
 
 (2.) It becomes us to acknowledge this, that 
 we may bear it, and improve it, as an affliction 
 of his ordering for wise and holy ends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She used this as an argument with 
 Abram to marry his maid; and he was prevailed 
 upon by this argument to do it. Note, 
 
 (1.) When our hearts are too much set upon 
 any creature-comfort, we are easily put upon 
 the use of indirect methods for the obtaining 
 of it. Inordinate desires commonly produce 
 irregular endeavours. If our wishes be not 
 kept in a submission to God's providence, 
 our pursuits will scarcely be kept under the 
 restraints of his precepts. 
 
 (2.) It is for want 
 of a firm dependence upon God's promise, 
 and a patient waiting for God's time, that we 
 go out of the way of our duty to catch at 
 expected mercy. <I>He that believes does not 
 make haste.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Abram's compliance with Sarai's proposal, 
 we have reason to think, was from an 
 earnest desire of the promised seed, on whom 
 the covenant should be entailed. God had 
 told him that his heir should be a son of his 
 body, but had not yet told him that it should 
 be a son by Sarai; therefore he thought, 
 "Why not by Hagar, since Sarai herself proposed 
 it?" Note, 
 
 (1.) Foul temptations may 
 have very fair pretences, and be coloured with 
 that which is very plausible. 
 
 (2.) Fleshly 
 wisdom, as it anticipates God's time of mercy, 
 so it puts us out of God's way. 
 
 (3.) This 
 would be happily prevented if we would ask 
 counsel of God by the word and by prayer, 
 before we attempt that which is important 
 and suspicious. Herein Abram was wanting; 
 he married without God's consent. <I>This 
 persuasion came not of him that called him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And he went in unto Hagar, and 
 she conceived: and when she saw 
 that she had conceived, her mistress 
 was despised in her eyes.
 &nbsp; 5 And 
 Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong <I>be</I> 
 upon thee: I have given my maid 
 into thy bosom; and when she saw 
 that she had conceived, I was despised 
 in her eyes: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> judge between 
 me and thee.
 &nbsp; 6 But Abram said 
 unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid <I>is</I> in 
 thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth 
 thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly 
 with her, she fled from her face.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the immediate bad consequences 
 of Abram's unhappy marriage to 
 Hagar. A great deal of mischief it made 
 quickly. When we do not well both sin and 
 trouble lie at the door; and we may thank 
 ourselves for the guilt and grief that follow 
 us when we go out of the way of our duty. 
 See it in this story.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Sarai is despised, and thereby provoked 
 and put into a passion,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 Hagar no 
 sooner perceives herself with child by her 
 master than she looks scornfully upon her 
 mistress, upbraids her perhaps with her barrenness, 
 insults over her, to make her to fret (as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:6">1 Sam. i. 6</A>),
 and boasts of the prospect 
 she had of bringing an heir to Abram, to 
 that good land, and to the promise. Now 
 she thinks herself a better woman than Sarai, 
 more favoured by Heaven, and likely to be 
 better beloved by Abram; and therefore she 
 will not submit as she has done. Note, 
 
 1. Mean and servile spirits, when favoured and 
 advanced either by God or man, are apt 
 to grow haughty and insolent, and to forget 
 their place and origin. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:21,Pr+30:21-23">Prov. xxix. 21; xxx. 21-23</A>.
 It is a hard thing to bear 
 honour aright. 
 
 2. We justly suffer by those 
 whom we have sinfully indulged, and it is a 

 <A NAME="Page107"> </A>

 righteous thing with God to make those instruments 
 of our trouble whom we have made 
 instruments of our sin, and to ensnare us in 
 our own evil counsels: this stone will return 
 upon him that rolleth it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abram is clamoured upon, and cannot 
 be easy while Sarai is out of humour; she 
 upbraids him vehemently, and very unjustly 
 charges him with the injury
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 <I>My wrong 
 be upon thee,</I> with a most unreasonable jealousy 
 suspecting that he countenanced Hagar's 
 insolence; and, as one not willing to hear 
 what Abram had to say for the rectifying of 
 the mistake and the clearing of himself, she 
 rashly appeals to God in the case: <I>The Lord 
 judge between me and thee;</I> as if Abram had 
 refused to right her. Thus does Sarai, in 
 her passion, speak <I>as one of the foolish women 
 speaketh.</I> Note, 
 
 1. It is an absurdity which 
 passionate people are often guilty of to quarrel 
 with others for that of which they themselves 
 must bear the blame. Sarai could not but 
 own that she had given her maid to Abram, 
 and yet she cries out, <I>My wrong be upon thee,</I> 
 when she should have said, <I>What a fool was 
 I to do so!</I> That is never said wisely which 
 pride and anger have the inditing of; when 
 passion is upon the throne, reason is out of 
 doors, and is neither heard nor spoken. 
 
 2. Those are not always in the right who are 
 most loud and forward in appealing to God. 
 Rash and bold imprecations are commonly 
 evidences of guilt and a bad cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Hagar is afflicted, and driven from the 
 house,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. Abram's meekness 
 resigns the matter of the maid-servant to 
 Sarai, whose proper province it was to rule 
 that part of the family: <I>Thy maid is in thy 
 hand.</I> Though she was his wife, he would 
 not countenance nor protect her in any thing 
 that was disrespectful to Sarai, for whom he 
 still retained the same affection that ever he 
 had. Note, Those who would keep up peace 
 and love must return soft answers to hard 
 accusations. Husbands and wives particularly 
 should agree, and endeavour not to be 
 both angry together. <I>Yielding pacifies great 
 offenses.</I> See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:1">Prov. xv. 1</A>.

 2. Sarai's passion 
 will be revenged upon Hagar: <I>She dealt 
 hardly with her,</I> not only confining her to her 
 usual place and work as a servant, but probably 
 making her to serve with rigour. 
 Note, God takes notice of, and is displeased 
 with, the hardships which harsh masters unreasonably 
 put upon their servants. They 
 ought to forbear threatening, with Job's 
 thought, <I>Did not he that made me make him?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:15">Job xxxi. 15</A>.

 3. Hagar's pride cannot bear 
 it, her high spirit having become impatient of 
 rebuke: <I>She fled from her face.</I> She not 
 only avoided her wrath for the present, as 
 David did Saul's, but she totally deserted 
 her service, and ran away from the house, 
 forgetting, 
 
 (1.) What wrong she hereby did 
 to her mistress, whose servant she was, and 
 to her master, whose wife she was. Note, 
 Pride will hardly be restrained by <I>any</I> bonds 
 of duty, no, not by <I>many.</I> 
 
 (2.) That she 
 herself had first given the provocation, by 
 despising her mistress. Note, Those that 
 suffer for their faults ought to bear their 
 sufferings patiently, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:20">1 Pet. ii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> found her 
 by a fountain of water in the wilderness, 
 by the fountain in the way 
 to Shur.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, Hagar, 
 Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? 
 and whither wilt thou go? And she 
 said, I flee from the face of my mistress 
 Sarai.
 &nbsp; 9 And the angel of the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto her, Return to thy
 mistress, and submit thyself under 
 her hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the first mention we have in scripture 
 of an angel's appearance. Hagar was a 
 type of the law, which was <I>given by the disposition 
 of angels; but the world to come is not 
 put in subjection to them,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5">Heb. ii. 5</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the angel arrested her in her flight,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 It should seem, she was making towards 
 her own country; for she was in the 
 way to Shur, which lay towards Egypt. It 
 were well if our afflictions would make us 
 think of our home, the better country. But
 Hagar was now out of her place, and out of 
 the way of her duty, and going further astray, 
 when the angel found her. Note, 
 
 1. It is a 
 great mercy to be stopped in a sinful way 
 either by conscience or by Providence. 
 
 2. God suffers those that are out of the way to 
 wander awhile, that when they see their folly, 
 and what a loss they have brought themselves 
 to, they may be the better disposed to return. 
 Hagar was not stopped till she was in the 
 wilderness, and had set down, weary enough, 
 and glad of clear water to refresh herself 
 with. God brings us into a wilderness, and 
 there meets us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">Hos. ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he examined her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He called her <I>Hagar, Sarai's maid,</I> 
 
 (1.) As a check to her pride. Though she was 
 Abram's wife, and, as such, was obliged to 
 return, yet he calls her <I>Sarai's maid,</I> to humble 
 her. Note, Though civility teaches us 
 to call others by their highest titles, yet humility 
 and wisdom teach us to call ourselves 
 by the lowest. 
 
 (2.) As a rebuke to her 
 flight. Sarai's maid ought to be in Sarai's 
 tent, and not wandering in the wilderness 
 and sauntering by a fountain of water. Note, 
 It is good for us often to call to mind what 
 our place and relation are. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4">Eccl. x. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The questions the angel put to her were 
 proper and very pertinent. 
 
 (1.) "<I>Whence 
 comest thou?</I> Consider that thou art running 
 away both from the duty thou wast 
 bound to and the privileges thou wast blessed 
 with in Abram's tent." Note, It is a great 
 advantage to live in a religious family, which 
 those ought to consider who have that advantage, 
 yet upon every slight inducement are 

 <A NAME="Page108"> </A>
 
 forward to quit it. 
 
 (2.) "<I>Whither wilt thou 
 go?</I> Thou art running thyself into sin, in 
 Egypt" (if she return to that people, she will 
 return to their gods), "and into danger, in 
 the wilderness," through which she must 
 travel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15">Deut. viii. 15</A>.
 Note, Those who are 
 forsaking God and their duty would do well 
 to remember not only <I>whence they have fallen,</I> 
 but <I>whither they are falling.</I> See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:18">Jer. ii. 18</A>,
 <I>What hast thou to do</I> (with Hagar) in the 
 way of Egypt? 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:68">John vi. 68</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Her answer was honest, and a fair confession: 
 <I>I flee from the face of my mistress.</I> 
 In this, 
 
 (1.) She acknowledges her fault in 
 fleeing from her mistress, and yet, 
 
 (2.) Excuses it, that it was <I>from the face,</I> of displeasure, 
 of her mistress. Note, Children 
 and servants must be treated with mildness 
 and gentleness, lest we provoke them to take 
 any irregular courses and so become accessory 
 to their sins, which will condemn us, 
 though it will not justify them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How he sent her back, with suitable 
 and compassionate counsel: "<I>Return to thy 
 mistress, and submit thyself under her hand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Go home, and humble thyself for 
 what thou hast done amiss, and beg pardon, 
 and resolve for the future to behave thyself 
 better." He makes no question but she 
 would be welcome, though it does not appear 
 that Abram sent after her. Note, Those that 
 have gone away from their place and duty, 
 when they are convinced of their error, must 
 hasten their return and reformation, how 
 mortifying soever it may be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may suppose that the angel having 
 given Hagar that good counsel
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 to <I>return to her mistress</I> she immediately promised 
 to do so, and was setting her face 
 homeward; and then the angel went on to 
 encourage her with an assurance of the mercy
 God had in store for her and her seed: for 
 God will meet those with mercy that are 
 returning to their duty. <I>I said, I will confess, 
 and thou forgavest,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>.
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A prediction concerning her posterity 
 given her for her comfort in her present 
 distress. Notice is taken of her condition: 
 <I>Behold, thou art with child;</I> and therefore 
 this is not a fit place for thee to be in. Note, 
 It is a great comfort to women with child to 
 think that they are under the particular cognizance 
 and care of the divine Providence. 
 God graciously considers their case and suits 
 supports to it. Now, 
 
 1. The angel assures 
 her of a safe delivery, and that of a <I>son,</I> which 
 Abram desired. This fright and ramble of 
 hers might have destroyed her hope of an 
 offspring; but God dealt not with her 
 according to her folly: <I>Thou shalt bear a son.</I> 
 She was saved in child-bearing, not only 
 by providence, but by promise. 
 
 2. He 
 names her child, which was an honour both 
 to her and it: Call him <I>Ishmael, God will 
 hear;</I> and the reason is, because the Lord has 
 heard; he has, and therefore he will. Note, 
 The experience we have had of God's seasonable 
 kindness to us in distress would 
 encourage us to hope for similar help in 
 similar exigencies, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>.
 He has <I>heard 
 thy affliction,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 Note, Even where 
 there is little cry of devotion, the God of 
 pity sometimes graciously hears the cry of 
 affliction. Tears speak as well as prayers. 
 This speaks comfort to the afflicted, that God 
 not only sees what their afflictions are, but 
 hears what they say. Note, further, Seasonable 
 succours, in a day of affliction, ought 
 always to be remembered with thankfulness 
 to God. Such a time, in such a strait, <I>the 
 Lord heard the voice of my affliction, and 
 helped me.</I> See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:7,Ps+31:22">Deut. xxvi. 7; Ps. xxxi. 22</A>.

 3. He promises her a numerous offspring,
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 <I>I will multiply thy seed exceedingly,</I> 
 Heb. <I>multiplying, I will multiply it,</I> that is, 
 multiply it in every age, so as to perpetuate 
 it. It is supposed that the Turks at this 
 day descend from Ishmael; and they are a 
 great people. This was in pursuance of the 
 promise made to Abram: <I>I will make thy seed 
 as the dust of the earth,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:16"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 16</A>.
 Note, 
 Many that are children of godly parents have, 
 for their sakes, a very large share of outward 
 common blessings, though, like Ishmael, 
 they are not taken into covenant: many are 
 multiplied that are not sanctified. 
 
 4. He 
 gives a character of the child she should bear, 
 which, however it may seem to us, perhaps 
 was not very disagreeable to her
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 <I>He will be a wild man; a wild ass of a man</I> (so the 
 word is), rude, and bold, and fearing no 
 man--untamed, untractable living at large, 
 and impatient of service and restraint. Note, 
 The children of the bondwoman, who are 
 out of covenant with God, are, as they were 
 born, like the wild ass's colt; it is grace that 
 reclaims men, civilizes them, and makes 
 them wise, and good for something. It is 
 foretold, 
 
 (1.) That he should live in strife, 

 <A NAME="Page109"> </A>
 
 and in a state of war: <I>His hand against every 
 man</I>--this is his <I>sin; and every man's hand 
 against him</I>--this is his <I>punishment.</I> Note, 
 Those that have turbulent spirits have commonly 
 troublesome lives; those that are 
 provoking, vexatious, and injurious to others, 
 must expect to be repaid in their own coin. 
 He that has his hand and tongue against 
 every man shall have every man's hand and 
 tongue against him, and he has no reason to 
 complain of it. And yet, 
 
 (2.) That he should 
 live in safety, and hold his own against all 
 the world: <I>He shall dwell in the presence of 
 all his brethren;</I> though threatened and 
 insulted by all his neighbours, yet he shall 
 keep his ground, and for Abram's sake, more 
 than his own, shall be able to make his part 
 good with them. Accordingly we read
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:18"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 18</A>),
 that he <I>died,</I> as he lived, <I>in the 
 presence of all his brethren.</I> Note, Many 
 that are much exposed by their own imprudence 
 are yet strangely preserved by the 
 divine Providence, so much better is God to 
 them than they deserve, when they not only 
 forfeit their lives by sin, but hazard them.</P>

 II. Hagar's pious reflection upon this gracious 
 appearance of God to her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 Observe in what she said,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her awful adoration of God's omniscience 
 and providence, with application of 
 it to herself: <I>She called the name of the Lord 
 that spoke unto her,</I> that is, thus she made 
 confession of his name, this she said to his 
 praise, <I>Thou God seest me:</I> this should be, 
 with her, his name for ever, and this his 
 memorial, by which she will know him and 
 remember him while she lives, <I>Thou God 
 seest me.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) The God with whom 
 we have to do is a seeing God, and all-seeing 
 God. <I>God is</I> (as the ancients express it) 
 <I>all eye.</I> 
 
 (2.) We ought to acknowledge this 
 with application to ourselves. He that sees 
 all sees me, as David 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:1">Ps. cxxxix. 1</A>),
 <I>O Lord, 
 thou hast searched me, and known me.</I> 
 
 (3.) A 
 believing regard to God, as a God that sees 
 us, will be of great use to us in our returns 
 to him. It is a proper word for a penitent:--
 
 [1.] "Thou seest my sin and folly." I have 
 <I>sinned before thee,</I> says the prodigal; <I>in thy 
 sight,</I> says David. 
 
 [2.] "Thou seest my 
 sorrow and affliction;" this Hagar especially 
 refers to. When we have brought ourselves 
 into distress by our own folly, yet God has 
 not forsaken us. 
 
 [3.] "Thou seest the sincerity 
 and seriousness of my return and repentance. 
 Thou seest my secret mournings 
 for sin, and secret motions towards thee." 
 
 [4.] "Thou seest me, if in any instance I 
 depart from thee," 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:20,21">Ps. xliv. 20, 21</A>.
 This thought should always restrain us from sin 
 and excite us to duty: <I>Thou God seest me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Her humble admiration of God's favour 
 to her: "<I>Have I here also looked after him 
 that seeth me?</I> Have I here <I>seen the back 
 parts</I> of him that seeth me?" so it might be 
 read, for the word is much the same with 
 that, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:23">Exod. xxxiii. 23</A>.
 She saw not <I>face to 
 face,</I> but as <I>through a glass darkly,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</A>.
 Probably she knew not who it was 
 that talked with her, till he was departing (as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:21,22,13:21">Judg. vi. 21, 22; xiii. 21</A>),
 and then she 
 looked after him, with a reflection like that of 
 the two disciples, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:31,32">Luke xxiv. 31, 32</A>.
 Or, <I>Have I here seen him that sees me?</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) The communion which holy souls have 
 with God consists in their having an eye of 
 faith towards him, as a God that has an eye 
 of favour towards them. The intercourse is 
 kept up by the eye. 
 
 (2.) The privilege of 
 our communion with God is to be looked 
 upon with wonder and admiration, 
 
 [1.] Considering 
 what we are who are admitted to 
 this favour. "Have I? I that am so mean, 
 I that am so vile?" 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:18">2 Sam. vii. 18</A>.

 [2.] Considering the place where we are thus 
 favoured--"<I>here</I> also? Not only in Abram's 
 tent and at his altar, but <I>here</I> also, in this 
 wilderness? Here, where I never expected 
 it, where I was out of the way of my duty? 
 <I>Lord, how is it?</I>" 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">John xiv. 22</A>.
 Some make 
 the answer to this question to be negative, 
 and so look upon it as a penitent reflection: 
 "<I>Have I here also,</I> in my distress and affliction, 
 <I>looked after God?</I> No, I was as careless
 and unmindful of him as ever I used to 
 be; and yet he has thus visited and regarded 
 me:" for God often anticipates us with his 
 favours, and is found of those that seek him 
 not, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The name which this gave to the 
 place: <I>Beer-lahai-roi, The well of him that 
 liveth and seeth me,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 It is probable 
 that Hagar put this name upon it; and it 
 was retained long after, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--a 
 lasting memorial of this event.</I> 
 This was a place where the God of glory 
 manifested the special cognizance and care 
 he took of a poor woman in distress. Note, 
 
 1. He that is all-seeing is ever-living; he 
 lives and sees us. 
 
 2. Those that are graciously 
 admitted into communion with God, 
 and receive seasonable comforts from him, 
 should tell others what he has done for their 
 souls, that they also may be encouraged to 
 seek him and trust in him. 
 
 3. God's gracious 
 manifestations of himself to us are to
 be had in everlasting remembrance by us, 
 and should never be forgotten.</P>

 It is here taken for granted, though not 
 expressly recorded, that Hagar did as the 
 angel commanded her, returning to her mistress
 and submitting herself; and then, in 
 the fulness of time, she brought forth her 
 son. Note, Those who obey divine precepts
 shall have the comfort of divine promises. 
 This was the son of the bond-woman that 
 was <I>born after the flesh</I>

 Note,
 
 1. Many who can call Abraham father are 
 yet <I>born after the flesh,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9">Matt. iii. 9</A>.
 
 2. The 
 carnal seed in the church are sooner brought 
 forth than the spiritual. It is an easier thing 
 to persuade men to assume the form of godliness 
 than to submit to the power of godliness.</P>
