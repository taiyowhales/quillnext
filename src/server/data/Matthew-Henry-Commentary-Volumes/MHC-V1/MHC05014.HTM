 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Ye <I>are</I> the children of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God: ye shall not cut
 yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
 &nbsp; 2 For thou <I>art</I> a holy people unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above
 all the nations that <I>are</I> upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
 &nbsp; 4 These <I>are</I> the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
 and the goat,
 &nbsp; 5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
 goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
 &nbsp; 6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
 into two claws, <I>and</I> cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
 shall eat.
 &nbsp; 7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the
 cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; <I>as</I> the camel, and
 the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not
 the hoof; <I>therefore</I> they <I>are</I> unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
 the cud, it <I>is</I> unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
 flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.
 &nbsp; 9 These ye shall eat of all that <I>are</I> in the waters: all that
 have fins and scales shall ye eat:
 &nbsp; 10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it
 <I>is</I> unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 11 <I>Of</I> all clean birds ye shall eat.
 &nbsp; 12 But these <I>are they</I> of which ye shall not eat: the eagle,
 and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
 &nbsp; 13 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,
 &nbsp; 14 And every raven after his kind,
 &nbsp; 15 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the
 hawk after his kind,
 &nbsp; 16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
 &nbsp; 17 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,
 &nbsp; 18 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the
 lapwing, and the bat.
 &nbsp; 19 And every creeping thing that flieth <I>is</I> unclean unto you:
 they shall not be eaten.
 &nbsp; 20 <I>But of</I> all clean fowls ye may eat.
 &nbsp; 21 Ye shall not eat <I>of</I> any thing that dieth of itself: thou
 shalt give it unto the stranger that <I>is</I> in thy gates, that he
 may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou <I>art</I>
 a holy people unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
 in his mother's milk.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses here tells the people of Israel,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God had dignified them, as a peculiar people, with three 
 distinguishing privileges, which were their honour, and figures of 
 those spiritual blessings in heavenly things with which God has in 
 Christ blessed us. 

 1. Here is election: <I>The Lord hath chosen thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Not for their own merit, nor for any good works foreseen, but because
 he would magnify the riches of his power and grace among them. He did 
 not choose them because they were by their own dedication and 
 subjection a peculiar people to him above other nations, but he chose 
 them that they might be so by his grace; and thus were believers 
 chosen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4">Eph. i. 4</A>.

 2.  Here is adoption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>You are the children of the Lord your God,</I> formed by him into a
 people, owned by him as his people, nay, his family, <I>a people near 
 unto him,</I> nearer than any other." <I>Israel is my son, my 
 first-born;</I> not because he needed children, but because they were 
 orphans, and needed a father. Every Israelite is indeed a child of God, 
 a partaker of his nature and favour, his love and blessing <I>Behold 
 what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us!</I> 

 3. Here is sanctification

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou art a holy people,</I> separated and set apart for God,
 devoted to his service, designed for his praise, governed by a holy 
 law, graced by a holy tabernacle, and the holy ordinances relating to 
 it." God's people are under the strongest obligations to be holy, and, 
 if they are holy, are indebted to the grace of God that makes them so. 
 The Lord has set them apart for himself, and qualified them for his 
 service and the enjoyment of him, and so has made them holy to 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they ought to distinguish themselves by a sober singularity 
 from all the nations that were about them. And, God having thus 
 advanced them, let not them debase themselves by admitting the 
 superstitious customs of idolaters, and, by making themselves like 
 them, put themselves upon the level with them. <I>Be you the children 
 of the Lord your God;</I> so the Seventy read it, as a command, that 
 is, "Carry yourselves as becomes the children of God, and do nothing to 
 disgrace the honour and forfeit the privileges of the relation." In two 
 things particularly they must distinguish themselves:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In their mourning: <I>You shall not cut yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This forbids (as some think), not only their cutting themselves at
 their funerals, either to express their grief or with their own blood 
 to appease the infernal deities, but their wounding and mangling 
 themselves in the worship of their gods, as Baal's prophets did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:28">1 Kings xviii. 28</A>),

 or their marking themselves by incisions in their flesh for such and
 such deities, which in them, above any, would be an inexcusable crime, 
 who in the sign of circumcision bore about with them in their bodies 
 the marks of the Lord Jehovah. So that, 

 (1.) They are forbidden to deform or hurt their own bodies upon any 
 account. Methinks this is like a parent's change to his little 
 children, that are foolish, careless, and wilful, and are apt to play 
 with knives: <I>Children, you shall not cut yourselves.</I> This is the 
 intention of those commands which oblige us to deny ourselves; the true 
 meaning of them, if we understood them aright, would appear to be, 
 <I>Do yourselves no harm.</I> And this also is the design of those 
 providences which most cross us, to remove from us those things by 
 which we are in danger of doing ourselves harm.  Knives are taken from 
 us, lest we should cut ourselves. Those that are dedicated to God as a 
 holy people must do nothing to disfigure themselves; the body is for 
 the Lord, and is to be used accordingly.

 (2.) They are forbidden to disturb and afflict their own minds with
 inordinate grief for the loss of near and dear relations: "You shall 
 not express or exasperate you sorrow, even upon the most mournful 
 occasions, by cutting yourselves, and making baldness between your 
 eyes, like men enraged, or resolvedly hardened in sorrow for the dead, 
 as those that have no hope,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1 Thess. iv. 13</A>.

 It is an excellent passage which Mr. Ainsworth here quotes from one of
 the Jewish writers, who understands this as a law against immoderate 
 grief for the death of our relations. <I>If your father</I> (for 
 instance) <I>die, you shall not cut yourselves,</I> that is, <I>you 
 shall not sorrow more than is meet, for you are not fatherless, you 
 have a Father, who is great, living, and permanent, even the holy 
 blessed God,</I> whose children you are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>But an infidel</I> (says he), <I>when his father dies, hath no
 father that can help him in time of need; for he hath said to a stock, 
 Thou art my father, and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:27">Jer. ii. 27</A>);

 <I>therefore he weeps, cuts himself, and makes himself bald.</I> We
 that have a God to hope in, and a heaven to hope for, must bear up 
 ourselves with that hope under every burden of this kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must be singular in their meat. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Many sorts of flesh which were wholesome enough, and which other 
 people did commonly eat, they must religiously abstain from as unclean. 
 This law we had before 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:2">Lev. xi. 2</A>,

 where it was largely opened. It seems plainly, by the connection here,
 to be intended as a mark of peculiarity; for their observance of it 
 would cause them to be taken notice of in all mixed companies as a 
 separate people, and would preserve them from mingling themselves with, 
 and conforming themselves to, their idolatrous neighbours.

 [1.] Concerning beasts, here is a more particular enumeration of those
 which they were allowed to eat then was in Leviticus, to show that they 
 had no reason to complain of their being restrained from eating swines' 
 flesh, and hares, and rabbits (which were all that were then forbidden, 
 but are now commonly used), when they were allowed so great a variety, 
 not only of that which we call butcher's meat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 which alone was offered in sacrifice, but of venison, which they had
 great plenty of in Canaan, <I>the hart, and the roe-buck, and the 
 fallow deer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 which, though never brought to God's altar, was allowed them at their
 own table. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:22"><I>ch.</I> xii. 22</A>.

 When of all these (as Adam of <I>every tree of the garden</I>) they
 might freely eat, those were inexcusable who, to gratify a perverse 
 appetite, or (as should seem) in honour of their idols, and in 
 participation of their idolatrous sacrifices, <I>ate swines' flesh, and 
 had broth of abominable things</I> (made so by this law) <I>in their 
 vessels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:4">Isa. lxv. 4</A>.

 [2.] Concerning fish there is only one general rule given, that
 whatsoever had not fins and scales (as shell-fish and eels, besides 
 leeches and other animals in the water that are not proper food) was 
 <I>unclean and forbidden,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 [3.] No general rule is given concerning fowl, but those are
 particularly mentioned that were to be unclean to them, and there are 
 few or none of them which are here forbidden that are now commonly 
 eaten; and whatsoever is not expressly forbidden is allowed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:11-20"><I>v.</I> 11-20</A>.
 
 <I>Of all clean fowls you may eat.</I>

 [4.] They are further forbidden, <I>First,</I> To eat the flesh of any
 creature that died of itself, because the blood was not separated from 
 it, and, besides the ceremonial uncleanness which it lay under (from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:39">Lev. xi. 39</A>),

 it is not wholesome food, nor ordinarily used among us, except by the
 poor.  <I>Secondly,</I> To <I>seethe a kid in its mother's milk,</I> 
 either to gratify their own luxury, supposing it a dainty bit, or in 
 conformity to some superstitious custom of the heathen. The Chaldee 
 paraphrasts read it, <I>Thou shalt not eat flesh--meats and milk--meats 
 together;</I> and so it would forbid the use of butter as sauce to any 
 flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now as to all these precepts concerning their food, 

 [1.] It is plain in the law itself that they belonged only to the Jews,
 and were not moral, nor of perpetual use, because not of universal 
 obligation; for what they might not eat themselves they might give to a 
 stranger, a proselyte of the gate, that had renounced idolatry, and 
 therefore was permitted to live among them, though not circumcised; or 
 they might sell it to an alien, a mere Gentile, that came into their 
 country for trade, but might not settle it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They might feed upon that which an Israelite might not touch, which is
 a plain instance of their peculiarity, and their being a holy people. 
 
 [2.] It is plain in the gospel that they are now antiquated and
 repealed. For <I>every creature of God is good, and nothing now to be 
 refused,</I> or <I>called common and unclean,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that

 lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong
 drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat
 there before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and
 thine household,
 &nbsp; 27 And the Levite that <I>is</I> within thy gates; thou shalt not
 forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
 &nbsp; 28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the
 tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay <I>it</I> up
 within thy gates:
 &nbsp; 29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance
 with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
 which <I>are</I> within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
 satisfied; that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God may bless thee in all the work
 of thine hand which thou doest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a part of the statute concerning tithes. The productions 
 of the ground were twice tithed, so that, putting both together, a 
 fifth part was devoted to God out of their increase, and only four 
 parts of five were for their own common use; and they could not but own 
 they paid an easy rent, especially since God's part was disposed of to 
 their own benefit and advantage. The first tithe was for the 
 maintenance of their Levites, who taught them the good knowledge of 
 God, and ministered to them in holy things; this is supposed as 
 anciently due, and is entailed upon the Levites as an inheritance, by 
 that law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:24">Num. xviii. 24</A>,

 &c. But it is the second tithe that is here spoken of, which was to be
 taken out of the remainder when the Levites had had theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are here charged to separate it, and set it apart for God: 
 <I>Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of they seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The Levites took care of their own, but the separating of this was left
 to the owners themselves, the law encouraging them to be honest by 
 reposing a confidence in them, and so trying their fear of God. They 
 are commanded to tithe <I>truly,</I> that is, to be sure to do it, and 
 to do it faithfully and carefully, that God's part might not be 
 diminished either with design or by oversight. Note, We must be sure to 
 give God his full dues out of our estates; for, being but stewards of 
 them, it is required that we be faithful, as those that must give 
 account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are here directed how to dispose of it when they had separated 
 it. Let every man lay by as God prospers him and gives him success, and 
 then let him lay out in pious uses as God gives him opportunity; and it 
 will be the easier to lay out, and the proportion will be more 
 satisfying, when first we have laid by. This second tithe may be 
 disposed of,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In works of piety, for the first two years after the year of 
 release. They must bring it up, either in kind or in the full value of 
 it, to the place of the sanctuary, and there must spend it in holy 
 feasting before the Lord. If they could do it with any convenience, 
 they must bring it in kind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 but, if not, they might turn it into money

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>),

 and that money must be laid out in something to feast upon before the
 Lord. The comfortable cheerful using of what God has given us, with 
 temperance and sobriety, is really the honouring of God with it. 
 Contentment, holy joy, and thankfulness, make every meal a religious 
 feast. The end of this law we have

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>That thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always;</I> it was
 to keep them right and firm to their religion,

 (1.) By acquainting them with the sanctuary, the holy things, and the
 solemn services that were there performed. What they read the 
 appointment of their Bibles, it would do them good to see the 
 observance of in the tabernacle; it would make a deeper impression upon 
 them, which would keep them out of the snares of the idolatrous 
 customs. Note, It will have a good influence upon our constancy in 
 religion <I>never to forsake the assembling of ourselves together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:25">Heb. x. 25</A>.

 By the comfort of the communion of saints, we may be kept to our
 communion with God.

 (2.) By using them to the most pleasant and delightful services of
 religion. Let them <I>rejoice before the Lord, that they may learn to 
 fear him always.</I> The more pleasure we find in the ways of religion 
 the more likely we shall be to persevere in those ways. One thing they 
 must remember in their pious entertainments--to bid their Levites 
 welcome to them. Thou shalt not <I>forsake the Levites</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "Let him never be a stranger to thy table, especially when thou eatest
 before the Lord."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Every third year this tithe must be disposed of at home in works of 
 charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>):

 <I>Lay it up within they own gates,</I> and let it be given to the
 poor, who, knowing the provision this law had made for them, no doubt 
 would come to seek it; and, that they might make the poor familiar to 
 them and not disdain their company, they are here directed to welcome 
 them to their houses. "Thither let them come, and eat and be 
 satisfied." In this charitable distribution of the second tithe they 
 must have an eye to the poor ministers and add to their encouragement 
 by entertaining them, then to poor strangers (not only for the supply 
 of their necessities, but to put a respect upon them, and so to invite 
 them to turn proselytes), and then to the fatherless and widow, who, 
 though perhaps they might have a competent maintenance left them, yet 
 could not be supposed to live so plentifully and comfortably as they 
 had done in months past, and therefore they were to countenance them, 
 and help to make them easy by inviting them to this entertainment. God 
 has a particular care for widows and fatherless, and he requires that 
 we should have the same. It is his honour, and will be ours, to help 
 the helpless. And if we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, 
 it is promised here that the Lord our God will <I>bless us in all the 
 work of our hand.</I> Note,

 (1.) The blessing of God is all in all to our outward prosperity, and,
 without that blessing, the work of our hands which we do will bring 
 nothing to pass.

 (2.) The way to obtain that blessing is to be diligent and charitable.
 The blessing descends upon the working hand: "Except not that God 
 should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease, but in all the work 
 of they hand." It is the hand of the diligent, with the blessing of God 
 upon it, that makes rich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:4,22">Prov. x. 4, 22</A>.

 And it descends upon the giving hand; he that thus scatters certainly
 increases, and the liberal soul will be made fat. It is an undoubted 
 truth, though little believed, that to be charitable to the poor, and 
 to be free and generous in the support of religion and any good work, 
 is the surest and safest way of thriving.  What is lent to the Lord 
 will be repaid with abundant interest. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:30">Ezek. xliv. 30</A>.</P>
