 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Interpreters are not agreed what is here meant by <I>entering into the 
 congregation of the Lord,</I> which is here forbidden to eunuchs and to 
 bastards, Ammonites and Moabites, for ever, but to Edomites and 
 Egyptians only till the third generation.  

 1.  Some think they are hereby excluded from communicating with the
 people of God in their religious services. Though eunuchs and bastards 
 were owned as members of the church, and the Ammonites and Moabites 
 might be circumcised and proselyted to the Jewish religion, yet they 
 and their families must lie for some time under marks of disgrace, 
 remembering the rock whence they were hewn, and must not come so near 
 the sanctuary as others might, nor have so free a communion with 
 Israelites. 

 2. Others think they are hereby excluded from bearing office in the
 congregation: none of these must be elders or judges, lest the honour 
 of the magistracy should thereby be stained. 

 3. Others think they are excluded only from marrying with Israelites.
 Thus the learned bishop Patrick inclines to understand it; yet we find 
 that when this law was put in execution after the captivity they 
 separated from Israel, not only the strange wives, but all the mixed 
 multitude, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1-2">Neh. xiii. 1-2</A>.
 
 With the daughters of these nations (though out of the nations of
 Canaan), it should seem, the men of Israel might marry, if they were 
 completely proselyted to the Jewish religion; but with the men of these 
 nations the daughters of Israel might not marry, nor could the men be 
 naturalized otherwise than as here provided.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is plain, in general, that disgrace is here put,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Upon bastards and eunuchs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 By bastards here the Jewish writers understand, not all that were born
 of fornication, or out of marriage, but all the issue of those 
 incestuous mixtures which are forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:1-30">Lev. xviii</A>.

 And, though it was not the fault of the issue, yet, to deter people
 from those unlawful marriages and unlawful lusts, it was very 
 convenient that their posterity should thus be made infamous.  By this 
 rule Jephthah, though the son of a harlot, a strange woman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:1,2">Judg. xi. 1, 2</A>),

 yet was not a bastard in the sense of this law. And as for the eunuchs,
 though by this law they seemed to be cast out of the vineyard as dry 
 trees, which they complain of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3">Isa. lvi. 3</A>),
 
 yet it is here promised
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 that if they took care of their duty to God, as far as they were
 admitted, by keeping his sabbaths and choosing the things that pleased 
 him, the want of this privilege should be made up to them with such 
 spiritual blessings as would entitle them to an everlasting name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Upon Ammonites and Moabites, the posterity of Lot, who, for his 
 outward convenience, had separated himself from Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:11">Gen. xiii. 11</A>.
 
 And we do not find that he or his ever joined themselves again to the
 children of the covenant. They are here cut off <I>to the tenth 
 generation,</I> that is, (as some think it is explained), for ever. 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1">Neh. xiii. 1</A>.

 The reason of this quarrel which Israel must have with them, so as not
 to <I>seek their peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 is because of the unkindness they had now lately done to the camp of
 Israel, notwithstanding the orders God had given not to distress or vex 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9,19"><I>ch.</I> ii. 9, 19</A>.

 1. It was bad enough that they did not <I>meet them with bread and
 water in the way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that they did not as allies, or at least as neutral states, bring
 victuals into their camp, which they should have been duly paid for. It 
 was well that God's Israel did not need their kindness, God himself 
 following them with bread and water.  However this omission of the 
 Ammonites should be remembered against their nation in future ages. 
 Note, God will certainly reckon, not only with those that oppose his 
 people, but with those that do not help and further them, when it is in 
 the power of their hand to do it. The charge at the great day is for an 
 omission: <I>I was hungry, and you gave me no meat.</I> 

 2. The Moabites had done worse, they hired Balaam to curse Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It is true <I>God turned the curse into a blessing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not only changing the word in Balaam's mouth, but making that really
 turn to the honour and advantage of Israel which was designed for their 
 ruin. But though the design was defeated, and overruled for good, the 
 Moabites' wickedness was not the less provoking. God will deal with 
 sinners, but according to their endeavours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:4">Ps. xxviii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Edomites and Egyptians had not so deep a mark of displeasure 
 put upon them as the Moabites and Ammonites had. If an Edomite or 
 Egyptian turned proselyte, his grand-children should be looked upon as 
 members of the congregation of the Lord to all intents and purposes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 We should think that the Edomites had been more injurious to the
 Israelites than the Ammonites, and deserved as little favour from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:20">Num. xx. 20</A>),

 and yet "<I>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite,</I> as thou must an
 Ammonite, for he is thy brother." Note, The unkindness of near 
 relations, though by many worst taken, yet should with us, for that 
 reason, because of the relation, be first forgiven. And then, as to the 
 Egyptians, here is a strange reason given why they must not be 
 abhorred: "<I>Thou wast a stranger in their land,</I> and therefore, 
 though hardly used there, be civil to them, for old acquaintance' 
 sake." They must not remember their bondage in Egypt for the keeping up 
 of any ill will to the Egyptians, but only for the magnifying of Gods 
 power and goodness in their deliverance.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
 thee from every wicked thing.
 &nbsp; 10 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason
 of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
 abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
 &nbsp; 11 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash
 <I>himself</I> with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come
 into the camp <I>again.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
 shalt go forth abroad:
 &nbsp; 13 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall
 be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
 and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:
 &nbsp; 14 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
 deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore
 shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and
 turn away from thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Israel was now encamped, and this vast army was just entering upon 
 action, which was likely to keep them together for a long time, and 
 therefore it was fit to give them particular directions for the good 
 ordering of their camp. And the charge is in one word to be 
 <I>clean.</I> They must take care to keep their camp pure from moral, 
 ceremonial, and natural pollution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From moral pollution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>When the host goes forth against thy enemy</I> then look upon
 thyself as in a special manner engaged to <I>keep thyself from every 
 evil thing.</I> 

 1. The soldiers themselves must take heed of sin, for sin takes off the
 edge of valour; guilt makes men cowards. Those that put their lives in 
 their hands are concerned to make and keep their peace with God, and 
 preserve a conscience void of offence; then may they look death in the 
 face without terror. Soldiers, in executing their commission, must keep 
 themselves from gratifying the lusts of malice, covetousness, or 
 uncleanness, for these are wicked things--must keep themselves from the 
 idols, or accursed things, they found in the camps they plundered. 

 2.  Even those that tarried at home, the body of the people, and every
 particular person, must at that time especially keep from every wicked 
 thing, lest by sin they provoke God to withdraw his presence from the 
 host, and give victory to the enemy for the correcting of his own 
 people. Times of war should be times of reformation, else how can we 
 expect God should hear and answer our prayers for success? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:3">1 Sam. vii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From ceremonial pollution, which might befal a person when 
 unconscious of it, for which he was bound to wash his flesh in water, 
 and look upon himself as <I>unclean until the evening,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+15:16">Lev. xv. 16</A>.
 
 A soldier, notwithstanding the constant service and duty he had to do
 in the camp, must be so far from looking upon himself as discharged 
 from the observance of this ceremony that more was required from him 
 than at another time; had he been at his own house, he needed only to 
 wash his flesh, but, being in the army, he must go abroad out of the 
 camp, as one concerned to keep it pure and ashamed of his own impurity, 
 and not return till after sunset, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 By this trouble and reproach, which even involuntary pollutions exposed
 men to, they were taught to keep up a very great dread of all fleshly 
 lusts. It were well if military men would consider this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From natural pollution; the camp of the Lord must have nothing 
 offensive in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 It is strange that the divine law, or at least the solemn order and
 direction of Moses, should extend to a thing of this nature; but the 
 design of it was to teach them,

 1. Modesty and decorum; nature itself teaches them thus to distinguish
 themselves from beasts that know no shame. 

 2. Cleanliness, and, though not niceness, yet neatness, even in their
 camp. Filthiness is offensive to the senses God has endued us with, 
 prejudicial to the health, a wrong to the comfort of human life, and an 
 evidence of a careless slothful temper of mind. 

 3. Purity from the pollutions of sin; if there must be this care taken
 to preserve the body clean and sweet, much more should we be solicitous 
 to keep the mind so. 

 4. A reverence of the divine majesty.  This is the reason here given:
 <I>For the Lord thy God walketh</I> by his ark, the special token of 
 his presence, <I>in the midst of thy camp;</I> with respect to that 
 external symbol this external purity is required, which (though not 
 insisted on in the letter when that reason ceases) teaches us to 
 preserve inward purity of soul, in consideration of the eye of God, 
 which is always upon us. By this expression of respect to the presence 
 of God among them, they were taught both to fortify themselves against 
 sin and to encourage themselves against their enemies with the 
 consideration of that presence. 

 5. A regard one to another. The filthiness of one is noisome to many;
 this law of cleanliness therefore teaches us not to do that which will 
 be justly offensive to our brethren and grieve them. It is a law 
 against nuisances.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Orders are here given about five several things which have no relation 
 one to another:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The land of Israel is here made a sanctuary, or city of refuge, for 
 servants that were wronged and abused by their masters, and fled 
 thither for shelter from the neighbouring countries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 We cannot suppose that they were hereby obliged to give entertainment
 to all the unprincipled men that ran from service; Israel needed not 
 (as Rome at first did) to be thus peopled. But,

 1. They must not deliver up the trembling servant to his enraged
 master, till upon trial it appeared that the servant has wronged his 
 master and was justly liable to punishment. Note, It is an honourable 
 thing to shelter and protect the weak, provided they be not wicked. God 
 allows his people to patronise the oppressed. The angel bid Hagar 
 return to her mistress, and Paul sent Onesimus back to his master 
 Philemon, because they had neither of them any cause to go away, nor 
 was either of them exposed to any danger in returning. But the servant 
 here is supposed to escape, that is, to run for his life, to the people 
 of Israel, of whom he had heard (as Benhadad of the kings of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:31">1 Kings xx. 31</A>)

 that they were a merciful people, to save himself from the fury of a
 tyrant; and in that case to deliver him up is to throw a lamb into the 
 mouth of a lion. 

 2. If it appeared that the servant was abused, they must not only
 protect him, but, supposing him willing to embrace their religion, they 
 must give him all the encouragement that might be to settle among them.  
 Care is taken both that he should not be imposed up on in the place of 
 his settlement--let it be <I>that which he shall choose</I> and 
 <I>where it liketh him best,</I> and that he should not exchange one 
 hard master for many--<I>thou shalt not oppress him.</I> Thus would he 
 soon find a comfortable difference between the land of Israel and other 
 lands, and would choose it to be his rest for ever.  Note, Proselytes 
 and converts to the truth should be treated with particular tenderness, 
 that they may have no temptation to return.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The land of Israel must be no shelter for the unclean; no whore, no 
 Sodomite, must be suffered to live among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 neither a whore nor a whoremonger. No houses of uncleanness must be
 kept either by men or women. Here is, 

 1. A good reason intimated why there should be no such wickedness
 tolerated among them: they were Israelites. This seems to have an 
 emphasis laid upon it. For a daughter of Israel to be a whore, or a son 
 of Israel a whoremaster, is to reproach the stock they are come of, the 
 people they belong to, and the God they worship.  It is bad in any, but 
 worst in Israelites, a holy nation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:12">2 Sam. xiii. 12</A>.
 
 2. A just mark of displeasure put upon this wickedness, that the hire
 of a whore, that is, the money she gets by her whoring, and the price 
 of a dog, that is, of the Sodomite, pimp, or whoremaster (so I incline 
 to understand it, for such are called <I>dogs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15">Rev. xxii. 15</A>),

 the money he gets by his lewd and villainous practices, no part of it
 shall be <I>brought into the house of the Lord</I> (as the hire of 
 prostitutes among the Gentiles was into their temples) <I>for any 
 vow.</I> This intimates,

 (1.) That God would not accept of any offering at all from such wicked
 people; they had nothing to bring an offering of but what they got by 
 their wickedness, and therefore their sacrifice could not but be <I>an 
 abomination to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 (2.) That they should not think, by making and paying vows, and
 bringing offerings to the Lord, to obtain leave to go on in this sin, 
 as (it should seem) some that followed that trade suggested to 
 themselves, when their offerings were admitted. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:14,15">Prov. vii. 14, 15</A>,

 <I>This day have I paid my vows, therefore came I forth to meet
 thee.</I> Nothing should be accepted in commutation of penance.

 (3.) That we cannot honour God with our substance unless it be honestly
 and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, 
 but how we got it; God hates robbery for burnt-offerings, and 
 uncleanness too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The matter of usury is here settled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 (1.) They must not lend upon usury to an Israelite. They had and held
 their estates immediately from and under God, who, while he 
 distinguished them from all other people, might have ordered, had he so 
 pleased, that they should have all things in common among themselves; 
 but instead of that, and in token of their joint interest in the good 
 land he had given them, he only appointed them, as there was occasion, 
 to lend to one another without interest, which among them would be 
 little or no loss to the lender, because their land was so divided, 
 their estates were so settled, and there was so little of merchandise 
 among them, that it was seldom or never that they had occasion to 
 borrow any great sums, only what was necessary for the subsistence of 
 their families when the fruits of their ground had met with any 
 disaster, or the like; and, in such a case, for a small matter to 
 insist upon usury would have been very barbarous. Where the borrower 
 gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share in the 
 gain; but to him that borrows for his necessary food pity must be 
 shown, and we must lend, hoping for nothing again, if we have 
 wherewithal to do it,

 (2.) They might lend upon usury to a stranger, who was supposed to live
 by trade, and (as we say) by turning the penny, and therefore got by 
 what he borrowed, and came among them in hopes to do so. By this it 
 appears that usury is not in itself oppressive; for they must not 
 oppress a stranger, and yet might exact usury from him.</P>

 IV. The performance of the vows wherewith we have bound our souls is 
 here required; and it is a branch of the law of nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>.

 (1.) We are here left at our liberty whether we will make vows or no:
 <I>If thou shalt forbear to vow</I> (some particular sacrifice and 
 offering, more than was commanded by the law), <I>it shall be no sin to 
 thee.</I> God had already signified his readiness to accept a free-will 
 offering thus vowed, though it were but a little fine flour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:4-7">Lev. ii. 4</A>,

 &c.),
 which was encouragement enough to those who were so inclined. But lest 
 the priests, who had the largest share of those vows and voluntary 
 offerings, should sponge upon the people, by pressing it upon them as 
 their duty to make such vows, beyond their ability and inclination, 
 they are here expressly told that it should not be reckoned a sin in 
 them if they did not make any such vows, as it would be if they omitted 
 any of the sacrifices that God had particularly required. For (as 
 bishop Patrick well expresses it) God would have men to be easy in his 
 service, and all their offerings to be free and cheerful. 

 (2.) We are here laid under the highest obligations, when we have made
 a vow, to perform it, and to perform it speedily: "<I>Thou shalt not be 
 slack to pay it,</I> lest if it be delayed beyond the first opportunity 
 the zeal abate, the vow be forgotten, or something happen to disable 
 thee for the performance of it. <I>That which has gone out of thy 
 lips</I> as a solemn and deliberate vow must not be recalled, but 
 <I>thou shalt keep and perform it,</I> punctually and fully." The rule 
 of the gospel goes somewhat further than this.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7">2 Cor. ix. 7</A>,

 <I>Every one, according as he purposeth in his heart,</I> though it
 have not gone out of his lips, <I>so let him give.</I> Here is a good 
 reason why we should pay our vows, that if we do not <I>God will 
 require it of us,</I> will surely and severely reckon with us, not only 
 for lying, but for going about to mock him, who cannot be mocked. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:4">Eccl. v. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Allowance is here given, when they passed through a cornfield or 
 vineyard, to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the 
 road-side, whether it was done for necessity or delight, only they must 
 carry none away with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Therefore the disciples were not censured for plucking the ears of corn
 (it was well enough known that the law allowed it), but for doing it on 
 the sabbath day, which the tradition of the elders had forbidden. Now,

 1. This law intimated to them what great plenty of corn and wine they
 should have in Canaan, so much that a little would not be missed out of 
 their fruits: they should have enough for themselves and all their 
 friends. 

 2. It provided for the support of poor travellers, to relieve the
 fatigue of their journey, and teaches us to be kind to such. The Jews 
 say, "This law was chiefly intended in favour of labourers, who were 
 employed in gathering in their harvest and vintage; their mouths must 
 not be muzzled any more than that of the ox when he treads out the 
 corn." 

 3. It teaches us not to insist upon property in a small matter, of
 which it is easy to say, <I>What is that between me and thee?</I> It 
 was true the grapes which the passenger ate were none of his own, nor 
 did the proprietor give them to him; but the thing was of so small 
 value that he had reason to think were he present, he would not deny 
 them to him, anymore than he himself would grudge the like courtesy, 
 and therefore it was no theft to take them. 

 4. It used them to hospitality, and teaches us to be ready to
 distribute, willing to communicate, and not to think every thing lost
 that is given away. Yet,

 5. It forbids us to abuse the kindness of our friends, and to take the
 advantage of fair concessions to make unreasonable encroachments: we
 must not draw an ell from those that give but an inch. They may eat of 
 their neighbour's grapes; but it does not therefore follow that they 
 may carry away.</P>
