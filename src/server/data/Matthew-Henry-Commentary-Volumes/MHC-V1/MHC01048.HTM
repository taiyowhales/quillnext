 The time drawing nigh that Israel must die, having, in the former 
 chapter, given order about his burial, in this he takes leave of 
 his grand-children by Joseph, and in the next of all his children. 
 Thus Jacob's dying words are recorded, because he then spoke 
 by a spirit of prophecy; Abraham's and Isaac's are not. God's 
 gifts and graces shine forth much more in some saints than in 
 others upon their death-beds. The Spirit, like the wind, blows 
 where it listeth. In this chapter, 
 
 I. Joseph, hearing of his
 father's sickness, goes to visit him, and takes his two sons with
 him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II. Jacob solemnly adopts his two sons, and takes 
 them for his own,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.
 
 III. He blesses them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.
 
 IV. He explains and justifies the crossing of his hands in 
 blessing them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.
 
 V. He leaves a particular legacy to 
 Joseph,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass after these 
 things, that <I>one</I> told Joseph, 
 Behold, thy father <I>is</I> sick: and he took 
 with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 2 And <I>one</I> told Jacob, and 
 said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
 unto thee: and Israel strengthened 
 himself, and sat upon the bed.
 &nbsp; 3 And 
 Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty 
 appeared unto me at Luz in the land 
 of Canaan, and blessed me,
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 said unto me, Behold, I will make thee 
 fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will 
 make of thee a multitude of people; 
 and will give this land to thy seed after 
 thee <I>for</I> an everlasting possession.
 &nbsp; 5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and 
 Manasseh, which were born unto thee 
 in the land of Egypt before I came 
 unto thee into Egypt, <I>are</I> mine; as 
 Reuben and Simeon, they shall be 
 mine.
 &nbsp; 6 And thy issue, which thou 
 begettest after them, shall be thine, 
 <I>and</I> shall be called after the name of 
 their brethren in their inheritance.
 &nbsp; 7 And as for me, when I came from 
 Padan, Rachel died by me in the land 
 of Canaan in the way, when yet <I>there 
 was</I> but a little way to come 
 unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in 
 the way of Ephrath; the same <I>is</I> 
 Beth-lehem.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Joseph, upon notice of his father's 
 illness, goes to see him; though a man of 
 honour and business, yet he will not fail to 
 show this due respect to his aged father,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Visiting the sick, to whom we lie under 
 obligations, or may have opportunity of doing 
 good, either for body or soul, is our duty. 
 The sick bed is a proper place both for 
 giving comfort and counsel to others and 
 receiving instruction ourselves. Joseph took 
 his two sons with him, that they might receive 
 their dying grandfather's blessing, and 
 that what they might see in him, and hear 
 from him, might make an abiding impression 
 upon them. Note, 
 
 1. It is good to acquaint 
 young people that are coming into the world 
 with the aged servants of God that are going 
 out of it, whose dying testimony to the 

 <A NAME="Page256"> </A>

 goodness of God, and the pleasantness of wisdom's 
 ways, may be a great encouragement 
 to the rising generation. Manasseh and 
 Ephraim (I dare say) would never forget 
 what passed at this time. 
 
 2. Pious parents 
 are desirous of a blessing, not only for themselves, 
 but for their children. "O that they 
 may live before God!" Joseph had been, 
 above all his brethren, kind to his father, and 
 therefore had reason to expect particular 
 favour from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jacob, upon notice of his son's visit, 
 prepared himself as well as he could to entertain 
 him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 He did what he could to 
 rouse his spirits, and to stir up the gift that 
 was in him; what little was left of bodily 
 strength he put forth to the utmost, and <I>sat 
 upon the bed.</I> Note, It is very good for sick 
 and aged people to be as lively and cheerful 
 as they can, that they may not faint in the 
 day of adversity. <I>Strengthen thyself,</I> as 
 Jacob here, and God will strengthen thee; 
 hearten thyself and help thyself, and God 
 will help and hearten thee. Let the spirit 
 sustain the infirmity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In recompence to Joseph for all his 
 attentions to him, he adopted his two sons. 
 In this charter of adoption there is, 
 
 1. A 
 particular recital of God's promise to him, 
 to which this had reference: "<I>God blessed 
 me</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 and let that blessing be entailed 
 upon them." God had promised him two 
 things, a numerous issue, and Canaan for an 
 inheritance
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);
 and Joseph's sons, pursuant 
 hereunto, should each of them multiply 
 into a tribe, and each of them have a 
 distinct lot in Canaan, equal with Jacob's 
 own sons. See how he blessed them by 
 faith in that which God had said to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21">Heb. xi. 21</A>.
 Note, In all our prayers, both 
 for ourselves and for our children, we ought 
 to have a particular eye to, and remembrance 
 of, God's promises to us. 
 
 2. An express 
 reception of Joseph's sons into his family: 
 "<I>Thy sons are mine</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 not only my grand-children,
 but as my own children." Though
 they were born in Egypt, and their father 
 was then separated from his brethren, which 
 might seem to have cut them off from the 
 heritage of the Lord, yet Jacob takes them 
 in, and owns them for visible church members. 
 He explains this at
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,
 <I>Let my 
 name be named upon them, and the name of 
 my fathers;</I> as if he had said, "Let them 
 not succeed their father in his power and 
 grandeur here in Egypt, but let them succeed 
 me in the inheritance of the promise 
 made to Abraham," which Jacob looked 
 upon as much more valuable and honourable, 
 and would have them to prize and 
 covet accordingly. Thus the aged dying 
 patriarch teaches these young persons, now 
 that they were of age (being about twenty-one 
 years old), not to look upon Egypt as 
 their home, nor to incorporate themselves 
 with the Egyptians, but to take their lot 
 with the people of God, as Moses afterwards 
 in the like temptation,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24-26">Heb. xi. 24-26</A>.
 And because it would be a piece of self-denial 
 in them, who stood so fair for preferment 
 in Egypt, to adhere to the despised 
 Hebrews, to encourage them he constitutes 
 each of them the head of a tribe. Note, 
 Those are worthy of double honour who, 
 through God's grace, break through the 
 temptations of worldly wealth and preferment, 
 to embrace religion in disgrace and 
 poverty. Jacob will have Ephraim and 
 Manasseh to believe that it is better to be 
 low and in the church than high and out of 
 it, to be called by the name of poor Jacob 
 than to be called by the name of rich Joseph. 
 
 3. A proviso inserted concerning the children 
 he might afterwards have; they should 
 not be accounted heads of tribes, as Ephraim 
 and Manasseh were, but should fall in with 
 either the one or the other of their brethren,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 It does not appear that Joseph had 
 any more children; however, it was Jacob's 
 prudence to give this direction, for the preventing 
 of contest and mismanagement. 
 Note, In making settlements, it is good to 
 take advice, and to provide for what may 
 happen, while we cannot foresee what will 
 happen. Our prudence must attend God's 
 providence. 
 
 4. Mention is made of the 
 death and burial of Rachel, Joseph's mother, 
 and Jacob's best beloved wife
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 referring to that story,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:19"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 19</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) When 
 we come to die ourselves, it is good to call 
 to mind the death of our dear relations and 
 friends, that have gone before us, to make 
 death and the grave the more familiar to us. 
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:13">Num. xxvii. 13</A>.
 Those that were to us 
 as our own souls are dead and buried; and 
 shall we think it much to follow them in the 
 same path? 
 
 (2.) The removal of dear relations 
 from us is an affliction the remembrance 
 of which cannot but abide with us a 
 great while. Strong affections in the enjoyment 
 cause long afflictions in the loss.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, 
 and said, Who <I>are</I> these?
 &nbsp; 9 And 
 Joseph said unto his father, They <I>are</I> 
 my sons, whom God hath given me 
 in this <I>place.</I> And he said, Bring 
 them, I pray thee, unto me, and I 
 will bless them.
 &nbsp; 10 Now the eyes of 
 Israel were dim for age, <I>so that</I> he 
 could not see. And he brought them 
 near unto him; and he kissed them,
 and embraced them.
 &nbsp; 11 And Israel 
 said unto Joseph, I had not thought 
 to see thy face: and, lo, God hath 
 showed me also thy seed.
 &nbsp; 12 And 
 Joseph brought them out from between 
 his knees, and he bowed himself 
 with his face to the earth.
 &nbsp; 13 And 
 Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his 

 <A NAME="Page257"> </A>

 right hand toward Israel's left hand, 
 and Manasseh in his left hand toward 
 Israel's right hand, and brought <I>them</I> 
 near unto him.
 &nbsp; 14 And Israel stretched 
 out his right hand, and laid <I>it</I> upon
 Ephraim's head, who <I>was</I> the younger, 
 and his left hand upon Manasseh's 
 head, guiding his hands wittingly; for 
 Manasseh <I>was</I> the firstborn.
 &nbsp; 15 And 
 he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before 
 whom my fathers Abraham and 
 Isaac did walk, the God which fed me 
 all my life long unto this day,
 &nbsp; 16 The 
 Angel which redeemed me from all 
 evil, bless the lads; and let my name 
 be named on them, and the name of 
 my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and 
 let them grow into a multitude in the
 midst of the earth.
 &nbsp; 17 And when Joseph 
 saw that his father laid his right 
 hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased 
 him: and he held up his father's 
 hand, to remove it from Ephraim's 
 head unto Manasseh's head.
 &nbsp; 18 And 
 Joseph said unto his father, Not so, 
 my father: for this <I>is</I> the firstborn; 
 put thy right hand upon his head.
 &nbsp; 19 And his father refused, and said, 
 I know <I>it,</I> my son, I know <I>it:</I> he also 
 shall become a people, and he also 
 shall be great: but truly his younger 
 brother shall be greater than he, and 
 his seed shall become a multitude of 
 nations.
 &nbsp; 20 And he blessed them that 
 day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, 
 saying, God make thee as Ephraim 
 and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim 
 before Manasseh.
 &nbsp; 21 And Israel said 
 unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God 
 shall be with you, and bring you again 
 unto the land of your fathers.
 &nbsp; 22 Moreover I have given to thee one 
 portion above thy brethren, which I 
 took out of the hand of the Amorite 
 with my sword and with my bow.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The blessing with which Jacob 
 blessed the two sons of Joseph, which is the 
 more remarkable because the apostle makes 
 such particular mention of it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21">Heb. xi. 21</A>),
 while he says nothing of the blessing which 
 Jacob pronounced on the rest of his sons, 
 though that also was done in faith. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jacob was blind for age,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 It is 
 one of the common infirmities of old age. 
 <I>Those that look out at the windows are darkened,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:3">Eccl. xii. 3</A>.
 It is folly to <I>walk in the 
 sight of our eyes,</I> and to suffer our hearts to 
 go after them, while we know death will 
 shortly close them, and we do not know but 
 some accident between us and death may 
 darken them. Jacob, like his father before
 him, when he was old, was dim-sighted. 
 Note,

 (1.) Those that have the honour of 
 age must therewith be content to take the 
 burden of it. 
 
 (2.) The eye of faith may be 
 very clear even when the eye of the body is 
 very much clouded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jacob was very fond of Joseph's sons: 
 <I>He kissed them and embraced them,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 It is common for old people to have a very particular 
 affection for their grand-children, perhaps 
 more than they had for their own children 
 when they were little, which Solomon 
 gives a reason for
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:6">Prov. xvii. 6</A>),
 <I>Children's 
 children are the crown of old men.</I> With 
 what satisfaction does Jacob say here
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 <I>I had not thought to see thy face</I> (having many 
 years given him up for lost), <I>and, lo, God has
 shown me also thy seed!</I> See here,
 
 (1.) How
 these two good men own God in their comforts. 
 Joseph says
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 <I>They are my sons 
 whom God has given me,</I> and, to magnify the 
 favour, he adds, "<I>In this place</I> of my banishment, 
 slavery, and imprisonment." Jacob 
 says here, <I>God has shown me thy seed.</I> Our 
 comforts are then doubly sweet to us when 
 we see them coming from God's hand. 
 
 (2.) How often God, in his merciful providences, 
 outdoes our expectations, and thus greatly 
 magnifies his favours. He not only prevents 
 our fears, but exceeds our hopes. We may 
 apply this to the promise which is made to 
 us and to our children. We could not have 
 thought that we should have been taken into 
 covenant with God ourselves, considering 
 how guilty and corrupt we are; and yet, lo, he 
 has shown us our seed also in covenant with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Before he entails his blessing, he recounts 
 his experiences of God's goodness to 
 him. He had spoken
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 of God's appearing 
 to him. The particular visits of his 
 grace, and the special communion we have 
 sometimes had with him, ought never to be 
 forgotten. But
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>)
 he mentions the 
 constant care which the divine Providence 
 had taken of him all his days. 
 
 (1.) He had 
 <I>fed him all his life long unto this day,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 Note, As long as we have lived in this world 
 we have had continual experience of God's 
 goodness to us, in providing for the support 
 of our natural life. Our bodies have called 
 for daily food, and no little has gone to feed 
 us, yet we have never wanted food convenient. 
 He that has fed us <I>all our life long</I> surely 
 will not fail us at last. 
 
 (2.) He had by his 
 angel <I>redeemed him from all evil,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 A great deal of hardship he had known in his 
 time, but God had graciously kept him from 
 the evil of his troubles. Now that he was 
 dying he looked upon himself as <I>redeemed 
 from all evil,</I> and bidding an everlasting farewell 
 to sin and sorrow. Christ, the Angel 
 of the covenant, is he that redeems us from 

 <A NAME="Page258"> </A>

 all evil,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:18">2 Tim. iv. 18</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] It becomes 
 the servants of God, when they are old 
 and dying, to witness for our God that they 
 have found him gracious. 
 
 [2.] Our experiences 
 of God's goodness to us are improvable, 
 both for the encouragement of others to 
 serve God, and for encouragement to us in 
 blessing them and praying for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When he confers the blessing and name 
 of Abraham and Isaac upon them he recommends 
 the pattern and example of Abraham 
 and Isaac to them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 He calls God the 
 <I>God before whom his fathers Abraham and 
 Isaac walked,</I> that is, in whom they believed, 
 whom they observed and obeyed, and with 
 whom they kept up communion in instituted 
 ordinances, according to the condition of the 
 covenant. <I>Walk before me,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) Those that would inherit the blessing of 
 their godly ancestors, and have the benefit 
 of God's covenant with them, must tread in 
 the steps of their piety. 
 
 (2.) It should recommend 
 religion and the service of God to us 
 that God was the God of our fathers, and that 
 they had satisfaction in walking before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. In blessing them, he <I>crossed hands.</I> 
 Joseph placed them so as that Jacob's right 
 hand should be put on the head of Manasseh 
 the elder,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 But Jacob would put 
 it on the head of Ephraim the younger,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 This displeased Joseph, who was willing to 
 support the reputation of his first-born, and 
 would therefore have removed his father's 
 hands,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 But Jacob gave him to 
 understand that he knew what he did, and
 that he did it not by mistake, nor in a humour, 
 nor from a partial affection to one 
 more than the other, but from a spirit of prophecy, 
 and in compliance with the divine 
 counsels. Manasseh should be great, but 
 truly Ephraim should be greater. When the 
 tribes were mustered in the wilderness, 
 Ephraim was more numerous than Manasseh, 
 and had the standard of that squadron
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:32,33,35,2:18,20">Num. i. 32, 33, 35; ii. 18, 20</A>),
 and is named first,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:2">Ps. lxxx. 2</A>.
 Joshua was of that tribe, so 
 was Jeroboam. The tribe of Manasseh was 
 divided, one half on one side Jordan, the 
 other half on the other side, which made it 
 the less powerful and considerable. In the 
 foresight of this, <I>Jacob crossed hands.</I> Note. 
 
 (1.) God, in bestowing his blessings upon 
 his people, gives more to some than to others, 
 more gifts, graces, and comforts, and more 
 of the good things of this life. 
 
 (2.) He often 
 gives most to those that are least likely. He 
 chooses the weak things of the world; raises 
 the poor out of the dust. Grace observes 
 not the order of nature, nor does God prefer 
 those whom we think fittest to be preferred, 
 but as it pleases him. It is observable how 
 often God, by the distinguishing favours of 
 his covenant, advanced the younger above 
 the elder, Abel above Cain, Shem above 
 Japheth, Abraham above Nahor and Haran, 
 Isaac above Ishmael, Jacob above Esau; 
 Judah and Joseph were preferred before 
 Reuben, Moses before Aaron, David and 
 Solomon before their elder brethren. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:7">1 Sam. xvi. 7</A>.
 He tied the Jews to observe 
 the birthright
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:17">Deut. xxi. 17</A>),
 but he never 
 tied himself to observe it. Some make this 
 typical of the preference given to the Gentiles 
 above the Jews; the Gentile converts were 
 much more numerous than those of the Jews. 
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Gal+4:27">Gal. iv. 27</A>.
 Thus free grace becomes 
 more illustrious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular tokens of his favour to 
 Joseph. 1. He left with him the promise of 
 their return out of Egypt, as a sacred trust: 
 <I>I die, but God shall be with you, and bring you 
 again,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 Accordingly, Joseph, when he 
 died, left it with his brethren,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:24"><I>ch.</I> l. 24</A>.
 This 
 assurance was given them, and carefully preserved
 among them, that they might neither 
 love Egypt too much when it favoured them, 
 nor fear it too much when it frowned upon 
 them. These words of Jacob furnish us with 
 comfort in reference to the death of our 
 friends: <I>They die;</I> but God shall be with 
 us, and his gracious presence is sufficient to 
 make up the loss: they leave us, but he will 
 never fail us. Further, He will bring us to 
 the land of our fathers, the heavenly Canaan, 
 whither our godly fathers have gone before 
 us. If God be with us while we stay behind 
 in this world, and will receive us shortly to 
 be with those that have gone before to a better 
 world, we ought not to sorrow as those that 
 have no hope. 
 
 2. He bestowed one portion 
 upon him above his brethren,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 The 
 lands bequeathed are described to be those 
 which he <I>took out of the hand of the Amorite 
 with his sword, and with his bow.</I> He purchased 
 them first
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32">Josh. xxiv. 32</A>),
 and, it 
 seems, was afterwards disseized of them by 
 the Amorites, but retook them by the sword, 
 repelling force by force, and recovering his 
 right by violence when he could not otherwise 
 recover it. These lands he settled upon 
 Joseph; mention is made of this grant,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:5">John iv. 5</A>.
 Pursuant to it, this parcel of ground 
 was given to the tribe of Ephraim as their 
 right, and the lot was never cast upon it; 
 and in it Joseph's bones were buried, which 
 perhaps Jacob had an eye to as much as to 
 any thing in this settlement. Note, It may 
 sometimes be both just and prudent to give 
 some children portions above the rest; but a 
 grave is that which we can most count upon 
 as our own in this earth.</P>
