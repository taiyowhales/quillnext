 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we left the world in ruins and 
 the church in straits; but in this chapter we have the repair of 
 the one and the enlargement of the other. Now the scene alters, 
 and another face of things begins to be presented to us, and the 
 brighter side of that cloud which there appeared so black and 
 dark; for, though God contend long, he will not contend for 
 ever, nor be always wrath. We have here, I. The earth made 
 anew, by the recess of the waters, and the appearing of the dry 
 land, now a second time, and both gradual. 
 
 1. The increase of 
 the waters is stayed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 2. They begin sensibly to abate, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:3">ver. 3</A>.
 
 3. After sixteen days' ebbing, the ark rests, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:4">ver. 4</A>.
 
 4. After sixty days' ebbing, the tops of the mountains appeared 
 above water, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:5">ver. 5</A>.
 
 5. After forty days' ebbing, and twenty days 
 before the mountains appeared, Noah began to send out his 
 spies, a raven and a dove, to gain intelligence, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:6=12">ver. 6-12</A>.
 
 6. Two months after the appearing of the tops of the mountains, the 
 waters had gone, and the face of the earth was dry 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:13">ver. 13</A>),
 though not dried so as to be fit for man till almost two months
 after,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:14">ver. 14</A>.

 II. Man placed anew upon the earth, in which,

 1. Noah's discharge and departure out of the ark,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 2. His sacrifice of praise, which he offered to God upon his enlargement,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20">ver. 20</A>.

 3. God's acceptance of his sacrifice, and the promise
 he made thereupon not to drown the world again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.
 And thus, at length, mercy rejoices against judgment.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And God remembered Noah, and 
 every living thing, and all the 
 cattle that <I>was</I> with him in the ark: 
 and God made a wind to pass over 
 the earth, and the waters assuaged;
 &nbsp; 2 The fountains also of the deep and 
 the windows of heaven were stopped, 
 and the rain from heaven was restrained;
 &nbsp; 3 And the waters returned 
 from off the earth continually: and
 after the end of the hundred and fifty 
 days the waters were abated.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. An act of God's grace: <I>God 
 remembered Noah and every living thing.</I> 
 This is an expression after the manner of 
 men; for not any of his creatures 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:6">Luke xii. 6</A>),
 much less any of his people, are forgotten 
 of God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:15,16">Isa. xlix. 15, 16</A>.
 But, 
 
 1. The whole 
 race of mankind, except Noah and his 
 family, was now extinguished, and driven 
 into the land of forgetfulness, to be remembered 
 no more; so that God's remembering 
 Noah was the return of his mercy to mankind, 
 of whom he would not make a full 
 end. It is a strange expression, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:13">Ezek. v. 13</A>,
 <I>When I have accomplished my fury in them, 
 I will be comforted.</I> The demands of divine 
 justice had been answered by the ruin of 
 those sinners; he had eased him of his 
 adversaries 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>),
 and now his spirit 
 was quieted 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:8">Zech. vi. 8</A>),
 and <I>he remembered 
 Noah and every living thing.</I> He remembered 
 mercy in wrath 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:2">Hab. iii. 2</A>),
 remembered the days of old 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:11">Isa. lxiii. 11</A>),
 remembered the holy seed, and then remembered 
 Noah. 
 
 2. Noah himself, though one 
 that had found grace in the eyes of the Lord, 
 yet seemed to be forgotten in the ark, and 
 perhaps began to think himself so; for we 
 do not find that God had told him how long 
 he should be confined and when he should 
 be released. Very good men have sometimes 
 been ready to conclude themselves forgotten 
 of God, especially when their afflictions have 
 been unusually grievous and long. Perhaps 
 Noah, though a great believer, yet when he 
 found the flood continuing so long after it 
 might reasonably be presumed to have done 
 its work, was tempted to fear lest he that 
 shut him in would keep him in, and began 
 to expostulate. <I>How long wilt thou forget 
 me?</I> But at length God returned in mercy 
 to him, and this is expressed by remembering 
 him. Note, Those that remember God 
 shall certainly be remembered by him, how 
 desolate and disconsolate soever their condition 
 may be. He will appoint them a set time 
 and remember them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:13">Job xiv. 13</A>.
 
 3. With 
 Noah, God remembered every living thing; 
 for, though his delight is especially in the 
 sons of men, yet he rejoices in all his works, 
 and hates nothing that he has made. He 
 takes special care, not only of his people's 
 persons, but of their possessions--of them 
 and all that belongs to them. He considered 
 the cattle of Nineveh, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11">Jon. iv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An act of God's power over wind and 
 water, both of which are at his beck, though 
 neither of them is under man's control. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He commanded the wind, and said to 
 that, <I>Go,</I> and it went, in order to the carrying 
 off of the flood: <I>God made a wind to 
 pass over the earth.</I> See here, 
 
 (1.) What 
 was God's remembrance of Noah: it was 
 his relieving him. Note, Those whom God 
 remembers he remembers effectually, for 
 good; he remembers us to save us, that we 
 may remember him to serve him. 
 
 (2.) What 
 a sovereign dominion God has over the 
 winds. He has them in his fist 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>)
 and brings them out of his treasuries, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>.
 He sends them when, and 
 whither, and for what purposes, he pleases. 
 Even stormy winds fulfil his word, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.
 It should seem, while the waters 
 increased, there was no wind; for that 
 would have added to the toss of the ark; but 
 now God sent a wind, when it would not be 
 so troublesome. Probably, it was a north 
 wind, for that drives away rain. However, 
 it was a drying wind, such a wind as God 
 sent to divide the Red Sea before Israel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:21">Exod. xiv. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He remanded the waters, and said to 
 them, <I>Come,</I> and they came. 
 
 (1.) He took 
 away the cause. He sealed up the springs of 
 those waters, <I>the fountains of the great deep, 
 and the windows of heaven.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] As 
 God has a key to open, so he has a key to 
 shut up again, and to stay the progress of 
 judgments by stopping the causes of them: 
 and the same hand that brings the desolation 
 must bring the deliverance; to that 
 hand therefore our eye must ever be. He 
 that wounds is alone able to heal. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:14">Job xii. 14, 15</A>.

 [2.] When afflictions have done 
 the work for which they are sent, whether 
 killing work or curing work, they shall be 
 removed. God's word shall not return void, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10,11">Isa. lv. 10, 11</A>.

 (2.) Then the effect ceased; 
 not all at once, but by degrees: <I>The waters
 abated</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 <I>returned from off the earth continually,</I> 
 Heb. they were <I>going and returning</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 which denotes a gradual departure. 
 <A NAME="Page65"> </A>
 The heat of the sun exhaled much, and perhaps 
 the subterraneous caverns soaked in 
 more. Note, As the earth was not drowned 
 in a day, so it was not dried in a day. In 
 the creation, it was but one day's work to 
 clear the earth from the waters that covered 
 it, and to make it dry land; nay, it was but 
 half a day's work, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9,10"><I>ch.</I> i. 9, 10</A>.
 But, the 
 work of creation being finished, this work of 
 providence was effected by the concurring 
 influence of second causes, yet thus enforced 
 by the almighty power of God. God usually 
 works deliverance for his people gradually, 
 that the day of small things may not be 
 despised, nor the day of great things 
 despaired of, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10">Zech. iv. 10</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And the ark rested in the seventh 
 month, on the seventeenth day of the 
 month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
 &nbsp; 5 And the waters decreased continually 
 until the tenth month: in the 
 tenth <I>month,</I> on the first <I>day</I> of the 
 month, were the tops of the mountains 
 seen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the effects and evidences of 
 the ebbing of the waters. 
 
 1. The ark rested. 
 This was some satisfaction to Noah, to feel 
 the house he was in upon firm ground, and 
 no longer movable. It rested upon a mountain, 
 whither it was directed, not by Noah's 
 prudence (he did not steer it), but by the 
 wise and gracious providence of God, that it 
 might rest the sooner. Note, God has times 
 and places of rest for his people after their 
 tossings; and many a time he provides for 
 their seasonable and comfortable settlement 
 without their own contrivance and quite 
 beyond their own foresight. The ark of 
 the church, though sometimes tossed with 
 tempests, and not comforted 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11">Isa. liv. 11</A>),
 yet has its rests, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31">Acts ix. 31</A>.

 2. The tops of 
 the mountains were seen, like little islands, 
 appearing above the water. We must suppose 
 that they were seen by Noah and his 
 sons; for there were none besides to see 
 them. It is probable that they had looked 
 through the window of the ark every day, 
 like the longing mariners, after a tedious 
 voyage, to see if they could discover land, or 
 as the prophet's servant 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:43,44">1 Kings xviii. 43, 44</A>),
 and at length they spy ground, 
 and enter the day of the discovery in their 
 journal. They felt ground above forty days 
 before they saw it, according to Dr. Lightfoot's 
 computation, whence he infers that, if 
 the waters decreased proportionably, the ark 
 drew eleven cubits in water.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And it came to pass at the end 
 of forty days, that Noah opened the 
 window of the ark which he had 
 made:
 &nbsp; 7 And he sent forth a raven, 
 which went forth to and fro, until the 
 waters were dried up from off the 
 earth.
 &nbsp; 8 Also he sent forth a dove 
 from him, to see if the waters were
 abated from off the face of the ground;
 &nbsp; 9 But the dove found no rest for the 
 sole of her foot, and she returned 
 unto him into the ark, for the waters 
 <I>were</I> on the face of the whole earth: 
 then he put forth his hand, and took 
 her, and pulled her in unto him into 
 the ark.
 &nbsp; 10 And he stayed yet other 
 seven days; and again he sent forth
 the dove out of the ark;
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 the dove came in to him in the evening; 
 and, lo, in her mouth <I>was</I> an 
 olive leaf plucked off: so Noah knew 
 that the waters were abated from off 
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 12 And he stayed yet 
 other seven days; and sent forth the 
 dove; which returned not again unto 
 him any more.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the spies 
 which Noah sent forth to bring him intelligence 
 from abroad, a raven and a dove. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That though God had told Noah particularly 
 when the flood would come, even 
 to a day 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:4"><I>ch.</I> vii. 4</A>),
 yet he did not give him 
 a particular account by revelation at what 
 times, and by what steps, it should <I>go away,</I> 
 
 1. Because the knowledge of the former was 
 necessary to his preparing the ark, and settling 
 himself in it; but the knowledge of the 
 latter would serve only to gratify his curiosity, 
 and the concealing of it from him 
 would be the needful exercise of his faith and 
 patience. And, 
 
 2. He could not foresee the 
 flood, but by revelation; but he might, by 
 ordinary means, discover the decrease of it, 
 and therefore God was pleased to leave him 
 to the use of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That though Noah by faith expected 
 his enlargement, and by patience waited for 
 it, yet he was inquisitive concerning it, as 
 one that thought it long to be thus confined. 
 Note, Desires of release out of trouble, 
 earnest expectations of it, and enquiries concerning 
 its advances towards us, will very 
 well consist with the sincerity of faith and 
 patience. <I>He that believes does not make 
 haste</I> to run before God, but he does make 
 haste to go forth to meet him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>.
 Particularly, 
 
 1. Noah sent forth a raven 
 through the window of the ark, which went 
 forth, as the Hebrew phrase is, <I>going forth 
 and returning,</I> that is, flying about, and 
 feeding on the carcases that floated, but returning 
 to the ark for rest; probably not in 
 it, but upon it. This gave Noah little satisfaction; 
 therefore, 
 
 2. He sent forth a dove, 
 which returned the first time with no good 
 news, but probably wet and dirty; but, the 
 second time, she brought an olive-leaf in her 
 <A NAME="Page66"> </A>
 bill, which appeared to be first plucked off, a 
 plain indication that now the trees, the fruit-trees, 
 began to appear above water. Note 
 here, 
 
 (1.) That Noah sent forth the dove the 
 second time seven days after the first time, 
 and the third time was after seven days too; 
 and probably the first sending of her out was 
 seven days after the sending forth of the 
 raven. This intimates that it was done on 
 the sabbath day, which, it should seem, 
 Noah religiously observed in the ark. Having 
 kept the sabbath in a solemn assembly of 
 his little church, he then expected special 
 blessings from heaven, and enquired concerning 
 them. Having directed his prayer, 
 he looked up, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:3">Ps. v. 3</A>.

 (2.) The dove is an 
 emblem of a gracious soul, which finding no 
 rest for its foot, no solid peace or satisfaction 
 in this world, this deluged defiling world, 
 returns to Christ as to its ark, as to its 
 Noah. The carnal heart, like the raven, 
 takes up with the world, and feeds on the 
 carrions it finds there; <I>but return thou to thy 
 rest, O my soul,</I> to thy <I>Noah,</I> so the word is, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:7">Ps. cxvi. 7</A>.
 <I>O that I had wings like a dove,</I> 
 to flee to him! 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:6">Ps. lv. 6</A>.
 And as Noah put 
 forth his hand, and took the dove, and pulled 
 her in to him, into the ark, so Christ will 
 graciously preserve, and help, and welcome, 
 those that fly to him for rest. 
 
 (3.) The 
 olive-branch, which was an emblem of peace, 
 was brought, not by the raven, a bird of 
 prey, nor by a gay and proud peacock, but 
 by a mild, patient, humble dove. It is a 
 dove-like disposition that brings into the
 soul earnests of rest and joy. 
 
 (4.) Some 
 make these things an allegory. The law was 
 first sent forth like the raven, but brought 
 no tidings of the assuaging of the waters of 
 God's wrath, with which the world of mankind 
 was deluged; therefore, in the fulness 
 of time, God sent forth his gospel, as the 
 dove, in the likeness of which the Holy 
 Spirit descended, and this presents us with 
 an olive-branch and brings in a better hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And it came to pass in the six 
 hundredth and first year, in the first 
 <I>month,</I> the first <I>day</I> of the month, the 
 waters were dried up from off the 
 earth: and Noah removed the covering 
 of the ark, and looked, and, behold, 
 the face of the ground was dry.
 &nbsp; 14 And in the second month, on the 
 seven and twentieth day of the month, 
 was the earth dried.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 1. The ground dry 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 that is, 
 all the water carried off it, which, upon the 
 first day of the first month (a joyful new-year's-day 
 it was), Noah was himself an eye-witness 
 of. He <I>removed the covering of the 
 ark,</I> not the whole covering, but so much as 
 would suffice to give him a prospect of the 
 earth about it; and a most comfortable 
 prospect he had. For behold, behold and 
 wonder, <I>the face of the ground was dry.</I> 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) It is a great mercy to see ground 
 about us. Noah was more sensible of it than 
 we are; for mercies restored are much more 
 affecting than mercies continued. 
 
 (2.) The 
 divine power which now renewed the face of 
 the earth can renew the face of an afflicted 
 troubled soul and of a distressed persecuted 
 church. He can make dry ground to appear 
 even where it seemed to have been lost and 
 forgotten, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:16">Ps. xviii. 16</A>.

 2. The ground 
 dried 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 so as to be a fit habitation for 
 Noah. Observe, Though Noah saw the ground 
 dry the first day of the first month, yet God 
 would not suffer him to go out of the ark 
 till the twenty-seventh day of the second 
 month. Perhaps Noah, being somewhat 
 weary of his restraint, would have quitted 
 the ark at first; but God, in kindness to 
 him, ordered him to stay so much longer. 
 Note, God consults our benefit rather than 
 our desires; for he knows what is good for 
 us better than we do for ourselves, and how 
 long it is fit our restraints should continue 
 and desired mercies should be delayed. We 
 would go out of the ark before the ground is 
 dried: and perhaps, if the door be shut, are 
 ready to remove the covering, and to climb 
 up some other way; but we should be satisfied 
 that God's time of showing mercy is 
 certainly the best time, when the mercy is 
 ripe for us and we are ready for it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And God spake unto Noah, 
 saying,
 &nbsp; 16 Go forth of the ark, thou, 
 and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy 
 sons' wives with thee.
 &nbsp; 17 Bring 
 forth with thee every living thing 
 that <I>is</I> with thee, of all flesh, <I>both</I> of 
 fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping 
 thing that creepeth upon the 
 earth; that they may breed abundantly 
 in the earth, and be fruitful, 
 and multiply upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, 
 and his wife, and his sons' wives with 
 him:
 &nbsp; 19 Every beast, every creeping 
 thing, and every fowl, <I>and</I> whatsoever 
 creepeth upon the earth, after 
 their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Noah's dismission out of the 
 ark, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. Noah did not 
 stir till God bade him. As he had a command 
 to go into the ark 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1"><I>ch.</I> vii. 1</A>),
 so, how 
 tedious soever his confinement there was, 
 he would wait for a command to go out of 
 it again. Note, We must in all our ways 
 acknowledge God, and set him before us in 
 all our removes. Those only go under God's 
 protection that follow God's direction and 
 submit to his government. Those that 
 steadily adhere to God's word as their rule, 
 and are guided by his grace as their principle, 
 and take hints from his providence to assist 

 <A NAME="Page67"> </A>
 
 them in their application of general directions 
 to particular cases, may in faith see him 
 guiding their motions in their march through 
 this wilderness. 
 
 2. Though God detained 
 him long, yet at last he gave him his discharge; 
 for <I>the vision is for an appointed 
 time, and at the end it shall speak,</I> it shall 
 speak truth 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>),
 it shall not lie. 
 
 3. God had said, <I>Come into the ark</I> which 
 he says, not, <I>Come forth,</I> but, Go <I>forth,</I> 
 which intimates that God, who went in with 
 him, staid with him all the while, till he sent 
 him out safely; for he has said, <I>I will not 
 leave thee.</I> 
 
 4. Some observe that, when they 
 were ordered into the ark, the men and the 
 women were mentioned separately 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:18"><I>ch.</I> vi. 18</A>):
 <I>Thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' 
 wives;</I> hence they infer that, during the 
 time of mourning, they were apart, and their 
 wives apart, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:12">Zech. xii. 12</A>.
 But now God 
 did as it were new-marry them, sending out 
 Noah and his wife together, and his sons and 
 their wives together, that they might be 
 fruitful and multiply. 
 
 5. Noah was ordered 
 to bring the creatures out with him, that 
 having taken the care of feeding them so 
 long, and been at so much pains about them, 
 he might have the honour of leading them 
 forth by their armies, and receiving their 
 homage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Noah's departure when he had his 
 dismission. As he would not go out without 
 leave, so he would not, out of fear or humour, 
 stay in when he had leave, but was in all 
 points observant of the heavenly vision. 
 Though he had been now a full year and 
 ten days a prisoner in the ark, yet when he 
 found himself preserved there, not only for a 
 new life, but for a new world, he saw no 
 reason to complain of his long confinement. 
 Now observe, 
 
 1. Noah and his family came 
 out alive, though one of them was a wicked
 Ham, whom, though he escaped the flood, 
 God's justice could have taken away by some 
 other stroke. But they are all alive. Note, 
 When families have been long continued 
 together, and no breaches made among them, 
 it must be looked upon as a distinguishing 
 favour, and attributed to the Lord's mercies. 
 
 2. Noah brought out all the creatures that 
 went in with him, except the raven and the 
 dove, which, probably, were ready to meet 
 their mates at their coming out. Noah was 
 able to give a very good account of his
 charge; for of all that were given to him he 
 had lost none, but was faithful to him that 
 appointed him, <I>pro hac vice--on this occasion,</I> 
 high steward of his household.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. Noah's thankful acknowledgment 
 of God's favour to him, in completing 
 the mercy of his deliverance, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 1. He 
 <I>built an altar.</I> Hitherto he had done nothing 
 without particular instructions and commands 
 from God. He had a particular call 
 into the ark, and another out of it; but, 
 altars and sacrifices being already of divine 
 institution for religious worship, he did not 
 stay for a particular command thus to express 
 his thankfulness. Those that have received 
 mercy from God should be forward in returning 
 thanks, and do it <I>not of constraint, 
 but willingly.</I> God is pleased with free-will 
 offerings, and praises that wait for him. 
 Noah was now turned out into a cold and 
 desolate world, where, one would have 
 thought, his first care would have been to 
 build a house for himself; but, behold, he 
 begins with an altar for God: God, that is 
 the first, must be first served; and he begins 
 well that begins with God. 
 
 2. He offered 
 a sacrifice upon his altar, <I>of every clean beast, 
 and of every clean fowl</I>--one, the odd seventh 
 that we read of, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:2,3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2, 3</A>.
 Here observe, 
 
 (1.) He offered only those that were clean; 
 for it is not enough that we sacrifice, but we 
 must sacrifice that which God appoints, according 
 to the law of sacrifice, and not a 
 corrupt thing. 
 
 (2.) Though his stock of 
 cattle was so small, and that rescued from 
 ruin at so great an expense of care and pains, 
 yet he did not grudge to give God his dues 
 out of it. He might have said, "Have I but 
 seven sheep to begin the world with, and 
 must one of these seven be killed and burnt 
 for sacrifice? Were it not better to defer it 
 till we have greater plenty?" No, to prove 
 the sincerity of his love and gratitude, he 
 cheerfully gives the seventh to his God, as 
 an acknowledgment that all was his, and 
 owing to him. Serving God with our little 
 is the way to make it more; and we must 
 never think that wasted with which God is 
 honoured. 
 
 (3.) See here the antiquity of 
 religion: the first thing we find done in the 
 new world was an act of worship, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.
 We are now to express our thankfulness, 
 not by burnt-offerings, but by the sacrifices 
 of praise and the sacrifices of righteousness, 
 by pious devotions and a pious conversation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's gracious acceptance of Noah's 
 thankfulness. It was a settled rule in the 
 patriarchal age: <I>If thou doest well, shalt thou 
 not be accepted?</I> Noah was so. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God was well pleased with the 

 <A NAME="Page68"> </A>

 performance, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 He <I>smelt a sweet savour,</I> or, as 
 it is in the Hebrew, <I>a savour of rest,</I> from it. 
 As, when he had made the world at first on 
 the seventh day, he rested and was refreshed, 
 so, now that he had new-made it, in the 
 sacrifice of the seventh he rested. He was 
 well pleased with Noah's pious zeal, and 
 these hopeful beginnings of the new world, 
 as men are with fragrant and agreeable 
 smells; though his offering was small, it was 
 according to his ability, and God accepted it. 
 Having caused his anger to rest upon the 
 world of sinners, he here caused his love to 
 rest upon this little remnant of believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hereupon, he took up a resolution never 
 to drown the world again. Herein he had 
 an eye, not so much to Noah's sacrifice as to 
 Christ's sacrifice of himself, which was typified 
 and represented by it, and which was 
 indeed an <I>offering of a sweet-smelling savour,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:2">Eph. v. 2</A>.
 Good security is here given, and 
 that which may be relied upon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That this judgment should never be 
 repeated. Noah might think, "To what purpose 
 should the world be repaired, when, in all 
 probability, for the wickedness of it, it will 
 quickly be in like manner ruined again?" 
 "No," says God, "it never shall." It was said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:6"><I>ch.</I> vi. 6</A>),
 <I>It repented the Lord that he had made 
 man;</I> now here he speaks as if it repented 
 him that he had destroyed man: neither 
 means a change of his mind, but both a 
 change of his way. <I>It repented him concerning 
 his servants,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.
 Two ways this resolve is expressed:--
 
 [1.] <I>I will not 
 again curse the ground,</I> Heb. <I>I will not add 
 to curse the ground any more.</I> God had 
 cursed the ground upon the first entrance of 
 sin 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>),
 when he drowned it he 
 added to that curse; but now he determines 
 not to add to it any more. 
 
 [2.] <I>Neither will 
 I again smite any more every living thing;</I> 
 that is, it was determined that whatever ruin 
 God might bring upon particular persons, or 
 families, or countries, he would never again 
 destroy the whole world till the day shall 
 come when time shall be no more. But the 
 reason of this resolve is very surprising, for 
 it seems the same in effect with the reason 
 given for the destruction of the world: 
 <I>Because the imagination of man's heart is evil 
 from his youth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5"><I>ch.</I> vi. 5</A>.
 But there is this 
 difference--there it is said, <I>The imagination 
 of man's heart is evil continually,</I> that is, 
 "his actual transgressions continually cry 
 against him;" here it is said, It is evil <I>from
 his youth or childhood.</I> It is bred in the 
 bone; he brought it into the world with him; 
 he was shapen and conceived in it. Now, 
 one would think it should follow, "Therefore 
 that guilty race shall be wholly extinguished, 
 and <I>I will make a full end.</I>" No, "Therefore 
 I will no more take this severe method; 
 for," <I>First,</I> "He is rather to be pitied, for 
 it is all the effect of sin dwelling in him; and 
 it is but what might be expected from such 
 a degenerate race: he is called a <I>transgressor
 from the womb,</I> and therefore it is not strange 
 that he deals so very treacherously," 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.
 Thus God <I>remembers that he is 
 flesh,</I> corrupt and sinful, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:39">Ps. lxxviii. 39</A>.
 <I>Secondly,</I> "He will be utterly ruined; for, 
 if he be dealt with according to his deserts, 
 one flood must succeed another till all be 
 destroyed." See here, 
 
 1. That outward 
 judgments, though they may terrify and 
 restrain men, yet cannot of themselves sanctify 
 and renew them; the grace of God 
 must work with those judgments. Man's 
 nature was as sinful after the deluge as it 
 had been before. 
 
 2. That God's goodness 
 takes occasion from man's sinfulness to magnify 
 itself the more; his reasons of mercy 
 are all drawn from himself, not from any 
 thing in us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the course of nature should never 
 be discontinued 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 "<I>While the earth remaineth,</I> 
 and man upon it, there shall be 
 <I>summer and winter</I> (not all winter as had been 
 this last year), <I>day and night,</I>" not all night, 
 as probably it was while the rain was descending. 
 Here, 
 
 [1.] It is plainly intimated that 
 this earth is not to remain always; it, and all 
 the works in it, must shortly be burnt up; 
 and we look for <I>new heavens and a new earth,</I> 
 when all these things must be dissolved. 
 But, 
 
 [2.] As long as it does remain God's 
 providence will carefully preserve the regular 
 succession of times and seasons, and cause 
 each to know its place. To this we owe it 
 that the world stands, and the wheel of nature 
 keeps it track. See here how changeable 
 the times are and yet how unchangeable. 
 <I>First,</I> The course of nature always changing. 
 As it is with the times, so it is with the events 
 of time, they are subject to vicissitudes--<I>day 
 and night, summer and winter,</I> counterchanged. 
 In heaven and hell it is not so, but on earth 
 <I>God hath set the one over against the other. 
 Secondly,</I> Yet never changed. It is constant 
 in this inconstancy. These seasons have 
 never ceased, nor shall cease, while the sun 
 continued such a steady measurer of time and 
 the moon such a <I>faithful witness in heaven.</I> 
 This is <I>God's covenant of the day and of the 
 night,</I> the stability of which is mentioned for 
 the confirming of our faith in the covenant 
 of grace, which is no less inviolable, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:20,21">Jer. xxxiii. 20, 21</A>.
 We see God's promises to the creatures 
 made good, and thence may infer that 
 his promises to all believers shall be so.</P>
