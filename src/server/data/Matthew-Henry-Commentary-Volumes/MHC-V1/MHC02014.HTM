 The departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt (which was indeed 
 the birth of the Jewish church) is made yet more memorable by further 
 works of wonder, which were wrought immediately upon it. Witness the 
 records of this chapter, the contents whereof, together with a key to 
 it, we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:29">Heb. xi. 29</A>.

 "They passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians
 assaying to do were drowned;" and this they did by faith, which 
 intimates that there was something typical and spiritual in it. Here
 is,

 I. The extreme distress and danger that Israel was in at the Red Sea.

 1. Notice was given of it to Moses before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. The cause of it was Pharaoh's violent pursuit of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 3. Israel was in a great consternation upon it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 4. Moses endeavours to encourage them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:13">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 II. The wonderful deliverance that God wrought for them out of this
 distress.

 1. Moses is instructed concerning it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 2. Lines that could not be forced are set between the camp of Israel 
 and Pharaoh's camp,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 3. By the divine power the Red Sea is divided
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31">ver. 31</A>),

 and is made,

 (1.) A lane to the Israelites, who marched safely through it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:22,29">ver. 22, 29</A>.
 
 But, 
 
 (2.) To the Egyptians it was made, 

 [1.] An ambush into which they were drawn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.
 
 And, 

 [2.] A grave in which they were all buried,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 III. The impressions this made upon the Israelites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:30,31">ver. 30, 31</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
 before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
 Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
 &nbsp; 3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They <I>are</I>
 entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
 &nbsp; 4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
 them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host;
 that the Egyptians may know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And they did
 so.
 &nbsp; 5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
 the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the
 people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let
 Israel go from serving us?
 &nbsp; 6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
 &nbsp; 7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
 of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
 he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
 Israel went out with an high hand.
 &nbsp; 9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses <I>and</I>
 chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook
 them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Instructions given to Moses concerning Israel's motions and 
 encampments, which were so very surprising that if Moses had not 
 express orders about them before they would scarcely have been 
 persuaded to follow the pillar of cloud and fire. That therefore there 
 might be no scruple nor dissatisfaction about it, Moses is told before, 
 
 1. Whither they must go,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 They had got to the edge of the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:20"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 20</A>),

 and a stage or two more would have brought them to Horeb, the place
 appointed for their serving God; but, instead of going forward, they 
 are ordered to turn short off, on the right hand from Canaan, and to 
 march towards the Red Sea. Where they were, at Etham, there was no sea 
 in their way to obstruct their passage: but God himself orders them 
 into straits, which might give them an assurance that when his purposes 
 were served he would without fail bring them out of those straits. 
 Note, God sometimes raises difficulties in the way of the salvation of 
 his people, that he may have the glory of subduing them, and helping 
 his people over them. 

 2. What God designed in these strange orders.  Moses would have yielded 
 an implicit obedience, though God had given him no reason; but shall he 
 hide from Moses the thing that he does? No, Moses shall know,

 (1.) That Pharaoh has a design to ruin Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (2.) That therefore God has a design to ruin Pharaoh, and he takes this 
 way to effect it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Pharaoh's sagacity would conclude that Israel was entangled in the 
 wilderness and so would become an easy prey to him; and, that he might 
 be the more apt to think so, God orders them into yet greater 
 entanglements; also, by turning them so much out of their road, he 
 amazes him yet more, and gives him further occasion to suppose that 
 they were in a state of embarrassment and danger. And thus (says God) 
 <I>I will be honoured upon Pharaoh.</I> Note, 

 [1.] All men being made for the honour of their Maker, those whom he is
 not honoured by he will be honoured upon. 

 [2.] What seems to tend to the church's ruin is often overruled to the
 ruin of the church's enemies, whose pride and malice are fed by 
 Providence, that they may be ripened for destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pharaoh's pursuit of Israel, in which, while he gratifies his own 
 malice and revenge, he is furthering the accomplishment of God's 
 counsels concerning him. <I>It was told him that the people fled,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Such a fright was he in, when he gave them leave to go, that when the 
 fright was a little over he either forgot, or would not own, that they 
 departed with his consent, and therefore was willing that it should be 
 represented to him as a revolt from their allegiance. Thus what may 
 easily be justified is easily condemned, by putting false colours upon 
 it. Now, hereupon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reflects upon it with regret that he had connived at their 
 departure. He and his servants, though it was with the greatest reason 
 in the world that they had let Israel go, yet were now angry with 
 themselves for it: <I>Why have we done thus?</I> 

 (1.) It vexed them that Israel had their liberty, that they had lost
 the profit of their labours, and the pleasure of chastising them. It is 
 meat and drink to proud persecutors to trample upon the saints of the 
 Most High, and say to their souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go 
 over;</I> and therefore it vexes them to have their hands tied. Note, 
 The liberty of God's people is a heavy grievance to their enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:12,13,Ac+5:17,33">Esth. v. 12, 13; Acts v. 17, 33</A>.

 (2.) It aggravated the vexation that they themselves had consented to
 it, thinking now that they might have hindered it, and that they needed 
 not to have yielded, though they had stood it out to the last 
 extremity. Thus God makes men's envy and rage against his people a 
 torment to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.

 It was well done to let Israel go, and what they would have reflected
 on with comfort if they had done it from an honest principle; but doing 
 it by constraint, they called themselves a thousand fools for doing it, 
 and passionately wished it undone again. Note, It is very common, but 
 very absurd and criminal, for people to repent of their good deeds; 
 their justice and charity, and even their repentance, are repented of. 
 See an instance somewhat like this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:10,11">Jer. xxxiv. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He resolves, if possible, either to reduce them or to be revenged on 
 them; in order to this, he levies an army, musters all his force of 
 chariots and horsemen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>

 (for, it should seem, he took no foot with him, because the king's 
 business required haste), and thus he doubts not but he shall 
 re-enslave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 It is easy to imagine what a rage Pharaoh was now in, roaring like a
 lion disappointed of his prey, how his proud heart aggravated the
 affront, swelled with indignation, scorned to be baffled, longed to be
 revenged: and now all the plagues are as if they had never been. He has
 quite forgotten the sorrowful funerals of his firstborn, and can think
 of nothing but making Israel feel his resentments; now he thinks he can
 be too hard for God himself; for, otherwise, could he have hoped to
 conquer a people so dear to him? God gave him up to these passions of
 his own heart, and so hardened it. It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 The children of Israel went out with <I>a high hand,</I> that is, with
 a great deal of courage and bravery, triumphing in their release, and
 resolved to break through the difficulties that lay in their way.
 <I>But the Egyptians</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:9">v. 9</A>)

 <I>pursued after them.</I> Note, Those that in good earnest set their
 faces heaven-ward, and will live godly in Christ Jesus, must expect to 
 be set upon by Satan's temptations and terrors. He will not tamely part 
 with any out of his service, nor go out without raging,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
 their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
 they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11 And they said unto Moses, Because <I>there were</I> no graves in
 Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
 wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of
 Egypt?
 &nbsp; 12 <I>Is</I> not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt,
 saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For <I>it
 had been</I> better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we
 should die in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still,
 and see the salvation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he will show to you to
 day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
 them again no more for ever.
 &nbsp; 14 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The fright that the children of Israel were in when they perceived 
 that Pharaoh pursued them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They knew very well the strength and rage of the enemy, and their own 
 weakness; numerous indeed they were, but all on foot, unarmed, 
 undisciplined, disquieted by long servitude, and (which was worst of 
 all) now penned up by the situation of their camp, so that they could 
 not make their escape. On the one hand was Pi-hahiroth, a range of 
 craggy rocks impassable; on the other hand were Migdol and Baalzephon, 
 which, some think were forts and garrisons upon the frontiers of Egypt; 
 before them was the sea; behind them were the Egyptians: so that there 
 was no way open for them but upwards, and thence their deliverance 
 came. Note, We may be in the way of our duty, following God and 
 hastening towards heaven, and yet may be in great straits, <I>troubled 
 on every side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8">2 Cor. iv. 8</A>.

 In this distress, no marvel that the children of Israel were sorely
 afraid; their father Jacob was so in a like case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:7">Gen. xxxii. 7</A>);

 when without are fightings, it cannot be otherwise but that within are
 fears: what therefore was the fruit of this fear? According as that 
 was, the fear was good or evil. 

 1. Some of them cried out unto the Lord; their fear set them a praying, 
 and that was a good effect of it.  God brings us into straits that he 
 may bring us to our knees. 

 2. Others of them cried out against Moses; their fear set them a 
 murmuring,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 They give up themselves for lost; and as if God's arm were shortened 
 all of a sudden, and he were not as able to work miracles to-day as he 
 was yesterday, they despair of deliverance, and can count upon nothing 
 but <I>dying in the wilderness.</I> How inexcusable was their distrust! 
 Did they not see themselves under the guidance and protection of a 
 pillar from heaven? And can almighty power fail them, or infinite
 goodness be false to them? Yet this was not the worst; they quarrel 
 with Moses for bringing them out of Egypt, and, in quarrelling with 
 him, fly in the face of God himself, and provoke him to wrath whose 
 favour was now the only succour they had to flee to. As the Egyptians 
 were angry with themselves for the best deed they ever did, so the 
 Israelites were angry with God for the greatest kindness that was ever 
 done them; so gross are the absurdities of unbelief. They here express,
 
 
 (1.) A sordid contempt of liberty, preferring servitude before it, only
 because it was attended with some difficulties. A generous spirit would 
 have said, "If the worst come to the worst," as we say, "It is better 
 to die in the field of honour than to live in the chains of slavery;" 
 nay, under God's conduct, they could not miscarry, and therefore they 
 might say, "Better live God's freemen in the open air of a wilderness 
 than the Egyptians' bondmen in the smoke of the brick-kilns." But 
 because, for the present, they are a little embarrassed, they are angry 
 that they were not left buried alive in their house of bondage. 

 (2.) Base ingratitude to Moses, who had been the faithful instrument of
 their deliverance. They condemn him, as if he had dealt hardly and 
 unkindly with them, whereas it was evident, beyond dispute, that 
 whatever he did, and however it issued, it was by direction from their 
 God, and with design for their good. What they had said in a former 
 ferment (when they hearkened not to Moses for anguish of spirit), they 
 repeat and justify in this: <I>We said in Egypt, Let us alone;</I> and 
 it was ill-said, yet more excusable, because then they had not had so 
 much experience as they had now of God's wonderful appearances in their 
 favour. But they had as soon forgotten the miracles of mercy as the 
 Egyptians had forgotten the miracles of wrath; and they, as well as the 
 Egyptians, hardened their hearts, at last, to their own ruin; as Egypt 
 after ten plagues, so Israel after ten provocations, of which this was 
 the first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:22">Num. xiv. 22</A>),

 were sentenced to die in the wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The seasonable encouragement that Moses gave them in this distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 He answered not these fools according to their folly. God bore with the 
 provocation they gave to him, and did not (as he might justly have 
 done) chose their delusions, and bring their fears upon them; and 
 therefore Moses might well afford to pass by the affront they put upon 
 him. Instead of chiding them, he comforts them, and with an admirable 
 presence and composure of mind, not disheartened either by the 
 threatenings of Egypt or the tremblings of Israel, stills their 
 murmuring, with the assurance of a speedy and complete deliverance: 
 <I>Fear you not.</I> Note, It is our duty and interest, when we cannot 
 get out of our troubles, yet to get above our fears, so that they may 
 only serve to quicken our prayers and endeavours, but may not prevail 
 to silence our faith and hope. 

 1. He assures them that God would deliver them, that he would undertake 
 their deliverance, and that he would effect it in the utter ruin of 
 their pursuers: <I>The Lord shall fight for you.</I> This Moses was 
 confident of himself, and would have them to be so, though as yet he 
 knew not how or which way it would be brought to pass. God had assured 
 him that Pharaoh and his host should be ruined, and he comforts them 
 with the same comforts wherewith he had been comforted. 

 2. He directs them to leave it to God, in a silent expectation of the 
 event: "<I>Stand still,</I> and think not to save yourselves either by 
 fighting or flying; wait God's orders, and observe them; be not 
 contriving what course to take, but follow your leader; wait God's 
 appearances, and take notice of them, that you may see how foolish you 
 are to distrust them. Compose yourselves, by an entire confidence in 
 God, into a peaceful prospect of the great salvation God is now about 
 to work for you. Hold your peace; you need not so much as give a shout 
 against the enemy, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:16">Josh. vi. 16</A>.

 The work shall be done without any concurrence of yours." Note, 

 (1.) If God himself bring his people into straits, he will himself
 discover a way to bring them out again. 

 (2.) In times of great difficulty and great expectation, it is our
 wisdom to keep our spirits calm, quiet, and sedate; for then we are in 
 the best frame both to do our own work and to <I>consider the work of 
 God. Your strength is to sit still</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:7">Isa. xxx. 7</A>),

 <I>for the Egyptians shall help in vain,</I> and threaten to hurt in
 vain.</P>

 the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on
 dry <I>ground</I> through the midst of the sea.
 &nbsp; 17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
 and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon
 Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
 horsemen.
 &nbsp; 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I
 have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon

 &nbsp; 19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
 removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
 from before their face, and stood behind them:
 &nbsp; 20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
 of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness <I>to them,</I> but it gave
 light by night <I>to these:</I> so that the one came not near the
 other all the night.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Direction given to Israel's leader.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he must do himself. He must, for the present, leave off 
 praying, and apply himself to his business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Wherefore cryest thou unto me?</I> Moses, though he was assured of a 
 good issue to the present distress, yet did not neglect prayer. We
 read not of one word he said in prayer, but he lifted up to God his 
 heart, the language of which God well understood and took notice of. 
 Moses's silent prayers of faith prevailed more with God than Israel's 
 loud outcries of fear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Note, 

 (1.) Praying, if of the right kind, is <I>crying to God,</I> which 
 denotes it to be the language both of a natural and of an importunate 
 desire. 

 (2.) To quicken his diligence. Moses had something else to do besides
 praying; he was to command the hosts of Israel, and it was now 
 requisite that he should be at his post. <I>Every thing is beautiful in 
 its season.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he must order Israel to do. <I>Speak to them, that they go 
 forward.</I> Some think that Moses had prayed, not so much for their 
 deliverance (he was assured of that) as for the pardon of heir 
 murmurings, and that God's ordering them to go forward was an 
 intimation of the pardon. There is no going forward with any comfort 
 but in the sense of our reconciliation to God. Moses had bidden them 
 stand still, and expect orders from God; and now orders are given. They 
 thought they must have been directed either to the right hand or to the 
 left. "No," says God, "speak to them to go forward, directly to the 
 sea-side;" as if there had lain a fleet of transport-ships ready for 
 them to embark in. Note, When we are in the way of our duty, though we 
 met with difficulties, we must go forward, and not stand in mute 
 astonishment; we must mind present work and then leave the even to God, 
 use means and trust him with the issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What he might expect God to do. Let the children of Israel go as far 
 as they can upon dry ground, and then God will divide the sea, and open 
 a passage for them through it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 God designs, not only to deliver the Israelites, but to destroy the 
 Egyptians; and the plan of his counsels is accordingly. 

 (1.) He will show favour to Israel; the waters shall be divided for
 them to pass through,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The same power could have congealed the waters for them to pass over; 
 but Infinite Wisdom chose rather to divide the waters for them to pass 
 through; for that way of salvation is always pitched upon which is most 
 humbling. Thus it is said, with reference to this
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:13,14">Isa. lxiii. 13, 14</A>),

 <I>He led them through the deep, as a beast goes down into the 
 valley,</I> and thus <I>made himself a glorious name.</I> 

 (2.) He will get him honour upon Pharaoh. If the due rent of honour be
 not paid to the great landlord, by and from whom we have and hold our 
 beings and comforts, he will distrain for it, and recover it. God will 
 be a loser by no man. In order to this, it is threatened: <I>I, behold 
 I, will harden Pharaoh's heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The manner of expression is observable: <I>I, behold I, will do it.</I> 
 "I, that may do it;" so it is the language of his sovereignty. We may
 not contribute to the hardening of any man's heart, nor withhold any 
 thing that we can do towards the softening of it; but God's grace is 
 his own, <I>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will 
 be hardeneth.</I> "I, that can do it;" so it is the language of his 
 power; none but the Almighty can make the heart soft 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:16">Job xxiii. 16</A>),

 nor can any other being make it hard. "I, that will do it;" for it is
 the language of his justice; it is a righteous thing with God to put 
 those under the impressions of his wrath who have long resisted the 
 influences of his grace. It is spoken in a way of triumph over this 
 obstinate and presumptuous rebel: "<I>I even I,</I> will take an 
 effectual course to humble him; he shall break that would not bend." It 
 is an expression like that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>),

 <I>Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A guard set upon Israel's camp where it now lay most exposed, which 
 was <I>in the rear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 <I>The angel of God,</I> whose ministry was made use of in the pillar 
 of cloud and fire, went from <I>before the camp of Israel,</I> where 
 they did not now need a guide (there was no danger of missing their way
 through the sea, nor needed they any other word of command than to go 
 forward), and it came behind them, where now they needed a guard (the 
 Egyptians being just ready to seize the hindmost of them), and so was a 
 wall of partition between them. There it was of use to the Israelites, 
 not only to protect them, but to light them through the sea, and, at 
 the same time, it confounded the Egyptians, so that they lost sight of 
 their prey just when they were ready to lay hands on it. The word and 
 providence of God have a black and dark side towards sin and sinners, 
 but a bright and pleasant side towards those that are Israelites 
 indeed. That which is a savour of life unto life to some is a savour of 
 death unto death to others. This was not the first time that he who in
 the beginning divided between light and darkness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:4">Gen. i. 4</A>),

 and still forms both

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7">Isa. xlv. 7</A>),

 had, at the same time, allotted darkness to the Egyptians and light to
 the Israelites, a specimen of the endless distinction which will be 
 made between the inheritance of the saints in light and that utter 
 darkness which for ever will be the portion of hypocrites. God will 
 separate between the precious and the vile.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 caused the sea to go <I>back</I> by a strong east wind all that night,
 and made the sea dry <I>land,</I> and the waters were divided.
 &nbsp; 22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea
 upon the dry <I>ground:</I> and the waters <I>were</I> a wall unto them on
 their right hand, and on their left.
 &nbsp; 23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the
 midst of the sea, <I>even</I> all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and
 his horsemen.
 &nbsp; 24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire
 and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
 &nbsp; 25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
 heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of
 Israel; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
 &nbsp; 26 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over
 the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
 their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
 &nbsp; 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
 returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
 Egyptians fled against it; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> overthrew the Egyptians
 in the midst of the sea.
 &nbsp; 28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
 horsemen, <I>and</I> all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
 after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
 &nbsp; 29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry <I>land</I> in the
 midst of the sea; and the waters <I>were</I> a wall unto them on their
 right hand, and on their left.
 &nbsp; 30 Thus the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saved Israel that day out of the hand of the

 Egyptians: and the people feared the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and believed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the history of that work of wonder which is so often 
 mentioned both in the Old and New Testament, the dividing of the Red 
 Sea before the children of Israel. It was the terror of the Canaanites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9,10">Josh. ii. 9, 10</A>),

 the praise and triumph of the Israelites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:3,Ps+106:9,136:13,14">Ps. cxiv. 3; 
 cvi. 9; cxxxvi. 13, 14</A>.

 It was a type of baptism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1,2">1 Cor. x. 1, 2</A>.

 Israel's passage through it was typical of the conversion of souls

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:15">Isa. xi. 15</A>),

 and the Egyptians' perdition in it was typical of the final ruin of all
 impenitent sinners,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:14">Rev. xx. 14</A>.

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An instance of God's almighty power in the kingdom of nature, in 
 dividing the sea, and opening a passage through the waters. It was a 
 bay, or gulf, or arm of the sea, two or three leagues over, which was 
 divided, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The instituted sign made use of was Moses's stretching out his hand 
 over it, to signify that it was done in answer to his prayer, for the 
 confirmation of his mission, and in favour to the people whom he led. 
 The natural sign was a strong east wind, signifying that it was done by 
 the power of God, whom the winds and the seas obey. If there be any
 passage in the book of Job which has reference to the miracles wrought 
 for Israel's deliverance out of Egypt, it is that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:12">Job xxvi. 12</A>,

 <I>He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
 smileth through Rahab</I> (so the word is), that is, Egypt. Note, God 
 can bring his people through the greatest difficulties, and force a way 
 where he does not find it. The God of nature has not tied himself to 
 its laws, but, when he pleases, dispenses with them, and then the fire 
 does not burn, nor the water flow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An instance of his wonderful favour to his Israel. They went 
 through the sea to the opposite shore, for I cannot suppose, with some, 
 that they fetched a compass, and came out again on the same side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They <I>walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 And the pillar of cloud, <I>that glory of the Lord,</I> being their 
 <I>rearward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:8">Isa. lviii. 8</A>),

 that the Egyptians might not charge them in the flank, the <I>waters
 were a wall to them</I> (it is twice mentioned) <I>on their right hand 
 and on their left.</I> Moses and Aaron, it is probable, ventured first 
 into this untrodden path, and then all Israel after them; and this 
 march through the paths of the great waters would make their march 
 afterwards, through the wilderness, less formidable. Those who had 
 followed God through the sea needed not to fear following him 
 whithersoever he led them. This march through the sea was in the night, 
 and not a moon-shiny night, for it was seven days after the full moon, 
 so that they had no light but what they had from the pillar of cloud 
 and fire. This made it the more awful; but where God leads us he will 
 light us; while we follow his conduct, we shall not want his 
 comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This was done, and recorded, in order to encourage God's people in all 
 ages to trust in him in the greatest straits. What cannot he do who did 
 this? What will not he do for those that fear and love him who did this
 for these murmuring unbelieving Israel is, who yet were <I>beloved for 
 their fathers' sake,</I> and for the sake of a remnant among them? We 
 find the saints, long afterwards, making themselves sharers in the 
 triumphs of this march 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:6">Ps. lxvi. 6</A>):

 <I>They went through the flood on foot; there did we rejoice in
 him:</I> and see how this work of wonder is improved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:11,16,19">Ps. lxxvii. 11, 16, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An instance of his just and righteous wrath upon his and his 
 people's enemies, the Egyptians. Observe here, 

 1. How they were infatuated. In the heat of their pursuit, they went 
 after the Israelites <I>into the midst of the sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "Why," thought they, "may not we venture where Israel did?" Once or 
 twice the magicians of Egypt had done what Moses did, with their 
 enchantments; Pharaoh remembered this, but forgot how they were 
 nonplussed at last. They were more advantageously provided with
 chariots and horses, while the Israelites were on foot. Pharaoh had 
 said, <I>I know not the Lord;</I> and by this it appeared he did not, 
 else he would not have ventured thus. None so bold as those that are 
 blind. Rage against Israel made them thus daring and inconsiderate: 
 they had long hardened their own hearts; and now God hardened them to 
 their ruin, and hid from their eyes the things that belonged to their 
 peace and safety. <I>Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of
 any bird</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:17">Prov. i. 17</A>);

 yet so blind were the Egyptians that they <I>hastened to the
 snare,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:23">Prov. vii. 23</A>.

 Note, The ruin of sinners is brought on by their own presumption, which
 hurries them headlong into the pit. They are self-destroyers. 

 2. How they were troubled and perplexed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 For some hours they marched through the divided waters as safely and 
 triumphantly as Israel did, not doubting but, that, in a little time, 
 they should gain their point. But, <I>in the morning watch, the Lord 
 looked upon the host of the Egyptians, and troubled them.</I> Something 
 or other they saw or heard from the pillar of cloud and fire which put 
 them into great consternation, and gave them an apprehension of their 
 ruin before it was brought upon them. Now it appeared that the 
 <I>triumphing of the wicked is short,</I> and that God has ways to 
 frighten sinners into despair, before he plunges them into destruction.
 <I>He cuts off the spirit of princes, and is terrible to the kings of 
 the earth.</I> 

 (1.) They had hectored and boasted as if the day were their own; but
 now they were troubled and dismayed, struck with a panic-fear. 

 (2.) They had driven furiously; but now they drove heavily, and found
 themselves plugged and embarrassed at every step; the way grew deep, 
 their hearts grew sad, their wheels dropped off, and the axle-trees 
 failed. Thus can God check the violence of those that are in pursuit of 
 his people. 

 (3.) They had been flying upon the back of Israel, as the hawk upon the
 trembling dove; but now they cried, <I>Let us flee from the face of 
 Israel,</I> which had become to them <I>like a torch of fire in a 
 sheaf,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6">Zech. xii. 6</A>.

 Israel has now, all of a sudden, become as much a terror to them as
 they had been to Israel. They might have let Israel alone and would
 not; now they would flee from the face of Israel and cannot. Men will 
 not be convinced, till it is too late, that those who meddle with God's 
 people meddle to their own hurt; when the Lord shall come with ten 
 thousands of his saints, to execute judgment, the mighty men will in 
 vain seek to shelter themselves under rocks and mountains <I>from the 
 face of Israel</I> and Israel's King, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>.

 Compare with this story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:20">Job xxvii. 20</A>,

 &c.

 3. How they were all drowned. As soon as ever the children of Israel
 had got safely to the shore, Moses was ordered to <I>stretch out his 
 hand over the sea,</I> and thereby give a signal to the waters to close 
 again, as before, upon the word of command, they had <I>opened to the
 right and the left,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He did so, and immediately the waters returned to their place, and 
 overwhelmed all the host of the Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 Pharaoh and his servants, who had hardened one another in sin, now fell 
 together, and not one escaped. An ancient tradition says that Pharaoh's 
 magicians, Jannes and Jambres, perished with the rest, as Balaam with 
 the Midianites whom he had seduced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:8">Num. xxxi. 8</A>.

 And now,

 (1.) God avenged upon the Egyptians the blood of the firstborn whom
 they had drowned: and the principal is repaid with interest, it is 
 recompensed double, full-grown Egyptians for newborn Israelites; thus 
 the Lord is righteous, and precious is his people's blood in his sight,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 (2.) God reckoned with Pharaoh for all his proud and insolent conduct
 towards Moses his ambassador. Mocking the messengers of the Lord, and
 playing the fool with them, bring ruin without remedy. Now God <I>got
 him honour upon Pharaoh,</I> looking upon that proud man, and abasing 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job. xl. 12</A>.

 Come and see the desolations he made, and write it, not in water, but
 with an iron pen in the rock for ever. Here lies that bloody tyrant
 who bade defiance to his Maker, to his demands, threatenings, and 
 judgments; a rebel to God, and a slave to his own barbarous passions; 
 perfectly lost to humanity, virtue, and all true honour; here he lies, 
 buried in the deep, a perpetual monument of divine justice. Here he 
 went down to the pit, though he was the terror of the mighty in the 
 land of the living. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:18">Ezek. xxxi. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the notice which the Israelites took of this wonderful work 
 which God wrought for them, and the good impressions which it made upon 
 them for the present.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They saw the Egyptians dead upon the sands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Providence so ordered it that the next tide threw up the dead bodies,

 (1.) For the greater disgrace of the Egyptians. Now the beasts and 
 birds of prey were called to <I>eat the flesh of the captains and 
 mighty men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18">Rev. xix. 17, 18</A>.

 The Egyptians were very nice and curious in embalming and preserving
 the bodies of their great men, but here the utmost contempt is poured
 upon all the grandees of Egypt; see how they lie, heaps upon heaps, as
 dung upon the face of the earth.

 (2.) For the greater triumph of the Israelites, and to affect them the
 more with their deliverance; for the eye affects the heart. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24">Isa. lxvi. 24</A>,

 <I>They shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
 that have transgressed against me.</I> Probably they stripped the slain 
 and, having borrowed jewels of their neighbours before, which (the 
 Egyptians having by this hostile pursuit of them broken their faith 
 with them) henceforward they were not under any obligation to restore, 
 they now got arms from them, which, some think, they were not before 
 provided with. Thus, when God broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces, 
 <I>he gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The sight of this great work greatly affected them, and now they 
 <I>feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Now they were ashamed of their distrusts and murmurings, and, in the 
 good mind they were in, they would never again despair of help from 
 Heaven, no, not in the greatest straits; they would never again quarrel 
 with Moses, nor talk of returning to Egypt. They were now baptized unto 
 Moses in the sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2">1 Cor. x. 2</A>.

 This great work which God wrought for them by the ministry of Moses
 bound them effectually to follow his directions, under God. This 
 confirmed their faith in the promises that were yet to be fulfilled; 
 and, being brought thus triumphantly out of Egypt, they did not doubt 
 that they should be in Canaan shortly, having such a God to trust to, 
 and such a mediator between them and him. O that there had been such a 
 heart in them as now there seemed to be! Sensible mercies, when they
 are fresh, make sensible impressions; but with many these impressions 
 soon wear off: while they see God's works, and feel the benefit of 
 them, they fear him and trust in him; but they soon forget his works, 
 and then they slight him. How well were it for us if we were always in 
 as good a frame as we are in sometimes!</P>
