 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The story of this chapter is perhaps as sad a story (all things 
 considered) as any we have in all the Bible. In the foregoing 
 chapters we have had the pleasant view of the holiness and happiness 
 of our first parents, the grace and favour of God, and 
 the peace and beauty of the whole creation, all good, very good; 
 but here the scene is altered. We have here an account of the 
 sin and misery of our first parents, the wrath and curse of God 
 against them, the peace of the creation disturbed, and its 
 beauty stained and sullied, all bad, very bad. "How has the 
 gold become dim, and the most fine gold changed!" O that our 
 hearts were deeply affected with this record! For we are all 
 nearly concerned in it; let it not be to us as a tale that is told. 
 The general contents of this chapter we have 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Rom. v. 12</A>),
 "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
 death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." More
 particularly, we have here,

 I. The innocent tempted,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The tempted transgressing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. The transgressors arraigned,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 IV. Upon their arraignment, convicted,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 V. Upon their conviction, sentenced,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>.

 VI. After sentence, reprieved,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 VII. Notwithstanding their reprieve, execution in part done,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.
 And, were it not for the gracious intimations here given of redemption
 by the promised seed, they, and all their degenerate guilty 
 race, would have been left to endless despair.</P></FONT>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now the serpent was more subtle 
 than any beast of the field which 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God had made. And he 
 said unto the woman, Yea, hath God 
 said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of 
 the garden?
 &nbsp; 2 And the woman said 
 unto the serpent, We may eat of the 
 fruit of the trees of the garden:
 &nbsp; 3 But of the fruit of the tree which <I>is</I> 
 in the midst of the garden, God hath 
 said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither 
 shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 the serpent said unto the woman, Ye 
 shall not surely die:
 &nbsp; 5 For God 
 doth know that in the day ye eat 
 thereof, then your eyes shall be 
 opened, and ye shall be as gods, 
 knowing good and evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the temptation 
 with which Satan assaulted our first 
 parents, to draw them into sin, and which 
 proved fatal to them. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tempter, and that was the devil, in 
 the shape and likeness of a serpent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is certain it was the devil that beguiled 
 Eve. The devil and Satan is the old 
 serpent 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:9">Rev. xii. 9</A>),
 a malignant spirit, by 
 creation an angel of light and an immediate 
 attendant upon God's throne, but by sin become 
 an apostate from his first state and a 
 rebel against God's crown and dignity. 
 Multitudes of the angels fell; but this that 
 attacked our first parents was surely the 
 prince of the devils, the ring-leader in the 
 rebellion: no sooner was he a sinner than 
 he was a Satan, no sooner a traitor than a 
 tempter, as one enraged against God and his 
 glory and envious of man and his happiness. 
 He knew he could not destroy man but by 
 debauching him. Balaam could not curse 
 Israel, but he could tempt Israel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:14">Rev. ii. 14</A>.
 The game therefore which Satan had to play 
 was to draw our first parents to sin, and so 
 to separate between them and their God. 
 Thus the devil was, from the beginning, a 
 murderer, and the great mischief-maker. 
 The whole race of mankind had here, as 
 it were, but one neck, and at that Satan
 struck. The adversary and enemy is that 
 wicked one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was the devil in the likeness of a 
 serpent. Whether it was only the visible 
 shape and appearance of a serpent (as some 
 think those were of which we read, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:12">Exod. vii. 12</A>),
 or whether it was a real living serpent, 
 actuated and possessed by the devil, is not 
 certain: by God's permission it might be 
 either. The devil chose to act his part in a 
 serpent, 
 
 (1.) Because it is a specious creature, 
 has a spotted dappled skin, and then 
 went erect. Perhaps it was a flying serpent, 
 which seemed to come from on high as a 
 messenger from the upper world, one of the 
 seraphim; for the fiery serpents were flying, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:29">Isa. xiv. 29</A>.
 Many a dangerous temptation 
 comes to us in gay fine colours that are but 
 skin-deep, and seems to come from above; 
 for Satan can seem an angel of light. And, 
 
 (2.) Because it is a subtle creature; this is 
 here taken notice of. Many instances are 
 given of the subtlety of the serpent, both to 
 do mischief and to secure himself in it when 
 it is done. We are directed to be wise as 
 serpents. But this serpent, as actuated by 
 the devil, was no doubt more subtle than 
 any other; for the devil, though he has lost 
 the sanctity, retains the sagacity of an angel, 
 and is wise to do evil. He knew of more 
 advantage by making use of the serpent than 
 we are aware of. Observe, There is not any 
 thing by which the devil serves himself and 
 his own interest more than by unsanctified 
 subtlety. What Eve thought of this serpent 
 speaking to her we are not likely to 
 tell, when I believe she herself did not know 
 what to think of it. At first, perhaps, she 
 supposed it might be a good angel, and yet, 
 afterwards, she might suspect something 
 amiss. It is remarkable that the Gentile 
 idolaters did many of them worship the devil 
 in the shape and form of a serpent, thereby 
 avowing their adherence to that apostate 
 spirit, and wearing his colours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The person tempted was the woman, 
 now alone, and at a distance from her husband, 
 but near the forbidden tree. It was 
 the devil's subtlety, 
 
 1. To assault the weaker 
 vessel with his temptations. Though perfect 
 in her kind, yet we may suppose her 

 <A NAME="Page22"> </A>

 inferior to Adam in knowledge, and strength, 
 and presence of mind. Some think Eve 
 received the command, not immediately from 
 God, but at second hand by her husband, and 
 therefore might the more easily be persuaded 
 to discredit it. 
 
 2. It was his policy to enter 
 into discourse with her when she was alone. 
 Had she kept close to the side out of which she 
 was lately taken, she would not have been so 
 much exposed. There are many temptations, 
 to which solitude gives great advantage; 
 but the communion of saints contributes 
 much to their strength and safety. 
 
 3. He 
 took advantage by finding her near the forbidden 
 tree, and probably gazing upon the 
 fruit of it, only to satisfy her curiosity. Those 
 that would not eat the forbidden fruit must 
 not come near the forbidden tree. <I>Avoid it, 
 pass not by it,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:15">Prov. iv. 15</A>.

 4. Satan tempted 
 Eve, that by her he might tempt Adam; so 
 he tempted Job by his wife, and Christ by 
 Peter. It is his policy to send temptations 
 by unsuspected hands, and theirs that have 
 most interest in us and influence upon us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The temptation itself, and the artificial 
 management of it. We are often, in scripture, 
 told of our danger by the temptations 
 of Satan, his <I>devices</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:11">2 Cor. ii. 11</A>),
 his <I>depths</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24">Rev. ii. 24</A>),
 his <I>wiles,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:11">Eph. vi. 11</A>.
 The greatest instances we have of them are in 
 his tempting of the two Adams, here, and 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1-11">Matt. iv</A>.
 In this he prevailed, but in that 
 he was baffled. What he spoke <I>to</I> them, of 
 whom he had no hold by any corruption in 
 them, he speaks <I>in</I> us by our own deceitful 
 hearts and their carnal reasonings; this 
 makes his assaults on us less discernible, but 
 not less dangerous. That which the devil 
 aimed at was to persuade Eve to cut forbidden 
 fruit; and, to do this, he took the same method 
 that he does still. He questioned whether 
 it was a sin or no, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 He denied that 
 there was any danger in it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 He suggested 
 much advantage by it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 And these 
 are his common topics.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He questioned whether it was a sin or 
 no to eat of this tree, and whether really the 
 fruit of it was forbidden. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He said to the woman, Yea, hath God 
 said, You shall not eat?</I> The first word intimated 
 something said before, introducing 
 this, and with which it is connected, perhaps 
 some discourse Eve had with herself, which 
 Satan took hold of, and grafted this question 
 upon. In the chain of thoughts one thing 
 strangely brings in another, and perhaps 
 something bad at last. Observe here, 
 
 [1.] He does not discover his design at first, but 
 puts a question which seemed innocent: "I 
 hear a piece of news, pray is it true? has 
 God forbidden you to eat of this tree?" 
 Thus he would begin a discourse, and draw 
 her into a parley. Those that would be safe 
 have need to be suspicious, and shy of talking 
 with the tempter. 
 
 [2.] He quotes the command 
 fallaciously, as if it were a prohibition, 
 not only of that tree, but of all. God had 
 said, <I>Of every tree you may eat, except one.</I> 
 He, by aggravating the exception, endeavours 
 to invalidate the concession: <I>Hath God said, 
 You shall not eat of every tree?</I> The divine 
 law cannot be reproached unless it be first 
 misrepresented. 
 
 [3.] He seems to speak it 
 tauntingly, upbraiding the woman with her 
 shyness of meddling with that tree; as if he 
 had said, "You are so nice and cautious, and 
 so very precise, because God has said, You
 shall not eat." The devil, as he is a liar, so 
 he is a scoffer, from the beginning: and the 
 scoffers of the last days are his children. 
 
 [4.] That which he aimed at in the first onset was 
 to take off her sense of the obligation of the 
 command. "Surely you are mistaken, it 
 cannot be that God should tie you out from 
 this tree; he would not do so unreasonable 
 a thing." See here, That it is the subtlety 
 of Satan to blemish the reputation of the 
 divine law as uncertain or unreasonable, and 
 so to draw people to sin; and that it is therefore 
 our wisdom to keep up a firm belief of,
 and a high respect for, the command of God. 
 Has God said, "You shall not lie, nor take 
 his name in vain, nor be drunk," &c.? "Yes, 
 I am sure he has, and it is well said, and by 
 his grace I will abide by it, whatever the 
 tempter suggests to the contrary."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In answer to this question the woman 
 gives him a plain and full account of the law 
 they were under, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 Here observe, 
 
 [1.] It was her weakness to enter into discourse 
 with the serpent. She might have 
 perceived by his question that he had no 
 good design, and should therefore have started 
 back with a <I>Get thee behind me, Satan, thou 
 art an offence to me.</I> But her curiosity, and 
 perhaps her surprise, to hear a serpent speak, 
 led her into further talk with him. Note, It 
 is a dangerous thing to treat with a temptation, 
 which ought at first to be rejected with 
 disdain and abhorrence. The garrison that 
 sounds a parley is not far from being surrendered. 
 Those that would be kept from harm 
 must keep out of harm's way. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:7,19:27">Prov. xiv. 7; xix. 27</A>.

 [2.] It was her wisdom to 
 take notice of the liberty God had granted 
 them, in answer to his sly insinuation, as if 
 God has put them into paradise only to tantalize 
 them with the sight of fair but forbidden 
 fruits. "Yea," says she, "we may eat of the 
 fruit of the trees, thanks to our Maker, we
 have plenty and variety enough allowed us."
 Note, To prevent our being uneasy at the restraints
 of religion, it is good often to take a 
 view of the liberties and comforts of it. 
 
 [3.] It was an instance of her resolution that she 
 adhered to the command, and faithfully repeated 
 it, as of unquestionable certainty: 
 "<I>God hath said,</I> I am confident he hath said 
 it, You shall not eat of the fruit of this tree;" 
 and that which she adds, <I>Neither shall you 
 touch it,</I> seems to have been with a good intention, 
 not (as some think) tacitly to reflect
 upon the command as too strict (<I>Touch not,
 taste not and handle not</I>), but to make a fence

 <A NAME="Page23"> </A>

 about it: "We must not eat, therefore we 
 will not touch. It is forbidden in the highest 
 degree, and the authority of the prohibition 
 is sacred to us." 
 
 [4.] She seems a little to 
 waver about the threatening, and is not so 
 particular and faithful in the repetition of 
 that as of the precept. God has said, <I>In the 
 day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;</I>
 all she makes of that is, <I>Lest you die.</I> Note, 
 Wavering faith and wavering resolutions 
 give great advantage to the tempter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He denies that there was any danger in 
 it, insisting that, though it might be the 
 transgressing of a precept, yet it would not 
 be the incurring of a penalty: <I>You shall not 
 surely die,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 "You shall not <I>dying die,</I>" 
 so the word is, in direct contradiction to what 
 God had said. Either, 
 
 (1.) "It is not certain 
 that you shall die," so some. "It is not so 
 sure as you are made to believe it is." Thus 
 Satan endeavours to shake that which he cannot 
 overthrow, and invalidates the force of 
 divine threatenings by questioning the certainty 
 of them; and, when once it is supposed 
 possible that there may be falsehood 
 or fallacy in any word of God, a door is then 
 opened to downright infidelity. Satan teaches 
 men first to doubt and then to deny; he makes 
 them sceptics first, and so by degrees makes 
 them atheists. Or, 
 
 (2.) "It is certain you 
 shall not die," so others. He avers his contradiction 
 with the same phrase of assurance 
 that God had used in ratifying the threatening. 
 He began to call the precept in question 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 but, finding that the woman adhered 
 to that, he quitted that battery, and made his 
 second onset upon the threatening, where he 
 perceived her to waver; for he is quick to 
 spy all advantages, and to attack the wall 
 where it is weakest: <I>You shall not surely die.</I> 
 This was a lie, a downright lie; for, 
 
 [1.] It 
 was contrary to the word of God, which we 
 are sure is true. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:21,27">1 John ii. 21, 27</A>.
 It was such a lie as gave the lie to God himself. 
 
 [2.] It was contrary to his own knowledge. 
 When he told them there was no danger in 
 disobedience and rebellion he said that which 
 he knew, by woeful experience, to be false. 
 He had broken the law of his creation, and 
 had found, to his cost, that he could not prosper 
 in it; and yet he tells our first parents 
 they shall not die. He concealed his own 
 misery, that he might draw them into the 
 like: thus he still deceives sinners into their 
 own ruin. He tells them that, though they 
 sin, they shall not die; and gains credit 
 rather than God, who tells them, <I>The wages 
 of sin is death.</I> Note, Hope of impunity is 
 a great support to all iniquity, and impenitency 
 in it. <I>I shall have peace, though I walk 
 in the imagination of my heart,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:19">Deut. xxix. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He promises them advantage by it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 Here he follows his blow, and it was a blow 
 at the root, a fatal blow to the tree we are 
 branches of. He not only would undertake 
 that they should be no losers by it, thus 
 binding himself to save them from harm; 
 but (if they would be such fools as to venture 
 upon the security of one that had himself become 
 a bankrupt) he undertakes they shall 
 be gainers by it, unspeakable gainers. He 
 could not have persuaded them to run the 
 hazard of ruining themselves if he had not 
 suggested to them a great probability of bettering 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He insinuates to them the great improvements 
 they would make by eating of 
 this fruit. And he suits the temptation to 
 the pure state they were now in, proposing 
 to them, not any carnal pleasures or gratifications, 
 but intellectual delights and satisfactions. 
 These were the baits with which 
 he covered his hook. 
 
 [1.] "<I>Your eyes shall 
 be opened;</I> you shall have much more of the 
 power and pleasure of contemplation than 
 now you have; you shall fetch a larger compass 
 in your intellectual views, and see further 
 into things than now you do." He 
 speaks as if now they were but dim-sighted, 
 and short-sighted, in comparison of what 
 they would be then. 
 
 [2.] "<I>You shall be as 
 gods,</I> as <I>Elohim,</I> mighty gods; not only 
 omniscient, but omnipotent too;" or, "You 
 shall be as God himself, equal to him, rivals 
 with him; you shall be sovereigns and no 
 longer subjects, self-sufficient and no longer 
 dependent." A most absurd suggestion! As 
 if it were possible for creatures of yesterday 
 to be like their Creator that was from eternity. 
 
 [3.] "You shall know <I>good and evil,</I> that is, 
 every thing that is desirable to be known." 
 To support this part of the temptation, he 
 abuses the name given to this tree: it was intended 
 to teach the practical knowledge of 
 good and evil, that is, of duty and disobedience; 
 and it would prove the experimental 
 knowledge of good and evil, that is, of happiness 
 and misery. In these senses, the 
 name of the tree was a warning to them not 
 to eat of it; but he perverts the sense of it, 
 and wrests it to their destruction, as if this 
 tree would give them a speculative notional 
 knowledge of the natures, kinds, and originals, 
 of good and evil. And, 
 
 [4.] All this 
 presently: "<I>In the day you eat thereof</I> you 
 will find a sudden and immediate change for 
 the better." Now in all these insinuations 
 he aims to beget in them, <I>First,</I> Discontent 
 with their present state, as if it were not so 
 good as it might be, and should be. Note, 
 No condition will of itself bring contentment,
 unless the mind be brought to it. Adam was 
 not easy, no, not in paradise, nor the angels 
 in their first state, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6">Jude 6</A>.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Ambition 
 of preferment, as if they were fit to be 
 gods. Satan had ruined himself by desiring 
 to be like the Most High 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:14">Isa. xiv. 14</A>),
 and therefore seeks to infect our first parents with 
 the same desire, that he might ruin them too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He insinuates to them that God had 
 no good design upon them, in forbidding 
 them this fruit: "<I>For God doth know</I> how 
 much it will advance you; and therefore, in 
 envy and ill-will to you, he hath forbidden 

 <A NAME="Page24"> </A>

 it:" as if he durst not let them eat of that 
 tree because then they would know their own 
 strength, and would not continue in an inferior 
 state, but be able to cope with him; or 
 as if he grudged them the honour and happiness 
 to which their eating of that tree 
 would prefer them. Now, 
 
 [1.] This was a 
 great affront to God, and the highest indignity 
 that could be done him, a reproach to 
 his power, as if he feared his creatures, and 
 much more a reproach to his goodness, as if 
 he hated the work of his own hands and 
 would not have those whom he has made to 
 be made happy. Shall the best of men think 
 it strange to be misrepresented and evil 
 spoken of, when God himself is so? Satan, as 
 he is the accuser of the brethren before God, so 
 he accuses God before the brethren; thus he 
 sows discord, and is the father of those that 
 do so. 
 
 [2.] It was a most dangerous snare 
 to our first parents, as it tended to alienate 
 their affections from God, and so to withdraw 
 them from their allegiance to him. 
 Thus still the devil draws people into his interest 
 by suggesting to them hard thoughts 
 of God, and false hopes of benefit and advantage 
 by sin. Let us therefore, in opposition 
 to him, always think well of God as the best 
 good, and think ill of sin as the worst of 
 evils: thus let us resist the devil, and he will 
 flee from us.</P>

 Here we see what Eve's parley with the 
 tempter ended in. Satan, at length, gains 
 his point, and the strong-hold is taken by his 
 wiles. God tried the obedience of our first 
 parents by forbidding them the tree of knowledge, 
 and Satan does, as it were, join issue 
 with God, and in that very thing undertakes 
 to seduce them into a transgression; and 
 here we find how he prevailed, God permitting 
 it for wise and holy ends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the inducements that 
 moved them to transgress. The woman, being 
 deceived by the tempter's artful management, 
 was ringleader in the transgression, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:14">1 Tim. ii. 14</A>.
 She was first in the fault; and it 
 was the result of her consideration, or rather 
 her inconsideration. 
 
 1. She saw no harm in 
 this tree, more than in any of the rest. It 
 was said of all the rest of the fruit-trees with 
 which the garden of Eden was planted that 
 they were <I>pleasant to the sight, and good for 
 food,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:9"><I>ch.</I> ii. 9</A>.
 Now, in her eye, this was 
 like all the rest. It seemed as good for food 
 as any of them, and she saw nothing in the 
 colour of its fruit that threatened death or 
 danger; it was as pleasant to the sight as 
 any of them, and therefore, "What hurt could 
 it do them? Why should this be forbidden 
 them rather than any of the rest?" 
 Note, When there is thought to be no 
 more harm in forbidden fruit than in other 
 fruit sin lies at the door, and Satan soon 
 carries the day. Nay, perhaps it seemed to 
 her to be better for food, more grateful to 
 the taste, and more nourishing to the body, 
 than any of the rest, and to her eye it was 
 more pleasant than any. We are often betrayed 
 into snares by an inordinate desire to 
 have our senses gratified. Or, if it had nothing 
 in it more inviting than the rest, yet it 
 was the more coveted because it was prohibited. 
 Whether it was so in her or not, we 
 find that in us (that is, in our flesh, in our 
 corrupt nature) there dwells a strange spirit 
 of contradiction. <I>Nitimur in vetitum--We 
 desire what is prohibited.</I> 
 
 2. She imagined 
 more virtue in this tree than in any of the rest, 
 that it was a tree not only not to be dreaded, 
 but <I>to be desired to make one wise,</I> and therein 
 excelling all the rest of the trees. This she 
 <I>saw,</I> that is, she perceived and understood 
 it by what the devil had said to her; and 
 some think that she saw the serpent eat 
 of that tree, and that he told her he thereby 
 had gained the faculties of speech and reason, 
 whence she inferred its power to make one wise, 
 and was persuaded to think, "If it 
 made a brute creature rational, why might 
 it not make a rational creature divine?" 
 See here how the desire of unnecessary 
 knowledge, under the mistaken notion of 
 wisdom, proves hurtful and destructive to 
 many. Our first parents, who knew so 
 much, did not know this--that they knew 
 enough. Christ is a tree to be desired to 
 make one wise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:3,1Co+1:30">Col. ii. 3; 1 Cor. i. 30</A>.
 Let us, by faith, feed upon him, that we may be 
 wise to salvation. In the heavenly paradise, 
 the tree of knowledge will not be a forbidden 
 tree; for there we shall know as we are 
 known. Let us therefore long to be there, 
 and, in the mean time, not exercise ourselves 
 in things too high or too deep for us, nor 
 covet to be wise above what is written.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The steps of the transgression, not steps 
 upward, but downward towards the pit--steps 
 that take hold on hell. 
 
 1. She <I>saw.</I> 
 She should have turned away her eyes from 
 beholding vanity; but she enters into 
 temptation, by looking with pleasure on the 
 forbidden fruit. Observe, A great deal of 

 <A NAME="Page25"> </A>
 
 sin comes in at the eyes. At these windows 
 Satan throws in those fiery darts which 
 pierce and poison the heart. The eye affects 
 the heart with guilt as well as grief. Let us 
 therefore, with holy Job, make a covenant 
 with our eyes, not to look on that which we 
 are in danger of lusting after, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31,Mt+5:28">Prov. xxiii. 31; Matt. v. 28</A>.
 Let the fear of God be 
 always to us for a covering of the eyes, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16"><I>ch.</I> xx. 16</A>.

 2. <I>She took.</I> It was her own act 
 and deed. The devil did not take it, and put 
 it into her mouth, whether she would or no; 
 but she herself took it. Satan may tempt, 
 but he cannot force; may persuade us to 
 cast ourselves down, but he cannot cast us 
 down, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:6">Matt. iv. 6</A>.
 Eve's taking was stealing, 
 like Achan's taking the accursed thing, 
 taking that to which she had no right. Surely 
 she took it with a trembling hand. 
 
 3. She <I>did eat.</I> Perhaps she did not intend, when 
 she looked, to take, nor, when she took, to 
 eat; but this was the result. Note, The 
 way of sin is downhill; a man cannot stop 
 himself when he will. The beginning of it 
 is as the breaking forth of water, to which it 
 is hard to say, "Hitherto thou shalt come 
 and no further." Therefore it is our wisdom 
 to suppress the first emotions of sin, 
 and to leave it off before it be meddled with. 
 <I>Obsta principiis--Nip mischief in the bud.</I> 
 
 4. She <I>gave also to her husband with her.</I> It is 
 probable that he was not with her when she was 
 tempted (surely, if he had, he would have interposed 
 to prevent the sin), but came to her 
 when she had eaten, and was prevailed upon 
 by her to eat likewise; for it is easier to learn 
 that which is bad than to teach that which is 
 good. She gave it to him, persuading him 
 with the same arguments that the serpent 
 had used with her, adding this to all the rest,
 that she herself had eaten of it, and found it 
 so far from being deadly that it was extremely 
 pleasant and grateful. <I>Stolen waters are 
 sweet.</I> She gave it to him, under colour of 
 kindness--she would not eat these delicious 
 morsels alone; but really it was the greatest 
 unkindness she could do him. Or perhaps 
 she gave it to him that, if it should prove 
 hurtful, he might share with her in the 
 misery, which indeed looks strangely unkind, 
 and yet may, without difficulty, be 
 supposed to enter into the heart of one that 
 had eaten forbidden fruit. Note, Those 
 that have themselves done ill are commonly 
 willing to draw in others to do the same. 
 As was the devil, so was Eve, no sooner a 
 sinner than a tempter. 
 
 5. <I>He did eat,</I> overcome 
 by his wife's importunity. It is needless 
 to ask, "What would have been the 
 consequence if Eve only had transgressed?" 
 The wisdom of God, we are sure, would have 
 decided the difficulty, according to equity; 
 but, alas! the case was not so; Adam also 
 did eat. "And what great harm if he did?" 
 say the corrupt and carnal reasonings of a 
 vain mind. What harm! Why, this act 
 involved disbelief of God's word, together 
 with confidence in the devil's, discontent 
 with his present state, pride in his own 
 merits, and ambition of the honour which 
 comes not from God, envy at God's perfections, 
 and indulgence of the appetites of the 
 body. In neglecting the tree of life of which 
 he was allowed to eat, and eating of the tree 
 of knowledge which was forbidden, he plainly 
 showed a contempt of the favours God had 
 bestowed on him, and a preference given to 
 those God did not see fit for him. He would 
 be both his own carver and his own master, 
 would have what he pleased and do what 
 he pleased: his sin was, in one word, <I>disobedience</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:19">Rom. v. 19</A>),
 disobedience to a 
 plain, easy, and express command, which 
 probably he knew to be a command of trial. 
 He sinned against great knowledge, against 
 many mercies, against light and love, the 
 clearest light and the dearest love that ever
 sinner sinned against. He had no corrupt 
 nature within him to betray him; but had a 
 freedom of will, not enslaved, and was in his 
 full strength, not weakened or impaired. 
 He turned aside quickly. Some think he 
 fell the very day on which he was made; 
 but I see not how to reconcile this with God's 
 pronouncing all <I>very good</I> in the close of the 
 day. Others suppose he fell on the sabbath 
 day: the better day the worse deed. However, 
 it is certain that he kept his integrity 
 but a very little while: being in honour, he 
 continued not. But the greatest aggravation 
 of his sin was that he involved all his posterity 
 in sin and ruin by it. God having 
 told him that his race should replenish the 
 earth, surely he could not but know that he 
 stood as a public person, and that his disobedience 
 would be fatal to all his seed; 
 and, if so, it was certainly both the greatest 
 treachery and the greatest cruelty that ever 
 was. The human nature being lodged entirely 
 in our first parents, henceforward it could 
 not but be transmitted from them under an 
 attainder of guilt, a stain of dishonour, and 
 an hereditary disease of sin and corruption. 
 And can we say, then, that Adam's sin had 
 but little harm in it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The ultimate consequences of the 
 transgression. Shame and fear seized the 
 criminals, <I>ipso facto--in the fact itself;</I> these 
 came into the world along with sin, and still 
 attend it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Shame seized them unseen, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The strong convictions they fell under, 
 in their own bosoms: <I>The eyes of them both 
 were opened.</I> It is not meant of the eyes of 
 the body; these were open before, as appears 
 by this, that the sin came in at them. Jonathan's 
 eyes were enlightened by eating forbidden 
 fruit 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:27">1 Sam. xiv. 27</A>),
 that is, he was 
 refreshed and revived by it; but theirs were 
 not so. Nor is it meant of any advances 
 made hereby in true knowledge; but the eyes 
 of their consciences were opened, their hearts 
 smote them for what they had done. Now, 

 <A NAME="Page26"> </A>

 when it was too late, they saw the folly of 
 eating forbidden fruit. They saw the happiness 
 they had fallen from, and the misery 
 they had fallen into. They saw a loving God 
 provoked, his grace and favour forfeited, his 
 likeness and image lost, dominion over the 
 creatures gone. They saw their natures corrupted 
 and depraved, and felt a disorder in 
 their own spirits of which they had never 
 before been conscious. They saw a law in 
 their members warring against the law of 
 their minds, and captivating them both to 
 sin and wrath. They saw, as Balaam, when 
 <I>his eyes were opened</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:31">Num. xxii. 31</A>),
 the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and 
 his sword drawn in his hand; and perhaps 
 they saw the serpent that had abused them 
 insulting over them. The text tells us that 
 they saw <I>that they were naked,</I> that is, 
 
 [1.] That they were stripped, deprived of all the 
 honours and joys of their paradise-state, and 
 exposed to all the miseries that might justly 
 be expected from an angry God. They were 
 disarmed; their defence had departed from 
 them. 
 
 [2.] That they were shamed, for ever 
 shamed, before God and angels. They saw 
 themselves disrobed of all their ornaments 
 and ensigns of honour, degraded from their 
 dignity and disgraced in the highest degree, 
 laid open to the contempt and reproach of 
 heaven, and earth, and their own consciences. 
 Now see here, <I>First,</I> What a dishonour and 
 disquietment sin is; it makes mischief wherever 
 it is admitted, sets men against themselves 
 disturbs their peace, and destroys all 
 their comforts. Sooner or later, it will have 
 shame, either the shame of true repentance, 
 which ends in glory, or that shame and everlasting 
 contempt to which the wicked shall 
 rise at the great day. Sin is a reproach to 
 any people. <I>Secondly,</I> What deceiver Satan 
 is. He told our first parents, when he 
 tempted them, that their eyes should be 
 opened; and so they were, but not as they 
 understood it; they were opened to their 
 shame and grief, not to their honour nor advantage. 
 Therefore, when he speaks fair, 
 believe him not. The most malicious mischievous
 liars often excuse themselves with 
 this, that they only equivocate; but God 
 will not so excuse them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sorry shift they made to palliate 
 these convictions, and to arm themselves 
 against them: <I>They sewed,</I> or platted, <I>fig-leaves 
 together;</I> and to cover, at least, part of their 
 shame from one another, they <I>made themselves
 aprons.</I> See here what is commonly 
 the folly of those that have sinned. 
 
 [1.] That they are more solicitous to save their 
 credit before men than to obtain their pardon 
 from God; they are backward to confess their 
 sin, and very desirous to conceal it, as much 
 as may be. <I>I have sinned, yet honour me.</I> 
 
 [2.] That the excuses men make, to cover 
 and extenuate their sins, are vain and frivolous. 
 Like the aprons of fig-leaves, they 
 make the matter never the better, but the 
 worse; the shame, thus hidden, becomes the 
 more shameful. Yet thus we are all apt to 
 <I>cover our transgressions as Adam,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33">Job xxxi. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Fear seized them immediately upon their 
 eating the forbidden fruit, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Observe here, 
 
 (1.) What was the cause and occasion 
 of their fear: They <I>heard the voice of the Lord 
 God walking in the garden in the cool of the 
 day.</I> It was the approach of the Judge that 
 put them into a fright; and yet he came in 
 such a manner as made it formidable only to 
 guilty consciences. It is supposed that he 
 came in a human shape, and that he who 
 judged the world now was the same that 
 shall judge the world at the last day, even 
 <I>that man whom God has ordained.</I> He appeared 
 to them now (it should seem) in no 
 other similitude than that in which they had 
 seen him when he put them into paradise; 
 for he came to convince and humble them, 
 not to amaze and terrify them. He came 
 into the garden, not descending immediately 
 from heaven in their view, as afterwards on 
 mount Sinai (making either thick darkness 
 his pavilion or the flaming fire his chariot), 
 but he came into the garden, as one that was 
 still willing to be familiar with them. He 
 came walking, not running, not riding upon 
 the wings of the wind, but walking deliberately, 
 as one slow to anger, teaching us, 
 when we are ever so much provoked, not to 
 be hot nor hasty, but to speak and act considerately 
 and not rashly. He came in the 
 cool of the day, not in the night, when all 
 fears are doubly fearful, nor in the heat of 
 day, for he came not in the heat of his anger. 
 <I>Fury is not in him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa. xxvii. 4</A>.
 Nor did 
 he come suddenly upon them; but they 
 heard his voice at some distance, giving 
 them notice of his coming, and probably it 
 was a still small voice, like that in which he 
 came to enquire after Elijah. Some think 
 they heard him discoursing with himself concerning 
 the sin of Adam, and the judgment 
 now to be passed upon him, perhaps as he 
 did concerning Israel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,9">Hos. xi. 8, 9</A>.
 <I>How shall I give thee up?</I> Or, rather, they heard 
 him calling for them, and coming towards 
 them. 
 
 (2.) What was the effect and evidence 
 of their fear: <I>They hid themselves from the 
 presence of the Lord God</I>--a sad change! 
 Before they had sinned, if they had heard 
 the voice of the Lord God coming towards 
 them, they would have run to meet him, and 
 with a humble joy welcomed his gracious 
 visits. But, now that it was otherwise, God 
 had become a terror to them, and then no 
 marvel that they had become a terror to themselves, 
 and were full of confusion. Their 
 own consciences accused them, and set their 
 sin before them in its proper colours. Their 
 fig-leaves failed them, and would do them 
 no service. God had come forth against 
 them as an enemy, and the whole creation 
 was at war with them; and as yet they knew 
 not of any mediator between them and an 
 angry God, so that nothing remained but a 

 <A NAME="Page27"> </A>

 certain fearful looking for of judgment. In 
 this fright they hid themselves among the 
 bushes; having offended, they fled for the 
 same. Knowing themselves guilty, they 
 durst not stand a trial, but absconded, and 
 fled from justice. See here, 
 
 [1.] The falsehood 
 of the tempter, and the frauds and fallacies 
 of his temptations. He promised them 
 they should be safe, but now they cannot so 
 much as think themselves so; he said they 
 should not die, and yet now they are forced 
 to fly for their lives; he promised them they 
 should be advanced, but they see themselves 
 a based--never did they seem so little as now; 
 he promised them they should be knowing, 
 but they see themselves at a loss, and know 
 not so much as where to hide themselves; 
 he promised them they should be as gods, 
 great, and bold, and daring, but they are as
 criminals discovered, trembling, pale, and 
 anxious to escape: they would not be subjects, 
 and so they are prisoners. 
 
 [2.] The folly 
 of sinners, to think it either possible or desirable 
 to hide themselves from God: can 
 they conceal themselves from the Father of 
 lights?
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7-13">Ps. cxxxix. 7</A>,
 &c.;
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:24">Jer. xxiii. 24</A>.
 Will they withdraw themselves from the fountain 
 of life, who alone can give help and 
 happiness? 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:8">Jon. ii. 8</A>.
 
 [3.] The fear that 
 attends sin. All that amazing fear of God's 
 appearances, the accusations of conscience, 
 the approaches of trouble, the assaults of inferior 
 creatures, and the arrests of death, 
 which is common among men, is the effect 
 of sin. Adam and Eve, who were partners 
 in the sin, were sharers in the shame and fear 
 that attended it; and though hand joined in 
 hand (hands so lately joined in marriage), yet 
 could they not animate nor fortify one another: 
 miserable comforters they had become 
 to each other!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God called unto
 Adam, and said unto him, Where <I>art</I> 
 thou?
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, I heard thy 
 voice in the garden, and I was afraid, 
 because I <I>was</I> naked; and I hid 
 myself.
 </FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the arraignment of these 
 deserters before the righteous Judge of 
 heaven and earth, who, though he is not tied 
 to observe formalities, yet proceeds against 
 them with all possible fairness, that he may 
 be justified when he speaks. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The startling question with which God 
 pursued Adam and arrested him: <I>Where art 
 thou?</I> Not as if God did not know where 
 he was; but thus he would enter the process 
 against him. "Come, where is this foolish 
 man?" Some make it a bemoaning question: 
 "Poor Adam, what has become of thee?" 
 "<I>Alas for thee!</I>" (so some read it) "<I>How 
 art thou fallen, Lucifer, son of the morning!</I> 
 Thou that wast my friend and favourite, 
 whom I had done so much for, and would 
 have done so much more for; hast thou now 
 forsaken me, and ruined thyself? Has it 
 come to this?" It is rather an upbraiding 
 question, in order to his conviction and 
 humiliation: <I>Where art thou?</I> Not, In what 
 <I>place?</I> but, In what <I>condition?</I> "Is this all 
 thou hast gotten by eating forbidden fruit? 
 Thou that wouldest vie with me, dost thou 
 now fly from me?" Note, 
 
 1. Those who by 
 sin have gone astray from God should seriously 
 consider where they are; they are afar 
 off from all good, in the midst of their 
 enemies, in bondage to Satan, and in the high 
 road to utter ruin. This enquiry after Adam 
 may be looked upon as a gracious pursuit, in 
 kindness to him, and in order to his recovery. 
 If God had not called to him, to reclaim him, 
 his condition would have been as desperate
 as that of fallen angels; this lost sheep would 
 have wandered endlessly, if the good Shepherd 
 had not sought after him, to bring him 
 back, and, in order to that, reminded him 
 where he was, where he should not be, and 
 where he could not be either happy or easy. 
 Note, 
 
 2. If sinners will but consider where 
 they are, they will not rest till they return to 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The trembling answer which Adam 
 gave to this question: <I>I heard thy voice in 
 the garden, and I was afraid,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 He does 
 not own his guilt, and yet in effect confesses 
 it by owning his shame and fear; but it is 
 the common fault and folly of those that have 
 done an ill thing, when they are questioned 
 about it, to acknowledge no more than what 
 is so manifest that they cannot deny it. 
 Adam was afraid, because he was naked; 
 not only unarmed, and therefore afraid to 
 contend with God, but unclothed, and therefore 
 afraid so much as to appear before him. 
 We have reason to be afraid of approaching 
 to God if we be not clothed and fenced with 
 the righteousness of Christ, for nothing but 
 this will be armour of proof and cover the 
 shame of our nakedness. Let us therefore 
 <I>put on the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> and then draw 
 near with humble boldness.</P>

 of the tree, whereof I commanded thee 
 that thou shouldest not eat?
 &nbsp; 12 And 
 the man said, The woman whom thou 
 gavest <I>to be</I> with me, she gave me of 
 the tree, and I did eat.
 &nbsp; 13 And the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God said unto the woman,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the offenders found guilty 
 by their own confession, and yet endeavouring 
 to excuse and extenuate their fault. They 
 could not confess and justify what they had 
 done, but they confess and palliate it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How their confession was extorted from 

 <A NAME="Page28"> </A>

 them. God put it to the man: <I>Who told 
 thee that thou wast naked?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 "How camest thou to be sensible of thy nakedness 
 as thy shame?" <I>Hast thou eaten of the forbidden 
 tree?</I> Note, Though God knows all 
 our sins, yet he will know them from us, 
 and requires from us an ingenuous confession 
 of them; not that he may be informed, 
 but that we may be humbled. In this examination, 
 God reminds him of the command 
 he had given him: "I commanded thee not 
 to eat of it, I thy Maker, I thy Master, I thy 
 benefactor; I commanded thee to the contrary." 
 Sin appears most plain and most 
 sinful in the glass of the commandment, 
 therefore God here sets it before Adam; and 
 in it we should see our faces. The question 
 put to the woman was, <I>What is this that thou 
 hast done?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 "Wilt thou also own thy 
 fault, and make confession of it? And wilt 
 thou see what an evil thing it was?" Note, 
 It concerns those who have eaten forbidden 
 fruit themselves, and especially those who 
 have enticed others to eat it likewise, seriously 
 to consider what they have done. In eating 
 forbidden fruit, we have offended a great and 
 gracious God, broken a just and righteous 
 law, violated a sacred and most solemn covenant, 
 and wronged our own precious souls 
 by forfeiting God's favour and exposing ourselves 
 to his wrath and curse: in enticing 
 others to eat of it, we do the devil's work, 
 make ourselves guilty of other men's sins, 
 and accessory to their ruin. <I>What is this 
 that we have done?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How their crime was extenuated by 
 them in their confession. It was to no 
 purpose to plead <I>not guilty.</I> The show of 
 their countenances testified against them; 
 therefore they become their own accusers: 
 "<I>I did eat,</I>" says the man, "And so did I," 
 says the woman; for when God judges he 
 will overcome. But these do not look like 
 penitent confessions; for instead of aggravating 
 the sin, and taking shame to themselves, 
 they excuse the sin, and lay the shame 
 and blame on others. 
 
 1. Adam lays all the 
 blame upon his wife. "She gave me of the 
 tree, and pressed me to eat of it, which I did, 
 only to oblige her"--a frivolous excuse. He 
 ought to have taught her, not to have been 
 taught by her; and it was no hard matter to 
 determine which of the two he must be ruled 
 by, his God or his wife. Learn, hence, never 
 to be brought to sin by that which will not 
 bring us off in the judgment; let not that
 bear us up in the commission which will not 
 bear us out in the trial; let us therefore 
 never be overcome by importunity to act 
 against our consciences, nor ever displease 
 God, to please the best friend we have in the 
 world. But this is not the worst of it. He
 not only lays the blame upon his wife, but
 expresses it so as tacitly to reflect on God 
 himself: "It is the woman whom thou gavest 
 me, and gavest to be with me as my companion, 
 my guide, and my acquaintance; she 
 gave me of the tree, else I had not eaten of 
 it." Thus he insinuates that God was accessory
 to his sin: he gave him the woman, 
 and she gave him the fruit; so that he seemed 
 to have it at but one remove from God's own 
 hand. Note, There is a strange proneness 
 in those that are tempted to say that they 
 are tempted of God, as if our abusing God's 
 gifts would excuse our violation of God's 
 laws. God gives us riches, honours, and 
 relations, that we may serve him cheerfully 
 in the enjoyment of them; but, if we 
 take occasion from them to sin against him, 
 instead of blaming Providence for putting us 
 into such a condition, we must blame ourselves 
 for perverting the gracious designs of 
 Providence therein. 
 
 2. Eve lays all the blame 
 upon the serpent: <I>The serpent beguiled me.</I> 
 Sin is a brat that nobody is willing to own, 
 a sign that it is a scandalous thing. Those 
 that are willing enough to take the pleasure 
 and profit of sin are backward enough to 
 take the blame and shame of it. "The 
 serpent, that subtle creature of thy making, 
 which thou didst permit to come into paradise 
 to us, he beguiled me," or <I>made me to 
 err;</I> for our sins are our errors. Learn 
 hence, 
 
 (1.) That Satan's temptations are all 
 beguilings, his arguments are all fallacies, his 
 allurements are all cheats; when he speaks 
 fair, believe him not. Sin deceives us, and, 
 by deceiving, cheats us. It is by the <I>deceitfulness 
 of sin</I> that the heart is hardened. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:11,Heb+3:13">Rom. vii. 11; Heb. iii. 13</A>.
 
 (2.) That 
 though Satan's subtlety drew us into sin, yet
 it will not justify us in sin: though he is the 
 tempter, we are the sinners; and indeed it 
 is our own lust that draws us aside and 
 entices us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:14">Jam. i. 14</A>.
 Let it not therefore 
 lessen our sorrow and humiliation for sin 
 that we are beguiled into it; but rather let 
 it increase our self-indignation that we should 
 suffer ourselves to be beguiled by a known 
 cheat and a sworn enemy. Well, this is all 
 the prisoners at the bar have to say why 
 sentence should not be passed and execution 
 awarded, according to law; and this <I>all</I> is 
 next to nothing, in some respects worse than 
 nothing.</P>

 The prisoners being found guilty by their 
 own confession, besides the personal and infallible

 material being offered in arrest of judgment, 

 <A NAME="Page29"> </A>

 God immediately proceeds to pass sentence; 
 and, in these verses, he begins (where the sin 
 began) with the serpent. God did not examine 
 the serpent, nor ask him what he had 
 done nor why he did it; but immediately 
 sentenced him, 
 
 1. Because he was already 
 convicted of rebellion against God, and his 
 malice and wickedness were notorious, not 
 found by secret search, but openly avowed 
 and declared as Sodom's. 
 
 2. Because he 
 was to be for ever excluded from all hope of 
 pardon; and why should any thing be said 
 to convince and humble him who was to find 
 no place for repentance? His wound was 
 not searched, because it was not to be cured. 
 Some think the condition of the fallen angels 
 was not declared desperate and helpless, 
 until now that they had seduced man into 
 the rebellion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sentence passed upon the tempter 
 may be considered as lighting upon the serpent, 
 the brute-creature which Satan made 
 use of which was, as the rest, made for the 
 service of man, but was now abused to his 
 hurt. Therefore, to testify a displeasure
 against sin, and a jealousy for the injured 
 honour of Adam and Eve, God fastens a 
 curse and reproach upon the serpent, and 
 makes it to groan, being burdened. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20">Rom. viii. 20</A>.
 The devil's instruments must share 
 in the devil's punishments. Thus the bodies 
 of the wicked, though only instruments of 
 unrighteousness, shall partake of everlasting 
 torments with the soul, the principal agent. 
 Even the ox that killed a man must be 
 stoned, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:28,29">Exod. xxi. 28, 29</A>.
 See here how 
 God hates sin, and especially how much displeased 
 he is with those who entice others 
 into sin. It is a perpetual brand upon Jeroboam's 
 name <I>that he made Israel to sin.</I> 
 Now, 
 
 1. The serpent is here laid under the 
 curse of God: <I>Thou art cursed above all 
 cattle.</I> Even the creeping things, when God 
 made them, were blessed of him 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:22"><I>ch.</I> i. 22</A>),
 but sin turned the blessing into a curse. 
 <I>The serpent was more subtle than any beast of the 
 field</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 and here, <I>cursed above every 
 beast of the field.</I> Unsanctified subtlety 
 often proves a great curse to a man; and the 
 more crafty men are to do evil the more 
 mischief they do, and, consequently, they 
 shall receive the greater damnation. Subtle 
 tempters are the most accursed creatures 
 under the sun. 2. He is here laid under 
 man's reproach and enmity. 
 
 (1.) He is to 
 be for ever looked upon as a vile and despicable 
 creature, and a proper object of scorn 
 and contempt: "<I>Upon thy belly thou shalt 
 go,</I> no longer upon feet, or half erect, but 
 thou shalt crawl along, thy belly cleaving to 
 the earth," an expression of a very abject 
 miserable condition, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:25">Ps. xliv. 25</A>;
 "and thou 
 shalt not avoid eating dust with thy meat." 
 His crime was that he tempted Eve to eat 
 that which she should not; his punishment 
 was that he was necessitated to eat that which 
 he would not: <I>Dust thou shalt eat.</I> This 
 denotes not only a base and despicable condition, 
 but a mean and pitiful spirit; it is 
 said of those whose courage has departed 
 from them that they <I>lick the dust like a serpent,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:17">Mic. vii. 17</A>.
 How sad it is that the 
 serpent's curse should be the covetous worldling's 
 choice, whose character it is that he 
 <I>pants after the dust of the earth!</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:7">Amos ii. 7</A>.
 These choose their own delusions, and so 
 shall their doom be. 
 
 (2.) He is to be for ever 
 looked upon as a venomous noxious creature, 
 and a proper object of hatred and detestation: 
 <I>I will put enmity between thee and the 
 woman.</I> The inferior creatures being made 
 for man, it was a curse upon any of them to 
 be turned against man and man against 
 them; and this is part of the serpent's curse. 
 The serpent is hurtful to man, and often 
 bruises his heel, because it can reach no 
 higher; nay, notice is taken of his biting the 
 horses' heels, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:17"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 17</A>.
 But man is victorious 
 over the serpent, and bruises his 
 head, that is, gives him a mortal wound, 
 aiming to destroy the whole generation of 
 vipers. It is the effect of this curse upon 
 the serpent that, though that creature is 
 subtle and very dangerous, yet it prevails not 
 (as it would if God gave it commission) to 
 the destruction of mankind. This sentence 
 pronounced upon the serpent is much fortified 
 by that promise of God to his people, 
 <I>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13">Ps. xci. 13</A>),
 and that of Christ to his disciples, 
 <I>They shall take up serpents</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:18">Mark xvi. 18</A>),
 witness Paul, who was unhurt by the 
 viper that fastened upon his hand. Observe 
 here, The serpent and the woman had just 
 now been very familiar and friendly in discourse 
 about the forbidden fruit, and a wonderful 
 agreement there was between them; 
 but here they are irreconcilably set at variance. 
 Note, Sinful friendships justly end in 
 mortal feuds: those that unite in wickedness 
 will not unite long.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This sentence may be considered as 
 levelled at the devil, who only made use of 
 the serpent as his vehicle in this appearance, 
 but was himself the principal agent. He 
 that spoke through the serpent's mouth is 
 here struck at through the serpent's side, and 
 is principally intended in the sentence, which, 
 like the pillar of cloud and fire, has a dark 
 side towards the devil and a bright side 
 towards our first parents and their seed. 
 Great things are contained in these words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A perpetual reproach is here fastened 
 upon that great enemy both to God and 
 man. Under the cover of the serpent, he is 
 here sentenced to be, 
 
 (1.) Degraded and 
 accursed of God. It is supposed that the sin 
 which turned angels into devils was pride, 
 which is here justly punished by a great 
 variety of mortifications couched under the 
 mean circumstances of a serpent crawling 
 on his belly and licking the dust. <I>How art 
 thou fallen, O Lucifer!</I> He that would be 
 above God, and would head a rebellion 

 <A NAME="Page30"> </A>

 against him, is justly exposed here to contempt 
 and lies to be trodden on; a man's 
 pride will bring him low, and God will 
 humble those that will not humble themselves. 
 
 (2.) Detested and abhorred of all 
 mankind. Even those that are really seduced
 into his interest yet profess a hatred 
 and abhorrence of him; and all that are 
 born of God make it their constant care to 
 keep themselves, that this wicked one touch 
 them not, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18">1 John v. 18</A>.
 He is here condemned 
 to a state of war and irreconcilable 
 enmity. 
 
 (3.) Destroyed and ruined at last 
 by <I>the great Redeemer,</I> signified by the 
 breaking of his head. His subtle politics 
 shall all be baffled, his usurped power shall 
 be entirely crushed, and he shall be for ever 
 a captive to the injured honour of divine 
 sovereignty. By being told of this now he 
 was tormented before the time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A perpetual quarrel is here commenced 
 between the kingdom of God and the kingdom 
 of the devil among men; war is proclaimed 
 between the seed of the woman and 
 the seed of the serpent. That war in heaven 
 between Michael and the dragon began now, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:7">Rev. xii. 7</A>.
 It is the fruit of this enmity, 
 
 (1.) That there is a continual conflict between 
 grace and corruption in the hearts of God's 
 people. Satan, by their corruptions, assaults 
 them, buffets them, sifts them, and seeks to 
 devour them; they, by the exercise of their 
 graces, resist him, wrestle with him, quench 
 his fiery darts, force him to flee from them. 
 Heaven and hell can never be reconciled, 
 nor light and darkness; no more can Satan 
 and a sanctified soul, for these are contrary 
 the one to the other. 
 
 (2.) That there is 
 likewise a continual struggle between the 
 wicked and the godly in this world. Those 
 that love God account those their enemies 
 that hate him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:21,22">Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22</A>.
 And all 
 the rage and malice of persecutors against 
 the people of God are the fruit of this 
 enmity, which will continue while there is a 
 godly man on this side heaven, and a wicked 
 man on this side hell. <I>Marvel not therefore 
 if the world hate you,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:13">1 John iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A gracious promise is here made of 
 Christ, as the deliverer of fallen man from 
 the power of Satan. Though what was said 
 was addressed to the serpent, yet it was said 
 in the hearing of our first parents, who, 
 doubtless, took the hints of grace here given 
 them, and saw a door of hope opened to 
 them, else the following sentence upon 
 themselves would have overwhelmed them. 
 Here was the dawning of the gospel day. 
 No sooner was the wound given than the 
 remedy was provided and revealed. Here, 
 <I>in the head of the book,</I> as the word is 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7">Heb. x. 7</A>),
 in the beginning of the Bible, it is 
 written of Christ, that he should <I>do the will 
 of God.</I> By faith in this promise, we have 
 reason to think, our first parents, and the 
 patriarchs before the flood, were justified 
 and saved and to this promise, and the 
 benefit of it, instantly serving God day and 
 night, they hoped to come. Notice is here 
 given them of three things concerning Christ:--
 
 (1.) His incarnation, that he should 
 be <I>the seed of the woman,</I> the seed of <I>that</I> 
 woman; therefore his genealogy 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:1-38">Luke iii.</A>)
 goes so high as to show him to be the son 
 of Adam, but God does the woman the 
 honour to call him rather her seed, because 
 she it was whom the devil had beguiled, 
 and on whom Adam had laid the blame; 
 herein God magnifies his grace, in that, 
 though the woman was first in the transgression, 
 yet she shall be saved <I>by</I> child-bearing 
 (as some read it), that is, by the 
 promised seed who shall descend from her, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:15">1 Tim. ii. 15</A>.
 He was likewise to be the 
 seed of a woman only, of a virgin, that he 
 might not be tainted with the corruption of 
 our nature; he was sent forth, <I>made of a 
 woman</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>),
 that this promise might 
 be fulfilled. It is a great encouragement to 
 sinners that their Saviour <I>is the seed of the 
 woman, bone of our bone,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11,14">Heb. ii. 11, 14</A>.
 Man is therefore sinful and unclean, because 
 he is <I>born of a woman</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:4">Job xxv. 4</A>),
 and therefore <I>his days are full of trouble,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:1">Job xiv. 1</A>.
 But the seed of the woman was 
 made sin and a curse for us, so saving us 
 from both. 
 
 (2.) His sufferings and death, 
 pointed at in Satan's <I>bruising his heel,</I> that 
 is, his human nature. Satan tempted Christ 
 in the wilderness, to draw him into sin; and 
 some think it was Satan that terrified Christ 
 in his agony, to drive him to despair. It 
 was the devil that put it into the heart of 
 Judas to betray Christ, of Peter to deny him, 
 of the chief priests to prosecute him, of the 
 false witnesses to accuse him, and of Pilate 
 to condemn him, aiming in all this, by destroying 
 the Saviour, to ruin the salvation; 
 but, on the contrary, it was by death that 
 Christ <I>destroyed him that had the power of 
 death,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>.
 Christ's heel was bruised 
 when his feet were pierced and nailed to the 
 cross, and Christ's sufferings are continued 
 in the sufferings of the saints for his name. 
 The devil tempts them, casts them into 
 prison, persecutes and slays them, and so 
 bruises the heel of Christ, who is afflicted in 
 their afflictions. But, while the heel is 
 bruised on earth, it is well that the head is 
 safe in heaven. 
 
 (3.) His victory over 
 Satan thereby. Satan had now trampled 
 upon the woman, and insulted over her; but 
 the seed of the woman should be raised up 
 in the fulness of time to avenge her quarrel, 
 and to trample upon him, to spoil him, to 
 lead him captive, and to <I>triumph over him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.
 <I>He shall bruise his head,</I> that is, 
 he shall destroy all his politics and all his 
 powers, and give a total overthrow to his 
 kingdom and interest. Christ baffled Satan's 
 temptations, rescued souls out of his hands, 
 cast him out of the bodies of people, dispossessed 
 the strong man armed, and divided 
 his spoil: by his death, he gave a fatal and 
 
 <A NAME="Page31"> </A>

 incurable blow to the devil's kingdom, a 
 wound to the head of this beast, that can 
 never be healed. As his gospel gets ground, 
 <I>Satan falls</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:18">Luke x. 18</A>)
 and is <I>bound,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:2">Rev. xx. 2</A>.
 By his grace, he treads Satan under 
 his people's feet 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20">Rom. xvi. 20</A>)
 and will 
 shortly cast him into the lake of fire, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:10">Rev. xx. 10</A>.
 And the devil's perpetual overthrow 
 will be the complete and everlasting joy and 
 glory of the chosen remnant.</P>

 </FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sentence passed upon 
 the woman for her sin. Two things she is 
 condemned to: a state of sorrow, and a state 
 of subjection, proper punishments of a sin in 
 which she had gratified her pleasure and her 
 pride.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. She is here put into a state of sorrow, 
 one particular of which only is specified, that 
 in bringing forth children; but it includes 
 all those impressions of grief and fear which 
 the mind of that tender sex is most apt to 
 receive, and all the common calamities 
 which they are liable to. Note, Sin brought 
 sorrow into the world; it was this that made 
 the world a vale of tears, brought showers 
 of trouble upon our heads, and opened 
 springs of sorrows in our hearts, and so 
 deluged the world: had we known no guilt, 
 we should have known no grief. The pains 
 of child-bearing, which are great to a proverb, 
 a scripture proverb, are the effect of 
 sin; every pang and every groan of the travailing 
 woman speak aloud the fatal consequences 
 of sin: this comes of eating forbidden 
 fruit. Observe, 
 
 1. The sorrows are 
 here said to be multiplied, <I>greatly multiplied.</I> 
 All the sorrows of this present time are so; 
 many are the calamities which human life is 
 liable to, of various kinds, and often repeated, 
 the clouds returning after the rain, 
 and no marvel that our sorrows are multiplied 
 when our sins are: both are innumerable 
 evils. The sorrows of child-bearing 
 are multiplied; for they include, not only the 
 travailing throes, but the indispositions 
 before (it is sorrow from the conception), 
 and the nursing toils and vexations after; 
 and after all, if the children prove wicked 
 and foolish, they are, more than ever, the 
 heaviness of her that bore them. Thus are 
 the sorrows multiplied; as one grief is over, 
 another succeeds in this world. 
 
 2. It is God 
 that multiplies our sorrows: <I>I will do it.</I> 
 God, as a righteous Judge, does it, which 
 ought to silence us under all our sorrows; as 
 many as they are, we have deserved them all, 
 and more: nay, God, as a tender Father, 
 does it for our necessary correction, that we 
 may be humbled for sin, and weaned from 
 the world by all our sorrows; and the good 
 we get by them, with the comfort we have 
 under them, will abundantly balance our sorrows, 
 how greatly soever they are multiplied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She is here put into a state of subjection. 
 The whole sex, which by creation was 
 equal with man, is, for sin, made inferior, 
 and forbidden to <I>usurp authority,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:11,12">1 Tim. ii. 11, 12</A>.
 The wife particularly is hereby put 
 under the dominion of her husband, and is 
 not <I>sui juris--at her own disposal,</I> of which see 
 an instance in that law, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:6-8">Num. xxx. 6-8</A>,
 where the husband is empowered, if he 
 please, to disannul the vows made by the 
 wife. This sentence amounts only to that 
 command, <I>Wives, be in subjection to your 
 own husbands;</I> but the entrance of sin has 
 made that duty a punishment, which otherwise 
 it would not have been. If man had 
 not sinned, he would always have ruled with 
 wisdom and love; and, if the woman had not 
 sinned, she would always have obeyed with 
 humility and meekness; and then the dominion 
 would have been no grievance: but 
 our own sin and folly make our yoke heavy. 
 If Eve had not eaten forbidden fruit herself, 
 and tempted her husband to eat it, she 
 would never have complained of her subjection; 
 therefore it ought never to be complained
 of, though harsh; but sin must be 
 complained of, that made it so. Those wives 
 who not only despise and disobey their husbands, 
 but domineer over them, do not consider 
 that they not only violate a divine law, 
 but thwart a divine sentence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe here how mercy is mixed 
 with wrath in this sentence. The woman 
 shall have sorrow, but it shall be in bringing 
 forth children, and the sorrow shall be <I>forgotten 
 for joy that a child is born,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21">John xvi. 21</A>.
 She shall be subject, but it shall be to 
 her own husband that loves her, not to a 
 stranger, or an enemy: the sentence was not 
 a curse, to bring her to ruin, but a chastisement, 
 to bring her to repentance. It was well 
 that enmity was not put between the man 
 and the woman, as there was between the 
 serpent and the woman.</P>

 thou taken: for dust thou <I>art,</I> and 
 unto dust shalt thou return.

 <A NAME="Page32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sentence passed upon 
 Adam, which is prefaced with a recital of his 
 crime: <I>Because thou hast hearkened to the 
 voice of thy wife,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 He excused the 
 fault, by laying it on his wife: <I>She gave it 
 me.</I> But God does not admit the excuse. 
 She could but tempt him, she could not 
 force him; though it was her fault to persuade 
 him to eat, it was his fault to hearken 
 to her. Thus men's frivolous pleas will, in 
 the day of God's judgment, not only be 
 overruled, but turned against them, and 
 made the grounds of their sentence. <I>Out of 
 thine own mouth will I judge thee.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God put marks of his displeasure on 
 Adam in three instances:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His habitation is, by this sentence, 
 cursed: <I>Cursed is the ground for thy sake;</I> 
 and the effect of that curse is, <I>Thorns and 
 thistles shall it bring forth unto thee.</I> It is 
 here intimated that his habitation should be 
 changed; he should no longer dwell in a 
 distinguished, blessed, paradise, but should 
 be removed to common ground, and that 
 cursed. The ground, or earth, is here put 
 for the whole visible creation, which, by the 
 sin of man, is made subject to vanity, the 
 several parts of it being not so serviceable to 
 man's comfort and happiness as they were 
 designed to be when they were made, and 
 would have been if he had not sinned. God 
 gave the earth to the children of men, designing 
 it to be a comfortable dwelling to 
 them. But sin has altered the property of it. 
 It is now cursed for man's sin; that is, it is 
 a dishonourable habitation, it bespeaks man 
 mean, that his foundation is in the dust; it 
 is a dry and barren habitation, its spontaneous 
 productions are now weeds and briers, something
 nauseous or noxious; what good fruits 
 it produces must be extorted from it by the 
 ingenuity and industry of man. Fruitfulness 
 was its blessing, for man's service 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:11,29"><I>ch.</I> i. 11, 29</A>),
 and now barrenness was its curse, 
 for man's punishment. It is not what it
 was in the day it was created. Sin turned a 
 fruitful land into barrenness; and man, 
 having become as the wild ass's colt, has the 
 wild ass's lot, <I>the wilderness for his habitation,</I> 
 and the <I>barren land his dwelling,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:6,Ps+68:6">Job xxxix. 6; Ps. lxviii. 6</A>.
 Had not this curse been in part 
 removed, for aught I know, the earth would 
 have been for ever barren, and never produced 
 any thing but thorns and thistles. The 
 ground is <I>cursed,</I> that is, doomed to destruction 
 at the end of time, when the earth, and 
 <I>all the works that are therein, shall be burnt up</I> 
 for the sin of man, the measure of whose 
 iniquity will then be full, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:7,10">2 Pet. iii. 7, 10</A>.
 But observe a mixture of mercy in this sentence. 
 
 (1.) Adam himself is not cursed, as 
 the serpent was 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 but only the ground 
 for his sake. God had blessings in him, even 
 the holy seed: <I>Destroy it not, for that blessing 
 is in it,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.
 And he had blessings 
 in store for him; therefore he is not directly 
 and immediately cursed, but, as it were, at 
 second hand. 
 
 (2.) He is yet above ground. 
 The earth does not open and swallow him 
 up; only it is not what it was: as he continues 
 alive, notwithstanding his degeneracy 
 from his primitive purity and rectitude, so 
 the earth continues to be his habitation, notwithstanding 
 its degeneracy from its primitive 
 beauty and fruitfulness. 
 
 (3.) This curse upon 
 the earth, which cut off all expectations of a 
 happiness in things below, might direct and 
 quicken him to look for bliss and satisfaction 
 only in things above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His employments and enjoyments are 
 all embittered to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His business shall henceforth become 
 a toil to him, and he shall go on with it <I>in the 
 sweat of his face,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 His business, before 
 he sinned, was a constant pleasure to him, 
 the garden was then dressed without any uneasy 
 labour, and kept without any uneasy 
 care; but now his labour shall be a weariness 
 and shall waste his body; his care shall be a 
 torment and shall afflict his mind. The curse 
 upon the ground which made it barren, and 
 produced thorns and thistles, made his employment 
 about it much more difficult and 
 toilsome. If Adam had not sinned, he had 
 not sweated. Observe here, 
 
 [1.] That labour 
 is our duty, which we must faithfully perform; 
 we are bound to work, not as creatures only, 
 but as criminals; it is part of our sentence, 
 which idleness daringly defies. 
 
 [2.] That 
 uneasiness and weariness with labour are our 
 just punishment, which we must patiently 
 submit to, and not complain of, since they 
 are less than our iniquity deserves. Let not 
 us, by inordinate care and labour, make our
 punishment heavier than God has made it; 
 but rather study to lighten our burden, and 
 wipe off our sweat, by eyeing Providence in 
 all and expecting rest shortly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His food shall henceforth become (in 
 comparison with what it had been) unpleasant 
 to him. 
 
 [1.] The matter of his food is 
 changed; he must now eat the herb of the 
 field, and must no longer be feasted with the 
 delicacies of the garden of Eden. Having by 
 sin made himself like the beasts that perish, 
 he is justly turned to be a fellow-commoner 
 with them, and to <I>eat grass as oxen, till he 
 know that the heavens do rule.</I> 
 
 [2.] There is 
 a change in the manner of his eating it: <I>In 
 sorrow</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>).
 and <I>in the sweat of his face</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)
 he must eat of it. Adam could not 
 but eat in sorrow all the days of his life, remembering 
 the forbidden fruit he had eaten, 
 and the guilt and shame he had contracted 
 by it. Observe, <I>First,</I> That human life is 
 exposed to many miseries and calamities, 
 which very much embitter the poor remains 
 of its pleasures and delights. Some never 
 eat with pleasure 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:25">Job xxi. 25</A>),
 through sickness 
 or melancholy; all, even the best, have 
 cause to eat with sorrow for sin; and all, 
 even the happiest in this world, have some 
 allays to their joy: troops of diseases, disasters, 
 and deaths, in various shapes, entered

 <A NAME="Page33"> </A>

 the world with sin, and still ravage it. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 That the righteousness of God is to 
 be acknowledged in all the sad consequences 
 of sin. <I>Wherefore then should a living man 
 complain?</I> Yet, in this part of the sentence, 
 there is also a mixture of mercy. He shall 
 sweat, but his toil shall make his rest the 
 more welcome when he returns to his earth, 
 as to his bed; he shall grieve, but he shall 
 not starve; he shall have sorrow, but in that 
 sorrow he shall eat bread, which shall 
 strengthen his heart under his sorrows. He 
 is not sentenced to eat dust as the serpent, 
 only to eat the herb of the field.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His life also is but short. Considering 
 how full of trouble his days are, it is in 
 favour to him that they are few; yet death 
 being dreadful to nature (yea, even though 
 life be unpleasant) <I>that</I> concludes the sentence. 
 "Thou shalt <I>return to the ground out 
 of which thou wast taken;</I> thy body, that part 
 of thee which was taken out of the ground, 
 shall return to it again; for <I>dust thou art.</I>" 
 This points either to the first original of his 
 body; it was made <I>of the dust,</I> nay it was 
 <I>made dust,</I> and was still so; so that there 
 needed no more than to recall the grant of 
 immortality, and to withdraw the power 
 which was put forth to support it, and then 
 he would, of course, <I>return to dust.</I> Or to 
 the present corruption and degeneracy of his 
 mind: <I>Dust thou art,</I> that is, "Thy precious 
 soul is now lost and buried in the dust of the 
 body and the mire of the flesh; it was made 
 spiritual and heavenly, but it has become 
 carnal and earthly." His doom is therefore 
 read: "<I>To dust thou shalt return.</I> Thy body 
 shall be forsaken by thy soul, and become 
 itself a lump of dust; and then it shall be 
 lodged in the grave, the proper place for it, 
 and mingle itself with the dust of the earth," 
 <I>our dust,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:29">Ps. civ. 29</A>.
 <I>Earth to earth, dust to 
 dust.</I> Observe here, 
 
 (1.) That man is a mean 
 frail creature, <I>little</I> as dust, the small dust of 
 the balance--<I>light</I> as dust, altogether lighter 
 than vanity--<I>weak</I> as dust, and of no consistency. 
 Our strength is not the strength 
 of stones; he that made us considers it, and 
 <I>remembers that we are dust,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:14">Ps. ciii. 14</A>.
 Man is indeed the <I>chief part of the dust of the 
 world</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:26">Prov. viii. 26</A>),
 but still he is dust. 
 
 (2.) That he is a mortal dying creature, and 
 hastening to the grave. Dust may be raised, 
 for a time, into a little cloud, and may seem 
 considerable while it is held up by the wind 
 that raised it; but, when the force of that is 
 spent, it falls again, and returns to the earth 
 out of which it was raised. Such a thing is 
 man; a great man is but a great mass of 
 dust, and must return to his earth. 
 
 (3.) That 
 sin brought death into the world. If Adam 
 had not sinned, he would not have died, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Rom. v. 12</A>.
 God entrusted Adam with a 
 spark of immortality, which he, by a patient 
 continuance in well-doing, might have 
 blown up into an everlasting flame; but he 
 foolishly blew it out by wilful sin: and now 
 death is <I>the wages of sin, and sin is the sting of 
 death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must not go off from this sentence 
 upon our first parents, which we are all so 
 nearly concerned in, and feel from, to this 
 day, till we have considered two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How fitly the sad consequences of sin 
 upon the soul of Adam and his sinful race 
 were represented and figured out by this sentence, 
 and perhaps were more intended in it 
 than we are aware of. Though that misery 
 only is mentioned which affected the body, 
 yet that was a pattern of spiritual miseries, 
 the curse that entered into the soul. 
 
 (1.) The 
 pains of a woman in travail represent the 
 terrors and pangs of a guilty conscience, 
 awakened to a sense of sin; from the conception 
 of lust, these sorrows are greatly multiplied, 
 and, sooner or later, will come upon 
 the sinner like pain upon a woman in travail, 
 which cannot be avoided. 
 
 (2.) The state of 
 subjection to which the woman was reduced 
 represents that loss of spiritual liberty and 
 freedom of will which is the effect of sin. The 
 dominion of sin in the soul is compared to 
 that of a husband 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:1-5">Rom. vii. 1-5</A>),
 the sinner's 
 desire is towards it, for he is fond of his 
 slavery, and it rules over him. 
 
 (3.) The curse 
 of barrenness which was brought upon the 
 earth, and its produce of briars and thorns, 
 are a fit representation of the barrenness of a 
 corrupt and sinful soul in that which is good 
 and its fruitfulness in evil. It is all overgrown 
 with thorns, and nettles cover the face 
 of it; and therefore it is <I>nigh unto cursing,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:8">Heb. vi. 8</A>.

 (4.) The toil and sweat bespeak 
 the difficulty which, through the infirmity of 
 the flesh, man labours under, in the service 
 of God and the work of religion, so hard has 
 it now become to <I>enter into the kingdom of 
 heaven.</I> Blessed be God, it is not impossible. 
 
 (5.) The embittering of his food to him bespeaks 
 the soul's want of the comfort of God's 
 favour, which is life, and the bread of life. 
 
 (6.) The soul, like the body, returns to the 
 dust of this world; its tendency is that way; 
 it has an earthy taint, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31">John iii. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How admirably the satisfaction our Lord 
 Jesus made by his death and sufferings answered 
 to the sentence here passed upon our 
 first parents. 
 
 (1.) Did travailing pains come 
 in with sin? We read of the <I>travail of 
 Christ's soul</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>);
 and the pains of 
 death he was held by are called <B><I>odinai</I></B> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:24">Acts ii. 24</A>),
 <I>the pains of a woman in travail.</I> 
 
 (2.) Did subjection come in with sin? Christ 
 was made under the law, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>.

 (3.) Did 
 the curse come in with sin? Christ was made 
 a curse for us, died a cursed death, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Gal. iii. 13</A>.

 (4.) Did thorns come in with sin? He 
 was crowned with thorns for us. 
 
 (5.) Did sweat come in with sin? He for us did sweat 
 as it were great drops of blood. 
 
 (6.) Did sorrow come in with sin? He was a man of 
 sorrows, his soul was, in his agony, exceedingly 
 sorrowful. 
 
 (7.) Did death come in with 
 sin? He became obedient unto death. Thus 

 <A NAME="Page34"> </A>

 is the plaster as wide as the wound. Blessed 
 be God for Jesus Christ!</P>

 <A NAME="Ge3_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And Adam called his wife's 
 name Eve; because she was the mother 
 of all living.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God having named the man, and called him 
 <I>Adam,</I> which signifies <I>red earth,</I> Adam, in 
 further token of dominion, named the woman, 
 and called her <I>Eve,</I> that is, <I>life.</I> Adam bears 
 the name of the dying body, Eve that of the 
 living soul. The reason of the name is here 
 given (some think, by Moses the historian, 
 others, by Adam himself): <I>Because she was</I> 
 (that is, was to be) <I>the mother of all living.</I> 
 He had before called her <I>Ishah--woman,</I> as a 
 wife; here he calls her <I>Evah--life,</I> as a 
 mother. Now, 
 
 1. If this was done by divine 
 direction, it was an instance of God's favour, 
 and, like the new naming of Abraham and 
 Sarah, it was a seal of the covenant, and an 
 assurance to them that, notwithstanding their 
 sin and his displeasure against them for it, 
 he had not reversed that blessing wherewith 
 he had blessed them: <I>Be fruitful and multiply.</I> 
 It was likewise a confirmation of the promise 
 now made, that the seed of the woman, of 
 this woman, should break the serpent's head. 
 
 2. If Adam did it of himself, it was an instance 
 of his faith in the word of God. Doubtless 
 it was not done, as some have suspected, 
 in contempt or defiance of the curse, but 
 rather in a humble confidence and dependence 
 upon the blessing. 
 
 (1.) The blessing 
 of a reprieve, admiring the patience of God, 
 that he should spare such sinners to be the 
 parents of all living, and that he did not immediately 
 shut up those fountains of the 
 human life and nature, because they could 
 send forth no other than polluted, poisoned, 
 streams. 
 
 (2.) The blessing of a Redeemer, 
 the promised seed, to whom Adam had an 
 eye, in calling his wife <I>Eve--life;</I> for he 
 should be the life of all the living, and in 
 him all the families of the earth should be 
 blessed, in hope of which he thus triumphs.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge3_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 Unto Adam also and to his wife 
 did the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God make coats of 
 skins, and clothed them.
 </FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further instance of God's 
 care concerning our first parents, notwithstanding 
 their sin. Though he corrects his 
 disobedient children, and put them under 
 the marks of his displeasure, yet he does not 
 disinherit them, but, like a tender father, provides 
 the herb of the field for their food and 
 <I>coats of skins</I> for their clothing. Thus the 
 father provided for the returning prodigal, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:22">Luke xv. 22, 23</A>.
 If the Lord had been 
 pleased to kill them, he would not have done 
 this for them. Observe,

 1. That clothes 
 came in with sin. We should have had no 
 occasion for them, either for defence or decency, 
 if sin had not made us naked, to our 
 shame. Little reason therefore we have to 
 be proud of our clothes, which are but the 
 badges of our poverty and infamy. 
 
 2. That 
 when God made clothes for our first parents 
 he made them warm and strong, but coarse 
 and very plain: not robes of scarlet, but coats 
 of skin. Their clothes were made, not of 
 silk and satin, but plain skins; not trimmed, 
 nor embroidered, none of the ornaments 
 which the daughters of Sion afterwards invented, 
 and prided themselves in. Let the 
 poor, that are meanly clad, learn hence not to 
 complain: having food and a covering, let 
 them be content; they are as well done to 
 as Adam and Eve were. And let the rich, 
 that are finely clad, learn hence not to make 
 the putting on of apparel their adorning, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:3">1 Pet. iii. 3</A>.

 3. That God is to be acknowledged 
 with thankfulness, not only in giving 
 us food, but in giving us clothes also, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:20"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 20</A>.
 The wool and the flax are his, as 
 well as <I>the corn and the wine,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Hos. ii. 9</A>.

 4. These coats of skin had a significancy. The 
 beasts whose skins they were must be slain, 
 slain before their eyes, to show them what 
 death is, and (as it is 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:18">Eccl. iii. 18</A>)
 that they 
 may see that they themselves were beasts, 
 mortal and dying. It is supposed that they 
 were slain, not for food, but for sacrifice, to 
 typify the great sacrifice, which, in the latter 
 end of the world, should be offered once for 
 all. Thus the first thing that died was a 
 sacrifice, or Christ in a figure, who is therefore 
 said to be the <I>Lamb slain from the foundation 
 of the world.</I> These sacrifices were 
 divided between God and man, in token of 
 reconciliation: the flesh was offered to God, a 
 whole burnt-offering; the skins were given 
 to man for clothing, signifying that, Jesus 
 Christ having offered himself to God a sacrifice 
 of a sweet-smelling savour, we are to 
 clothe ourselves with his righteousness as 
 with a garment, that the shame of our nakedness 
 may not appear. Adam and Eve made 
 for themselves aprons of fig-leaves, a covering 
 too narrow for them to <I>wrap themselves in,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:20">Isa. xxviii. 20</A>.
 Such are all the rags of 
 our own righteousness. But God made 
 them coats of skins; large, and strong, and 
 durable, and fit for them; such is the righteousness 
 of Christ. Therefore <I>put on the 
 Lord Jesus Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Sentence being passed upon the offenders, 

 <A NAME="Page35"> </A>
 
 we have here execution, in part, done upon 
 them immediately. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they were justly disgraced and 
 shamed before God and the holy angels, by 
 the ironical upbraiding of them with the issue 
 of their enterprise: "<I>Behold, the man has become 
 as one of us, to know good and evil!</I> A 
 goodly god he makes! Does he not? See 
 what he has got, what preferments, what advantages, 
 by eating forbidden fruit!" This 
 was said to awaken and humble them, and to 
 bring them to a sense of their sin and folly, 
 and to repentance for it, that, seeing themselves 
 thus wretchedly deceived by following 
 the devil's counsel, they might henceforth 
 pursue the happiness God should offer in 
 the way he should prescribe. God thus <I>fills 
 their faces with shame, that they may seek his 
 name,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:16">Ps. lxxxiii. 16</A>.
 He puts them to this 
 confusion, in order to their conversion. True 
 penitents will thus upbraid themselves: 
 "What fruit have I now by sin? 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Rom. vi. 21</A>.
 Have I gained what I foolishly promised myself 
 in a sinful way? No, no, it never proved 
 what it pretended to, but the contrary."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were justly discarded, and 
 shut out of paradise, which was a part of the 
 sentence implied in that, <I>Thou shalt eat the 
 herb of the field.</I> Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reason God gave why he shut man 
 out of paradise; not only because he had put 
 forth his hand, and taken of the tree of knowledge, 
 which was his sin, but lest he should 
 again put forth his hand, and take also of the 
 tree of life (now forbidden him by the divine 
 sentence, as before the tree of knowledge was 
 forbidden by the law), and should dare to 
 eat of that tree, and so profane a divine sacrament 
 and defy a divine sentence, and yet 
 flatter himself with a conceit that thereby he 
 should live forever. Observe, 
 
 (1.) There is 
 a foolish proneness in those that have rendered 
 themselves unworthy of the substance 
 of Christian privileges to catch at the signs 
 and shadows of them. Many that like not 
 the terms of the covenant, yet, for their reputation's 
 sake, are fond of the seals of it. 
 
 (2.) It is not only justice, but kindness, to such, 
 to be denied them; for, by usurping that to 
 which they have no title, they affront God 
 and make their sin the more heinous, and by 
 building their hopes upon a wrong foundation 
 they render their conversion the more 
 difficult and their ruin the more deplorable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The method God took, in giving him 
 this bill of divorce, and expelling and excluding 
 him from this garden of pleasure. 
 He turned him out, and kept him out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He turned him out, from the garden 
 to the common. This is twice mentioned: 
 <I>He sent him forth</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 and then <I>he drove 
 him out,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 God bade him go out, told 
 him that that was no place for him, he should 
 no longer occupy and enjoy that garden; but 
 he liked the place too well to be willing to 
 part with it, and therefore God <I>drove him out,</I> 
 made him go out, whether he would or no. 
 This signified the exclusion of him, and all 
 his guilty race, from that communion with 
 God which was the bliss and glory of paradise. 
 The tokens of God's favour to him 
 and his delight in the sons of men, which he 
 had in his innocent estate, were now suspended; 
 the communications of his grace 
 were withheld, and Adam became weak, and 
 like other men, as Samson when the <I>Spirit of 
 the Lord had departed from him.</I> His acquaintance 
 with God was lessened and lost, 
 and that correspondence which had been 
 settled between man and his Maker was interrupted 
 and broken off. He was driven 
 out, as one unworthy of this honour and incapable 
 of this service. Thus he and all 
 mankind, by the fall, forfeited and lost communion 
 with God. But whither did he send 
 him when he turned him out of Eden? He 
 might justly have chased him out of the 
 world 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:18">Job xviii. 18</A>),
 but he only chased him 
 out of the garden. He might justly have 
 cast him down to hell, as he did the angels 
 that sinned when he shut them out from the 
 heavenly paradise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2 Pet. ii. 4</A>.
 But man 
 was only sent to till the ground out of which 
 he was taken. He was sent to a place of 
 toil, not to a place of torment. He was sent 
 to the ground, not to the grave,--to the 
 work-house, not to the dungeon, not to the 
 prison-house,--to hold the plough, not to 
 drag the chain. His tilling the ground 
 would be recompensed by his eating of its 
 fruits; and his converse with the earth 
 whence he was taken was improvable to good 
 purposes, to keep him humble, and to remind 
 him of his latter end. Observe, then, 
 that though our first parents were excluded 
 from the privileges of their state of innocency, 
 yet they were not abandoned to despair, God's 
 thoughts of love designing them for a second 
 state of probation upon new terms.</P>

 (2.) He kept him out, and forbade him all 
 hopes of a re-entry; for he <I>placed at the east 
 of the garden of Eden</I> a detachment of <I>cherubim,</I> 
 God's hosts, armed with a dreadful and 
 irresistible power, represented by flaming 
 swords which turned every way, on that side 
 the garden which lay next to the place whither 
 Adam was sent, to keep the way that led to 
 the tree of life, so that he could neither steal 
 nor force an entry; for who can make a pass 
 against an angel on his guard or gain a pass 
 made good by such force? Now this intimated 
 to Adam, 
 
 [1.] That God was displeased 
 with him. Though he had mercy in 
 store for him, yet at present he was angry 
 with him, was turned to be his enemy and 
 fought against him, for here was a sword 
 drawn 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23">Num. xxii. 23</A>);
 and he was to him a 
 consuming fire, for it was a flaming sword. 
 
 [2.] That the angels were at war with him; 
 no peace with the heavenly hosts, while he 
 was in rebellion against their Lord and ours. 
 
 [3.] That the way to the tree of life was shut 
 up, namely, that way which, at first, he was 
 put into, the way of spotless innocency. It 

 <A NAME="Page36"> </A>

 is not said that the cherubim were set to keep 
 him and his for ever from the tree of life 
 (thanks be to God, there is a paradise set 
 before us, and a tree of life in the midst of 
 it, which we rejoice in the hopes of); but 
 they were set to keep that way of the tree of 
 life which hitherto they had been in; that is, 
 it was henceforward in vain for him and his 
 to expect righteousness, life, and happiness, 
 by virtue of the first covenant, for it was irreparably 
 broken, and could never be pleaded, 
 nor any benefit taken by it. The command 
 of that covenant being broken, the curse of 
 it is in full force; it leaves no room for repentance, 
 but we are all undone if we be 
 judged by that covenant. God revealed this 
 to Adam, not to drive him to despair, but to 
 oblige and quicken him to look for life and 
 happiness in the promised seed, by whom 
 the flaming sword is removed. God and his 
 angels are reconciled to us, and a new and 
 living way into the holiest is consecrated and 
 laid open for us.</P>
