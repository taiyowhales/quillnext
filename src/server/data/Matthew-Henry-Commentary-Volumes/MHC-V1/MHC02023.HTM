 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter continues and concludes the acts that passed in the first 
 session (if I may so call it) upon mount Sinai. Here are, 

 I. Some laws of universal obligation, relating especially to the ninth
 commandment, against bearing false witness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and giving false judgment,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:2,3,6-8">ver. 2, 3, 6-8</A>.

 Also a law of doing good to our enemies
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>),

 and not oppressing strangers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:9">ver. 9</A>. 

 II. Some laws peculiar to the Jews. The sabbatical year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>),

 the three annual feasts
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>),

 with some laws pertaining thereto. 

 III. Gracious promises of the completing of the mercy God had begun for 
 them, upon condition of their obedience.  That God would conduct them 
 through the wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>),

 that he would prosper all they had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>),

 that he would put them in possession of Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27-31">ver. 27-31</A>.

 But they must not mingle themselves with the nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:32,33">ver. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
 the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
 &nbsp; 2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <I>do</I> evil; neither shalt
 thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest <I>judgment:</I>
 &nbsp; 3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
 &nbsp; 4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
 shalt surely bring it back to him again.
 &nbsp; 5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
 burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help
 with him.
 &nbsp; 6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
 &nbsp; 7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
 righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
 and perverteth the words of the righteous.
 &nbsp; 9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
 of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are, 

 I. Cautions concerning judicial proceedings; it was not enough that 
 they had good laws, better than ever any nation had, but care must be 
 taken for the due administration of justice according to those 
 laws.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The witnesses are here cautioned that they neither occasion an 
 innocent man to be indicted, by raising a false report of him and 
 setting common fame against him, nor assist in the prosecution of an 
 innocent man, or one whom they do not know to be guilty, by <I>putting 
 their hand</I> in swearing as witnesses against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Bearing false witness against a man, in a matter that touches his life, 
 has in it all the guilty of lying, perjury, malice, theft, murder, with 
 the additional stains of colouring all with a pretence of justice and 
 involving many others in the same guilt. There is scarcely any one act 
 of wickedness that a man can possibly be guilty of which has in it a 
 greater complication of villanies than this has. Yet the former part of 
 this caution is to be extended, not only to judicial proceedings, but 
 to common conversation; so that slandering and backbiting are a species 
 of falsewitness-bearing. A man's reputation lies as much at the mercy 
 of every company as his estate or life does at the mercy of a judge or 
 jury; so that he who raises, or knowingly spreads, a false report 
 against his neighbour, especially if the report be made to wise and 
 good men whose esteem one would desire to enjoy, sins as much against 
 the laws of truth, justice, and charity, as a false witness does--with 
 this further mischief, that he leaves it not in the power of the person 
 injured to obtain redress. That which we translate, Thou shalt not 
 <I>raise,</I> the margin reads, Thou shalt not <I>receive</I> a false 
 report; for sometimes the receiver, in this case, is as bad as the 
 thief; and a backbiting tongue would not do so much mischief as it does 
 if it were not countenanced. Sometimes we cannot avoid hearing a false 
 report, but we must not receive it, that is, we must not hear it with 
 pleasure and delight as those that rejoice in iniquity, nor give credit 
 to it as long as there remains any cause to question the truth of it.  
 This is charity to our neighbour's good name, and doing as we would be 
 done by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judges are here cautioned not to pervert judgment. 

 (1.) They must not be overruled, either by might or multitude, to go
 against their consciences in giving judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 With the Jews causes were tried by a bench of justices, and judgment 
 given according to the majority of votes, in which cause every 
 particular justice must go according to truth, as it appeared to him 
 upon the strictest and most impartial enquiry, though the multitude of 
 the people, and their outcries, or, the sentence of the <I>rabbim</I> 
 (we translate it <I>many</I>), the more ancient and honourable of the 
 justices, went the other way. Therefore (as with us), among the Jews, 
 the junior upon the bench voted first, that he might not be swayed nor 
 overruled by the authority of the senior. Judges must not respect the 
 persons either of the parties or of their fellow-judges. The former 
 part of this verse also gives a general rule for all, as well as 
 judges, not <I>to follow a multitude to do evil.</I> General usage will 
 never excuse us in a bad practice; nor is the broad way ever the better 
 or safer for its being tracked and crowded. We must enquire what we 
 ought to do, not what the majority do; because we must be judged by our 
 Master, not by our fellow-servants, and it is too great a compliment to 
 be willing to go to hell for company. 

 (2.) They must not pervert judgment, no, not in favour of a poor man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Right must in all cases take place and wrong must be punished, and 
 justice never biassed nor injury connived at under pretence of charity 
 and compassion. If a poor man be a bad man, and do a bad thing, it is 
 foolish pity to let him fare the better for his poverty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:16,17">Deut. i. 16, 17</A>.

 (3.) Neither must they pervert judgment in prejudice to a poor man, nor
 suffer him to be wronged because he had not wherewithal to right 
 himself; in such cases the judges themselves must become advocates for 
 the poor, as far as their cause was good and honest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of the poor;</I> remember they 
 are thy poor, bone of thy bone, thy poor neighbours, thy poor brethren; 
 let them not therefore fare the worse for being poor." 

 (4.) They must dread the thoughts of assisting or abetting a bad cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 "<I>Keep thyself far from a false matter;</I> do not only keep thyself 
 free from it, nor think it enough to say thou art unconcerned in it, 
 but keep far from it, dread it as a dangerous snare. The innocent and 
 righteous thou wouldest not, for all the world, slay with thy own 
 hands; keep far therefore from a false matter, for thou knowest not but 
 it may end in that, and the righteous God will not leave such 
 wickedness unpunished: <I>I will not justify the wicked,</I>" that is, 
 "I will condemn him that unjustly condemns others." Judges themselves 
 are accountable to the great judge. 
 
 (5.) They must not take bribes,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They must not only not be swayed by a gift to give an unjust judgment, 
 to condemn the innocent, or acquit the guilty, or adjudge a man's right 
 from him, but they must not so much as take a gift, lest it should have 
 a bad influence upon them, and overrule them, contrary to their 
 intentions; for it has a strange tendency to blind those that otherwise 
 would do well. 
 
 (6.) They must not oppress a stranger,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Though aliens might not inherit lands among them, yet they must have 
 justice done them, must peaceably enjoy their own, and be redressed if 
 they were wronged, though they were strangers to the commonwealth of 
 Israel.  It is an instance of the equity and goodness of our law, that, 
 if an alien be tried for any crime except treason, the one half of his 
 jury, if he desire it, shall be foreigners; they call it a trial <I>per 
 mediatatem linguae,</I> a kind provision that strangers may not be 
 oppressed. The reason here given is the same with that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:21"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 21</A>,

 <I>You were strangers,</I> which is here elegantly enforced, <I>You
 know the heart of a stranger;</I> you know something of the griefs and 
 fears of a stranger by sad experience, and therefore, being delivered, 
 can the more easily put your souls into their souls' stead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Commands concerning neighbourly kindnesses. We must be ready to do 
 all good offices, as there is occasion, for any body, yea even for 
 those that have done us ill offices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 The command of loving our enemies, and doing good to those that hate 
 us, is not only a <I>new,</I> but an <I>old</I> commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:21,22">Prov. xxv. 21, 22</A>.

 Infer hence, 

 1. If we must do this kindness for an enemy, much more for a friend, 
 though an enemy only is mentioned, because it is supposed that a man 
 would not be unneighbourly to any unless such as he had a particular 
 spleen against. 

 2. If it be wrong not to prevent our enemy's loss and damage, how much 
 worse is it to occasion harm and loss to him, or any thing he has. 

 3.  If we must bring back our neighbours' cattle when they go astray, 
 much more must we endeavour, by prudent admonitions and instructions, 
 to bring back our neighbours themselves, when they go astray in any 
 sinful path, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:19,20">Jam. v. 19, 20</A>.

 And, if we must endeavour to help up a fallen ass, much more should we
 endeavour, by comforts and encouragements, to help up a sinking spirit, 
 <I>saying to those that are of a fearful heart, Be strong.</I> We must 
 seek the relief and welfare of others <I>as our own,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:4">Phil. ii. 4</A>.

 <I>If thou sayest, Behold, we know it not, doth not he that pondereth
 the heart consider it?</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:11,12">Prov. xxiv. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 the fruits thereof:
 &nbsp; 11 But the seventh <I>year</I> thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
 that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
 beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
 with thy vineyard, <I>and</I> with thy oliveyard.
 &nbsp; 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
 shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of
 thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

 &nbsp; 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt

 labours out of the field.

 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.

 bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
 morning.

 into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
 in his mother's milk.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The institution of the sabbatical year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Every seventh year the land was to rest; they must not plough nor sow 
 it at the beginning of the year, and then they could not expect any 
 great harvest at the end of the year: but what the earth did produce of 
 itself should be eaten from hand to mouth, and not laid up. Now this 
 was designed, 

 1. To show what a plentiful land that was into which God was bringing 
 them--that so numerous a people could have rich maintenance out of the 
 produce of so small a country, without foreign trade, and yet could 
 spare the increase of every seventh year. 

 2. To remind them of their dependence upon God their great landlord, 
 and their obligation to use the fruit of their land as he should 
 direct.  Thus he would try their obedience in a matter that nearly 
 touched their interest. Afterwards we find that their disobedience to 
 this command was a forfeiture of the promises,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:21">2 Chron. xxxvi. 21</A>.

 3. To teach them a confidence in the divine Providence, while they did
 their duty--that, as the sixth day's manna served for two day's meat, 
 so the sixth year's increase should serve for two years' subsistence. 
 Thus they must learn not to <I>take thought for their life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>.

 If we are prudent and diligent in our affairs, we may trust Providence
 to furnish us with the bread of the day in its day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The repetition of the law of the fourth commandment concerning the 
 weekly sabbath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Even in the year of rest they must not think that the sabbath day was 
 laid in common with the other days, but, even that year, it must be 
 religiously observed; yet thus some have endeavoured to take away the 
 observance of the sabbath, by pretending that every day must be a 
 sabbath day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. All manner of respect to the gods of the heathen is here strictly 
 forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 A general caution is prefixed to this, which has reference to all these 
 precepts: <I>In all things that I have said unto you, be 
 circumspect.</I> We are in danger of missing our way on the right hand 
 and on the left, and it is at our peril if we do; therefore we have 
 need to look about us. A man may ruin himself through mere 
 carelessness, but he cannot save himself without great care and 
 circumspection: particularly, since idolatry was a sin which they were 
 much addicted to, and would be greatly tempted to, they must endeavour 
 to blot out the remembrance of the gods of the heathen, and must disuse 
 and forget all their superstitious forms of speech, and never mention 
 them but with detestation. In Christian schools and academies (for it 
 is in vain to think of reforming the play-houses), it were to be wished 
 that the names and stories of the heathen deities, or demons rather, 
 were not so commonly and familiarly used as they are, even with 
 intimations of respect, and sometimes with forms of invocation. Surely 
 we have <I>not so learned Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their solemn religious attendance on God in the place which he 
 should choose is here strictly required, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:14-17"><I>v.</I> 14-17</A>.

 1. Thrice a year all their males must come together in a holy 
 convocation, that they might the better know and love one another, and 
 keep up their communion as a dignified and peculiar people. 

 2. They must come together <I>before the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 to present themselves before him, looking towards the place where his 
 honour dwelt, and to pay their homage to him as their great Lord, from 
 and under whom they held all their enjoyments. 

 3. They must feast together before the Lord, eating and drinking 
 together, in token of their joy in God and their grateful sense of his 
 goodness to them; for <I>a feast is made for laughter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:19">Eccl. x. 19</A>.

 O what a good Master do we serve, who has made it our duty to
 <I>rejoice before him,</I> who feasts his servants when they are in 
 waiting! Never let religion be called a melancholy thing, when its 
 solemn services are solemn feasts.  

 4. They must not <I>appear before God empty,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Some free-will offering or other they must bring, in token of their 
 respect and gratitude to their great benefactor; and, as they were not 
 allowed to come empty-handed, so we must not come to worship God 
 empty-hearted; our souls must be filled with grace, with pious and 
 devout affections, holy desires towards him, and dedications of 
 ourselves to him, for <I>with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.</I> 
 
 5. The passover, pentecost, and feast of tabernacles, in spring, 
 summer, and autumn, were the three times appointed for their 
 attendance: not in winter, because travelling was then uncomfortable; 
 not in the midst of their harvest, because then they were otherwise 
 employed; so that they had no reason to say that he <I>made them to 
 serve with an offering,</I> or <I>wearied them with incense.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Some particular directions are here given about the three feasts, 
 though not so fully as afterwards. 

 1. As to the passover, it was not to be offered with leavened bread, 
 for at that feast all leaven was to be cast out, nor was the fat of it 
 to remain until the morning, lest it should become offensive,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 2. At the feast of pentecost, when they were to begin their harvest, 
 they must bring <I>the first of their first-fruits</I> to God, by the 
 pious presenting of which the whole harvest was sanctified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 3. At the feast of <I>ingathering,</I> as it is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 they must give God thanks for the harvest-mercies they had received, 
 and must depend upon him for the next harvest, and must not think to 
 receive benefit by that superstitious usage of some of the Gentiles, 
 who, it is said, at the end of their harvest, <I>seethed a kid in its 
 dam's milk,</I> and sprinkled that milk-pottage, in a magical way, upon 
 their gardens and fields, to make them more fruitful next year. But 
 Israel must abhor such foolish customs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the
 way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
 &nbsp; 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
 will not pardon your transgressions: for my name <I>is</I> in him.
 &nbsp; 22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
 speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
 adversary unto thine adversaries.
 &nbsp; 23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
 the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
 Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them
 off.
 &nbsp; 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor
 do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
 quite break down their images.
 &nbsp; 25 And ye shall serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and he shall bless thy
 bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
 midst of thee.
 &nbsp; 26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
 land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
 &nbsp; 27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
 people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies
 turn their backs unto thee.
 &nbsp; 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out
 the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
 &nbsp; 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
 the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
 against thee.
 &nbsp; 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
 until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
 &nbsp; 31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
 of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
 will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou
 shalt drive them out before thee.
 &nbsp; 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
 &nbsp; 33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
 against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
 snare unto thee.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three gracious promises are here made to Israel, to engage them to 
 their duty and encourage them in it; and each of the promises has some 
 needful precepts and cautions joined to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here promised that they should be guided and kept in their way 
 through the wilderness to the land of promise: <I>Behold, I send an 
 angel before thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>my angel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 a created angel, say some, a minister of God's providence, employed in 
 conducting and protecting the camp of Israel; that it might appear that 
 God took a particular care of them, he appointed one of his chief 
 servants to make it his business to attend them, and see that they 
 wanted for nothing.  Others suppose it to be the Son of God, the angel 
 of the covenant; for the Israelites in the wilderness are said to 
 <I>tempt Christ;</I> and we may as well suppose him God's messenger, 
 and the church's Redeemer, before his incarnation, as <I>the Lamb slain 
 from the foundation of the world.</I> And we may the rather think he 
 was pleased to undertake the deliverance and guidance of Israel because 
 they were typical of his great undertaking. It is promised that this 
 blessed angel should <I>keep them in the way,</I> though it lay through 
 a wilderness first, and afterwards through their enemies' country; thus 
 God's spiritual Israel shall be kept through the wilderness of this 
 earth, and from the insults of the gates of hell. It is also promised 
 that he should bring them into the place which God had not only 
 designed but prepared for them: and thus Christ has prepared a place 
 for his followers, and will preserve them to it, for he is faithful to 
 him that appointed him. The precept joined with this promise is that 
 they be observant of, and obedient to, this angel whom God would send 
 before them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Beware of him, and obey his voice</I> in every thing; <I>provoke 
 him not</I> in any thing, for it is at your peril if you do, he will 
 <I>visit your iniquity.</I>" Note, 

 1. Christ is the author of salvation to those only that obey him. The 
 word of command is <I>Hear you him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.

 <I>Observe what he hath commanded,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 2. Our necessary dependence upon the divine power and goodness should 
 awe us into obedience. We do well to take heed of provoking our 
 protector and benefactor, because if our defence depart from us, and 
 the streams of his goodness be cut off, we are undone. Therefore, 
 "<I>Beware of him,</I> and carry it towards him with all possible 
 reverence and caution. Fear the <I>Lord, and his goodness.</I>" 

 3. Christ will be faithful to those who are faithful to him, and will 
 espouse their cause who adhere to his: <I>I will be an adversary to 
 thine adversaries,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The league shall be offensive and defensive, like that with Abraham, 
 <I>I will bless him that blesseth thee, and curse him that curseth 
 thee.</I> Thus is God pleased to twist his interests and friendships 
 with his people's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is promised that they should have a comfortable settlement in 
 the land of Canaan, which they hoped now (though it proved otherwise) 
 within a few months to be in the possession of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.
 
 Observe, 
 
 1. How reasonable the conditions of this promise are--only that they 
 should serve their own God, who was indeed the only true God, and not 
 the gods of the nations, which were no gods at all, and which they had 
 no reason at all to have any respect for. They must not only not 
 worship their gods, but they must utterly overthrow them, in token of 
 their great abhorrence of idolatry, their resolution never to worship 
 idols themselves, and their care to prevent any other from worshipping 
 them; as the converted conjurors <I>burnt their books,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:19">Acts xix. 19</A>.

 2. How rich the particulars of this promise are. 

 (1.) The comfort of their food. He shall <I>bless thy bread and thy
 water;</I> and God's blessing will make bread and water more refreshing 
 and nourishing than a feast of fat things and wines on the lees without 
 that blessing. 

 (2.) The continuance of their health: "<I>I will take sickness
 away,</I> either prevent it or remove it. Thy land shall not be visited 
 with epidemical diseases, which are very dreadful, and sometimes have 
 laid countries waste." 

 (3.) The increase of their wealth. Their cattle should not be barren,
 nor cast their young, which is mentioned as an instance of prosperity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:10">Job xxi. 10</A>.

 (4.) The prolonging of their lives to old age: "<I>The number of thy
 days I will fulfil,</I> and they shall not be cut off in the midst by 
 untimely deaths." Thus hath godliness the <I>promise of the life that 
 now is.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is promised that they should conquer and subdue their enemies, 
 the present occupants of the land of Canaan, who must be driven out to 
 make room for them. This God would do, 

 1. Effectually by his power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>);

 not so much by the sword and bow of Israel as by the terrors which he 
 would strike into the Canaanites. Though they were so obstinate as not 
 to be willing to submit to Israel, resign their country, and retire 
 elsewhere, which they might have done, yet they were so dispirited that 
 they were not able to stand before them. This completed their ruin; 
 such power had the devil in them that they would resist, but such power 
 had God over them that they could not. <I>I will send my fear before 
 thee;</I> and those that fear will soon flee.  Hosts of hornets made 
 way for the hosts of Israel; such mean creatures can God make use of 
 for the chastising of his people's enemies, as in the plagues of Egypt. 
 When God pleases, hornets can drive out Canaanites, as well as lions 
 could, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:12">Josh. xxiv. 12</A>.

 2. He would do it gradually, in wisdom
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>),

 not all at once, but by little and little. As the Canaanites had kept 
 possession till Israel had grown into a people, so there should still 
 be some remains of them till Israel should grow so numerous as to 
 replenish the whole. Note, The wisdom of God is to be observed in the 
 gradual advances of the church's interests. It is in real kindness to 
 the church that its enemies are subdued by little and little; for thus 
 we are kept upon our guard, and in a continual dependence upon God. 
 Corruptions are thus driven out of the hearts of God's people; not all 
 at once, but by little and little; the old man is crucified, and 
 therefore dies slowly. God, in his providence, often delays mercies, 
 because we are not ready for them.  Canaan has room enough to receive 
 Israel, but Israel is not numerous enough to occupy Canaan. We are not 
 straitened in God; if we are straitened, it is in ourselves. The land 
 of Canaan is promised them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 in its utmost extent, which yet they were not possessed of till the 
 days of David; and by their sins they soon lost possession. The precept 
 annexed to this promise is that they should not make any friendship, 
 nor have any familiarity, with idolaters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Idolaters must not so much as sojourn in their land, unless they 
 renounced their idolatry.  Thus they must avoid the reproach of 
 intimacy with the worshippers of false gods and the danger of being 
 drawn to worship with them. By familiar converse with idolaters, their 
 dread and detestation of the sin would wear off; they would think it no 
 harm, in compliment to their friends, to pay some respect to their 
 gods, and so by degrees would be drawn into the fatal snare. Note, 
 Those that would be kept from bad courses must keep from bad company; 
 it is dangerous living in a bad neighbourhood; others' sins will be our 
 snares, if we look not well to ourselves. We must always look upon our 
 greatest danger to be from those that would cause us to sin against 
 God. Whatever friendship is pretended, that is really our worst enemy 
 that draws us from our duty.</P>
