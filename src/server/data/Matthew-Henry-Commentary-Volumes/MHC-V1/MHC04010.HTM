 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Orders given about the making and using of silver trumpets, which
 seems to have been the last of all the commandments God gave upon mount 
 Sinai, and one of the least, yet not without its significancy,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
 make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
 assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
 &nbsp; 3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
 assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 4 And if they blow <I>but</I> with one <I>trumpet,</I> then the princes,
 <I>which are</I> heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather
 themselves unto thee.
 &nbsp; 5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
 parts shall go forward.
 &nbsp; 6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that
 lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow
 an alarm for their journeys.
 &nbsp; 7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye
 shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
 &nbsp; 8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
 trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
 throughout your generations.
 &nbsp; 9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
 oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
 and ye shall be remembered before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and ye shall
 be saved from your enemies.
 &nbsp; 10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days,
 and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
 trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
 your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
 before your God: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here directions concerning the public notices that were to be 
 given to the people upon several occasions by sound of trumpet. In a 
 thing of this nature, one would think, Moses needed not to have been 
 taught of God: his own reason might teach him the conveniency of 
 trumpets; but the constitution of Israel was to be in every thing 
 divine, and therefore even in this matter, small as it seems. Moses is 
 here directed, 

 1. About the making of them. They must be made of silver; not cast but 
 of beaten work (as some read it), the matter and shape, no doubt, very 
 fit for the purpose. He was now ordered to make but two, because there 
 were but two priests to use them. But in Solomon's time we read of 120 
 <I>priests sounding with trumpets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:12">2 Chron. v. 12</A>.

 The form of these trumpets is supposed to have been much like ours at
 this day.

 2. Who were to make use of them; not any inferior person, but the
 priests themselves, the <I>sons of Aaron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 As great as they were, they must not think it a disparagement to them
 to be trumpeters in the house of God; the meanest office there was
 honourable. This signified that the Lord's ministers should <I>lift up
 their voice like a trumpet,</I> to show people their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:1">Isa. lviii. 1</A>),

 to call them to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:13">Isa. xxvii. 13</A>.

 3. Upon what occasions the trumpets were to be sounded.

 (1.) For the <I>calling of assemblies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Thus they are told to blow the trumpet in Zion for the calling of a
 solemn assembly together, to sanctify a fast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:15">Joel ii. 15</A>.

 Public notice ought to be given of the time and place of religious
 assemblies; for the invitation to the benefit or ordinances is general: 
 <I>whoever will, let him come.</I> wisdom cries in the chief places of 
 concourse. But, that the trumpet might not <I>give an uncertain
 sound,</I> they are directed, if only the princes and elders were to 
 meet, to blow but one of the trumpets; less should serve to call 
 <I>them</I> together, who ought to be examples of forwardness in any 
 thing that is good: but, if the body of the people were to be called 
 together, both the trumpets must be sounded, that they might be heard 
 at the greater distance. In allusion to this, they are said to be 
 blessed that <I>hear the joyful sound</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15">Ps. lxxxix. 15</A>),

 that is, that are invited and called upon to wait upon God in public
 ordinances,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>.

 And the general assembly at the great day will be summoned by <I>the
 sound of the archangel's trumpet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31">Matt. xxiv. 31</A>.

 (2.) For the <I>journeying of the camps,</I> to give notice when each
 squadron must move; for no man's voice could reach to give the word of 
 command: soldiers with us that are well disciplined may be exercised by 
 beat of drums. When the trumpets were blown for this purpose, they 
 must<I>sound an alarm</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 a broken, quavering, interrupted sound, which was proper to excite and
 encourage the minds of people in their marches against their enemies; 
 whereas a continued equal sound was more proper for the calling of the 
 assembly together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 yet when the people were called together to deprecate God's judgments
 we find an alarm sounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1">Joel ii. 1</A>.

 At the first sounding, Judah's squadron marched, at the second
 Reuben's, at the third Ephraim's, at the fourth Dan's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 And some think that this was intended to sanctify their marches, for 
 thus were proclaimed by the priests, who were God's mouth to the 
 people, not only the divine orders given them to move, but the divine 
 blessing upon them in all their motions. He that hath ears, let him 
 hear that <I>God is with them of a truth.</I> King Abijah valued 
 himself and his army very much upon this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:12">2 Chron. xiii. 12</A>),

 <I>God himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding
 trumpets.</I>

 (3.) For the animating and encouraging of their armies, when they went
 out in battle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>If you go to war, blow with the trumpets,</I> signifying thereby
 your appeal to heaven for the decision of the controversy, and your 
 prayer to God to give you victory; and God will own this his own 
 institution, and <I>you shall be remembered before the Lord your 
 God.</I>" God will take notice of this sound of the trumpet, and be 
 engaged to fight their battles, and let all the people take notice of 
 it, and be encouraged to fight his, as David, when he heard <I>a sound 
 of a going upon the tops of the mulberry trees.</I> Not that God needed 
 to be awaked by sound of trumpet any more than Christ needed to be 
 awaked by his disciples in the storm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:25">Matt. viii. 25</A>.

 But where he intends mercy it is his will that we should solicit it;
 ministers must stir up the good soldiers of Jesus Christ to fight 
 manfully against sin, the world, and the devil, by assuring them that 
 Christ is the <I>captain of their salvation,</I> and will <I>tread 
 Satan under their feet.</I>

 (4.) For the solemnizing of their sacred feasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 One of their feasts was called <I>a memorial of the blowing of 
 trumpets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:23-25">Lev. xxiii. 23</A>,

 &c. And it should seem they were thus to grace the solemnity of all
 their feasts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:3">Ps. lxxxi. 3</A>),

 and their sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:27">2 Chron. xxix. 27</A>),

 to intimate with what joy and delight they performed their duty to God,
 and to raise the minds of those that attended the services to a holy 
 triumph in the God they worshipped. And then their performances were 
 for a <I>memorial before God;</I> for he takes pleasure in our 
 religious exercises when we take pleasure in them. Holy work should be 
 done with holy joy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And it came to pass on the twentieth <I>day</I> of the second
 month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off
 the tabernacle of the testimony.
 &nbsp; 12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
 wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
 Paran.
 &nbsp; 13 And they first took their journey according to the
 commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the hand of Moses.
 &nbsp; 14 In the first <I>place</I> went the standard of the camp of the
 children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
 <I>was</I> Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
 &nbsp; 15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar
 <I>was</I> Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
 &nbsp; 16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun
 <I>was</I> Eliab the son of Helon.
 &nbsp; 17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon
 and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
 to their armies: and over his host <I>was</I> Elizur the son of
 Shedeur.
 &nbsp; 19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon
 <I>was</I> Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
 &nbsp; 20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad <I>was</I>
 Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
 &nbsp; 21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and
 <I>the other</I> did set up the tabernacle against they came.
 &nbsp; 22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
 forward according to their armies: and over his host <I>was</I>
 Elishama the son of Ammihud.
 &nbsp; 23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh
 <I>was</I> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
 &nbsp; 24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
 <I>was</I> Abidan the son of Gideoni.
 &nbsp; 25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
 forward, <I>which was</I> the rereward of all the camps throughout
 their hosts: and over his host <I>was</I> Ahiezer the son of
 Ammishaddai.
 &nbsp; 26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher
 <I>was</I> Pagiel the son of Ocran.
 &nbsp; 27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
 <I>was</I> Ahira the son of Enan.
 &nbsp; 28 Thus <I>were</I> the journeyings of the children of Israel
 according to their armies, when they set forward.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general account of the removal of the camp of Israel from mount 
 Sinai, before which mountain it had lain now about a year, in which 
 time and place a great deal of memorable business was done. Of this 
 removal, it should seem, God gave them notice some time before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:6,7">Deut. i. 6, 7</A>):

 <I>You have dwelt long enough in this mountain, turn you and take your
 journey towards the land of promise.</I> The apostle tells us that 
 <I>mount Sinai genders to bondage</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:24">Gal. iv. 24</A>),

 and signifies the law there given, which is of use indeed as a
 schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, yet we must not rest in it, but 
 advance towards the joys and liberties of the children of God, for our 
 happiness is conferred not by the law, but by promise. Observe,

 1. The signal given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The cloud was taken up,</I> and we may suppose it stood for some
 time, till they were ready to march; and a great deal of work it was to 
 take down all those tents, and pack up all those goods that they had 
 there; but every family being employed about its own, and all at the 
 same time, many hands made quick work of it.

 2. The march began: <I>They took their journey according to the
 commandment of the Lord,</I> and just as the cloud led them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Some think that mention is thus frequently made in this and the
 foregoing chapter of the <I>commandment of the Lord,</I> guiding and 
 governing them in all their travels, to obviate the calumny and 
 reproach which were afterwards thrown upon Israel, that they tarried so 
 long in the wilderness, because they had lost themselves there, and 
 could not find the way out. No, the matter was not so; in every stage, 
 in every step, they were under divine direction; and, if they knew not 
 where they were, yet he that led them knew. Note, Those that have given 
 up themselves to the direction of God's word and Spirit steer a steady 
 course, even when they seem to be bewildered. While they are sure they 
 cannot lose their God and guide, they need not fear losing their way.

 3. The place they rested in, after three days' march: They went <I>out
 of the wilderness of Sinai,</I> and rested <I>in the wilderness of 
 Paran.</I> Note, All our removals in this world are but from one 
 wilderness to another. The changes which we think will be for the 
 better do not always prove so; while we carry about with us, wherever 
 we go, the common infirmities of human nature, we must expect, wherever 
 we go, to meet with its common calamities; we shall never be at rest, 
 never at home, till we come to heaven, and all will be well there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular draught of the order of their march, according to the 
 late model. 

 1. Judah's squadron marched first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 The leading standard, now lodged with that tribe, was an earnest of the 
 sceptre which in David's time should be committed to it, and looked 
 further to the captain of our salvation, of whom it was likewise 
 foretold that <I>unto him should the gathering of the people be.</I>

 2. Then came those two families of the Levites which were entrusted to
 carry the tabernacle. As soon as ever the cloud was taken up, the 
 tabernacle was taken down, and packed up for removing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And here the six wagons came laden with the more bulky part of the 
 tabernacle. This frequent removing of the tabernacle in all their
 journeys signified the movableness of that ceremonial dispensation. 
 That which was so often shifted would at length vanish away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.

 3. Reuben's squadron marched forward next, taking place after Judah,
 <I>according to the commandment of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 4. Then the Kohathites followed with their charge, the sacred furniture
 of the tabernacle, <I>in the midst of the camp,</I> the safest and most 
 honourable place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And they (that is, says the margin, the Gershonites and Merarites) did 
 <I>set up the tabernacle against they came;</I> and perhaps it is 
 expressed thus generally because, if there was occasion, not those 
 Levites only, but the other Israelites that were in the first squadron, 
 lent a hand to the tabernacle to hasten the rearing of it up, even 
 before they set up their own tents.

 5. Ephraim's squadron followed next after the ark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>),

 to which some think the psalmist alludes when he prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:2">Ps. lxxx. 2</A>),

 <I>Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh,</I> the three tribes that 
 composed this squadron, <I>stir up thy strength</I> (and the ark is 
 called his strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61">Ps. lxxviii. 61</A>),

 <I>and come and save us.</I>

 6. Dan's squadron followed last,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.

 It is called the <I>rearward,</I> or <I>gathering host,</I> of all the 
 camps, because it gathered up all that were left behind; not the women 
 and children (these we may suppose were taken care of by the heads of 
 their families in their respective tribes), but all the unclean, the 
 mixed multitude, and all that were weak and feeble, and cast behind in 
 their march. Note, He that leadeth Joseph like a flock has a tender
 regard to the hindmost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16">Ezek. xxxiv. 16</A>),

 that cannot keep pace with the rest, and <I>of all that are given him
 he will lose none,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11">John xvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
 Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will
 do thee good: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken good concerning Israel.
 &nbsp; 30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to
 mine own land, and to my kindred.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
 knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest
 be to us instead of eyes.
 &nbsp; 32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
 what goodness the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall do unto us, the same will we do unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 33 And they departed from the mount of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> three days'
 journey: and the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went before them
 in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for
 them.
 &nbsp; 34 And the cloud of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> upon them by day, when they
 went out of the camp.
 &nbsp; 35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
 said, Rise up, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let
 them that hate thee flee before thee.
 &nbsp; 36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, unto the many
 thousands of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An account of what passed between Moses and Hobab, now upon this 
 advance which the camp of Israel made towards Canaan. Some think that 
 Hobab was the same with Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, and that the 
 story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:1-27">Exod. xviii.</A>,

 should come in here; it seems more probable that Hobab was the son of
 Jethro, <I>alias</I> Reuel, or Raguel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:18">Exod. ii. 18</A>),

 and that when the father, being aged, went to his own land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:27">Exod. xviii. 27</A>),

 he left his son Hobab with Moses, as Barzillai left Chimham with David;
 and the same word signifies both a <I>father-in-law</I> and a 
 <I>brother-in-law.</I> Now this Hobab staid contentedly with Israel 
 while they encamped at mount Sinai, near his own country; but, now that 
 they were removing, he was for going back to his own country and 
 kindred, and his father's house. Here is,

 1. The kind invitation Moses gives him to go forward with them to
 Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He tempts him with a promise that they would certainly be kind to him, 
 and puts God's word in for security: <I>The Lord hath spoken good 
 concerning Israel.</I> As if he had said, "Come, cast in thy lot among 
 us, and thou shalt fare as we fare; and we have the promise of God that 
 we shall fare well." Note, Those that are bound for the heavenly Canaan 
 should invite and encourage all their friends to go along with them, 
 for we shall have never the less of the treasures of the covenant, and 
 the joys of heaven, for others coming in to share with us. And what 
 argument can be more powerful with us to take God's people for our 
 people than this, that God <I>hath spoken good concerning them?</I> It 
 is good having fellowship with those that have fellowship with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>),

 and going with those with whom God is,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 2. Hobab's inclination, and present resolution, to go back to his own
 country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 One would have thought that he who had seen so much of the special 
 presence of God with Israel, and such surprising tokens of his favour 
 to them, would not have needed much invitation to embark with them. But 
 his refusal must be imputed to the affection he had for his native air 
 and soil, which was not overpowered, as it ought to have been, by a 
 believing regard to the promise of God and a value for covenant 
 blessings. He was indeed a son of Abraham's loins (for the Midianites 
 descended from Abraham by Keturah), but not an heir of Abraham's faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>),

 else he would not have given Moses this answer. Note, The things of
 this world, which are seen, draw strongly from the pursuit of the 
 things of the other world, which are not seen. The magnetic virtue of 
 this earth prevails with most people above the attractives of heaven 
 itself.

 3. The great importunity Moses used with him to alter his resolution,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.
 
 He urges,

 (1.) That he might be serviceable to them: "<I>We are to encamp in the
 wilderness</I>" (a country well known to Hobab), "<I>and thou mayest be 
 to us instead of eyes,</I> not to show us where we must encamp, nor 
 what way we must march" (which the cloud was to direct), "but to show 
 us the conveniences and inconveniences of the place we march through 
 and encamp in, that we may make the best use we can of the 
 conveniences, and the best fence we can against the inconveniences." 
 Note, It will very well consist with our trust in God's providence to 
 make use of the help of our friends in those things wherein they are 
 capable of being serviceable to us. Even those that were led by miracle 
 must not slight the ordinary means of direction. Some think that Moses
 suggests this to Hobab, not because he expected much benefit from his 
 information, but to please him with the thought of being some way 
 useful to so great a body, and so to draw him on with them, by 
 inspiring him with an ambition to obtain that honour. Calvin gives 
 quite another sense of this place, very agreeably with the original, 
 which yet I do not find taken notice of by any since. "<I>Leave us
 not, I pray thee,</I> but come along, to share with us in the promised 
 land, <I>for therefore hast thou known our encampment in the 
 wilderness, and hast been to us instead of eyes;</I> and we cannot make 
 thee amends for sharing with us in our hardships, and doing us so many 
 good offices, unless thou go with us to Canaan. Surely for this reason 
 thou didst set out with us that thou mightest go on with us." Note, 
 Those that have begun well should use that as a reason for their 
 persevering, because otherwise they lose the benefit and recompence of 
 all they have done and suffered.

 (2.) That they would be kind to him: <I>What goodness the Lord shall do
 to us, the same we will do to thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] We can give only what we receive. We can do no more service and
 kindness to our friends than God is pleased to put it into the power of 
 our hand to do. This is all we dare promise, to do good as God shall
 enable us. 

 [2.] Those that share with God's Israel in their labours and hardships 
 shall share with them in their comforts and honours. Those that are 
 willing to take their lot with them in the wilderness shall have their 
 lot with them in Canaan; <I>if we suffer with them we shall reign with 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:12,Lu+22:28,29">2 Tim. ii. 12; 
 Luke xxii. 28, 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We do not find any reply that Hobab here made to Moses, and therefore 
 we hope that his silence gave consent, and he did not leave them, but 
 that, when he perceived he might be useful, he preferred that before 
 the gratifying of his own inclination; in this case he left us a good 
 example. And we find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16,1Sa+15:6">Judg. i. 16; 1 Sam. xv. 6</A>)

 that his family was no loser by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the communion between God and Israel in this removal. 
 They left <I>the mount of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 that Mount Sinai where they had seen his glory and heard his voice, and
 had been taken into covenant with him (they must not expect that such 
 appearances of God to them as they had there been blessed with should 
 be constant); they departed from that celebrated mountain, which we 
 never read of in scripture any more, unless with reference to these 
 past stories; now farewell, Sinai; <I>Zion</I> is the mountain of which 
 God has said. <I>This is my rest for ever</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:14">Ps. cxxxii. 14</A>),

 and of which we must say so. But when they left the <I>mount of the
 Lord</I> they took with them the <I>ark of the covenant of the 
 Lord,</I> by which their stated communion with God was to be kept up. 
 For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By it God did <I>direct their paths.</I> The ark of the covenant 
 went before them, some think in <I>place,</I> at least in this removal; 
 others think only in <I>influence;</I> though it was carried in the 
 midst of the camp, yet the cloud that hovered over it directed all 
 their motions. The ark (that is, the God of the ark) is said to 
 <I>search out a resting place</I> for them; not that God's infinite 
 wisdom and knowledge need to make searches, but every place they were 
 directed to was as convenient for them as if the wisest man they had 
 among them had been employed to go before them, and mark out their camp 
 to the best advantage. thus Canaan is said to be a land which God 
 <I>spied out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:6">Ezek. xx. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By it they did <I>in all their ways acknowledge God,</I> looking 
 upon it as a token of God's presence; when that moved, or rested, they 
 had their eye up unto God. Moses, as the mouth of the congregation, 
 lifted up a prayer, both at the removing and at the resting of the ark; 
 thus their going out and coming in were sanctified by prayer, and it is 
 an example to us to begin and end every day's journey, and every day's 
 work, with prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is his prayer when the ark set forward: <I>Rise up, Lord, and 
 let thy enemies be scattered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 They were now in a desolate country, but they were marching towards an 
 enemy's country, and their dependence was upon God for success and 
 victory in their wars, as well as for direction and supply in the 
 wilderness. David used this prayer long after 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:1">Ps. lxviii. 1</A>),

 for he also fought the Lords' battles. Note,

 [1.] There are those in the world that are enemies to God, and haters
 of him: secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, his laws, his 
 ordinances, his people. 

 [2.] The scattering and defeating of God's enemies is a thing to be 
 earnestly desired, and believingly expected, by all the Lord's people. 
 This prayer is a prophecy. Those that persist in rebellion against God 
 are hasting towards their own ruin. 

 [3.] For the scattering and defeating of God's enemies, there needs no
 more but God's arising. <I>When God arose to judgment,</I> the work
 was soon done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:8,9">Ps. lxxvi. 8, 9</A>.

 "Rise, Lord, as the sun riseth to scatter the shadows of the night."
 Christ's rising from the dead scattered his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His prayer when the ark rested, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 [1.] That God would cause his people to rest. So some read it,
 "<I>Return, O Lord, the many thousands of Israel,</I> return them to 
 their rest again after this fatigue." Thus it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:14">Isa. lxiii. 14</A>),

 <I>The Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest.</I> Thus he prays that
 God would give Israel success and victory abroad, and peace and 
 tranquillity at home. 

 [2.] That God himself would take up his rest among them. So we read it: 
 <I>Return to the thousands of Israel,</I> the <I>ten thousand 
 thousand,</I> so the word is. Note, <I>First,</I> The church of God is 
 a great body; there are many thousands belonging to God's Israel.
 <I>Secondly,</I> We ought in our prayers to concern ourselves for this 
 body. <I>Thirdly,</I> The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God 
 consist in the continual presence of God among them. Their safety
 consists not in their numbers, though they are thousands, many 
 thousands, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return to them 
 and residence with them. These thousands are cyphers; he is the figure: 
 and upon this account, <I>Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto 
 thee, O people!</I></P>
