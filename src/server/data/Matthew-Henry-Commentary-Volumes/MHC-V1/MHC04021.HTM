 The armies of Israel now begin to emerge out of the wilderness, and to 
 come into a land inhabited, to enter upon action, and take possession 
 of the frontiers of the land of promise. A glorious campaign this 
 chapter gives us the history of, especially in the latter part of it. 
 Here is, 
 
 I. The defeat of Arad the Canaanite,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The chastisement of the people with fiery serpents for their
 murmurings, and the relief granted them upon their submission by a 
 brazen serpent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 III. Several marches forward, and some occurrences by the way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:10-20">ver. 10-20</A>.

 IV. The celebrated conquest of Sihon king of the Amorites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:21-32">ver. 21-32</A>),

 and of Og king of Bashan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:33-35">ver. 33-35</A>),

 and possession taken of their land.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And <I>when</I> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
 heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
 fought against Israel, and took <I>some</I> of them prisoners.
 &nbsp; 2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, If thou wilt
 indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
 destroy their cities.
 &nbsp; 3 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
 up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
 cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The descent which Arad the Canaanite made upon the camp of Israel, 
 hearing that they came <I>by the way of the spies;</I> for, though the 
 spies which Moses had sent thirty-eight years before then passed and 
 repassed unobserved, yet their coming, and their errand, it is likely, 
 were afterwards known to the Canaanites, gave them an alarm, and 
 induced them to keep an eye upon Israel and get intelligence of all 
 their motions. Now, when they understood that they were facing about 
 towards Canaan, this Arad, thinking it policy to keep the war at a 
 distance, made an onset upon them and fought with them. But it proved 
 that he meddled to his own hurt; had he sat still, his people might 
 have been last destroyed of all the Canaanites, but now they were the 
 first. Thus those that are <I>overmuch wicked die before their 
 time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>.

 2. His success at first in this attempt. His advance-guards picked up
 some straggling Israelites, and took them prisoners,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This, no doubt, puffed him up, and he began to thin that he should have 
 the honour of crushing this formidable body, and saving his country 
 from the ruin which it threatened. It was likewise a trial to the faith 
 of the Israelites and a check to them for their distrusts and 
 discontents. 
 
 3. Israel's humble address to God upon this occasion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was a temptation to them to murmur as their fathers did, and to 
 despair of getting possession of Canaan; but God, who thus tried them 
 by his providence, enabled them by his grace to quit themselves well in 
 the trial, and to trust in him for relief against this fierce and 
 powerful assailant. They, by their elders, in prayer for success, 
 <I>vowed a vow.</I> Noe, When we are desiring and expecting mercy from 
 God we should bind our souls with a bond that we will faithfully do our 
 duty to him, particularly that we will honour him with the mercy we are 
 in the pursuit of. Thus Israel here promised to destroy the cities of 
 these Canaanites, as devoted to God, and not to take the spoil of them 
 to their own use. If God would give them victory, he should have all 
 the praise, and they would not make a gain of it to themselves. When we 
 are in this frame we are prepared to receive mercy. 

 4. The victory which the Israelites obtained over the Canaanites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 A strong party was sent out, probably under the command of Joshua, 
 which not only drove back these Canaanites, but followed them to their 
 cities, which probably lay on the edge of the wilderness, and utterly 
 destroyed them, and so returned to the camp. <I>Vincimur in
 pr&aelig;lie, sed non in bello--We lose a battle, but we finally 
 triumph.</I> What is said of the tribe of God is true of all God's 
 Israel, a troop may overcome them, but they shall overcome at the last. 
 The place was called <I>Hormah,</I> as a memorial of the destruction, 
 for the terror of the Canaanites, and probably for warning to posterity 
 not to attempt the rebuilding of these cities, which were destroyed as 
 devoted to God and sacrifices to divine justice. And it appears from 
 the instance of Jericho that the law concerning such cities was that 
 they should never be rebuilt. There seems to be an allusion to this 
 name in the prophecy of the fall of the New Testament Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:16">Rev. xvi. 16</A>),

 where its forces are said to be gathered together to a place called
 <I>Armageddon--the destruction of a troop.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
 to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
 discouraged because of the way.
 &nbsp; 5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses,
 Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
 wilderness? for <I>there is</I> no bread, neither <I>is there any</I>
 water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
 bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
 &nbsp; 7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
 for we have spoken against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and against thee; pray unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses
 prayed for the people.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
 set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
 that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole,
 and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when
 he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The fatigue of Israel by a long march round the land of Edom, 
 because they could not obtain passage through it the nearest way: 
 <I>The soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Perhaps the way was rough and uneven, or foul and dirty; or it fretted 
 them to go far about, and that they were not permitted to force their 
 passage through the Edomites' country. Those that are of a fretful 
 discontented spirit will always find something or other to make them 
 uneasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their unbelief and murmuring upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though they had just now obtained a glorious victory over the 
 Canaanites, and were going on conquering and to conquer, yet they speak 
 very discontentedly of what God had done for them and distrustfully of 
 what he would do, vexed that they were brought out of Egypt, that they 
 had not bread and water as other people had by their own care and 
 industry, but by miracle, they knew not how. They have <I>bread enough 
 and to spare;</I> and yet they complain <I>there is no bread,</I> 
 because, though they eat angels' food, yet they are weary of it; manna 
 itself is loathed, and called <I>light bread,</I> fit for children, not 
 for men and soldiers. What will those be pleased with whom manna will 
 not please? Those that are disposed to quarrel will find fault where
 there is no fault to be found. Thus those who have long enjoyed the 
 means of grace are apt to surfeit even on the heavenly manna, and to 
 call it light bread. But let not the contempt which some cast upon the 
 word of God cause us to value it the less: it is the bread of life, 
 substantial bread, and will nourish those who by faith feed upon it to 
 eternal life, whoever calls it light bread.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The righteous judgment which God brought upon them for their 
 murmuring, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He sent <I>fiery serpents among them,</I> which bit or stung many of 
 them to death. The wilderness through which they had passed was all 
 along infested with those fiery serpents, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15">Deut. viii. 15</A>.

 But hitherto God had wonderfully preserved his people from receiving
 hurt by them, till now that they murmured, to chastise them for which 
 these animals, which hitherto had shunned their camp, now invade it. 
 Justly are those made to feel God's judgments that are not thankful for 
 his mercies. These serpents are called <I>fiery,</I> from their colour, 
 or from their rage, or from the effects of their bitings, inflaming the 
 body, putting it immediately into a high fever, scorching it with an 
 insatiable thirst. They had unjustly complained for want of water

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 to chastise them for which God sends upon them this thirst, which no 
 water would quench. Those that cry without cause have justly cause 
 given them to cry out. They distrustfully concluded that they must 
 <I>die in the wilderness,</I> and God took them at their word, chose 
 their delusions, and brought their unbelieving fears upon them; many of 
 them did die. They had impudently flown in the face of God himself, and 
 the <I>poison of asps was under their lips,</I> and now these fiery 
 serpents (which, it should seem, were flying serpents, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:29">Isa. xiv. 29</A>)

 flew in their faces and poisoned them. They in their pride had lifted
 themselves up against God and Moses, and now God humbled and mortified 
 them, by making these despicable animals a plague to them. That
 artillery is now turned against them which had formerly been made use 
 of in their defence against the Egyptians. He that brought quails to 
 feast them let them know that he could bring serpents to bite them; the 
 whole creation is at war with those that are in arms against God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their repentance and supplication to God under this judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 They confess their fault: <I>We have sinned.</I> They are particular in 
 their confession: <I>We have spoken against the Lord, and against 
 thee.</I> It is to be feared that they would not have owned the sin if 
 they had not felt the smart; but they relent under the rod; <I>when he 
 slew them, then they sought him.</I> They beg the prayers of Moses for 
 them, as conscious to themselves of their own unworthiness to be heard, 
 and convinced of the great interest which Moses had in heaven. How soon 
 is their tone altered! Those who had just before quarrelled with him as 
 their worst enemy now make their court to him as their best friend, and 
 choose him for their advocate with God. Afflictions often change men's
 sentiments concerning God's people, and teach them to value those 
 prayers which, at a former period, they had scorned. Moses, to show 
 that he had heartily forgiven them, blesses those who had cursed him, 
 and <I>prays for those who had despitefully used him</I> Herein he was 
 a type of Christ, who interceded for his persecutors, and a pattern to 
 us to go and do likewise, and thus to show that we <I>love our 
 enemies.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The wonderful provision which God made for their relief. He did not 
 employ Moses in summoning the judgment, but, that he might recommend 
 him to the good affection of the people, he made him instrumental in 
 their relief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 God ordered Moses to make the representation of a fiery serpent, which 
 he did, in brass, and set it up on a very long pole, so that it might 
 be seen from all parts of the camp, and every one that was stung with a 
 fiery serpent was healed by looking up to this serpent of brass. The 
 people prayed that God would <I>take away the serpents from them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but God saw fit not to do this: for he gives effectual relief in the 
 best way, though not in our way. Thus those who did not die for their 
 murmuring were yet made to smart for it, that they might the more 
 feelingly repent and humble themselves for it; they were likewise made 
 to receive their cure from God, by the hand of Moses, that they might 
 be taught, if possible, never again to speak against God and Moses. 
 This method of cure was altogether miraculous, and the more wonderful 
 if what some naturalists say be true, that looking upon bright and 
 burnished brass is hurtful to those that are stung with fiery serpents. 
 God can bring about his purposes by contrary means. The Jews themselves 
 say that it was not the sight of the brazen serpent that cured them, 
 but, in looking up to it, they looked up to God as the Lord that healed 
 them. But there was much of gospel in this appointment. Our Saviour has 
 told us so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14,15">John iii. 14, 15</A>),

 that <I>as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so the Son of
 man must be lifted up,</I> that <I>whosoever believeth in him should 
 not perish.</I> Observe then a resemblance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Between their disease and ours. The devil is the old serpent, a 
 fiery serpent, hence he appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:3">Rev. xii. 3</A>)

 as a <I>great red dragon.</I> Sin is the biting of this fiery serpent;
 it is painful to the startled conscience, and poisonous to the seared 
 conscience.  Satan's temptations are called his <I>fiery darts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16">Eph. vi. 16</A>.

 Lust and passion inflame the soul, so do the terrors of the Almighty,
 when they <I>set themselves in array.</I> At the last, sin <I>bites 
 like a serpent</I> and <I>stings like an adder;</I> and even its sweets 
 are turned into the gall of asps.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Between their remedy and ours. 

 (1.) It was God himself that devised and prescribed this antidote
 against the fiery serpents; so our salvation by Christ was the 
 contrivance of Infinite Wisdom; God himself has found the ransom.

 (2.) It was a very unlikely method of cure; so our salvation by the
 death of Christ is <I>to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the Greeks 
 foolishness.</I> It was Moses that <I>lifted up the serpent in the 
 wilderness,</I> so the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, and 
 Moses wrote of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:4-6">John v. 4-6</A>.

 Christ was lifted up by the rulers of the Jews, who were the successors
 of Moses.

 (3.) That which cured was shaped in the likeness of that which wounded.
 So Christ, though perfectly free from sin himself, yet was <I>made in 
 the likeness of sinful flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>),

 so like that it was taken for granted that this man was a sinner,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:24">John ix. 24</A>.

 (4.) The brazen serpent was lifted up; so was Christ. He was lifted up
 upon the cross 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:33,34">John xii. 33, 34</A>),

 for his was made a spectacle to the world. He was lifted up by the
 preaching of the gospel. The word here used for a <I>pole</I> signifies 
 a <I>banner,</I> or <I>ensign,</I> for Christ crucified <I>stands for 
 an ensign of the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>.

 Some make the lifting up of the serpent to be a figure of Christ's
 triumphing over Satan, the old serpent, whose head he bruised, when in 
 his cross he made an open show of the principalities and powers which 
 he had spoiled and destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Between the application of their remedy and ours. They looked and 
 lived, and we, if we believe, shall not perish; it is by faith that we 
 look unto Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 <I>Look unto me, and be you saved,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:22">Isa. xlv. 22</A>.

 We must be sensible of our wound and of our danger by it, receive the
 record which God has given concerning his Son, and rely upon the 
 assurance he has given us that we shall be healed and saved by him if 
 we resign ourselves to his direction. The brazen serpent's being lifted 
 up would not cure if it was not looked upon. If any pored on their 
 wound, and would not look up to the brazen serpent, they inevitably 
 died. If they slighted this method of cure, and had recourse to natural 
 medicines, and trusted to them, they justly perished; so if sinners 
 either despise Christ's righteousness or despair of benefit by it their 
 wound will, without doubt, be fatal. But whoever looked up to this 
 healing sign, though from the outmost part of the camp, though with a 
 weak and weeping eye, was certainly healed; so whosoever believes in 
 Christ, though as yet but weak in faith, shall not perish.  There are 
 weak brethren <I>for whom Christ died.</I> Perhaps for some time after 
 the serpent was set up the camp of Israel was molested by the fiery 
 serpents; and it is the probable conjecture of some that they carried 
 this brazen serpent along with them through the rest of their journey, 
 and set it up wherever they encamped, and, when they settled in Canaan, 
 fixed it somewhere within the borders of the land; for it is not likely 
 that the children of Israel went so far off as this was into the 
 wilderness to burn incense to it, as we find they did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:4">2 Kings xviii. 4</A>.

 Even those that are delivered from the eternal death which is the wages
 of sin must expect to feel the pain and smart of it as long as they are 
 here in this world; but, if it be not our own fault, we may have the 
 brazen serpent to accompany us, to be still looked up to upon all 
 occasions, by bearing about with us continually the dying of the Lord 
 Jesus.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in
 Oboth.
 &nbsp; 11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in
 the wilderness which <I>is</I> before Moab, toward the sunrising.
 &nbsp; 12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of
 Zared.
 &nbsp; 13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
 Arnon, which <I>is</I> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts
 of the Amorites: for Arnon <I>is</I> the border of Moab, between Moab
 and the Amorites.
 &nbsp; 14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
 &nbsp; 15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
 dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
 &nbsp; 16 And from thence <I>they went</I> to Beer: that <I>is</I> the well
 whereof the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, Gather the people together,
 and I will give them water.
 &nbsp; 17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
 it:
 &nbsp; 18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
 it, by <I>the direction of</I> the lawgiver, with their staves. And
 from the wilderness <I>they went</I> to Mattanah:
 &nbsp; 19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
 &nbsp; 20 And from Bamoth <I>in</I> the valley, that <I>is</I> in the country of
 Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the several stages and removals of the 
 children of Israel, till they came into the plains of Moab, out of 
 which they at length passed over Jordan into Canaan, as we read in the 
 beginning of Joshua. Natural motions are quicker the nearer they are to 
 their centre. The Israelites were now drawing near to the promised 
 rest, and now they <I>set forward,</I> as the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It were well if we would do thus in our way to heaven, rid ground in 
 the latter end of our journey, and the nearer we come to heaven be so 
 much the more active and abundant in the work of the Lord. Two things 
 especially are observable in the brief account here given of these 
 removals:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The wonderful success which God blessed his people with, near the 
 brooks of Arnon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.

 They had now compassed the land of Edom (which they were not to invade, 
 nor so much as to disturb, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:4,5">Deut. ii. 4, 5</A>),

 and had come to the border of Moab. It is well that there are more ways
 than one to Canaan.  The enemies of God's people may retard their 
 passage, but cannot prevent their entrance into the promised rest. Care 
 is taken to let us know that the Israelites in their march religiously 
 observed the orders which God gave them to use no hostility against the 
 Moabites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9">Deut. ii. 9</A>),

 because they were the posterity of righteous Lot; therefore they
 pitched on the other side of Arnon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that side which was now in the possession of the Amorites, one of the 
 devoted nations, though formerly it had belonged to Moab, as appears 
 here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 This care of theirs not to offer violence to the Moabites is pleaded by 
 Jephtha long afterwards, in his remonstrance against the Ammonites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:15-23">Judg. xi. 15</A>,

 &c.), and turned to them for a testimony. What their achievements were,
 now that they pitched on the banks of the river Arnon, we are not 
 particularly told, but are referred to the <I>book of the wars of the 
 Lord,</I> perhaps that book which was begun with the history of the war 
 with the Amalekites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14">Exod. xvii. 14</A>.

 <I>Write it</I> (said God) <I>for a memorial in a book,</I> to which
 were added all the other battles which Israel fought, in order, and, 
 among the rest, their actions on the river Arnon, at <I>Vaheb</I> in 
 <I>Suphah</I> (as our margin reads it) and other places on that river. 
 Or, <I>it shall be said</I> (as some read it) <I>in the rehearsal,</I> 
 or commemoration, <I>of the wars of the Lord, what he did in the Red 
 Sea,</I> when he brought Israel out of Egypt, and what he did <I>in the 
 brooks of Arnon,</I> just before he brought them into Canaan. Note, In 
 celebrating the memorials of God's favours to us, it is good to observe 
 the series of them, and how divine goodness and mercy have constantly 
 followed us, even from the Red Sea to the brooks of Arnon. In every 
 stage of our lives, nay, in every step, we should take notice of what 
 God has wrought for us; what he did at such a time, and what in such a 
 place, ought to be distinctly remembered.</P>

 2. The wonderful supply which God blessed his people with at 
 <I>Beer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 which signifies the <I>well</I> or <I>fountain.</I> It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 they pitched in <I>Oboth,</I> which signifies <I>bottles,</I> so called 
 perhaps because there they filled their bottles with water, which 
 should last them for some time; but by this time, we may suppose, it 
 was with them as it was with Hagar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:15">Gen. xxi. 15</A>),

 <I>The water was spent in the bottle;</I> yet we do not find that they
 murmured, and therefore God, in compassion to them, brought them to a 
 well of water, to encourage them to wait on him in humble silence and 
 expectation and to believe that he would graciously take cognizance of 
 their wants, though they did not complain of them. In this world, we do 
 at the best but pitch in <I>Oboth,</I> where our comforts lie in close 
 and scanty vessels; when we come to heaven we shall remove to 
 <I>Beer,</I> the well of life, the fountain of living waters. Hitherto 
 we have found, when they were supplied with water, they asked it in 
 unjust discontent, and God gave it in just displeasure; but here we 
 find,

 (1.) That God gave it in love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Gather the people together,</I> to be witnesses of the wonder, and 
 joint-sharers in the favour, <I>and I will give them water.</I> Before 
 they prayed, God granted, and anticipated them with the blessings of 
 his goodness.

 (2.) That they received it with joy and thankfulness, which made the
 mercy doubly sweet to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Then they sang this song, to the glory of God and the encouragement of 
 one another, <I>Spring up, O well!</I> Thus they pray that it may 
 spring up, for promised mercies must be fetched in by prayer; they 
 triumph that it does spring up, and meet it with their joyful 
 acclamations. With joy must we <I>draw water out of the wells of 
 salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3">Isa. xi. 3</A>.

 As the brazen serpent was a figure of Christ, who is lifted up for our
 cure, so is this well a figure of the Spirit, who is poured forth for 
 our comfort, and from whom flow to us <I>rivers of living waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38">John vii. 38</A>.

 Does this well spring up in our souls?  We should sing to it; take the
 comfort to ourselves, and give the glory to God; stir up this gift, 
 sing to it, <I>Spring up, O well!</I> thou <I>fountain of gardens,</I> 
 to water my soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:15">Cant. iv. 15</A>),

 plead the promise, which perhaps alludes to this story

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:17,18">Isa. xli. 17, 18</A>),

 <I>I will make the wilderness wells of water.</I>

 (3.) That whereas before the remembrance of the miracle was perpetuated
 in the names given to the places, which signified the people's strife 
 and murmuring, now it was perpetuated in a song of praise, which 
 preserved on record the manner in which it was done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The princes digged the well,</I> the seventy elders, it is probable, 
 <I>by direction of the lawgiver</I> (that is, Moses, under God) <I>with 
 their staves;</I> that is, with their staves they made holes in the 
 soft and sandy ground, and God caused the water miraculously to spring 
 up in the holes which they made. Thus the pious Israelites long 
 afterwards, <I>passing through the valley of Baca,</I> a dry and 
 thirsty place, made wells, and God by rain from heaven filled the 
 pools, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6">Ps. lxxxiv. 6</A>.

 Observe,

 [1.] God promised to give them water, but the must open the ground to
 receive it, and give it vent. God's favours must be expected in the use 
 of such means as lie within our power, but still the excellency of the 
 power is of God. 

 [2.] The nobles of Israel were forward to set their hands to this work,
 and used their staves, probable those that were the ensigns of their 
 honour and power, for the public service, and it is upon record to 
 their honour. And we may suppose that it was a great confirmation to 
 them in their offices, and a great comfort to the people, that they 
 were made use of by the divine power as instruments to this miraculous 
 supply. By this it appeared that the spirit of Moses, who must shortly 
 die, rested in some measure upon the nobles of Israel. Moses did not 
 strike the ground himself, as formerly the rock, but gave them 
 direction to do it, that their staves might share in the honour of his 
 rod, and they might comfortably hope that when he should leave them yet 
 God would not, but that they also in their generation should be public 
 blessings, and might expect the divine presence with them as long as 
 they acted by the direction of the lawgiver. For comfort must be looked 
 for only in the way of duty; and, if we would share in divine joys, we 
 must carefully follow the divine direction.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
 fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <I>of</I> the waters
 of the well: <I>but</I> we will go along by the king's <I>high</I> way,
 until we be past thy borders.
 &nbsp; 23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his
 border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
 against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
 fought against Israel.
 &nbsp; 24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and
 possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children
 of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <I>was</I> strong.
 &nbsp; 25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all
 the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 26 For Heshbon <I>was</I> the city of Sihon the king of the
 Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and
 taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.
 &nbsp; 27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into
 Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:
 &nbsp; 28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the
 city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <I>and</I> the lords of
 the high places of Arnon.
 &nbsp; 29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
 hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
 captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
 &nbsp; 30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon,
 and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which <I>reacheth</I>
 unto Medeba.
 &nbsp; 31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
 &nbsp; 32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
 thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <I>were</I> there.
 &nbsp; 33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
 king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to
 the battle at Edrei.
 &nbsp; 34 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
 delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
 and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
 Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
 &nbsp; 35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
 there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

 We have here an account of the victories obtained by Israel over Sihon 
 and Og, which must be distinctly considered, not only because they are 
 here distinctly related, but because long afterwards the memorial of 
 them is distinctly celebrated, and they are severally assigned as 
 instances of everlasting mercy. He slew <I>Sihon king of the Amorites, 
 for his mercy endureth for ever, and Og the king of Bashan, for his 
 mercy endureth for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:19,20">Ps. cxxxvi. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Israel sent a peaceable message to Sihon king of the Amorites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but received an unpeaceable return, worse than that of the Edomites to 
 the like message, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:18,20"><I>ch.</I> xx. 18, 20</A>.

 For the Edomites only refused them a passage, and stood upon their own
 defence to keep them out; but Sihon went out with his forces <I>against 
 Israel in the wilderness,</I> out of his own borders, without any 
 provocation given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 and so ran himself upon his own ruin. Jephtha intimates that he was 
 prompted by his politics to do this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:20">Judg. xi. 20</A>),

 <I>Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast;</I> but his
 politics deceived him, for Moses says, <I>God hardened his spirit and 
 made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into the hand of 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:30">Deut. ii. 30</A>.

 The enemies of God's church are often infatuated in those very counsels
 which they think most wisely taken.  Sihon's army was routed, and not 
 only so, but all his country came into the possession of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 This seizure is justified, 

 1. Against the Amorites themselves, for they were the aggressors, and
 provoked the Israelites to battle; and yet, perhaps, that would not 
 have been sufficient to entitle Israel to their land, but that God 
 himself, the King of nations, the Lord of the whole earth, had given 
 them a grant of it. The Amorites formed one of the devoted nations 
 whose land God had promised to Abraham and his seed, which promise 
 should be performed when the iniquity of the Amorites should be full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:16">Gen. xv. 16</A>.

 Jephtha insists upon this grant as their title, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:23,24">Judg. xi. 23, 24</A>.

 The victory which God gave them over the Amorites put them in
 possession, and then, the promise made to their fathers having given 
 them a right, by virtue of that they kept possession.

 2. Against the Moabites, who had formerly been the lords-proprietors of
 this country. If they should ever lay claim to it, and should plead
 that God himself had provided that <I>none of their land should be 
 given to Israel for a possession</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9">Deut. ii. 9</A>),

 Moses here furnishes posterity with a replication to their plea, and
 Jephtha makes use of it against the Amorites 260 years afterwards, when 
 Israel's title to this country was questioned.

 (1.) The justification itself is that though it was true this country
 had belonged to the Moabites, yet the Amorites had taken it from them 
 some time before, and were now in full and quiet possession of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The Israelites did not take it out of the hands of the Moabites, they 
 had before lost it to the Amorites, and were constrained to give up 
 their pretensions to it; and, when Israel had taken it from the 
 Amorites, they were under no obligation to restore it to the Moabites, 
 whose title to it was long since extinguished. See here the uncertainty 
 of worldly possessions, how often they change their owners, and how 
 soon we may be deprived of them, even when we think ourselves most sure 
 of them; <I>they make themselves wings.</I> It is our wisdom therefore 
 to secure the good part which cannot be taken away from us. See also 
 the wisdom of the divine Providence and its perfect foresight, by which 
 preparation is made long before for the accomplishment of all God's 
 purposes in their season. This country being designed in due time for 
 Israel, it is beforehand put into the hand of the Amorites, who little 
 think that they have it but as trustees till Israel come of age, and 
 then must surrender it. We understand not the vast reaches of 
 Providence, but known unto God are all his works, as appears in this 
 instance, that he <I>set the bounds of the people according to the 
 number of the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8">Deut. xxxii. 8</A>.

 All that land which he intended for his chosen people he put into the
 possession of the devoted nations, that were to be driven out.

 (2.) For proof of the allegation, he refers to the authentic records of 
 the country, for so their proverbs or songs were, one of which he 
 quotes some passages out of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:27-30"><I>v.</I> 27-30</A>),

 which sufficiently proves what is vouched for, namely, 

 [1.] That such and such places that are here named, though they had
 been in the possession of the Moabites, had by right of war become the 
 dominion of Sihon king of the Amorites. Heshbon had become his city, 
 and he obtained such a quiet possession of it that it was built and 
 prepared for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and the country to Dibon and Nophah was likewise subdued, and annexed 
 to the kingdom of the Amorites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 [2.] That the Moabites were utterly disabled ever to regain the 
 possession. Even Ar of Moab, though not taken or attempted by Sihon, 
 but still remaining the metropolis of Moab, yet was so wasted by this 
 loss that is would never be able to make head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The Moabites were undone, and even Chemosh their god had given them up,
 as unable to rescue them out of the hands of Sihon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 By all this it appears that the Moabites' claim to this country was 
 barred for ever. There may be a further reason for inserting this
 Amorite poem, namely, to show that the triumphing of the wicked is 
 short. Those that had conquered the Moabites, and insulted over them, 
 were now themselves conquered and insulted over by the Israel of God.
 It is very probable that the same Sihon, king of the Amorites, that had 
 got this country from the Moabites, now lost it to the Israelites; for, 
 though it is said to be taken from a former king of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 yet not by a former king of the Amorites; and then it shows how 
 sometimes justice makes men to see the loss of that which they got by 
 violence, and were puffed up with the gain of. They are <I>exalted but 
 for a little while,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:24">Job xxiv. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Og king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his 
 neighbours to make peace with Israel, is instigated by it to make war 
 with them, which proves in like manner to be his destruction. Og was 
 also an Amorite, and therefore perhaps thought himself better able to 
 deal with Israel than his neighbours were, and more likely to prevail, 
 because of his own gigantic strength and stature, which Moses takes 
 notice of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:11">Deut. iii. 11</A>,

 where he gives a more full account of this story.  Here observe,

 1. That the Amorite begins the war
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 He <I>went out to battle against Israel.</I> His country was very rich 
 and pleasant. Bashan was famous for the best timber (witness the oaks 
 of Bashan), and the best breed of cattle, witness the bulls and kine of 
 Bashan, and the lambs and rams of that country, which are celebrated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14">Deut. xxxii. 14</A>.

 Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions
 against the judgments of God, but all in vain, when their day comes, on 
 which they must fall.

 2. That God interests himself in the cause, bids Israel not to fear
 this threatening force, and promises a complete victory: "<I>I have 
 delivered him into thy hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 the thing is as good as done already, it is all thy own, enter and take 
 possession." Giants are but worms before God's power. 

 3. That Israel is more than a conqueror, not only routs the enemies'
 army, but gains the enemies' country, which afterwards was part of the 
 inheritance of the two tribes and a half that were first seated on the 
 other side Jordan. God gave Israel these successes, while Moses was
 yet with them, both for his comfort (that he might see the beginning of 
 that glorious work, which he must not live to see the finishing of) and 
 for the encouragement of the people in the war of Canaan under Joshua.
 Though this was to them in comparison but as the day of small things, 
 yet it was an earnest of great things.</P>
