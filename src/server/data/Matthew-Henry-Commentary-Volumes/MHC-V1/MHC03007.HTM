 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Likewise this <I>is</I> the law of the trespass offering: it <I>is</I>
 most holy.
 &nbsp; 2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
 kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
 sprinkle round about upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
 the fat that covereth the inwards,
 &nbsp; 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that <I>is</I> on them, which
 <I>is</I> by the flanks, and the caul <I>that is</I> above the liver, with
 the kidneys, it shall he take away:
 &nbsp; 5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar <I>for</I> an
 offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: it <I>is</I> a trespass offering.
 &nbsp; 6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
 eaten in the holy place: it <I>is</I> most holy.
 &nbsp; 7 As the sin offering <I>is,</I> so <I>is</I> the trespass offering:
 <I>there is</I> one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement
 therewith shall have <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, <I>even</I>
 the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering
 which he hath offered.
 &nbsp; 9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
 that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
 priest's that offereth it.
 &nbsp; 10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall
 all the sons of Aaron have, one <I>as much</I> as another.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. Concerning the trespass-offering, that, being much of the same 
 nature with the sin-offering, it was to be governed by the same rules, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When the blood and fat were offered to God to make atonement, the 
 priests were to eat the flesh, as that of the sin-offering, in the holy 
 place. The Jews have a tradition (as we have it from the learned bishop 
 Patrick) concerning the sprinkling of the blood of the 
 trespass-offering <I>round about upon the altar,</I> "That there was a 
 scarlet line which went round about the altar exactly in the middle, 
 and the blood of the burnt-offerings was sprinkled round about above 
 the line, but that of the trespass-offerings and peace-offerings round 
 about below the line." As to the flesh of the trespass-offering, the 
 right to it belonged to the priest that offered it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He that did the work must have the wages. This was an encouragement to 
 the priests to give diligent attendance on the altar; the more ready 
 and busy they were the more they got. Note, The more diligent we are in 
 the services of religion the more we shall reap of the advantages of 
 it.  But any of the priests, and the males of their families, might be 
 invited by him to whom it belonged to partake with him: <I>Every male 
 among the priests shall eat thereof,</I> that is, may eat thereof, 
 <I>in the holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And, no doubt, it was the usage to treat one another with those 
 perquisites of their office, by which friendship and fellowship were 
 kept up among the priests. Freely they had received, and must freely 
 give. It seems the offerer was not himself to have any share of his 
 trespass-offering, as he was to have of his peace-offering; but it was 
 all divided between the altar and the priest. They offered 
 peace-offerings in thankfulness for mercy, and then it was proper to 
 feast; but they offered trespass-offerings in sorrow for sin, and then 
 fasting was more proper, in token of holy mourning, and a resolution to 
 abstain from sin.

 2. Concerning the burnt-offering it is here appointed that the priest 
 that offered it should have the skin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which no doubt he might make money of. "This" (the Jews say) "is meant 
 only for the burnt-offerings which were offered by particular persons; 
 for the profit of the skins of the daily burnt-offerings for the 
 congregation went to the repair of the sanctuary." Some suggest that 
 this appointment will help us to understand God's clothing our first 
 parents with <I>coats of skins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:21">Gen. iii. 21</A>.

 It is probable that the beasts whose skins they were were offered in
 sacrifice as whole burnt-offerings, and that Adam was the priest that 
 offered them; and then God gave him the skins, as his fee, to make 
 clothes of for himself and his wife, in remembrance of which the skins 
 ever after pertained to the priest; and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:16">Gen. xxvii. 16</A>.

 3. Concerning the meat-offering, if it was dressed, it was fit to be
 eaten immediately; and therefore the priest that offered it was to have 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If it was dry, there was not so much occasion for being in haste to use 
 it; and therefore an equal dividend of it must be made among all the 
 priests that were then in waiting,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And this <I>is</I> the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
 which he shall offer unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
 the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil,
 and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with
 oil, of fine flour, fried.
 &nbsp; 13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer <I>for</I> his offering
 leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
 offerings.
 &nbsp; 14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation <I>for</I>
 an heave offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> it shall be the priest's
 that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
 thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he
 shall not leave any of it until the morning.
 &nbsp; 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering <I>be</I> a vow, or a
 voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he
 offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of
 it shall be eaten:
 &nbsp; 17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
 day shall be burnt with fire.
 &nbsp; 18 And if <I>any</I> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
 offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
 accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it:
 it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall
 bear his iniquity.
 &nbsp; 19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean <I>thing</I> shall not be
 eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
 that be clean shall eat thereof.
 &nbsp; 20 But the soul that eateth <I>of</I> the flesh of the sacrifice of
 peace offerings, that <I>pertain</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, having his
 uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
 people.
 &nbsp; 21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean <I>thing, as</I>
 the uncleanness of man, or <I>any</I> unclean beast, or any abominable
 unclean <I>thing,</I> and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
 offerings, which <I>pertain</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even that soul shall be
 cut off from his people.
 &nbsp; 22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
 manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
 &nbsp; 24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat
 of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
 but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
 &nbsp; 25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men
 offer an offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even the soul that
 eateth <I>it</I> shall be cut off from his people.
 &nbsp; 26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, <I>whether it be</I> of
 fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
 &nbsp; 27 Whatsoever soul <I>it be</I> that eateth any manner of blood,
 even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
 &nbsp; 28 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
 the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring
 his oblation unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of the sacrifice of his peace
 offerings.
 &nbsp; 30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made by
 fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast
 may be waved <I>for</I> a wave offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
 breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.
 &nbsp; 32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest <I>for</I>
 an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
 peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for
 <I>his</I> part.
 &nbsp; 34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of
 the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
 offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his
 sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All this relates to the peace-offerings: it is the repetition and 
 explication of what we had before, with various additions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The nature and intention of the peace-offerings are here more 
 distinctly opened. They were offered either, 

 1. In thankfulness for some special mercy received, such as recovery
 from sickness, preservation in a journey, deliverance at sea,
 redemption out of captivity, all which are specified in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:1-43">
 Ps. cvii.</A>,

 and for them men are called upon to offer the sacrifice of
 thanksgiving, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Or,

 2. In performance of some vow which a man made when he was in distress
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and this was less honourable than the former, though the omission of it 
 would have been more culpable. Or,

 3. In supplication for some special mercy which a man was in the
 pursuit and expectation of, here called a <I>voluntary offering.</I> 
 This accompanied a man's prayers, as the former did his praises. We do 
 not find that men were bound by the law, unless they had bound 
 themselves by vow, to offer these peace-offerings upon such occasions, 
 as they were to bring their sacrifices of atonement in case of sin 
 committed. Not but that prayer and praise are as much our duty as
 repentance is; but here, in the expressions of their sense of mercy, 
 God left them more to their liberty than in the expressions of their 
 sense of sin--to try the generosity of their devotion, and that their 
 sacrifices, being free-will offerings, might be the more laudable and 
 acceptable; and, by obliging them to bring the sacrifices of atonement, 
 God would show the necessity of the great propitiation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rites and ceremonies about the peace-offerings are enlarged 
 upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If the peace-offering was offered for a thanksgiving, a 
 meat-offering must be offered with it, cakes of several sorts, and 
 wafers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and (which was peculiar to the peace-offerings) leavened bread must be 
 offered, not to be burnt upon the altar, that was forbidden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:11"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11</A>),

 but to be eaten with the flesh of the sacrifice, that nothing might be
 wanting to make it a complete and pleasant feast; for unleavened bread 
 was less grateful to the taste, and therefore, though enjoined in the 
 passover for a particular reason, yet in other festivals leavened 
 bread, which was lighter and more pleasant, was appointed, that men 
 might feast at God's table as well as at their own.  And some think 
 that a meat-offering is required to be brought with every 
 peace-offering, as well as with that of thanksgiving, by that law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 which requires an oblation with it, that the table might be as well 
 furnished as the altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The flesh of the peace-offerings, both that which was the priest's 
 share and that which was the offerer's must be eaten quickly, and not 
 kept long, either raw, or dressed, cold. If it was a peace-offering for 
 thanksgiving, it must be all eaten the same day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 if a vow, or voluntary offering, it must be eaten either the same day 
 or the day after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If any was left beyond the time limited, it was to be burnt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 and, if any person ate of what was so left their conduct should be 
 animadverted upon as a very high misdemeanour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Though they were not obliged to eat it in the holy place, as those 
 offerings that are called most holy, but might take it to their own 
 tents and feast upon it there, yet God would by this law make them to 
 know a difference between that and other meat, and religiously to 
 observe it, that whereas they might keep other meat cold in the house 
 as long as they thought fit, and warm it again if they pleased, and eat 
 it three or four days after, they might not do so with the flesh of 
 their peace-offerings, but it must be eaten immediately.

 (1.) Because God would not have that holy flesh to be in danger of 
 putrefying, or being fly-blown, to prevent which it must be salted with 
 <I>fire</I> (as the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:49">Mark ix. 49</A>)

 if it were kept; as, if it was used, it must be salted with salt.

 (2.) Because God would not have his people to be niggardly and sparing,
 and distrustful of providence, but cheerfully to enjoy what God gives 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:15">Eccl. viii. 15</A>),

 and to do good with it, and not to be anxiously solicitous for the
 morrow.

 (3.) The flesh of the peace-offerings was God's treat, and therefore
 God would have the disposal of it; and he orders it to be used 
 generously for the entertainment of their friends, and charitably for 
 the relief of the poor, to show that he is a bountiful benefactor, 
 <I>giving us all things richly to enjoy,</I> the bread of the day in 
 its day. If the sacrifice was thanksgiving, they were especially 
 obliged thus to testify their holy joy in God's goodness by their holy 
 feasting. This law is made very strict 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that if the offerer did not take care to have all his offering eaten by 
 himself or his family, his friends or the poor, within the time limited 
 by the law, or, in the event of any part being left, to burn it (which 
 was the most decent way of disposing of it, the sacrifices upon the 
 altar being <I>consumed by fire</I>), then his offering should not be 
 accepted, nor imputed to him. Note, All the benefit of our religious 
 services is lost if we do not improve them, and conduct ourselves 
 aright afterwards.  They are not acceptable to God if they have not a 
 due influence upon ourselves. If a man seemed generous in bringing a 
 peace-offering, and yet afterwards proved sneaking and paltry in the 
 using of it, it was as if he had never brought it; nay, <I>it shall be 
 an abomination.</I> Note, There is no mean between God's acceptance and 
 his abhorrence. If our persons and performances are sincere and 
 upright, they are accepted; if not, they are an abomination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 He that eats it after the time appointed shall <I>bear his
 iniquity,</I> that is, he shall be <I>cut off from his people,</I> as 
 it is explained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:8"><I>ch.</I> xix. 8</A>),

 where this law is repeated. This law of eating the peace-offerings
 before the third day, that they might not putrefy, is applicable tot 
 the resurrection of Christ after two days, that, being God's <I>holy 
 one,</I> he might not see corruption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps. xvi. 10</A>.

 And some think that it instructs us speedily, and without delay, to
 partake of Christ and his grace, feeding and feasting thereon by faith 
 to-day, <I>while it is called to-day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:13,14">Heb. iii. 13, 14</A>),

 for it will be too late shortly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. But the flesh, and those that eat it, must be pure. 

 (1.) The flesh must <I>touch no unclean thing;</I> if it did, it must 
 not be eaten, but burnt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 If, in carrying it from the altar to the place where it was eaten, a 
 dog touched it, or it touched a dead body or any other unclean thing, 
 it was then unfit to be used in a religious feast. Every thing we 
 honour the holy God with must be pure and carefully kept from all 
 pollution. It is a case adjudged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:12">Hag. ii. 12</A>)

 that the holy flesh could not by its touch communicate holiness to what
 was common; but by this law it is determined that by the touch of that 
 which was unclean it received pollution from it, which intimates that 
 the infection of sin is more easily and more frequently communicated 
 than the savour of grace.

 (2.) It must not be eaten by any unclean person. When a person was upon
 any account ceremonially unclean it was at his peril if he presumed to 
 eat of the flesh of the peace-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 Holy things are only for holy persons; the holiness of the food being 
 ceremonial, those were incapacitated to partake of it who lay under any 
 ceremonial uncleanness; but we are hereby taught to preserve ourselves 
 pure from all the pollutions of sin, that we may have the benefit and 
 comfort of Christ's sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1,2">1 Pet. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 Our consciences must be purged from dead works, that we may be fit to
 <I>serve the living God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14">Heb. ix. 14</A>.

 But if any dare to partake of the table of the Lord under the pollution
 of sin unrepented of, and so profane sacred things, they eat and drink 
 <I>judgment to themselves,</I> as those did that ate of the 
 peace-offerings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 that they <I>pertain unto the Lord:</I> whatever pertains to the Lord 
 is sacred, and must be used with great reverence and not with 
 unhallowed hands. "<I>Be you holy,</I> for God is holy, and you pertain 
 to him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The eating of blood and the fat of the inwards is here again 
 prohibited; and the prohibition is annexed as before to the law of the 
 peace-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>.

 (1.) The prohibition of the fat seems to be confined to those beasts 
 which were used for sacrifice, the bullocks, sheep, and goats: but of 
 the roe-buck, the hart, and other clean beasts, they might eat the fat; 
 for those only of which offerings were brought are mentioned here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 This was to preserve in their minds a reverence for God's altar, on 
 which the fat of the inwards was burnt. The Jews say, "If a man eat so 
 much as an olive of forbidden fat--if he do it presumptuously, he is in 
 danger of being cut off by the hand of God--if ignorantly, he is to 
 bring a sin-offering, and so to pay dearly for his carelessness." To 
 eat of the flesh of that which died of itself, or was torn of beasts, 
 was unlawful; but to eat of the fat of such was doubly unlawful,

 (2.) The prohibition of blood is more general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>),

 because the fat was offered to God only by way of acknowledgment, but 
 the blood <I>made atonement for the soul,</I> and so typified Christ's 
 sacrifice much more than the burning of the fat did; to this therefore 
 a greater reverence must be paid, till these types had their 
 accomplishment in the offering up of the body of Christ once for all. 
 The Jews rightly expound this law as forbidding only the <I>blood of 
 the life,</I> as they express it, not that which we call the 
 <I>gravy,</I> for of that they supposed it was lawful to eat.</P>

 5. The priest's share of the peace-offerings is here prescribed. Out of 
 every beast that was offered for a peace-offering the priest that 
 offered it was to have to himself the breast and the right shoulder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:30-34"><I>v.</I> 30-34</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) That when the sacrifice was killed the offerer himself must, with 
 his own hands, present God's part of it, that he might signify thereby 
 his cheerfully giving it up to God, and his desire that it might be 
 accepted. He was with his own hands to <I>lift it up,</I> in token of 
 his regard to God as the God of heaven, and then to <I>wave it to and 
 fro,</I> in token of his regard to God as the Lord of the whole earth, 
 to whom thus, as far as he could reach, he offered it, showing his 
 readiness and wish to do him honour. Now that which was thus heaved and 
 waved was the fat, and the breast, and the right shoulder, it was all 
 offered to God; and then he ordered the fat to his altar, and the 
 breast and shoulder to his priest, both being his receivers. 

 (2.) That when the fat was burnt the priest took his part, on which he
 and his family were to feast, as well as the offerer and his family. In 
 holy joy and thanksgiving, it is good to have our ministers to go 
 before us, and to be our mouth to God. The melody is sweet when he that 
 sows and those that reap rejoice together. Some observe a significancy 
 in the parts assigned to the priests: the breast and the shoulder 
 intimate the affections and the actions, which must be devoted to the 
 honour of God by all his people and to the service also of the church 
 by all his priests. Christ, our great peace-offering, feasts all his 
 spiritual priests with the breast and shoulder, with the dearest love 
 and the sweetest and strongest supports; for his is the wisdom of God 
 and the power of God. When Saul was designed for a king Samuel ordered
 the shoulder of the peace-offering to be set before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:24">1 Sam. ix. 24</A>),

 which gave him a hint of something great and sacred intended for him.
 Jesus Christ is our great peace-offering; for he made himself a 
 sacrifice, not only to atone for sin, and so to save us from the curse, 
 but to purchase a blessing for us, and all good. By our joyfully 
 partaking of the benefits of redemption we <I>feast upon the 
 sacrifice,</I> to signify which the Lord's supper was instituted.</P>

 35 This <I>is the portion</I> of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
 anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made by
 fire, in the day <I>when</I> he presented them to minister unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the priest's office;
 36 Which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded to be given them of the children of
 Israel, in the day that he anointed them, <I>by</I> a statute for ever
 throughout their generations.
 37 This <I>is</I> the law of the burnt offering, of the meat
 offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering,
 and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
 offerings;
 38 Which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day
 that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the wilderness of Sinai.

 Here is the conclusion of these laws concerning the sacrifices, though 
 some of them are afterwards repeated and explained. The are to be 
 considered, 

 1. As a grant to the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 In the day they were ordained to that work and office this provision 
 was made for their comfortable maintenance. Note, God will take care 
 that those who are employed for him be well paid and well provided for. 
 Those that receive the anointing of the Spirit to minister unto the 
 Lord shall have their portion, and it shall be a worthy portion, out of 
 the offerings of the Lord; for God's work is its own wages, and there 
 is a present reward of obedience in obedience.

 2. As a statute for ever to the people, that they should bring these 
 offerings according to the rules prescribed, and cheerfully give the 
 priests their share out of them. God <I>commanded the children of 
 Israel to offer their oblations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Note, The solemn acts religious worship are commanded. They are not 
 things that we are left to our liberty in, and which we may do or not 
 do at our pleasure; but we are under indispensable obligations to 
 perform them in their season, and it is at our peril if we omit them. 
 The observance of the laws of Christ cannot be less necessary than the 
 observance of the laws of Moses was.</P>
