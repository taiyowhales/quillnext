 Aaron being now fully established in the priesthood abundantly to his 
 own satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of the people (which was the 
 good that God brought out of the evil opposition made to him), in this 
 chapter God gives him full instructions concerning his office or rather 
 repeats those which he had before given him. He tells him, 

 I. What must be his work and the care and charge committed to him, and
 what assistance he should have the Levites in that work,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>. 

 II. What should be his and the Levites' wages for this work.

 1. The perquisites or fees peculiar to the priests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:8-19">ver. 8-19</A>.

 2. The settled maintenance of the Levites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>.

 III. The portion which must be paid to the priests out of the Levites'
 maintenance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:25-32">ver.  25-32</A>.

 Thus every one knew what he had to do, and what he had to live
 upon.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
 father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
 sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
 iniquity of your priesthood.
 &nbsp; 2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
 father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee,
 and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee <I>shall
 minister</I> before the tabernacle of witness.
 &nbsp; 3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
 tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
 sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
 &nbsp; 4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of
 the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
 tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
 &nbsp; 5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
 of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
 among the children of Israel: to you <I>they are</I> given <I>as</I> a gift
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your
 priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the
 vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office <I>unto
 you</I> as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh
 shall be put to death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The coherence of this chapter with that foregoing is very 
 observable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people, in the close of that chapter, had complained of the 
 difficulty and peril that there were in drawing near to God, which put 
 them under some dreadful apprehensions that the tabernacle in the midst 
 of them, which they hoped would have been their joy and glory, would 
 rather be their terror and ruin. Now, in answer to this complaint, God 
 here gives them to understand by Aaron that the priests should come 
 near for them as their representatives; so that, though the people were 
 obliged to keep their distance, yet that should not at all redound to 
 their disgrace or prejudice, but their comfortable communion with God 
 should be kept up by the interposition of the priests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A great deal of honour God had now lately put upon Aaron; his rod 
 had budded and blossomed, when the rods of the rest of the princes 
 remained dry, and destitute both of fruit and ornament. Now lest Aaron 
 should be puffed up with the abundance of the favours that were done 
 him, and the miracles that were wrought for the support of him in his 
 high station, God comes to him to remind him of the burden that was 
 laid upon him, and the duty required from him as a priest. He would see 
 reason not to be proud of his preferment, but to receive the honours of 
 his office with reverence and holy trembling, when he considered how 
 great was the charge committed to him, and how hard it would be for him 
 to give a good account of it. <I>Be not high-minded, but fear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God tells him of the danger that attended his dignity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 (1.) That both the priests and Levites (<I>thou, and thy sons, and thy
 father's house</I>) should <I>bear the iniquity of the sanctuary;</I> 
 that is, if the sanctuary were profaned by the intrusion of strangers, 
 or persons in their uncleanness, the blame should lie upon the Levites 
 and priests, who ought to have kept them off. Though the sinner that 
 thrust in presumptuously should die in his iniquity, yet his blood 
 should be required at the hands of the watchmen. Or it may be taken 
 more generally: "If any of the duties or offices of the sanctuary be 
 neglected, if any service be not done in its season or not according to 
 the law, if any thing be lost or misplaced in the removal of the 
 sanctuary, you shall be accountable for it, and answer it at your 
 peril."

 (2.) That the priests should themselves <I>bear the iniquity of the
 priesthood;</I> that is, if they either neglected any part of their 
 work or permitted any other persons to invade their office, and take 
 their work out of their hands, they should bear the blame of it. Note, 
 The greater the trust is of work and power that is committed to us the 
 greater is our danger of contracting guilt, by falsifying and betraying 
 that trust. This is a good reason why we should neither be envious at 
 others' honours nor ambitious ourselves of high places, because great 
 dignity exposes us to great iniquity. Those that are entrusted with the 
 charge of the sanctuary will have a great deal to answer for.  Who 
 would covet the care of souls who considers the account that must be 
 given of that care?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells him of the duty that attended his dignity. 

 (1.) That he and his sons must <I>minister before the tabernacle of
 witness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 that is (as bishop Patrick explains it), <I>before the most holy 
 place,</I> in which the ark was, on the outside of the veil of that 
 tabernacle, but within the door of the tabernacle, of the congregation.  
 They were to attend the golden altar, the table, and candlestick, which 
 no Levite might approach to. <I>You shall serve,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Not, "You shall rule" (it was never intended that they should lord it 
 over God's heritage), but "You shall serve God and the congregation." 
 Note, The priesthood is a service. <I>If any desire the office of a 
 bishop he desires a good work.</I> Ministers must remember that they 
 are ministers, that is, servants, of whom it is required that they be 
 humble, diligent, and faithful.

 (2.) That the Levites must assist him and his sons, and minister to
 them in all the <I>service of the tabernacle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>),

 though they must by no means come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary, 
 nor at the altar meddle with the great services of burning the fat and 
 sprinkling the blood. Aaron's family was very small, and, as it 
 increased, the rest of the families of Israel would increase likewise, 
 so that the hands of the priests neither were now nor were likely to be 
 sufficient for all the service of the tabernacle; therefore (says God) 
 <I>the Levites shall be joined to thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 where there seems to be an allusion to the name of Levi, which 
 signifies <I>joined.</I> Many of the Levites had of late set themselves 
 against Aaron, but henceforward God promises that they should be 
 heartily joined to him in interest and affection, and should no more 
 contest with him. It was a good sign to Aaron that God owned him when 
 he inclined the hearts of those concerned to own him too. The Levites 
 are said to be given as a gift to the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, We are to value it as a great gift of the divine bounty to have 
 those joined to us that will be helpful and serviceable to us in the 
 service of God.

 (3.) That both priests and Levites must carefully watch against the
 profanation of sacred things. The Levites must <I>keep the charge of 
 the tabernacle,</I> that <I>no stranger</I> (that is, none who upon any 
 account was forbidden to come) might <I>come nigh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:4"><I>v.</I>  4</A>),

 and that upon pain of death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 And the priests must <I>keep the charge of the sanctuary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 must instruct the people, and admonish them concerning the due distance 
 they were to keep, and not suffer them to break the bounds set them, as 
 Korah's company had done, that there be <I>no wrath any more upon the 
 children of Israel.</I> Note, The preventing of sin is the preventing 
 of wrath; and the mischief sin has done should be a warning to us for 
 the future to watch against it both in ourselves and others.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
 the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of
 the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of
 the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
 &nbsp; 9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, <I>reserved</I> from
 the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of
 theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass
 offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, <I>shall be</I>
 most holy for thee and for thy sons.
 &nbsp; 10 In the most holy <I>place</I> shalt thou eat it; every male shall
 eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.
 &nbsp; 11 And this <I>is</I> thine; the heave offering of their gift, with
 all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
 them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee,
 by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall
 eat of it.
 &nbsp; 12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and
 of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, them have I given thee.
 &nbsp; 13 <I>And</I> whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
 bring unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, shall be thine; every one that is clean in
 thine house shall eat <I>of</I> it.
 &nbsp; 14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
 &nbsp; 15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
 bring unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>whether it be</I> of men or beasts, shall be
 thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
 redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
 &nbsp; 16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt
 thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
 shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which <I>is</I> twenty
 gerahs.
 &nbsp; 17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
 the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they <I>are</I> holy:
 thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
 their fat <I>for</I> an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
 as the right shoulder are thine.
 &nbsp; 19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the
 children of Israel offer unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, have I given thee, and
 thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it
 <I>is</I> a covenant of salt for ever before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto thee and to
 thy seed with thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The priest's service is called a <I>warfare;</I> and who goes a warfare 
 at his own charges? As they were well employed, so they were well 
 provided for, and well paid. None shall serve God for nought. All 
 believers are spiritual priests, and God has promised to take care of 
 them; they shall <I>dwell in the land,</I> and <I>verily they shall be 
 fed,</I> and shall not <I>want any good thing.</I> Godliness has the 
 <I>promise of the life that now is.</I> And from this plentiful 
 provision here made for the priests the apostle infers that it is the 
 duty of Christian churches to maintain their ministers; those that 
 <I>served at the altar lived upon the altar.</I> So those that preach 
 the gospel should <I>live upon the gospel,</I> and live comfortably, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13,14">1 Cor. ix. 13, 14</A>.

 Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. Now observe,

 1. That much of the provision that was made for them arose out of the
 sacrifices which they themselves were employed to offer. They had the 
 skins of almost all the sacrifices, which they might sell, and they had 
 a considerable share out of the meat-offerings, sin-offerings, &c. 
 Those that had the charge of the offerings had the benefit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Note, God's work is its own wages, and his service carries its 
 recompence along with it.  Even in keeping God's commandments there is 
 great reward. The present pleasures of religion are part of its pay. 

 2.  That they had not only a good table kept for them, but money
 likewise in their pockets for the redemption of the first-born, and 
 those firstlings of cattle which might not be offered in sacrifice. 
 Thus their maintenance was such as left them altogether <I>disentangled 
 from the affairs of this life;</I> they had no grounds to occupy, no 
 land to till, no vineyards to dress, no cattle to tend, no visible 
 estate to take care of, and yet had a more plentiful income than any 
 other families whatsoever. Thus God ordered it that they might be the 
 more entirely addicted to their ministry, and not diverted from it, nor 
 disturbed in it, by any worldly care or business (the ministry requires 
 a whole man); and that they might be examples of living by faith, not 
 only in God's providence, but in his ordinance. They lived from hand to 
 mouth, that they might learn to take no thought for the morrow; 
 sufficient for the day would be the provision thereof: and they had no 
 estates to leave their children, that they might by faith leave their 
 children, that they might by faith leave them to the care of that God 
 who had <I>fed them all their lives long.</I> 

 3. Of the provision that was made for their tables some is said to be
 <I>most holy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),

 which was to be eaten by the priests themselves, and in the court of 
 the tabernacle only; but other perquisites were less holy, of which 
 their families might eat, at their own houses, provided they were 
 clean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:10-12">Lev. xxi. 10</A>, &c.

 4. It is commanded that the <I>best of the oil,</I> and <I>the best of
 the wine and wheat,</I> should be offered for the <I>first-fruits unto 
 the Lord,</I> which the priest were to have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, We must always serve and honour God with the best we have, for he 
 is the best, and best deserves it; he is the first, and therefore must 
 have the first ripe. Those that think to save charges by putting God 
 off with the refuse do but deceive themselves, for <I>God is not 
 mocked.</I>

 5.  All this is given to the priests <I>by reason of the anointing,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>.

 It was not for the sake of their personal merits above other Israelites 
 that they had these tributes paid to them, be it known unto them; but 
 purely for the sake of the office to which they were anointed. Thus all 
 the comforts that are given to the Lord's people are given them by 
 reason of the anointing which they have received. It is said to be 
 given them <I>by an ordinance for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and it is a <I>covenant of salt for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 As long as the priesthood should continue this should continue to be 
 the maintenance of it, that this lamp might not go out for want of oil 
 to keep it burning. Thus provision is made that a gospel ministry 
 should continue till Christ comes, by an ordinance for ever. <I>Lo, I 
 am with you</I> (that is their maintenance and support) <I>always, even 
 to the end of the world.</I> Thanks be to the Redeemer, it is the word 
 which he has <I>commanded to a thousand generations.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no
 inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among
 them: I <I>am</I> thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
 in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve,
 <I>even</I> the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
 tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
 &nbsp; 23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of
 the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: <I>it shall
 be</I> a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among
 the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
 &nbsp; 24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer
 <I>as</I> an heave offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have given to the Levites
 to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children
 of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
 &nbsp; 25 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 26 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
 of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from
 them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave
 offering of it for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> a tenth <I>part</I> of the tithe.
 &nbsp; 27 And <I>this</I> your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you,
 as though <I>it were</I> the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
 fulness of the winepress.
 &nbsp; 28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and
 ye shall give thereof the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s heave offering to Aaron the
 priest.
 &nbsp; 29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, of all the best thereof, <I>even</I> the hallowed part
 thereof out of it.
 &nbsp; 30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
 best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites
 as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the
 winepress.
 &nbsp; 31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
 for it <I>is</I> your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have
 heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
 things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a further account of the provision that was made both for the 
 Levites and for the priests, out of the country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must have <I>no inheritance in the land;</I> only cities to 
 dwell in were afterwards allowed them, but no ground to occupy: <I>Thou 
 shalt not have any part among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It is repeated again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:23"><I>v.</I>  23</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 <I>Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance,</I> 
 either by purchase or descent. God would have them comfortably provided 
 for, but would not have their families over-rich, lest they should 
 think themselves above that work which their wages supposed and obliged 
 them constantly to attend upon. As Israel was a peculiar people, and 
 not to be numbered among the nations, so Levi was a peculiar tribe, and 
 not to be settled as the rest of the tribes, but in all respects 
 distinguished from them.  A good reason is given why they must have 
 <I>no inheritance in the land,</I> for, says God, <I>I am thy part, and 
 thy inheritance.</I> Note, Those that have God for their inheritance 
 and their portion for ever ought to look with a holy contempt and 
 indifference upon the inheritances of this world, and not covet their 
 portion in it. "<I>The Lord is my portion, therefore will I hope in 
 him,</I> and not depend upon any thing I have on this earth,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:24">Lam. iii. 24</A>.

 The Levites shall have no inheritance, and yet they shall live very
 comfortably and plentifully--to teach us that Providence has various 
 ways of supporting those that live in a dependence upon it; the fowls 
 reap not, and yet are fed, the lilies spin not, and yet are clothed, 
 the Levites have no inheritance in Israel, and yet live better than any 
 other tribe. The repetition of that caution, that <I>no Israelite 
 should approach the tabernacle,</I> comes in suitable, though somewhat 
 abruptly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It seems set in opposition to that order concerning the priests and 
 Levites that they should have <I>no inheritance in Israel,</I> to show 
 how God dispenses his favours variously. The Levites have the honour of 
 attending the tabernacle, which is denied the Israelites; but then the 
 Israelites have the honour of inheritances in Canaan, which is denied 
 the Levites; thus each is kept from either envying or despising the 
 other, and both have reason to rejoice in their lot. The Israelites 
 must not <I>come nigh the tabernacle,</I> but then the Levites must 
 have <I>no inheritance in the land;</I> if ministers expect that people 
 should keep in their sphere, and not intermeddle with sacred offices, 
 let them keep in theirs, and not entangle themselves in secular 
 affairs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But they must both have tithes of the land. Besides the 
 first-fruits which were appropriated to the priests, which, the Jews 
 say, were to be a fiftieth part, or at least a sixtieth, the tithe also 
 was appropriated. 

 1. The Levites had the tithes of the people's increase 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 
 <I>I have given</I> (whose the whole is) <I>all the tenths in 
 Israel,</I> of all the productions of the land, to <I>the children of 
 Levi,</I> to be divided among them in just proportions, <I>for their 
 service which they serve.</I> The Levites were the smallest tribe of 
 the twelve, and yet, besides all other advantages, they had a tenth 
 part of the yearly profits, without the trouble and expense of 
 ploughing and sowing; such care did God take of those that were devoted 
 to his service; not only that they might be well maintained, but that 
 they might be honoured with a national acknowledgment of the good 
 services they did to the public, and owned as God's agents and 
 receivers; for that which was a heave-offering, or an offering lifted 
 heavenward unto the Lord, was by him consigned to the Levites. 

 2. The priests had the tenths of the Levites' tithes settled upon them.
 The order for this Moses is directed to give to the Levites, whom God 
 would have to pay it with cheerfulness, rather than the priests to 
 demand it with authority: <I>Speak to the Levites</I> that it be 
 <I>offered by them,</I> rather than levied upon them. Now observe,

 (1.) The Levites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well
 as the Israelites out of their increase. They were God's tenants, and 
 rent was expected from them, nor were they exempted by their office. 
 Thus now, ministers must be charitable out of what they receive; and 
 the more freely they have received the more freely they must give, and 
 be examples of liberality. <I>You shall offer a heave-offering to the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Those that are employed to assist the devotions of others must be sure 
 to pay their own, as a heave-offering to the Lord.  Prayers and praises 
 lifted up to God, or rather the heart lifted up in them, are now our 
 heave-offerings. This (says God) shall be <I>reckoned to you as though 
 it were the corn of the threshing-floor;</I> that is, though it was not 
 the fruit of their ground, nor of their own labour, as the tithes of 
 other Israelites were, yet being of such as they had it should be 
 accepted, to the sanctifying of all the rest.

 (2.) This was to be given <I>to Aaron the priest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and to his successors the high priests, to be divided and disposed of 
 in such proportions as they should think fit among the inferior 
 priests.  Most of the profits of the priests' office, which were 
 appointed in the former part of the chapter, arising from the 
 sacrifices, those priests had the benefit of who constantly attended at 
 the altar; but, forasmuch as there were many priests employed in the 
 country to teach and rule, those tithes taken by the Levites, it is 
 probable, were directed by the high priest for their maintenance. It is 
 the probable conjecture of the learned bishop Patrick that the tenth of 
 this last tenth was reserved for the high priest himself, to support 
 his state and dignity; for otherwise we read not of any peculiar 
 provision made for him.

 (3.) When the Levites had thus paid the tenth of their income, as a
 heave-offering to the Lord, they had themselves the comfortable 
 enjoyment of the other nine parts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "When you have thus <I>heaved the best from it</I> (for still God's 
 part must be the best) then you shall <I>eat the rest,</I> not as a 
 holy thing, but with the same freedom that the other Israelites eat 
 their part with, <I>in every place, you and your households,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 See here what is the way to have the comfort of all our worldly 
 possessions so as to bear no sin by reason of them, as it follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 [1.] We must be sure that what we have be got honestly and in the
 service of God. It is <I>your reward for your service;</I> that meat is 
 the best eating that is first earned; but, if any <I>will not work, 
 neither shall he eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:10">2 Thess. iii. 10</A>.

 And that seems to be spoken of as having a particular comfort and
 satisfaction in it which is the reward of faithful service done in the 
 tabernacle of the congregation.

 [2.] We must be sure that God has his dues out of it. Then we have the
 comfort of our substance when we have honoured the Lord with it. The 
 <I>you shall bear no sin by reason of it,</I> when <I>you have heaved 
 the best from it.</I> This intimates that we must never feed ourselves 
 without fear, lest our table become a snare, and we bear sin by reason 
 of it; and that therefore we are concerned to <I>give alms of such 
 things as we have,</I> that all may be clean and comfortable to us.</P>
