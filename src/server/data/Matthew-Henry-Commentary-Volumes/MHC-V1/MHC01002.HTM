 This chapter is an appendix to the history of the creation, more 
 particularly explaining and enlarging upon that part of the history 
 which relates immediately to man, the favourite of this 
 lower world. We have in it,

 I. The institution and sanctification
 of the sabbath, which was made for man, to further his holiness
 and comfort
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>).

 II. A more particular account of man's 
 creation, as the centre and summary of the whole work
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>).

 III. A description of the garden of Eden, and the placing of man 
 in it under the obligations of a law and covenant
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>).

 IV. The creation of the woman, her marriage to the man, and 
 the institution of the ordinance of marriage
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:18-25">ver. 18</A>, &c.).</P>

 1 Thus the heavens and the earth 
 were finished, and all the host of 
 them.
 &nbsp; 2 And on the seventh day 
 God ended his work which he had 
 made; and he rested on the seventh 
 day from all his work which he had
 made.
 &nbsp; 3 And God blessed the 
 seventh day, and sanctified it: because
 that in it he had rested from all 
 his work which God created and made.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 
 
 I. The settlement of the 
 kingdom of nature, in God's resting from the 
 work of creation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 Here observe, 
 
 1. The creatures made both in heaven and 
 earth are the <I>hosts</I> or <I>armies</I> of them, which 
 denotes them to be numerous, but marshalled, 
 disciplined, and under command. 
 How great is the sum of them! And yet 
 every one knows and keeps his place. God 
 uses them as his hosts for the defence of his 
 people and the destruction of his enemies; 
 for he is the Lord of hosts, of all these hosts, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:35">Dan. iv. 35</A>.
 
 2. The heavens and the earth 
 are finished pieces, and so are all the creatures 
 in them. So perfect is God's work that
 
 <A NAME="Page13"> </A>

 nothing can be added to it nor taken from it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.
 God that began to build showed 
 himself well able to finish. 
 
 3. After the end 
 of the first six days God ceased from all 
 works of creation. He has so ended his work 
 as that though, in his providence, he worketh 
 hitherto 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17">John v. 17</A>),
 preserving and governing 
 all the creatures, and particularly forming 
 the spirit of man within him, yet he does not 
 make any new species of creatures. In miracles, 
 he has controlled and overruled nature, 
 but never changed its settled course, nor repealed 
 nor added to any of its establishments. 
 
 4. The eternal God, though infinitely happy 
 in the enjoyment of himself, yet took a satisfaction 
 in the work of his own hands. He 
 did not rest, as one weary, but as one well-pleased 
 with the instances of his own goodness 
 and the manifestations of his own glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The commencement of the kingdom of 
 grace, in the sanctification of the sabbath 
 day, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 He rested on that day, and took 
 a complacency in his creatures, and then 
 sanctified it, and appointed us, on that day, 
 to rest and take a complacency in the Creator; 
 and his rest is, in the fourth commandment, 
 made a reason for ours, after six days' labour. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. The solemn observance of one 
 day in seven, as a day of holy rest and holy 
 work, to God's honour, is the indispensable 
 duty of all those to whom God has revealed 
 his holy sabbaths. 
 
 2. The way of sabbath-sanctification 
 is the good old way, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.
 Sabbaths are as ancient as the world; and I 
 see no reason to doubt that the sabbath, 
 being now instituted in innocency, was religiously 
 observed by the people of God 
 throughout the patriarchal age. 
 
 3. The 
 sabbath of the Lord is truly honourable, and 
 we have reason to honour it--honour it for 
 the sake of its antiquity, its great Author, 
 the sanctification of the first sabbath by the 
 holy God himself, and by our first parents in 
 innocency, in obedience to him. 
 
 4. The 
 sabbath day is a blessed day, for God blessed 
 it, and that which he blesses is blessed 
 indeed. God has put an honour upon it, has 
 appointed us, on that day, to bless him, and 
 has promised, on that day, to meet us and 
 bless us. 
 
 5. The sabbath day is a holy day, 
 for God has sanctified it. He has separated 
 and distinguished it from the rest of the 
 days of the week, and he has consecrated it 
 and set it apart to himself and his own service 
 and honour. Though it is commonly 
 taken for granted that the Christian sabbath 
 we observe, reckoning from the creation, is 
 not the seventh but the first day of the week, 
 yet being a seventh day, and we in it, celebrating 
 the rest of God the Son, and the 
 finishing of the work of our redemption, we 
 may and ought to act faith upon this original 
 institution of the sabbath day, and to commemorate 
 the work of creation, to the honour 
 of the great Creator, who is therefore worthy 
 to receive, on that day, blessing, and honour, 
 and praise, from all religious assemblies.</P>

 4 These <I>are</I> the generations of the 
 heavens and of the earth when they 
 were created, in the day that the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God made the earth and the
 heavens,
 &nbsp; 5 And every plant of the 
 field before it was in the earth, and
 every herb of the field before it grew: 
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God had not caused it to
 rain upon the earth, and <I>there was</I> not 
 a man to till the ground.
 &nbsp; 6 But there 
 went up a mist from the earth, and watered 
 the whole face of the ground.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God formed man 
 <I>of</I> the dust of the ground, and breathed 
 into his nostrils the breath of life; 
 and man became a living soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, 
 
 I. Here is a name given 
 to the Creator which we have not yet met 
 with, and that is <I>Jehovah</I>--the LORD, in 
 capital letters, which are constantly used in 
 our English translation to intimate that in 
 the original it is <I>Jehovah.</I> All along, in the 
 first chapter, he was called <I>Elohim--a God 
 of power;</I> but now <I>Jehovah Elohim--a God 
 of power and perfection,</I> a finishing God. As 
 we find him known by his name Jehovah 
 when he appeared to perform what he had 
 promised 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>),
 so now we have him 
 known by that name, when he had perfected 
 what he had begun. <I>Jehovah</I> is that great 
 and incommunicable name of God which 
 denotes his having his being of himself, and 
 his giving being to all things; fitly therefore 
 is he called by that name now that heaven 
 and earth are finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Further notice taken of the production 
 of plants and herbs, because they were made 
 and appointed to be food for man, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 Here observe, 
 
 1. The earth did not bring 
 forth its fruits of itself, by any innate virtue 
 of its own but purely by the almighty power 
 of God, which formed every plant and every 
 herb before it grew in the earth. Thus 
 grace in the soul, that plant of renown, grows 
 not of itself in nature's soil, but is the work 
 of God's own hands. 
 
 2. Rain also is the 
 gift of God; it came not till <I>the Lord God 
 caused it to rain.</I> If rain be wanted, it is 
 God that withholds it; if rain come plentifully 
 in its season, it is God that sends it; if 
 it come in a distinguishing way, it is God 
 that <I>causeth it to rain upon one city and not 
 upon another,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:7">Amos iv. 7</A>.

 3. Though God, 
 ordinarily, works by means, yet he is not tied 
 to them, but when he pleases he can do his 
 own work without them. As the plants were 
 produced before the sun was made, so they 
 were before there was either rain to water
 the earth or man to till it. Therefore though 
 we must not tempt God in the neglect of 
 means, yet we must trust God in the want 
 of means. 
 
 4. Some way or other God will 
 take care to water the plants that are of his

 <A NAME="Page14"> </A>

 own planting. Though as yet there was no
 rain, God made a mist equivalent to a shower, 
 and with it <I>watered the whole face of the 
 ground.</I> Thus he chose to fulfil his purpose 
 by the weakest means, <I>that the excellency of the 
 power might be of God.</I> Divine grace descends 
 like a mist, or silent dew, and waters 
 the church without noise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2">Deut. xxxii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A more particular account of the 
 creation of man, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Man is a little world, 
 consisting of heaven and earth, soul and body. 
 Now here we have an account of the origin 
 of both and the putting of both together: 
 let us seriously consider it, and say, to our 
 Creator's praise, We are <I>fearfully and wonderfully 
 made,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:14">Ps. cxxxix. 14</A>.
 Elihu, in the 
 patriarchal age, refers to this history when 
 he says 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:6">Job xxxiii. 6</A>),
 <I>I also am formed out 
 of the clay,</I> and 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 <I>The breath of the Almighty 
 hath given me life,</I> and 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:8"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 8</A>),
 <I>There is a spirit in man.</I> Observe then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mean origin, and yet the curious 
 structure, of the body of man. 
 
 (1.) The matter 
 was despicable. He was made <I>of the dust of 
 the ground,</I> a very unlikely thing to make a 
 man of; but the same infinite power that 
 made the world of nothing made man, its 
 master-piece, of next to nothing. He was 
 made of the dust, the small dust, such as is 
 upon the surface of the earth. Probably, 
 not dry dust, but dust moistened with the 
 mist that went up, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 He was not made
 of gold-dust, powder of pearl, or diamond
 dust, but common dust, dust of the ground. 
 Hence he is said to be of the earth, <B><I>choikos</I></B>--<I>dusty,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:47">1 Cor. xv. 47</A>.
 And we also are of the 
 earth, for we are his offspring, and of the 
 same mould. So near an affinity is there 
 between the earth and our earthly parents 
 that our mother's womb, out of which we 
 were born, is called <I>the earth</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15">Ps. cxxxix. 15</A>),
 and the earth, in which we must be buried, 
 is called our <I>mother's womb,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:21">Job i. 21</A>.
 Our foundation is in the earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19">Job iv. 19</A>.
 Our fabric is earthly, and the fashioning of it like 
 that of an earthen vessel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:9">Job x. 9</A>.
 Our food 
 is out of the earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:5">Job xxviii. 5</A>.
 Our familiarity is with the earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:14">Job xvii. 14</A>.
 Our fathers are in the earth, and our own 
 final tendency is to it; and what have we 
 then to be proud of? 
 
 (2.) Yet the Maker 
 was great, and the make fine. The Lord 
 God, the great fountain of being and power, 
 formed man. Of the other creatures it is 
 said that they were <I>created</I> and <I>made;</I> but of 
 man that he was <I>formed,</I> which denotes a 
 gradual process in the work with great 
 accuracy and exactness. To express the
 creation of this new thing, he takes a new 
 word, a word (some think) borrowed from 
 the potter's forming his vessel upon the 
 wheel; for we are the clay, and God the 
 potter, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:8">Isa. lxiv. 8</A>.
 The body of man is 
 curiously wrought, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15,16">Ps. cxxxix. 15, 16</A>.
 <I>Materiam superabat opus--The workmanship exceeded 
 the materials.</I> Let us present our 
 bodies to God as living sacrifices 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>),
 as living temples 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19">1 Cor. vi. 19</A>),
 and then 
 these vile bodies shall shortly be new-formed 
 like Christ's glorious body, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21">Phil. iii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The high origin and the admirable serviceableness 
 of the soul of man. 
 
 (1.) It 
 takes its rise from the breath of heaven, and 
 is produced by it. It was not made of the 
 earth, as the body was; it is a pity then that 
 it should cleave to the earth, and mind earthly 
 things. It came immediately from God; he 
 gave it to be put into the body 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>),
 as afterwards he gave the tables of stone of 
 his own writing to be put into the ark, and 
 the <I>urim</I> of his own framing to be put into 
 the breast-plate. Hence God is not only the 
 former but the Father of spirits. Let the soul 
 which God has breathed into us breathe after 
 him; and let it be for him, since it is from 
 him. Into his hands let us commit our 
 spirits, for from his hands we had them. 
 
 (2.) It takes its lodging in a house of clay, and is 
 the life and support of it. It is by it that 
 man is a living soul, that is, a living man; 
 for the soul is the man. The body would 
 be a worthless, useless, loathsome carcase, 
 if the soul did not animate it. To God that 
 gave us these souls we must shortly give an
 account of them, how we have employed
 them, used them, proportioned them, and
 disposed of them; and if then it be found
 that we have lost them, though it were
 to gain the world, we shall be undone for
 ever. Since the extraction of the soul is so
 noble, and its nature and faculties are so
 excellent, let us not be of those fools that
 despise their own souls, by preferring their
 bodies before them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:32">Prov. xv. 32</A>.
 When our Lord Jesus anointed the blind man's 
 eyes with clay perhaps he intimated that it 
 was he who at first formed man out of the 
 clay; and when he <I>breathed on his disciples, 
 saying, Receive you the Holy Ghost,</I> he intimated 
 that it was he who at first breathed 
 into man's nostrils the breath of life. He 
 that made the soul is alone able to new-make 
 it.</P>

 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God planted a 
 garden eastward in Eden; and there
 he put the man whom he had formed.
 &nbsp; 9 And out of the ground made the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God to grow every tree
 that is pleasant to the sight, and good for 
 food; the tree of life also in the 
 midst of the garden, and the tree of 
 knowledge of good and evil.
 &nbsp; 10 And 
 a river went out of Eden to water the
 garden; and from thence it was 
 parted, and became into four heads.
 &nbsp; 11 The name of the first <I>is</I> Pison: 
 that <I>is</I> it which compasseth the whole

 Hiddekel: that <I>is</I> it which goeth toward 
 the east of Assyria. And the 
 fourth river <I>is</I> Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God took the man, and put 
 him into the garden of Eden to dress 
 it and to keep it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Man consisting of body and soul, a body 
 made out of the earth and a rational immortal 
 soul the breath of heaven, we have, in 
 these verses, the provision that was made 
 for the happiness of both; he that made him 
 took care to make him happy, if he could
 but have kept himself so and known when 
 he was well off. That part of man by which 
 he is allied to the world of sense was made 
 happy; for he was put in the paradise of 
 God: that part by which he is allied to the 
 world of spirits was well provided for; for
 he was taken into covenant with God. Lord, 
 what is man that he should be thus dignified--man 
 that is a worm! Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A description of the garden of 
 Eden, which was intended for the mansion and 
 demesne of this great lord, the palace of this 
 prince. The inspired penman, in this history, 
 writing for the Jews first, and calculating 
 his narratives for the infant state of 
 the church, describes things by their outward 
 sensible appearances, and leaves us, 
 by further discoveries of the divine light, to 
 be led into the understanding of the mysteries 
 couched under them. Spiritual things 
 were strong meat, which they could not yet 
 bear; but he writes to them as unto carnal, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:1">1 Cor. iii. 1</A>.
 Therefore he does not so much 
 insist upon the happiness of Adam's mind as 
 upon that of his outward state. The Mosaic 
 history, as well as the Mosaic law, has 
 rather the patterns of heavenly things than 
 the heavenly things themselves, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:23">Heb. ix. 23</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The place appointed for Adam's residence 
 was a garden; not an ivory house nor 
 a palace overlaid with gold, but a garden, 
 furnished and adorned by nature, not by art. 
 What little reason have men to be proud of 
 stately and magnificent buildings, when it 
 was the happiness of man in innocency that 
 he needed none! As clothes came in with 
 sin, so did houses. The heaven was the roof 
 of Adam's house, and never was any roof so 
 curiously ceiled and painted. The earth was 
 his floor, and never was any floor so richly 
 inlaid. The shadow of the trees was his 
 retirement; under them were his 
 dining-rooms, his lodging-rooms, and never were any 
 rooms so finely hung as these: Solomon's, 
 in all their glory, were not arrayed like them. 
 The better we can accommodate ourselves to 
 plain things, and the less we indulge ourselves 
 with those artificial delights which 
 have been invented to gratify men's pride and 
 luxury, the nearer we approach to a state of 
 innocency. Nature is content with a little 
 and that which is most natural, grace with 
 less, but lust with nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The contrivance and furniture of this 
 garden were the immediate work of God's 
 wisdom and power. The Lord God planted 
 this garden, that is, he <I>had</I> planted it--upon 
 the third day, when the fruits of the earth 
 were made. We may well suppose to have 
 been the most accomplished place for pleasure 
 and delight that ever the sun saw, when the 
 all-sufficient God himself designed it to be 
 the present happiness of his beloved creature, 
 man, in innocency, and a type and a figure 
 of the happiness of the chosen remnant in 
 glory. No delights can be agreeable nor satisfying 
 to a soul but those that God himself 
 has provided and appointed for it; no true 
 paradise, but of God's planting. The light 
 of our own fires, and the sparks of our own 
 kindling, will soon leave us in the dark, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>.
 The whole earth was now a paradise 
 compared with what it is since the fall and 
 since the flood; the finest gardens in the 
 world are a wilderness compared with what 
 the whole face of the ground was before it 
 was cursed for man's sake: yet that was not 
 enough; God planted a garden for Adam. 
 God's chosen ones shall have distinguishing 
 favours shown them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The situation of this garden was extremely 
 sweet. It was in <I>Eden,</I> which signifies 
 <I>delight</I> and <I>pleasure.</I> The place is here 
 particularly pointed out by such marks and 
 bounds as were sufficient, I suppose, when 
 Moses wrote, to specify the place to those 
 who knew that country; but now, it seems, 
 the curious cannot satisfy themselves concerning 
 it. Let it be our care to make sure 
 a place in the heavenly paradise, and then 
 we need not perplex ourselves with a search 
 after the place of the earthly paradise. It is 
 certain that, wherever it was, it had all desirable 
 conveniences, and (which never any 
 house nor garden on earth was) without any 
 inconvenience. Beautiful for situation, the 
 joy and the glory of the whole earth, was this 
 garden: doubtless it was earth in its highest 
 perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The trees with which this garden was 
 planted. 
 
 (1.) It had all the best and choicest 
 trees in common with the rest of the ground. 
 It was beautiful and adorned with every tree 
 that, for its height or breadth, its make or 
 colour, its leaf or flower, was pleasant to the 
 sight and charmed the eye; it was replenished 
 and enriched with every tree that yielded 
 fruit grateful to the taste and useful to the 
 body, and so good for food. God, as a tender 
 Father, consulted not only Adam's profit, 
 but his pleasure; for there is a pleasure 
 consistent with innocency, nay, there is a true 
 and transcendent pleasure in innocency. 
 God delights in the prosperity of his servants, 

 <A NAME="Page16"> </A>
 
 and would have them easy; it is owing to 
 themselves if they be uneasy. When Providence 
 puts us into an Eden of plenty and 
 pleasure, we ought to <I>serve him with joyfulness 
 and gladness of heart,</I> in the abundance 
 of the good things he gives us. But, 
 
 (2.) It 
 had two extraordinary trees peculiar to itself; 
 on earth there were not their like. 
 
 [1.] There was the <I>tree of life in the midst of the 
 garden,</I> which was not so much a memorandum 
 to him of the fountain and author of his 
 life, nor perhaps any natural means to preserve 
 or prolong life; but it was chiefly intended 
 to be a sign and seal to Adam, assuring 
 him of the continuance of life and 
 happiness, even to immortality and everlasting 
 bliss, through the grace and favour of 
 his Maker, upon condition of his perseverance 
 in this state of innocency and obedience. 
 Of this he might eat and live. Christ 
 is now to us the tree of life 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7,22:2">Rev. ii. 7; xxii. 2</A>),
 and the <I>bread of life,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:48,53">John vi. 48, 53</A>.
 
 [2.] There was <I>the tree of the knowledge of 
 good and evil,</I> so called, not because it had 
 any virtue in it to beget or increase useful 
 knowledge (surely then it would not have 
 been forbidden), but, <I>First,</I> Because there 
 was an express positive revelation of the 
 will of God concerning this tree, so that by 
 it he might know moral good and evil. What 
 is good? It is good not to eat of this tree.
 What is evil? It is evil to eat of this tree. 
 The distinction between all other moral good 
 and evil was written in the heart of man by 
 nature; but this, which resulted from a positive 
 law, was written upon this tree. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Because, in the event, it proved to 
 give Adam an experimental knowledge of 
 good by the loss of it and of evil by the 
 sense of it. As the covenant of grace has in 
 it, not only <I>Believe and be saved,</I> but also, 
 <I>Believe not and be damned</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>),
 so the covenant of innocency had in it, not only 
 "Do this and live," which was sealed and 
 confirmed by the tree of life, but, "Fail and 
 die," which Adam was assured of by this 
 other tree: "Touch it at your peril;" so that, 
 in these two trees, God set before him <I>good and 
 evil, the blessing and the curse,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:19">Deut. xxx. 19</A>.
 These two trees were as two sacraments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The rivers with which this garden was 
 watered, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:10-14"><I>v.</I> 10-14</A>.
 These four rivers (or 
 one river branched into four streams) contributed 
 much both to the pleasantness and 
 the fruitfulness of this garden. The land of 
 Sodom is said to be <I>well watered every where, 
 as the garden of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:10"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 10</A>.
 Observe, That which God plants he will take 
 care to keep watered. The trees of righteousness 
 are set by the rivers, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3">Ps. i. 3</A>.
 In the 
 heavenly paradise there is a river infinitely 
 surpassing these; for it is a river of the 
 water of life, not coming out of Eden, as this, 
 but proceeding out of the throne of God and 
 of the Lamb 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Rev+22:1">Rev. xxii. 1</A>),
 a river that <I>makes 
 glad the city of our God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>.
 Hiddekel and Euphrates are rivers of Babylon, which 
 we read of elsewhere. By these the captive 
 Jews sat down and <I>wept, when they remembered 
 Sion</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1">Ps. cxxxvii. 1</A>);
 but methinks 
 they had much more reason to weep (and so 
 have we) at the remembrance of Eden. 
 Adam's paradise was their prison; such 
 wretched work has sin made. Of the land 
 of Havilah it is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 <I>The gold of that 
 land is good,</I> and <I>there is bdellium and the 
 onyx-stone:</I> surely this is mentioned that the 
 wealth of which the land of Havilah boasted 
 might be as foil to that which was the glory 
 of the land of Eden. Havilah had gold, and 
 spices, and precious stones; but Eden had 
 that which was infinitely better, the tree of 
 life, and communion with God. So we may 
 say of the Africans and Indians: "They have 
 the gold, but we have the gospel. The gold 
 of their land is good, but the riches of ours 
 are infinitely better."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The placing of man in this paradise of 
 delight, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>, 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God put him in possession of it: 
 <I>The Lord God took the man, and put him into 
 the garden of Eden;</I> so 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:8,15"><I>v.</I> 8, 15</A>.
 Note here, 
 
 (1.) Man was made <I>out</I> of paradise; for, after 
 God had formed him, he put him into the 
 garden: he was made of common clay, not 
 of paradise-dust. He lived out of Eden before 
 he lived in it, that he might see that all 
 the comforts of his paradise-state were owing 
 to God's free grace. He could not plead a 
 tenant-right to the garden, for he was not 
 born upon the premises, nor had any thing 
 but what he received; all boasting was hereby 
 for ever excluded. 
 
 (2.) The same God that 
 was the author of his being was the author 
 of his bliss; the same hand that made him a 
 living soul planted the tree of life for him, 
 and settled him by it. He that made us is 
 alone able to make us happy; he that is the 
 former of our bodies and the Father of our 
 spirits, he, and none but he, can effectually 
 provide for the felicity of both. 
 
 (3.) It adds 
 much to the comfort of any condition if we 
 have plainly seen God going before us and 
 putting us into it. If we have not forced 
 providence, but followed it, and taken the 
 hints of direction it has given us, we may 
 hope to find a paradise where otherwise we 
 could not have expected it. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4">Ps. xlvii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How God appointed him business and 
 employment. He put him there, not like 
 Leviathan into the waters, to play therein, 
 but to dress the garden and to keep it. Paradise 
 itself was not a place of exemption 
 from work. Note, here, 
 
 (1.) We were none 
 of us sent into the world to be idle. He that 
 made us these souls and bodies has given us 
 something to work with; and he that gave us 
 this earth for our habitation has made us 
 something to work on. If a high extraction, 
 or a great estate, or a large dominion, or 
 perfect innocency, or a genius for pure contemplation, 
 or a small family, could have 
 given a man a writ of ease, Adam would not 
 have been set to work; but he that gave us 

 <A NAME="Page17"> </A>

 being has given us business, to serve him and 
 our generation, and to work out our salvation: 
 if we do not mind our business, we are 
 unworthy of our being and maintenance. 
 
 (2.) Secular employments will vary well consist 
 with a state of innocency and a life of 
 communion with God. The sons and heirs 
 of heaven, while they are here in this world, 
 have something to do about this earth, which 
 must have its share of their time and thoughts; 
 and, if they do it with an eye to God, they 
 are as truly serving him in it as when they 
 are upon their knees. 
 
 (3.) The husbandman's 
 calling is an ancient and honourable 
 calling; it was needful even in paradise. 
 The garden of Eden, though it needed not 
 to be weeded (for thorns and thistles were 
 not yet a nuisance), yet must be dressed and 
 kept. Nature, even in its primitive state, 
 left room for the improvements of art and 
 industry. It was a calling fit for a state of 
 innocency, making provision for life, not for 
 lust, and giving man an opportunity of admiring 
 the Creator and acknowledging his 
 providence: while his hands were about his 
 trees, his heart might be with his God. 
 
 (4.) There is a true pleasure in the business which 
 God calls us to, and employs us in. Adam's 
 work was so far from being an allay that it 
 was an addition to the pleasures of paradise; 
 he could not have been happy if he had 
 been idle: it is still a law, He that will not 
 work has no right to eat, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:10,Pr+27:23">2 Thess. iii. 10; Prov. xxvii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The command which God gave to 
 man in innocency, and the covenant he then 
 took him into. Hitherto we have seen God 
 as man's powerful Creator and his bountiful 
 Benefactor; now he appears as his Ruler and 
 Lawgiver. God put him into the garden of 
 Eden, not to live there as he might list, but 
 to be under government. As we are not 
 allowed to be idle in this world, and to do 
 nothing, so we are not allowed to be wilful, 
 and do what we please. When God had 
 given man a dominion over the creatures, he 
 would let him know that still he himself was 
 under the government of his Creator.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>
 16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God commanded 
 the man, saying, Of every tree of the 
 garden thou mayest freely eat:
 &nbsp; 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of 
 good and evil, thou shalt not eat of 
 it: for in the day that thou eatest 
 thereof thou shalt surely die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 I. God's authority over man, 
 as a creature that had reason and freedom of 
 will. The Lord God commanded the man, 
 who stood now as a public person, the father 
 and representative of all mankind, to receive 
 law, as he had lately received a nature, for 
 himself and all his. God commanded all the 
 creatures, according to their capacity; the 
 settled course of nature is a law, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:6,Ps+104:9">Ps. cxlviii. 6; civ. 9</A>.
 The brute-creatures have their 
 respective instincts; but man was made capable 
 of performing reasonable service, and 
 therefore received, not only the command of 
 a Creator, but the command of a Prince and 
 Master. Though Adam was a very great 
 man, a very good man, and a very happy 
 man, yet the Lord God commanded him; 
 and the command was no disparagement to 
 his greatness, no reproach to his goodness, 
 nor any diminution at all to his happiness. 
 Let us acknowledge God's right to rule us, 
 and our own obligations to be ruled by him; 
 and never allow any will of our own in contradiction 
 to, or competition with, the holy 
 will of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular act of this authority, in 
 prescribing to him what he should do, and 
 upon what terms he should stand with his 
 Creator. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A confirmation of his present happiness 
 to him, in that grant, <I>Of every tree in 
 the garden thou mayest freely eat.</I> This was 
 not only an allowance of liberty to him, in 
 taking the delicious fruits of paradise, as a 
 recompence for his care and pains in dressing 
 and keeping it 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7,10">1 Cor. ix. 7, 10</A>),
 but it 
 was, withal, an assurance of life to him, immortal 
 life, upon his obedience. For the 
 tree of life being put <I>in the midst of the garden</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 as the heart and soul of it, doubtless 
 God had an eye to that especially in this 
 grant; and therefore when, upon his revolt, 
 this grant is recalled, no notice is taken of 
 any tree of the garden as prohibited to him, 
 except the tree of life 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:22"><I>ch.</I> iii. 22</A>),
 of which it 
 is there said he might have eaten and <I>lived 
 for ever,</I> that is, never died, nor ever lost his 
 happiness. "Continue holy as thou art, in 
 conformity to thy Creator's will, and thou 
 shalt continue happy as thou art in the enjoyment 
 of thy Creator's favour, either in this 
 paradise or in a better." Thus, upon condition 
 of perfect personal and perpetual obedience, 
 Adam was sure of paradise to himself 
 and his heirs for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A trial of his obedience, upon pain of 
 the forfeiture of all his happiness: "<I>But of
 the</I> other tree which stood very near the tree 
 of life (for they are both said to be <I>in the 
 midst of the garden</I>), and which was called 
 the <I>tree of knowledge, in the day thou eatest 
 thereof, thou shalt surely die;</I>" as if he had 
 said, "Know, Adam, that thou art now 
 upon thy good behaviour, thou art put into 
 paradise upon trial; be observant, be obedient, 
 and thou art made for ever; otherwise 
 thou wilt be as miserable as now thou art 
 happy." Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Adam is threatened with death in case 
 of disobedience: <I>Dying thou shalt die,</I> denoting 
 a sure and dreadful sentence, as, in 
 the former part of this covenant, <I>eating thou 
 shalt eat,</I> denotes a free and full grant. Observe 
 
 [1.] Even Adam, in innocency, was 
 awed with a threatening; fear is one of the 
 handles of the soul, by which it is taken hold 
 of and held. If he then needed this hedge, 
 
 <A NAME="Page18"> </A>

 much more do we now. 
 
 [2.] The penalty 
 threatened is death: <I>Thou shalt die,</I> that is, 
 "Thou shalt be debarred from the tree of 
 life, and all the good that is signified by it, 
 all the happiness thou hast, either in possession 
 or prospect; and thou shalt become 
 liable to death, and all the miseries that preface 
 it and attend it." 
 
 [3.] This was 
 threatened as the immediate consequence of 
 sin: <I>In the day thou eatest, thou shalt die,</I> 
 that is, "Thou shalt become mortal and 
 capable of dying; the grant of immortality 
 shall be recalled, and that defence shall depart 
 from thee. Thou shalt become obnoxious 
 to death, like a condemned malefactor 
 that is dead in the law" (only, because Adam 
 was to be the root of mankind, he was reprieved); 
 "nay, the harbingers and forerunners 
 of death shall immediately seize thee, 
 and thy life, thenceforward, shall be a dying 
 life: and this, <I>surely;</I> it is a settled rule, <I>the 
 soul that sinneth, it shall die.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Adam is tried with a positive law, not 
 to eat of the fruit <I>of the tree of knowledge.</I> 
 Now it was very proper to make trial of his 
 obedience by such a command as this, 
 
 [1.] Because the reason of it is fetched purely 
 from the will of the Law-maker. Adam had 
 in his nature an aversion to that which was 
 evil in itself, and therefore he is tried in a 
 thing which was evil only because it was 
 forbidden; and, being in a small thing, it 
 was the more fit to prove his obedience by. 
 
 [2.] Because the restraint of it is laid upon 
 the desires of the flesh and of the mind, 
 which, in the corrupt nature of man, are the 
 two great fountains of sin. This prohibition 
 checked both his appetite towards sensitive 
 delights and his ambitions of curious knowledge, 
 that his body might be ruled by his 
 soul and his soul by his God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus easy, thus happy, was man in a state 
 of innocency, having all that heart could 
 wish to make him so. How good was God 
 to him! How many favours did he load 
 him with! How easy were the laws he gave 
 him! How kind the covenant he made with 
 him! Yet man, being in honour, understood 
 not his own interest, but soon <I>became 
 as the beasts that perish.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 
 
 I. An instance of the 
 Creator's care of man and his fatherly concern 
 for his comfort, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 Though God 
 had let him know that he was a subject, by 
 giving him a command, 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),
 yet here 
 he lets him know also, for his encouragement 
 in his obedience, that he was a friend, 
 and a favourite, and one whose satisfaction 
 he was tender of. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God graciously pitied his solitude: 
 <I>It is not good that man, this man, 
 should be alone.</I> Though there was an upper 
 world of angels and a lower world of brutes, 
 and he between them, yet there being none 
 of the same nature and rank of beings with 
 himself, none that he could converse familiarly 
 with, he might be truly said to be 
 <I>alone.</I> Now he that made him knew both 
 him and what was good for him, better than 
 he did himself, and he said, "It is not good 
 that he should continue thus alone." 
 
 (1.) It 
 is not for his comfort; for man is a sociable 
 creature. It is a pleasure to him to exchange 
 knowledge and affection with those of his 
 own kind, to inform and to be informed, to 
 love and to be beloved. What God here 
 says of the first man Solomon says of all 
 men 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:9,10">Eccl. iv. 9</A>,
 &c.), that <I>two are better than
 one,</I> and <I>woe to him that is alone.</I> If there 
 were but one man in the world, what a melancholy 
 man must he needs be! Perfect 
 solitude would turn a paradise into a desert, 
 and a palace into a dungeon. Those therefore 
 are foolish who are selfish and would be 
 placeed alone in the earth.
 
 (2.) It is not for 
 the increase and continuance of his kind. 
 God could have made a world of men at first, 
 to replenish the earth, as he replenished 
 heaven with a world of angels: but the place 
 would have been too strait for the designed 
 number of men to live together at once; 
 therefore God saw fit to make up that number 
 by a succession of generations, which, as 
 God had formed man, must be from two, 
 and those male and female; one will be 
 ever one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How God graciously resolved to provide 
 society for him. The result of this reasoning 
 concerning him was this kind resolution, 
 <I>I will make a help-meet for him;</I> a help <I>like</I> 
 him (so some read it), one of the same nature 
 and the same rank of beings; a help <I>near</I> him 
 (so others), one to cohabit with him, and to 
 be always at hand; a help <I>before</I> him (so 
 others), one that he should look upon with 
 pleasure and delight. Note hence, 
 
 (1.) In 
 our best state in this world we have need of 
 one another's help; for we are members one 
 of another, and <I>the eye cannot say to the hand, 
 I have no need of thee,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.
 We must therefore be glad to receive help from 
 others, and give help to others, as there is 
 occasion. 
 
 (2.) It is God only who perfectly 
 knows our wants, and is perfectly able to 

 <A NAME="Page19"> </A>

 supply them all, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:19">Phil. iv. 19</A>.
 In him alone 
 our help is, and from him are all our helpers. 
 
 (3.) A suitable wife is a help-meet, and is 
 from the Lord. The relation is then likely 
 to be comfortable when meetness directs and 
 determines the choice, and mutual helpfulness 
 is the constant care and endeavour, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:33,34">1 Cor. vii. 33, 34</A>.

 (4.) Family-society, if it is agreeable, 
 is a redress sufficient for the grievance 
 of solitude. He that has a good God, a good 
 heart, and a good wife, to converse with, and 
 yet complains he wants conversation, would 
 not have been easy and content in paradise; 
 for Adam himself had no more: yet, even 
 before Eve was created, we do not find that 
 he complained of being alone, knowing that
 he <I>was not alone, for the Father was with him.</I> 
 Those that are most satisfied in God and his 
 favour are in the best way, and in the best 
 frame, to receive the good things of this life, 
 and shall be sure of them, as far as Infinite 
 Wisdom sees good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An instance of the creatures' subjection 
 to man, and his dominion over them 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):
 <I>Every beast of the field and every fowl of the 
 air God brought to Adam,</I> either by the ministry 
 of angels, or by a special instinct, 
 directing them to come to man as their master, 
 teaching the ox betimes to know his 
 owner. Thus God gave man livery and seisin 
 of the fair estate he had granted him, and 
 put him in possession of his dominion over 
 the creatures. God brought them to him, 
 that he might name them, and so might give, 
 
 1. A proof of his knowledge, as a creature 
 endued with the faculties both of reason and 
 speech, and so <I>taught more than the beasts of 
 the earth and made wiser than the fowls of 
 heaven,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>.
 And, 
 
 2. A proof of 
 his power. It is an act of authority to impose 
 names 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:7">Dan. i. 7</A>),
 and of subjection to 
 receive them. The inferior creatures did now, 
 as it were, do homage to their prince at his 
 inauguration, and swear fealty and allegiance 
 to him. If Adam had continued faithful to 
 his God, we may suppose the creatures themselves 
 would so well have known and remembered 
 the names Adam now gave them 
 as to have come at his call, at any time, and 
 answered to their names. God gave names 
 to the day and night, to the firmament, to 
 the earth, and to the sea; and he <I>calleth the 
 stars by their names,</I> to show that he is the 
 supreme Lord of these. But he gave Adam 
 leave to name the beasts and fowls, as their 
 subordinate lord; for, having made him in 
 his own image, he thus put some of his honour 
 upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An instance of the creatures' insufficiency 
 to be a happiness for man: <I>But</I> (among 
 them all) <I>for Adam there was not found a help 
 meet for him.</I> Some make these to be the 
 words of Adam himself; observing all the 
 creatures come to him by couples to be named, 
 he thus intimates his desire to his Maker:--"Lord, 
 these have all helps meet for them; 
 but what shall I do? Here is never a one 
 for me." It is rather God's judgment upon 
 the review. He brought them all together, 
 to see if there were ever a suitable match for 
 Adam in any of the numerous families of the 
 inferior creatures; but there was none. Observe 
 here, 
 
 1. The dignity and excellency of 
 the human nature. On earth there was not 
 its like, nor its peer to be found among all 
 visible creatures; they were all looked over, 
 but it could not be matched among them all. 
 
 2. The vanity of this world and the things of 
 it; put them all together, and they will not 
 make a help-meet for man. They will not 
 suit the nature of his soul, nor supply its 
 needs, nor satisfy its just desires, nor run 
 parallel with its never-failing duration. God 
 creates a new thing to be a help-meet for 
 man--not so much the woman as the seed 
 of the woman.</P>

 Here we have, 
 
 I. The making of the woman, 
 to be a help-meet for Adam. This was 
 done upon the sixth day, as was also the 
 placing of Adam in paradise, though it is 
 here mentioned after an account of the seventh 
 day's rest; but what was said in general 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:27"><I>ch.</I> i. 27</A>),

 that God made man male and female,
 is more distinctly related here. Observe, 
 
 1. That Adam was first formed, then 
 Eve 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:13">1 Tim. ii. 13</A>),
 and she was made of the 
 man, and for the man 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:8,9">1 Cor. xi. 8, 9</A>),
 all which are urged there as reasons for the humility, 
 modesty, silence, and submissiveness, 
 of that sex in general, and particularly the 
 subjection and reverence which wives owe to 
 their own husbands. Yet man being made 
 last of the creatures, as the best and most 
 excellent of all, Eve's being made after Adam, 
 and out of him, puts an honour upon that 
 sex, as the glory of the man, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:7">1 Cor. xi. 7</A>.
 If man is the head, she is the crown, a crown to 
 her husband, the crown of the visible creation. 
 The man was dust refined, but the woman 
 was dust double-refined, one remove further 
 from the earth. 
 
 2. That Adam slept while 
 his wife was in making, that no room might 
 be left to imagine that he had herein <I>directed 

 <A NAME="Page20"> </A>

 the Spirit of the Lord, or been his counsellor,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:13">Isa. xl. 13</A>.
 He had been made sensible of 
 his want of a meet help; but, God having 
 undertaken to provide him one, he does not 
 afflict himself with any care about it, but lies 
 down and sleeps sweetly, as one that had cast 
 all his care on God, with a cheerful resignation 
 of himself and all his affairs to his 
 Maker's will and wisdom. Jehovah-jireh, 
 let the Lord provide when and whom he 
 pleases. If we graciously rest in God, God 
 will graciously work for us and work all for 
 good. 
 
 3. That <I>God caused a sleep to fall on 
 Adam,</I> and made it a deep sleep, that so the 
 opening of his side might be no grievance to 
 him; while he knows no sin, God will take 
 care he shall feel no pain. When God, by 
 his providence, does that to his people which 
 is grievous to flesh and blood, he not only 
 consults their happiness in the issue, but by 
 his grace he can so quiet and compose their 
 spirits as to make them easy under the 
 sharpest operations. 
 
 4. That the woman 
 was <I>made of a rib out of the side of Adam;</I> 
 not made out of his head to rule over him, 
 nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by 
 him, but out of his side to be equal with him, 
 under his arm to be protected, and near his 
 heart to be beloved. Adam lost a rib, and 
 without any diminution to his strength or 
 comeliness (for, doubtless, the flesh was closed 
 without a scar); but in lieu thereof he had a 
 help meet for him, which abundantly made 
 up his loss: what God takes away from his 
 people he will, one way or other, restore with 
 advantage. In this (as in many other things) 
 Adam was a figure of him that was to come; 
 for out of the side of Christ, the second 
 Adam, his spouse the church was formed, 
 when he slept the sleep, the deep sleep, of 
 death upon the cross, in order to which his 
 side was opened, and there came out blood 
 and water, blood to purchase his church and
 water to purify it to himself. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25,26">Eph. v. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The marriage of the woman to Adam. 
 Marriage is honourable, but this surely was 
 the most honourable marriage that ever was, 
 in which God himself had all along an immediate 
 hand. Marriages (they say) are 
 made in heaven: we are sure this was, for 
 the man, the woman, the match, were all 
 God's own work; he, by his power, made 
 them <I>both,</I> and now, by his ordinance, made 
 them <I>one.</I> This was a marriage made in 
 perfect innocency, and so was never any 
 marriage since, 
 
 1. God, as <I>her</I> Father,
 brought the woman to the man, as his 
 second self, and a help-meet for him. When 
 he had made her, he did not leave her to 
 her own disposal; no, she was his child, and 
 she must not marry without his consent. 
 Those are likely to settle to their comfort 
 who by faith and prayer, and a humble dependence 
 upon providence, put themselves 
 under a divine conduct. That wife that is 
 of God's making by special grace, and of 
 God's bringing by special providence, is 
 likely to prove a help-meet for a man. 
 
 2. From God, as <I>his</I> Father, Adam received her 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 "<I>This is now bone of my bone.</I> Now 
 I have what I wanted, and which all the 
 creatures could not furnish me with, a help 
 meet for me." God's gifts to us are to be 
 received with a humble thankful acknowledgment 
 of his wisdom in suiting them to 
 us, and his favour in bestowing them on us. 
 Probably it was revealed to Adam in a vision, 
 when he was asleep, that this lovely creature, 
 now presented to him, was a piece of himself, 
 and was to be his companion and the 
 wife of his covenant. Hence some have 
 fetched an argument to prove that glorified 
 saints in the heavenly paradise shall know 
 one another. Further, in token of his acceptance 
 of her, he gave her a name, not 
 peculiar to her, but common to her sex: 
 <I>She shall be called woman, Isha,</I> a <I>she-man,</I> 
 differing from man in sex only, not in nature--made 
 of man, and joined to man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The institution of the ordinance of 
 marriage, and the settling of the law of it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 The sabbath and marriage were two 
 ordinances instituted in innocency, the 
 former for the preservation of the church, 
 the latter for the preservation of the world of 
 mankind. It appears (by 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:4,5">Matt. xix. 4, 5</A>)
 that it was God himself who said here, "A 
 man must leave all his relations, to cleave 
 to his wife;" but whether he spoke it by 
 Moses, the penman, or by Adam (who spoke, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 is uncertain. It should seem, they
 are the words of Adam, in God's name, 
 laying down this law to all his posterity. 
 
 1. See here how great the virtue of a divine ordinance 
 is; the bonds of it are stronger even 
 than those of nature. To whom can we be 
 more firmly bound than the fathers that
 begat us and the mothers that bore us? Yet 
 the son must quit them, to be joined to his 
 wife, and the daughter forget them, to cleave 
 to her husband, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:10,11">Ps. xlv. 10, 11</A>.
 
 2. See how 
 necessary it is that children should take their 
 parents' consent along with them in their 
 marriage, and how unjust those are to their 
 parents, as well as undutiful, who marry 
 without it; for they rob them of their right 
 to them, and interest in them, and alienate 
 it to another, fraudulently and unnaturally. 
 
 3. See what need there is both of prudence 
 and prayer in the choice of this relation, 
 which is so near and so lasting. That had 
 need be well done which is to be done for 
 life. 
 
 4. See how firm the bond of marriage 
 is, not to be divided and weakened by 
 having many wives 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>)
 nor to be 
 broken or cut off by divorce, for any cause 
 but fornication, or voluntary desertion. 
 
 5. See how dear the affection ought to be between 
 husband and wife, such as there is to 
 our own bodies, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:28">Eph. v. 28</A>.
 These two are 
 one flesh; let them then be one soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. An evidence of the purity and innocency 
 of that state wherein our first parents 

 <A NAME="Page21"> </A>

 were created, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 They were both naked. 
 They needed no clothes for defense against 
 cold nor heat, for neither could be injurious 
 to them. They needed none for ornament. 
 Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like 
 one of these. Nay, they needed none for 
 decency; they were naked, and had no 
 reason to be ashamed. <I>They knew not what 
 shame was,</I> so the Chaldee reads it. Blushing 
 is now the colour of virtue, but it was not 
 then the colour of innocency. Those that 
 had no sin in their conscience might well 
 have no shame in their faces, though they 
 had no clothes to their backs.</P>
