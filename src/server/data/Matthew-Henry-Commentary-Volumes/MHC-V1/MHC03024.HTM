 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee
 pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
 continually.
 &nbsp; 3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
 morning before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> continually: <I>it shall be</I> a statute for
 ever in your generations.
 &nbsp; 4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> continually.
 &nbsp; 5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes
 thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
 &nbsp; 6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
 pure table before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon <I>each</I> row, that it
 may be on the bread for a memorial, <I>even</I> an offering made by
 fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 continually, <I>being taken</I> from the children of Israel by an
 everlasting covenant.
 &nbsp; 9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
 in the holy place: for it <I>is</I> most holy unto him of the
 offerings of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made by fire by a perpetual statute.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Care is here taken, and orders are given, for the decent furnishing of
 the candlestick and table in God's house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The lamps must always be kept burning. The law for this we had
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:20,21">Exod. xxvii. 20, 21</A>.

 It is here repeated, probably because it now began to be put in
 execution, when other things were settled.

 1. The people were to provide oil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and this, as every thing else that was to be used in God's service,
 must be of the best, <I>pure olive-oil, beaten,</I> probably it was 
 double-strained. This was to <I>cause the lamps to burn;</I> all our 
 English copies read it <I>lamps,</I> but in the original it is singular 
 in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>--to

 <I>cause the lamp to burn;</I> but plural in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>--<I>he

 shall order the lamps.</I> The seven lamps made all one lamp, in 
 allusion to which the blessed Spirit of grace is represented by 
 <I>seven lamps of fire before the throne</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Rev. iv. 5</A>),

 for there are <I>diversities of gifts, but one Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4">1 Cor. xii. 4</A>.

 Ministers are as burning and shining lights in Christ's church, but it 
 is the duty of people to provide comfortably for them, as Israel for 
 the lamps. Scandalous maintenance makes a scandalous ministry.

 2. The priests were to tend the lamps; they must snuff them, clean the
 candlestick, and supply them with oil, morning and evening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Thus it is the work of the ministers of the gospel to <I>hold forth 
 that word of life,</I> not to set up new lights, but, by expounding and 
 preaching the word, to make the light of it more clear and extensive.
 This was the ordinary way of keeping the lamps burning; but, when the 
 church was poor and in distress, we find its lamps fed constantly with 
 <I>oil from the good olives</I> immediately, without the ministry of 
 priest or people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2,3">Zech. iv. 2, 3</A>);

 for, though God has tied us to means, he has not tied himself to them,
 but will take effectual care that his lamp never go out in the world 
 for want of oil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The table must always be kept spread. This was appointed before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:30">Exod. xxv. 30</A>.

 And here also,

 1. The table was furnished with bread; not dainties nor varieties to
 gratify a luxurious palate, but twelve loaves or cakes of bread, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Where there is plenty of bread there is no famine; and where bread is 
 not there is no feast. There was a loaf for every tribe, for <I>in our 
 Father's house there is bread enough.</I> They were all provided for by 
 the divine bounty, and were all welcome to the divine grace. Even
 after the revolt of the ten tribes this number of loaves was continued 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:11">2 Chron. xiii. 11</A>),

 for the sake of those few of each tribe that retained their affection
 to the temple and continued their attendance on it.

 2. A handful of frankincense was put in a golden saucer, upon or by
 each row, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When the bread was removed, and given to the priests, this frankincense 
 was burnt upon the golden altar (I suppose) over and above the daily 
 incense: and this was for a memorial instead of the bread, an offering 
 made by fire, as the handful of the meat-offering which was burnt upon 
 the altar is called the <I>memorial thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:2"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2</A>.

 Thus a little was accepted as a humble acknowledgment, and all the
 loaves were consigned to the priests. All God's spiritual Israel, 
 typified by the twelve loaves, are made through Christ a sweet savour 
 to him, and their prayers are said to come up before God <I>for a 
 memorial,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4">Acts x. 4</A>.

 The word is borrowed from the ceremonial law.

 3. Every sabbath it was renewed. When the loaves had stood there a
 week, the priests had them to eat with other holy things that were to 
 be eaten in the holy place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 and new ones were provided at the public charge, and put in the room of 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The Jews say, "The hands of those priests that put on were mixed with 
 theirs that took off, that the table might be never empty, but the 
 bread might be <I>before the Lord continually.</I>" God is never 
 unprovided for the entertainment of those that visit him, as men often 
 are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:5">Luke xi. 5</A>.

 Every one of those cakes contained two tenth-deals, that is, two omers
 of fine flour; just so much manna every Israelite gathered on the sixth 
 day for the sabbath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:22">Exod. xvi. 22</A>.

 Hence some infer that this show-bread, which was set on the table on
 the sabbath, was intended as a memorial of the manna wherewith they 
 were fed in the wilderness.  Christ's ministers should provide new 
 bread for his house every sabbath day, the production of their fresh 
 studies in the scripture, that <I>their proficiency may appear to 
 all,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father <I>was</I> an
 Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of
 the Israelitish <I>woman</I> and a man of Israel strove together in
 the camp;
 &nbsp; 11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name <I>of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,</I> and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
 mother's name <I>was</I> Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
 tribe of Dan:)
 &nbsp; 12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> might be
 showed them.
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let
 all that heard <I>him</I> lay their hands upon his head, and let all
 the congregation stone him.
 &nbsp; 15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
 Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
 &nbsp; 16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he shall
 surely be put to death, <I>and</I> all the congregation shall
 certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in
 the land, when he blasphemeth the name <I>of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,</I> shall be
 put to death.
 &nbsp; 17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
 &nbsp; 18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
 beast.
 &nbsp; 19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
 done, so shall it be done to him;
 &nbsp; 20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
 caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him <I>again.</I>
 &nbsp; 21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he
 that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
 &nbsp; 22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger,
 as for one of your own country: for I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
 bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
 with stones. And the children of Israel did as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Evil manners, we say, beget good laws. We have here an account of the 
 evil manners of a certain nameless mongrel Israelite, and the good laws 
 occasioned thereby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The offender was the son of an Egyptian father and an Israelitish 
 mother 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 his mother was of the tribe of Dan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Neither he nor his father is named, but his mother only, who was an 
 Israelite. This notice is taken of his parentage either,

 1. To intimate what occasioned the quarrel he was engaged in. The Jews
 say, "He offered to set up his tent among the Danites in the right of 
 his mother, but was justly opposed by some or other of that tribe, and 
 informed that his father being an Egyptian he had no part nor lot in 
 the matter, but must look upon himself as a stranger." Or, 

 2. To show the common ill effect of such mixed marriages. When a
 daughter of Israel would marry an idolatrous malignant Egyptian, what 
 could be the fruit of such a marriage but a blasphemer? For the 
 children will be apt to take after the worse side, whichsoever it is, 
 and will sooner learn of an Egyptian father to blaspheme than of an 
 Israelitish mother to pray and praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The occasion of the offence was contention: He <I>strove with a man 
 of Israel.</I> The mixed multitude of Egyptians that came up with 
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:38">Exod. xii. 38</A>)

 were in many ways hurtful to them, and this was one, they were often
 the authors of strife. The way to preserve the peace of the church is 
 to preserve the purity of it. In this strife he broke out into ill 
 language. Note, When quarrels begin we know not what mischief they will 
 make before they end, nor how treat a matter a little fire may kindle. 
 When men's passion is up they are apt to forget both their reason and 
 their religion, which is a good reason why we should not be apt either 
 to give or to resent provocation, but leave off strife before it be 
 meddled with, because the beginning of it is <I>as the letting forth of 
 water.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The offence itself was blasphemy and cursing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is supposed that his cause came to be heard before the judges, who 
 determined that he had no right to the privileges of an Israelite, his 
 father being an Egyptian, and that, being enraged at the sentence,

 1. He <I>blasphemed the name of the Lord.</I> He blasphemed <I>the
 name,</I> that is, he blasphemed God, who is known by his name only, 
 not by his nature, or any similitude. Not as if God were a mere name, 
 but his is a name above every name. The translators add <I>of the
 Lord,</I> which is implied, but not expressed, in the original, for the 
 greater reverence of the divine Majesty: it is a shame that it should 
 be found on record that the very name of Jehovah should be blasphemed; 
 <I>tell it not in Gath.</I> It is a fond conceit of the superstitious 
 Jews that his blasphemy was in pronouncing the name of <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 which they call ineffable: he that made himself known by that name 
 never forbade the calling of him by that name. It is probable that 
 finding himself aggrieved by the divine appointment, which separated 
 between the Israelites and strangers, he impudently reproached both the 
 law and the Law-maker, and set him at defiance. 

 2. He cursed either God himself (and then his cursing was the same with
 blaspheming) or the person with whom he strove. Imprecations of 
 mischief are the hellish language of hasty passion, as well as of 
 rooted malice. Or perhaps he cursed the judges that gave sentence 
 against him; he flew in the face of the court, and ridiculed the 
 processes of it; thus he added sin to sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The caution with which he was proceeded against for this sin. The 
 witnesses or inferior judges brought him and his case (which was 
 somewhat extraordinary) unto Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 according to the order settled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:22">Exod. xviii. 22</A>), 

 and Moses himself would not give judgment hastily, but committed the
 offender into custody, till he had consulted the oracle in this case. 
 Note, Judges must deliberate; both those that give the verdict and 
 those that give the sentence must consider diligently what they do, and 
 do nothing rashly, for <I>the judgment is God's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:17">Deut. i. 17</A>),

 and before him there will be a rehearing of the cause. They waited to
 know what was <I>the mind of the Lord,</I> whether he was to be put to 
 death by the hand of the magistrate or to be left to the judgment of 
 God: or, rather, they wanted to know whether he should be stoned, as 
 those were to be that only cursed their <I>parents</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:9"><I>ch.</I> xx. 9</A>),

 or whether, the crime being so much greater, some sorer punishment
 should be inflicted on him. Note, Those that sit in judgment should 
 sincerely desire, and by prayer and the use of all good means should 
 endeavour to <I>know the mind of the Lord,</I> because they <I>judge 
 for him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6">2 Chron. xix. 6</A>)

 and to him they are accountable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Sentence passed upon this offender by the righteous Judge of heaven
 and earth himself: <I>Let all the congregation stone him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 God could have cut him off by an immediate stroke from heaven, but he 
 would put this honour upon the institution of magistracy to make use of 
 it for the supporting and vindicating of his own glory in the world. 
 Observe, 

 1. The place of execution appointed: <I>Bring him forth without the
 camp.</I> To signify their detestation of the crime, they must thus 
 cast out the criminal as an abominable branch, and separate him from 
 them as an unclean thing and unworthy a place in the camp of Israel. 

 2. The executioners: <I>Let all the congregation</I> do it, to show
 their zeal for the honour of God's name. Every man should have a stone 
 to throw at him that blasphemes God, reckoning himself nearly concerned 
 in the reproaches cast on God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">Ps. lxix. 9</A>.

 Thus also the greater terror would be cast upon the congregation; those
 that once helped to stone a blasphemer would ever after dread every 
 thing that bordered upon blasphemy, that looked like it or looked 
 towards it.

 3. The solemnity of the execution; before the congregation stoned him,
 the witnesses were to <I>lay their hands upon his head.</I> The Jews 
 say that this was used in the execution of no criminals but 
 blasphemers; and that it was done with words to this purport, "<I>Thy 
 blood be upon thy own head, for thou thyself hast occasioned it.</I> 
 Let no blame be laid on the law, judges, juries, or witnesses; <I>if 
 thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. A standing law made upon this occasion for the stoning of 
 blasphemers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Magistrates are the guardians of both tables, and ought to be as 
 jealous for the honour of God against those that speak contemptuously 
 of his being and government as for the public peace and safety against 
 the disturbers of them.

 1. A great stress is laid upon this law, as in no case to be dispensed
 with: <I>He shall surely be put to death; they shall certainly stone 
 him.</I> Those that lightly esteemed God's honour might think it hard 
 to make a man an offender for a word (words are but wind); but God 
 would let them know that they must not make light of such words as 
 these, which come from malice against God in the heart of him that 
 speaks, and must occasion either great guilt or great grief to those 
 that hear. 

 2. It is made to extend to the strangers that sojourned among them, as
 well as those that were born in the land. God never made any law to 
 compel strangers to be circumcised and embrace the Jewish religion 
 (proselytes made by force would be no honour to the God of Israel), but 
 he made a law to restrain strangers from speaking evil of the God of 
 Israel. 

 3. He that was put to death for blasphemy is said to <I>bear his
 sin,</I> in the punishment of it; no sacrifice being appointed, on the 
 head of which the sin might be transferred, he himself was to bear it 
 upon his own head, as a sacrifice to divine justice. So <I>his own 
 tongue fell upon him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>),

 and the tongue of a blasphemer will fall heavily.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. A repetition of some other laws annexed to this new law. 

 1. That murder should be punished with death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 according to an ancient law in Noah's time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>),

 and the very law of nature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:10">Gen. iv. 10</A>.

 2. That maimers should in like manner be punished by the law of
 retaliation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Not that men might in these cases be their own avengers, but they might 
 appeal to the civil magistrate, who should award suffering to the 
 injurious and satisfaction to the injured as should be thought fit in 
 proportion to the hurt done. This law we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:4,5">Exod. xxii. 4, 5</A>.

 And it was more agreeable to that dispensation, in which were revealed
 the rigour of the law and what sin deserved, than to the dispensation 
 we are under, in which are revealed the grace of the gospel and the 
 remission of sins: and therefore our Saviour has set aside this law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:38,39">Matt. v. 38, 39</A>),

 not to restrain magistrates from executing public justice, but to
 restrain us all from returning personal injuries and to oblige us to 
 forgive as we are and hope to be forgiven.

 3. That hurt done wilfully to a neighbour's cattle should be punished
 by making good the damage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:18,21"><I>v.</I> 18, 21</A>.

 Thus the divine law took not only their lives, but their goods also 
 under its protection. Those beasts which belonged to no particular
 person, but were, as our law speaks, <I>ferae naturae--of a wild 
 nature,</I> it was lawful for them to kill; but not those which any man 
 had a property in. Does God take care for oxen? Yes; for our sakes he

 4. That strangers, as well as native Israelites, should be both
 entitled to the benefit of this law, so as not to suffer wrong, and 
 liable to the penalty of this law in case they did wrong. And, it 
 should seem, this is it that brings in these laws here, to show how 
 equitable it was that strangers as well as Israelites should be 
 punished for blasphemy, because strangers as well as Israelites were 
 punishable for other crimes. And there may be this further reason for 
 the recognition of these laws here, God would hereby show what 
 provision he had made for man's safety, in punishing those that were 
 injurious to him, which should be an argument with magistrates to be 
 jealous for his honour, and to punish those that blasphemed his name. 
 If God took care for their comfort, they ought to take care for his 
 glory.</P>

 VIII. The execution of the blasphemer. Moses did, as it were, sign the 
 warrant or it: He <I>spoke unto the children of Israel</I> to do it, 
 and they <I>did as the Lord commanded Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This teaches that death is the wages of sin, and that blasphemy in 
 particular is an <I>iniquity to be punished by the judges.</I> But, if 
 those who thus profane the name of God escape punishment from men, yet 
 the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous 
 judgments. This blasphemer was the first that died by the law of Moses. 
 Stephen, the first that died for the gospel, died by the abuse of this 
 law; the martyr and the malefactor suffered the same death: but how 
 vast the difference between them!</P>
