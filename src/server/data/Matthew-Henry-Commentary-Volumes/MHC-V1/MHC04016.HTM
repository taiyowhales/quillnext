 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of the history contained in this chapter is altogether 
 uncertain. Probably these mutinies happened after their removal back 
 again from Kadesh-barnea, when they were fixed (if I may so speak) for 
 their wandering in the wilderness, and began to look upon that as their 
 settlement. Presently after new laws given follows the story of a new 
 rebellion, as if sin took occasion from the commandment to become more 
 exceedingly sinful. Here is, 

 I. A daring and dangerous rebellion raised against Moses and Aaron, by 
 Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:1-15">ver. 1-15</A>.

 1. Korah and his accomplices contend for the priesthood against Aaron,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:3">ver. 3</A>.

 Moses reasons with them, and appeals to God for a decision of the
 controversy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:4-11">ver. 4-11</A>.

 2. Dathan and Abiram quarrel with Moses, and refuse to obey his 
 summons, which greatly grieves him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 II. A solemn appearance of the pretenders to the priesthood before God,
 according to order, and a public appearance of the glory of the Lord, 
 which would have consumed the whole congregation if Moses and Aaron had 
 not interceded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 III. The deciding of the controversy, and the crushing of the
 rebellion, by the cutting off of the rebels.

 1. Those in their tents were buried alive,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:23-34">ver. 23-34</A>.

 2. Those at the door of the tabernacle were consumed by fire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:35">ver. 35</A>),
 
 and their censers preserved for a memorial,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:37-40">ver. 37-40</A>.

 IV. A new insurrection of the people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:41-43">ver. 41-43</A>.

 1. God stayed in the insurrection by a plague, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:45">ver. 45</A>.

 2. Aaron stayed the plague by offering incense, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:46-50">ver. 46-50</A>.

 The manner and method of recording this story plainly show the ferment
 to have been very great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
 Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son
 of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <I>men:</I>
 &nbsp; 2 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children
 of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
 in the congregation, men of renown:
 &nbsp; 3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
 against Aaron, and said unto them, <I>Ye take</I> too much upon you,
 seeing all the congregation <I>are</I> holy, every one of them, and
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
 above the congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 4 And when Moses heard <I>it,</I> he fell upon his face:
 &nbsp; 5 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying,
 Even to morrow the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will show who <I>are</I> his, and <I>who is</I>
 holy; and will cause <I>him</I> to come near unto him: even <I>him</I> whom
 he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.
 &nbsp; 6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
 &nbsp; 7 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 to morrow: and it shall be <I>that</I> the man whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth
 choose, he <I>shall be</I> holy: <I>ye take</I> too much upon you, ye sons
 of Levi.
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
 &nbsp; 9 <I>Seemeth it but</I> a small thing unto you, that the God of
 Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to
 bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
 them?
 &nbsp; 10 And he hath brought thee near <I>to him,</I> and all thy brethren
 the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
 &nbsp; 11 For which cause <I>both</I> thou and all thy company <I>are</I>
 gathered together against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and what <I>is</I> Aaron, that ye
 murmur against him?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An account of the rebels, who and what they were, not, as formerly, 
 the mixed multitude and the dregs of the people, who are therefore 
 never named, but men of distinction and quality, that made a figure. 
 Korah was the ring-leader: he formed and headed the faction; therefore 
 it is called <I>the gainsaying of Korah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:11">Jude 11</A>.

 He was cousin-german to Moses, they were brothers' children, yet the
 nearness of the relation could not restrain him from being insolent and 
 rude to Moses. Think it not strange if a man's foes be <I>those of his 
 own house.</I> With him joined Dathan and Abiram, chief men of the 
 tribe of Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob. Probably Korah was disgusted 
 both at the preferment of Aaron to the priesthood and the constituting 
 of Elizaphan to the head of the Kohathites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:30"><I>ch.</I> iii. 30</A>);

 and perhaps the Reubenites were angry that the tribe of Judah had the
 first post of honour in the camp. <I>On</I> is mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 as one of the heads of the faction, but never after in the whole story, 
 either because, as some think, he repented and left them, or because he 
 did not make himself so remarkable as Dathan and Abiram did. The 
 Kohathites encamped on the same side of the tabernacle that the 
 Reubenites did, which perhaps gave Korah an opportunity of drawing them 
 in, whence the Jews say, <I>Woe to the wicked man, and woe to his 
 neighbour,</I> who is in danger of being infected by him. And, these 
 being themselves <I>men of renown,</I> they seduced into the conspiracy 
 <I>two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 probably they were first-born, or at least heads of families, who, 
 before the elevation of Aaron, had themselves ministered in holy 
 things. Note, The pride, ambition, and emulation, of great men, have 
 always been the occasion of a great deal of mischief both in churches 
 and states. God by his grace make great men humble, and so give peace 
 in our time, O Lord! Famous men, and men of renown, as these are 
 described to be, were the great sinners of the old world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:4">Gen. vi. 4</A>.

 The fame and renown which they had did not content them; they were
 high, but would be higher, and thus the famous men became infamous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rebels' remonstrance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 That which they quarrel with is the settlement of the priesthood upon 
 Aaron and his family, which they think an honour too great for Moses to 
 give and Aaron to accept, and so they are both charged with usurpation: 
 <I>You take too much upon you;</I> or, "Let it suffice you to have 
 domineered thus long, and now think of resigning your places to those 
 who have as good a title to them and are as well able to manage them."

 1. They proudly boast of the holiness of the congregation, and the
 presence of God in it. "They are <I>holy, every one of them,</I> and as 
 fit to be employed in offering sacrifice as Aaron is, and as masters of 
 families formerly were, and <I>the Lord is among them,</I> to direct 
 and own them." Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, 
 or of God's favour, as the people had been so frequently and so lately 
 polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure, 
 which should have made them thankful for priests to mediate between 
 them and God; but, instead of that, they envy them. 

 2. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking the honour they had
 to themselves, whereas it was evident, beyond contradiction, that they 
 were called of God to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4">Heb. v. 4</A>.

 So that they would either have no priests at all, nor any government,
 none to preside either in civil or sacred things, none over the 
 congregation, none above it, or they would not acquiesce in that 
 constitution of the government which God had appointed. See here,

 (1.) What spirit levellers are of, and those that despise dominions,
 and resist the powers that God has set over them; they are proud, 
 envious, ambitious, turbulent, wicked, and unreasonable men. 

 (2.) What usage even the best and most useful men may expect, even from
 those they have been serviceable to. If those be represented as 
 usurpers that have the best titles, and those as tyrants that govern 
 best, let them recollect that Moses and Aaron were thus abused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Moses's conduct when their remonstrance was published against him. 
 How did he take it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>fell on his face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:5"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 5</A>.

 Thus he showed how willing he would have been to yield to them, and how
 gladly he would have resigned his government, if it would have 
 consisted with his duty to God and his fidelity to the trust reposed in 
 him. Thus also he applied to God, by prayer, for direction what to say 
 and to do upon this sad occasion. He would not speak to them till he 
 had thus humbled and composed his own spirit (which could not but begin 
 to be heated), and had received instruction from God. The <I>heart of 
 the wise</I> in such a case <I>studies to answer,</I> and asks counsel 
 at God's mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He agrees to refer the case to God, and leave it to him to decide 
 it, as one well assured of the goodness of his title, and yet well 
 content to resign, if God thought fit, to gratify this discontented 
 people with another nomination. An honest cause fears not a speedy 
 trial; even to-morrow let it be brought on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 Let Korah and his partisans bring their censers, and offer incense 
 before the Lord, and, if he testify his acceptance of them, well and 
 good; Moses is now as willing that all the Lord's people should be 
 priests, if God so pleased, as before that they should all be prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:29"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29</A>.

 But if God, upon an appeal to him, determine (as no doubt he would) for
 Aaron, they would find it highly dangerous to make the experiment: and 
 therefore he puts it off till to-morrow, to try whether, when they had 
 slept upon it, they would desist, and let fall their pretensions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He argues the case fairly with them, to still the mutiny with fair 
 reasoning, if possible, before the appeal came to God's tribunal, for 
 then he knew it would end in the confusion of the complainants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He calls them <I>the sons of Levi,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They were of his own tribe, nay, they were of God's tribe; it was 
 therefore the worse in them thus to mutiny both against God and against 
 him. It was not long since the sons of Levi had bravely appeared on 
 God's side, in the matter of the golden calf, and got immortal honour 
 by it; and shall those that were then the only innocents now be the 
 leading criminals, and lose all the honour they had won? Could there be 
 such chaff on God's floor? Levites, and yet rebels?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He retorts their charge upon themselves. They had unjustly charged 
 Moses and Aaron with taking too much upon them, though they had done no 
 more than what God put upon them; nay, says Moses, <I>You take too much 
 upon you, you sons of Levi.</I> Note, Those that take upon them to 
 control and contradict God's appointment take too much upon them. It is 
 enough for us to submit; it is too much to prescribe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He shows them the privilege they had as Levites, which was 
 sufficient for them, they needed not to aspire to the honour of the 
 priesthood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 He reminds them how great the honour was to which they were preferred, 
 as Levites.

 [1.] They were <I>separated from the congregation of Israel,</I>
 distinguished from them, dignified above them; instead of complaining 
 that Aaron's family was advanced above theirs, they ought to have been 
 thankful that their tribe was advanced above the rest of the tribes, 
 though they had been in all respects upon the level with them. Note, It 
 will help to keep us from envying those that are above us duly to 
 consider how many there are below us. Instead of fretting that any are 
 preferred before us in honour, power, estate, or interest, in gifts, 
 graces, or usefulness, we have reason to bless God if we, who are less 
 than the least, are not put among the very last. Many perhaps who 
 deserve better are not preferred so well. 

 [2.] They were separated to very great and valuable honours,
 <I>First,</I> To <I>draw near to God,</I> nearer than the common 
 Israelites, though they also were a people near unto him; the nearer 
 any are to God the greater is their honour. <I>Secondly, To do the 
 service of the tabernacle.</I> It is honour enough to bear the vessels 
 of the sanctuary, and to be employed in any part of the service of the 
 tabernacle. God's service is not only perfect freedom, but high 
 preferment. <I>Thirdly,</I> To <I>stand before the congregation to 
 minister unto them.</I> Note, Those are truly great that serve the 
 public, and it is the honour of God's ministers to be the church's 
 ministers; nay, which adds to the dignity put upon them, 

 [3.] It was the God of Israel himself that separated them. It was his
 act and deed to put them into their place, and therefore they ought not 
 to have been discontented: and he it was likewise that put Aaron into 
 his place, and therefore they ought not to have envied him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He convicts them of the sin of undervaluing those privileges: 
 <I>Seemeth it a small thing unto you?</I> As if he had said, "It ill 
 becomes you of all men to grudge Aaron the priesthood, when at the same 
 time that he was advanced to that honour you were designed for another 
 honour dependent upon it, and shine with rays borrowed from him." Note, 
 
 [1.] The privilege of drawing near to the God of Israel is not a small
 thing in itself, and therefore must not appear small to us. To those 
 who neglect opportunities of drawing near to God, who are careless and 
 formal in it, to whom it is a task and not a pleasure, we may properly 
 put this question: "Seemeth it a small thing to you that God has made 
 you a people near unto him?" 

 [2.] Those who aspire after and usurp the honours forbidden them put a
 great contempt upon the honours allowed them. We have each of us as 
 good a share of reputation as God sees fit for us, and sees us fit for, 
 and much better than we deserve; and we ought to rest satisfied with 
 it, and not, as these, <I>exercise ourselves in things too high for us: 
 Seek you the priesthood also?</I> They would not <I>own</I> that they 
 sought it, but Moses saw that they had this in their eye; the law had 
 provided very well for those that served at the altar, and therefore 
 they would put in for the office.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He interprets their mutiny to be a rebellion against God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 while they pretended to assert the holiness and liberty of the Israel 
 of God, they really took up arms against the God of Israel: <I>You are 
 gathered together against the Lord.</I> Note, Those that strive against 
 God's ordinances and providences, whatever they pretend, and whether 
 they are aware of it or no, do indeed strive with their Maker. Those 
 resist the prince who resist those that are commissioned by him: for, 
 alas! says Moses, <I>What is Aaron, that you murmur against him?</I> If 
 murmurers and complainers would consider that the instruments they 
 quarrel with are but instruments whom God employs, and that they are 
 but what he makes them, and neither more nor less, better nor worse, 
 they would not be so bold and free in their censures and reproaches as 
 they are. Those that found the priesthood, as it was settled, a 
 blessing, must give all the praise to God; but if any found it a burden 
 they must not therefore quarrel with Aaron, who is but what he is made, 
 and does but as he is bidden. Thus he interested God in the cause, and 
 so might be sure of speeding well in his appeal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
 which said, We will not come up:
 &nbsp; 13 <I>Is it</I> a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a
 land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
 wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
 &nbsp; 14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
 with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
 vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not
 come up.
 &nbsp; 15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Respect
 not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
 neither have I hurt one of them.
 &nbsp; 16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:
 &nbsp; 17 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
 bring ye before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> every man his censer, two hundred and
 fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each <I>of you</I> his censer.
 &nbsp; 18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them,
 and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
 &nbsp; 19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto all the congregation.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
 consume them in a moment.
 &nbsp; 22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
 the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
 wroth with all the congregation?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The insolence of Dathan and Abiram, and their treasonable 
 remonstrance. Moses had heard what Korah had to say, and had answered 
 it; now he summons Dathan and Abiram to bring in their complaints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 but they would not obey his summons, either because they could not for 
 shame say that to his face which they were resolved to say, and then it 
 is an instance of some remains of modesty in them; or, rather, because 
 they would not so far own his authority, and then it is an instance of 
 the highest degree of impudence. They spoke the language of Pharaoh 
 himself, who set Moses at defiance, but they forgot how dearly he paid 
 for it. Had not their heads been wretchedly heated, and their hearts 
 hardened, they might have considered that, if they regarded not these 
 messengers, Moses could soon in God's name send messengers of death for 
 them. But thus the God of this world <I>blinds the minds of those that 
 believe not.</I> But by the same messengers they send their articles of 
 impeachment against Moses; and the charge runs very high.

 1. They charge him with having done them a great deal of wrong in
 bringing them out of Egypt, invidiously calling that <I>a land flowing 
 with milk and honey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Onions, and garlick, and fish, they had indeed plenty of in Egypt, but 
 it never pretended to milk and honey; only they would thus banter the 
 promise of Canaan. Ungrateful wretches, to represent that as an injury 
 to them which was really the greatest favour that ever was bestowed 
 upon any people!

 2. They charge him with a design upon their lives, that he intended to
 <I>kill them in the wilderness,</I> though they were so well provided 
 for. And, if they were sentenced to die in the wilderness, they must 
 thank themselves. Moses would have healed them, and they would not be
 healed. 

 3. They charge him with a design upon their liberties, that he meant to
 enslave them, by <I>making himself a prince over them.</I> A prince 
 over them! Was he not a tender father to them? nay, their devoted
 servant for the Lord's sake? Had they not their properties secured, 
 their order preserved, and justice impartially administered? Did they
 not live in ease and honour? And yet they complain as if Moses's yoke 
 were heavier than Pharaoh's. And did Moses make himself a prince? Far 
 from it. How gladly would he have declined the office at first! How 
 gladly would he have resigned it many a time since! And yet he is thus 
 put under the blackest characters of a tyrant and a usurper.

 4. They charge him with cheating them, raising their expectations of a
 good land, and then defeating them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Thou hast not brought us,</I> as thou promisedst us, <I>into a land 
 that floweth with milk and honey;</I> and pray whose fault was that? He 
 had brought them to the borders of it, and was just ready, under God, 
 to put them in possession of it; but they thrust it away from them, and 
 shut the door against themselves; so that it was purely their own fault 
 that they were not now in Canaan, and yet Moses must bear the blame. 
 Thus when the <I>foolishness of man perverteth his way his heart 
 fretteth against the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.

 5. They charge him in the general with unfair dealing, that he put
 <I>out the eyes of these men,</I> and then meant to lead them blindfold 
 as he pleased. The design of all he did for them was to open their 
 eyes, and yet they insinuate that he intended to put out their eyes, 
 that they might not see themselves imposed upon. Note, The wisest and 
 best cannot please every body, nor gain the good word of all. Those 
 often fall under the heaviest censures who have merited the highest 
 applause. Many a good work Moses had shown them from the Father, and 
 for which of these do they reproach him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses's just resentment of their insolence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Moses, though the meekest man, yet, finding God reproached in him, 
 <I>was very wroth;</I> he could not bear to see a people ruining 
 themselves for whose salvation he had done so much. In this 
 discomposure,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He appeals to God concerning his own integrity; whereas they basely 
 reflected upon him as ambitious, covetous, and oppressive, in making 
 himself a prince over them, God was his witness, 

 (1.) That he never got any thing by them: <I>I have not taken one ass
 from them,</I> not only not by way of bribery and extortion, but not by 
 way of recompence or gratuity for all the good offices he had done 
 them; he never took the pay of a general, or the salary of a judge, 
 much less the tribute of a prince. He got more in his estate when he 
 kept Jethro's flock than when he came to be king in Jeshurun. 

 (2.) That they never lost any thing by him: <I>Neither have I hurt any
 one of them,</I> no, not the least, no, not the worst, no, not those 
 that had been most peevish and provoking to him: he never abused his 
 power to the support of wrong. Note, Those that have never blemished 
 themselves need not fear being slurred by others: when men condemn us 
 we may be easy, if our own hearts condemn us not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He begs of God to plead his cause, and clear him, by showing his 
 displeasure at the incense which Korah and his company were to offer, 
 with whom Dathan and Abiram were in confederacy. Lord, says he, 
 <I>Respect not thou their offering.</I> Herein he seems to refer to the 
 history of Cain, lately written by his own hand, of whom it is said 
 that to him and his offering God had not respect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:5">Gen. iv. 5</A>.

 These that <I>followed the gainsaying of Korah walked in the way of
 Cain</I> (these are put together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:11">Jude 11</A>),

 and therefore he prays that they might be frowned upon as Cain was, and
 put to the same confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Issue joined between Moses and his accusers. 

 1. Moses challenges them to appear with Aaron next morning, at the time
 of offering up the morning incense, and refer the matter to God's 
 judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Since he could not convince them by his calm and affectionate 
 reasoning, he is ready to enter into bonds to stand God's award, not 
 doubting but that God would appear, to decide the controversy. This 
 reference he had agreed to before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 and here adds only one clause, which bespeaks his great condescension 
 to the plaintiffs, that Aaron, against whose advancement they excepted, 
 though now advanced by the divine institution to the honour of burning 
 incense within the tabernacle, yet, upon this trial, should put himself 
 into the place of a probationer, and stand upon the level with Korah, 
 at the door of the tabernacle; nay, and Moses himself would stand with 
 them, so that the complainant shall have all the fair dealing he can 
 desire; and thus <I>every mouth shall be stopped.</I>

 2. Korah accepts the challenge, and makes his appearance with Moses and
 Aaron <I>at the door of the tabernacle,</I> to make good his 
 pretensions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 If he had not had a very great stock of impudence, he could not have 
 carried on the matter thus far. Had not he lately seen Nadab and Abihu, 
 the consecrated priests, struck dead for daring to offer incense with 
 unhallowed fire? and could he and his accomplices expect to fare any 
 better in offering incense with unhallowed hands? Yet, to confront 
 Moses and Aaron, in the height of his pride he thus bids defiance to 
 Heaven, and pretends to demand the divine acceptance without a divine 
 warrant; thus wretchedly is the heart hardened through the 
 deceitfulness of sin. They <I>took every man his censer.</I> Perhaps 
 these were some of the censers which these heads of families had made 
 use of at their family-altars, before this part of religious service 
 was confined to the priesthood and the altar in the tabernacle (and 
 they would bring them into use and reputation again); or they might be 
 common chafing-dishes, which were for their ordinary use. Now to attend 
 the solemn trial, and to be witness of the issue, one would have 
 thought Moses should have <I>gathered the congregation against the 
 rebels,</I> but it seems Korah gathered them against Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which intimates that a great part of the congregation sided with Korah, 
 were at his beck, and wished him success, and that Korah's hopes were 
 very high of carrying the point against Aaron; for, had he suspected 
 the event, he would not have coveted to make the trial thus public: but 
 little did he think that he was now calling the congregation together 
 to be the witnesses of his own confusion! Note, Proud and ambitious 
 men, while they are projecting their own advancement, often prove to 
 have been hurrying on their own shameful fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The judgment set, and the Judge taking the tribunal, and 
 threatening to give sentence against the whole congregation. 

 1. The <I>glory of the Lord appeared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The same glory that appeared to instal Aaron in his office at first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:23">Lev. ix. 23</A>)

 now appeared to confirm him in it, and to confound those that oppose 
 him, and set up themselves in competition with him. The 
 <I>Shechinah,</I> or divine Majesty, the glory of the eternal Word, 
 which ordinarily dwelt between the cherubim within the veil, now was 
 publicly seen over the door of the tabernacle, to the terror of the 
 whole congregation; for, though they saw no manner of similitude, yet 
 probably the appearances of the light and fire were such as plainly 
 showed God to be angry with them; as when he appeared,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:10"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 10</A>.

 Nothing is more terrible to those who are conscious of guilt than the
 appearances of divine glory; for such a glorious Being must needs be a 
 formidable enemy.

 2. God threatened to <I>consume them all in a moment,</I> and, in
 order to that, bade Moses and Aaron stand from among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 God thus showed what their sin deserved, and how very provoking it was 
 to him. See what a dangerous thing it is to have fellowship with
 sinners, and in the least to partake with them. Many of the 
 congregation, it is likely, came only for company, following the crowd, 
 or for curiosity, to see the issue, yet not coming, as they ought to 
 have done, to bear their testimony against the rebels, and openly to 
 declare for God and Moses, they had like to have been all consumed in a 
 moment. If we follow the herd into which the devil has entered, it is 
 at our peril.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The humble intercession of Moses and Aaron for the congregation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 1. Their posture was importuning: they <I>fell on their faces,</I>
 prostrating themselves before God, as supplicants in good earnest, that 
 they might prevail for sparing mercy. Though the people had
 treacherously deserted them, and struck in with those that were in arms 
 against them, yet they approved themselves faithful to the trusts 
 reposed in them, as shepherds of Israel, who were to stand in the 
 breach when they saw the flock in danger. Note, If others fail in their 
 duty to us, this does not discharge us from our duty to them, nor take 
 off the obligations we lie under to seek their welfare. 

 2. Their prayer was a pleading prayer, and it proved a prevailing one.
 Now God would have <I>destroyed them</I> if Moses had not <I>turned 
 away his wrath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23">Ps. cvi. 23</A>);

 yet far be it from us to imagine that Moses was more considerate or
 more compassionate than God in such a case as this: but God saw fit to 
 show his just displeasure against the sin of sinners by the sentence, 
 and at the same time to show his gracious condescension to the prayers 
 of the saints, by the revocation of the sentence at the intercession of 
 Moses. Observe in the prayer,

 (1.) The title they give to God: <I>The God of the spirits of all
 flesh.</I> See what man is; he is a spirit in flesh, a soul embodied, a 
 creature wonderfully compounded of heaven and earth. See what God is; 
 he is the God of the spirits of all mankind. <I>He forms the 
 spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:1">Zech. xii. 1</A>.

 He <I>fathers it,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 He has an ability to fashion it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:15">Ps. xxxiii. 15</A>),

 and authority to dispose of it, for he has said, <I>All souls are
 mine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:4">Ezek. xviii. 4</A>.

 They insinuate hereby that though, as <I>the God of the spirits of all
 flesh,</I> he might in sovereignty consume this congregation in a 
 moment, yet it was to be hoped that he would in mercy spare them, not 
 only because they were the work of his own hands, and he had a 
 propriety in them, but because, being the <I>God of spirits,</I> he 
 knew their frame, and could distinguish between the leaders and the 
 led, between those who sinned maliciously and those who were drawn in 
 by their wiles, and would make a difference accordingly in his 
 judgments.

 (2.) The argument they insist on; it is much the same with that which
 Abraham urged in his intercession for Sodom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23">Gen. xviii. 23</A>):

 <I>Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked?</I> Such is the
 plea here: <I>Shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the 
 congregation?</I> Not but that it was the sin of them all to join in 
 this matter, but the great transgression was his that first hatched the 
 treason. Note, Whatever God may do in sovereignty and strict justice, 
 we have reason to hope that he will not destroy a congregation for the 
 sin of one, but that, <I>righteousness and peace</I> having <I>kissed 
 each other</I> in the undertaking of the Redeemer, <I>mercy shall 
 rejoice against judgment.</I> Moses knew that all the congregation must 
 perish in the wilderness by degrees, yet he is thus earnest in prayer 
 that they might not be consumed at once, and would reckon it a favour 
 to obtain a reprieve. <I>Lord, let it alone this year.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about
 the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
 &nbsp; 25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
 elders of Israel followed him.
 &nbsp; 26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
 you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
 theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
 &nbsp; 27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
 Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood
 in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and
 their little children.
 &nbsp; 28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent
 me to do all these works; for <I>I have</I> not <I>done them</I> of mine
 own mind.
 &nbsp; 29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
 visited after the visitation of all men; <I>then</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not
 sent me.
 &nbsp; 30 But if the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> make a new thing, and the earth open her
 mouth, and swallow them up, with all that <I>appertain</I> unto them,
 and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
 that these men have provoked the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
 these words, that the ground clave asunder that <I>was</I> under them:
 &nbsp; 32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
 their houses, and all the men that <I>appertained</I> unto Korah, and
 all <I>their</I> goods.
 &nbsp; 33 They, and all that <I>appertained</I> to them, went down alive
 into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
 from among the congregation.
 &nbsp; 34 And all Israel that <I>were</I> round about them fled at the cry
 of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up <I>also.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the determining of the controversy with Dathan and Abiram, 
 who rebelled against Moses, as in the next paragraph the determining of 
 the controversy with Korah and his company, who would be rivals with 
 Aaron. It should seem that Dathan and Abiram had set up a spacious 
 tabernacle in the midst of the tents of their families, where they kept 
 court, met in council, and hung out their flag of defiance against 
 Moses; it is here called <I>the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and 
 Abiram,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:24,27"><I>v.</I> 24, 27</A>.

 There, as in the place of rendezvous, Dathan and Abiram staid, when 
 Korah and his friends went up to the tabernacle of the Lord, waiting 
 the issue of their trial; but here we are told how they had their 
 business done, before that trial was over. For God will take what 
 method he pleases in his judgments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Public warning is given to the congregation to withdraw immediately 
 from the tents of the rebels. 

 1. God bids Moses speak to this purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This was in answer to Moses's prayer. He had begged that God would not 
 <I>destroy the whole congregation.</I> "Well," says God, "I will not, 
 provided they be so wise as to shift for their own safety, and get out 
 of the way of danger. If they will quit the rebels, well and good, they 
 shall not perish with them; otherwise, let them take what follows." 
 Note, We cannot expect to reap benefit by the prayers of our friends 
 for our salvation, unless we ourselves be diligent and faithful in 
 making use of the means of salvation; for God never promised to save by 
 miracles those that would not save themselves by means. Moses that had 
 prayed for them must preach this to them, and warn them to <I>flee from 
 this wrath to come.</I>

 2. Moses accordingly repairs to the head-quarters of the rebels,
 leaving Aaron at the door of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Dathan and Abiram had contumaciously refused to come up to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 yet he humbly condescends to go down to them, to try if he could yet 
 convince and reclaim them. Ministers must thus with meekness instruct 
 those that oppose themselves, and not think it below them to stoop to 
 those that are most stubborn, for their good. Christ himself stretches 
 out his hand to a rebellious and gainsaying people. The seventy elders 
 of Israel attend Moses and his guard, to secure him from the insolence 
 of the rabble, and by their presence to put an honour upon him, and if 
 possible to strike an awe upon the rebels. It is our duty to contribute 
 all we can to the countenance and support of injured innocency and 
 honour.

 3. Proclamation is made that all manner of persons, as they tendered
 their own safety, should forthwith <I>depart from the tents of these 
 wicked men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and thus should signify that they deserted their cause and interest, 
 detested their crimes and counsels, and dreaded the punishment coming 
 upon them. Note, Those that would not perish with sinners must <I>come 
 out from among them,</I> and be separate. In vain do we pray, <I>Gather 
 not our souls with sinners,</I> if we save not ourselves from the 
 <I>untoward generation.</I> God's people are called out of Babylon, 
 lest they share both in her sins and in her plagues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The congregation takes the warning, but the rebels themselves 
 continue obstinate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 1. God, in mercy, inclined the people to forsake the rebels: <I>They
 got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,</I> both those 
 whose lot it was to pitch near them (who doubtless with themselves 
 removed their families, and all their effects) and those also who had 
 come from all parts of their camp to see the issue. It was in answer to 
 the prayer of Moses that God thus stirred up the hearts of the 
 congregation to shift for their own preservation. Note, To those whom 
 God will save he gives repentance, that they may <I>recover themselves 
 out of the snare of the devil.</I> Grace to separate from evil doers is 
 one of the things that accompany salvation.

 2. God, in justice, left the rebels to the obstinacy and hardness of
 their own hearts. Though they saw themselves abandoned by all their 
 neighbours, and set up as a mark to the arrows of God's justice, yet 
 instead of falling down and humbling themselves before God and Moses, 
 owning their crime and begging pardon, instead of fleeing and 
 dispersing themselves to seek for shelter in the crowd, they impudently 
 <I>stood in the doors of their tents,</I> as if they would out-face God 
 himself, and dare him to his worst. Thus were their hearts hardened to 
 their own destruction, and they were fearless when their case was most 
 fearful. But what a pity was it that their little children, who were 
 not capable of guilt or fear, should by the presumption of their 
 parents be put in this audacious posture! Happy they who are taught 
 betimes to bow before God, and not as those unhappy little ones to 
 stand it out against him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Sentence is solemnly pronounced upon them by Moses in the name of 
 the Lord, and the decision of the controversy is put upon the execution 
 of that sentence by the almighty power of God. Moses, by divine 
 instinct and direction, when the eyes of all Israel were fastened upon 
 him, waiting the event, moved with a just and holy indignation at the 
 impudence of the rebels, boldly puts the whole matter to a surprising 
 issue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.

 1. If the rebels die a common death, he will be content to be called
 and counted an impostor; not only if they die a natural death, but if 
 they die by any sort of judgment that has formerly been executed on 
 other malefactors. "If they die by the plague, or by fire from heaven, 
 or by the sword, then say, God has disowned Moses;" but, 

 2. "If the earth open and swallow them up" (a punishment without
 precedent), "then let all the house of Israel know assuredly that I am 
 God's servant, sent by him, and employed for him, and that those that 
 fight against me fight against him." The judgment itself would have 
 been proof enough of God's displeasure against the rebels, and would 
 have given all men to <I>understand that they had provoked the 
 Lord;</I> but when it was thus solemnly foretold and appealed to by 
 Moses beforehand, when there was not the least previous indication of 
 it from without, the convincing evidence of it was much the stronger, 
 and it was put beyond dispute that he was not only a servant but a 
 favourite of Heaven, who was so intimately acquainted with the divine 
 counsels, and could obtain such extraordinary appearances of the divine
 power in his vindication.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Execution is immediately done. It appeared that God and his servant 
 Moses understood one another very well; for, as soon as ever Moses had 
 spoken the word, God did the work, the earth <I>clave asunder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 <I>opened her mouth, and swallowed them all up,</I> them and theirs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and then <I>closed upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 This judgment was,

 1. Unparalleled. God, in it, <I>created a new thing,</I> did what he 
 never did before; for he has many arrows in his quiver; and there are 
 diversities of operations in wrath as well as mercy. Dathan and Abiram 
 thought themselves safe because they were at a distance from the 
 <I>shechinah,</I> whence the fire of the Lord had sometimes issued, 
 <I>qui procul &agrave; Jove</I> (they say) <I>procul &agrave;
 fulmine--he who is far from Jove is far from the thunderbolt.</I> But 
 God made them to know that he was not tied up to one way of punishing;
 the earth, when he pleases, shall serve his justice as effectually as 
 the fire.

 2. It was very terrible to the sinners themselves to go down alive into
 their own graves, to be dead and buried in an instant, to go down thus 
 to the bars of the pit when they were in their <I>full strength wholly 
 at ease and quiet.</I> 

 3. It was severe upon their poor children, who, for the greater terror
 of the judgment, and fuller indication of the divine wrath, perished as 
 parts of their parents, in which, though we cannot particularly tell 
 how bad they might be to deserve it or how good God might be otherwise 
 to them to compensate it, yet of this we are sure in the general, that 
 Infinite Justice did them no wrong. <I>Far be it from God that he
 should do iniquity.</I> 

 4. It was altogether miraculous. The cleaving of the earth was as
 wonderful, and as much above the power of nature, as the cleaving of 
 the sea, and the closing of the earth again more so than the closing of 
 the waters. God has all the creatures at his command, and can make any 
 of them, when he pleases, instruments of his justice; nor will any of 
 them be our friends if he be our enemy. God now confirmed to Israel
 what Moses had lately taught them in that prayer of his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11">Ps. xc. 11</A>,

 <I>Who knows the power of thy anger?</I> He has, when he pleases, 
 <I>strange punishments for the workers of iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:3">Job xxxi. 3</A>.

 Let us therefore conclude, <I>Who is able to stand before this holy
 Lord God?</I> 

 5. It was very significant. They <I>set their mouths against the
 heavens,</I> and <I>their throat was an open sepulchre;</I> justly 
 therefore does the earth open her mouth upon them and swallow them up.
 They made a rent in the congregation; justly therefore is the earth 
 rent under them. Presumptuous sinners, that hate to be reformed, are a
 burden to the earth, the whole creation groans under them, which here 
 was signified by this, that the earth sunk under these rebels, as weary 
 of bearing them and being under them. And, considering how the earth is 
 still in like manner loaded with the weight of iniquity, we have reason 
 to wonder that this was the only time it ever sunk under its load. 

 6. It was typical of the eternal ruin of sinners who die impenitent,
 who, perhaps in allusion to this, are said to <I>sink down into the 
 pit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:15">Ps. ix. 15</A>)

 and to <I>go down quickly into hell,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:15">Ps. lv. 15</A>.

 But David, even when he <I>sinks in deep mire,</I> yet prays in faith,
 <I>Let not the pit shut her mouth upon me,</I> as it does on the 
 damned, between whom and life there is a gulf fixed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:2-15">Ps. lxix. 2-15</A>.

 His case was bad, but not, like this, desperate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. All Israel is alarmed at the judgment: <I>They fled at the cry of 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 They cried for help when it was too late. Their doleful shrieks, 
 instead of fetching their neighbours in to their relief, drove them so 
 much the further off; for knowing their own guilt, and one another's, 
 they hastened one another, saying, <I>Lest the earth swallow us up 
 also.</I> Note, Others' ruins should be our warnings. Could we by faith 
 hear the outcries of those that have gone down to the bottomless pit, 
 we should give more diligence than we do to escape for our lives, lest 
 we also come into that condemnation.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>35 And there came out a fire from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and consumed the
 two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
 &nbsp; 36 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 37 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
 up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
 yonder; for they are hallowed.
 &nbsp; 38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let
 them make them broad plates <I>for</I> a covering of the altar: for
 they offered them before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, therefore they are hallowed:
 and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 39 And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith
 they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad
 <I>plates for</I> a covering of the altar:
 &nbsp; 40 <I>To be</I> a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
 stranger, which <I>is</I> not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer
 incense before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; that he be not as Korah, and as his
 company: as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to him by the hand of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must now look back to the door of the tabernacle, where we left the 
 pretenders to the priesthood with their censers in their hands ready to 
 offer incense; and here we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Vengeance taken on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 It is probable that when the earth opened in the camp to swallow up 
 Dathan and Abiram <I>a fire went out from the Lord and consumed the 250 
 men that offered incense,</I> while Aaron that stood with them was 
 preserved alive. This punishment was not indeed so new a thing as the 
 former, for Nadab and Abihu thus died; but it was not less strange or 
 dreadful, and in it it appeared,

 1. That <I>our God is a consuming fire.</I> Is thunder a sensible
 indication of the terror of his voice? Lightning is also the power of 
 his hand. We must see in this his fiery indignation which devours the 
 adversaries, and infer from it what a fearful thing it is to <I>fall 
 into the hands of the living God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:27-31">Heb. x. 27-31</A>.

 2. That it is at our peril if we meddle with that which does not belong
 to us. God is jealous of the honour of his own institutions, and will 
 not have them invaded. It is most probable that Korah himself was 
 consumed with those 250 that presumed to offer incense; for the 
 priesthood was the thing he aimed at, and therefore we have reason to 
 think that he would not quit his post at the door of the tabernacle. 
 But, behold, those are made sacrifices to the justice of God who 
 flattered themselves with the hopes of being priests. Had they been
 content with their office as Levites, which was sacred and honourable, 
 and better than they deserved, they might have lived and died with joy 
 and reputation; but, like the angels that sinned, <I>leaving their 
 first estate,</I> and aiming at the honours that were not appointed 
 them, they were thrust down to <I>Hades,</I> their censers struck out 
 of their hands, and their breath out of their bodies, by a burning 
 which typified <I>the vengeance of eternal fire.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Care is taken to perpetuate the remembrance of this vengeance. No 
 mention is made of the taking up of their carcases: the scripture 
 leaves them as dung upon the face of the earth; but orders are given 
 about their censers, 

 1. That they be secured, because they are hallowed. Eleazar is charged
 with this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Those invaders of the priesthood had proceeded so far, by the divine 
 patience and submission, as to kindle their incense with fire from off 
 the altar, which they were suffered to use by way of experiment: but, 
 as soon as they had kindled their fire, God kindled another, which put 
 a fatal final period to their pretensions; now Eleazar is ordered to 
 scatter the fire, with the incense that was kindled with it, in some 
 unclean place without the camp, to signify God's abhorrence of their 
 offering as a polluted thing: <I>The sacrifice of the wicked is an 
 abomination to the Lord.</I> But he is to gather up the censers out of 
 the mingled burning, God's fire and theirs, because <I>they are 
 hallowed.</I> Having been once put to a holy use, and that by God's own 
 order (though only for trial), they must not return to common service; 
 so some understand it: rather, <I>they are devoted,</I> they are an 
 anathema; and therefore, as all devoted things, they must be made some 
 way or other serviceable to the glory of God.

 2. That they be used in the service of the sanctuary, not as censers,
 which would rather have put honour upon the usurpers whose disgrace was 
 intended; nor was there occasion for brazen censers, the golden altar 
 was served with golden ones; but they must be beaten into <I>broad 
 plates for a covering of the brazen altar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.

 These pretenders thought to have ruined the altar, by laying the 
 priesthood in common again; but to show that Aaron's office was so far 
 from being shaken by their impotent malice that it was rather confirmed 
 by it, their censers, which offered to rival his, were used both for 
 the adorning and for the preserving of the altar at which he 
 ministered. Yet this was not all; this covering of the altar must be a
 <I>memorial to the children of Israel,</I> throughout their 
 generations, of this great event. Though there was so much in it 
 astonishing, and though Moses was to record it in his history, yet 
 there was danger of its being forgotten in process of time; impressions 
 that seem deep are not always durable; therefore it was necessary to 
 appoint this record of the judgment, that the Levites who attended this 
 altar, and had their inferior services appointed them, might learn to 
 keep within their bounds, and be afraid of transgressing them, lest 
 they should be made like Korah and his company, who were Levites, and 
 would have been priests. These censers were preserved <I>in 
 terrorem,</I> that others might hear and fear, and do no more 
 presumptuously. Thus God has provided that his wonderful works, both in 
 mercy and judgment, should be had in everlasting remembrance, that the 
 end of them may be answered, and they may serve for instruction and 
 admonition to those <I>on whom the ends of the world are come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
 Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have
 killed the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
 against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
 it, and the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared.
 &nbsp; 43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 44 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 45 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
 them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
 &nbsp; 46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire
 therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly
 unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there
 is wrath gone out from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; the plague is begun.
 &nbsp; 47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
 the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
 people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
 people.
 &nbsp; 48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
 was stayed.
 &nbsp; 49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
 seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
 &nbsp; 50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A new rebellion raised the very next day against Moses and Aaron. Be 
 astonished, O heavens, at this, and wonder, O earth! Was there ever 
 such an instance of the incurable corruption of sinners?  <I>On the 
 morrow</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)
 
 the body of the people mutinied.

 1. Though they were so lately terrified by the sight of the punishment
 of the rebels. The shrieks of those sinking sinners, those sinners 
 against their own souls, were yet sounding in their ears, the smell of 
 the fire yet remained, and the gaping earth was scarcely thoroughly 
 closed, and yet the same sins were re-acted and all these warnings 
 slighted. 

 2. Though they were so lately saved from sharing in the same
 punishment, and the survivors were <I>as brands plucked out of the 
 burning,</I> yet they fly in the face of Moses and Aaron, to whose 
 intercession they owed their preservation. Their charge runs very high: 
 <I>You have killed the people of the Lord.</I> Could any thing have 
 been said more unjustly and maliciously? They canonize the rebels, 
 calling those the people of the Lord who died in arms against him. They 
 stigmatize divine justice itself. It was plain enough that Moses and 
 Aaron had no hand in their death (they did what they could to save 
 them), so that in charging them with murder they did in effect charge 
 God himself with it. The continued obstinacy of this people, 
 notwithstanding the terrors of God's law as it was given on Mount 
 Sinai, and the terrors of his judgments as they were here executed on 
 the disobedient, shows how necessary the grace of God is to the 
 effectual change of men's hearts and lives, without which the most 
 likely means will never attain the end. Love will do what fear could 
 not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's speedy appearance against the rebels. When they had 
 <I>gathered against Moses and Aaron,</I> perhaps with a design to 
 depose or murder them, they <I>looked towards the tabernacle,</I> as if 
 their misgiving consciences expected some frowns thence, and, 
 <I>behold, the glory of the Lord appeared</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 for the protection of his servants, and the confusion of his and their 
 accusers and adversaries. Moses and Aaron thereupon came before the 
 tabernacle, partly for their own safety (there they took sanctuary from 
 the strife of tongues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5,31:20">Ps. xxvii. 5; xxxi. 20</A>),

 and partly for advice, to know what was the mind of God upon this
 occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Justice hereupon declares that they deserve to be <I>consumed in a 
 moment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 Why should those live an other day who hate to be reformed, and whose 
 rebellions are their daily practices? Let just vengeance take place and 
 do its work, and the trouble will soon be over; only Moses and Aaron 
 must first be secured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The intercession which Moses and Aaron made for them. Though they 
 had as much reason, one would think, as Elias had to make intercession 
 against Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2">Rom. xi. 2</A>),

 yet they forgive and forget the indignities offered them, and are the
 best friends their enemies have.

 1. They both <I>fell on their faces,</I> humbly to intercede with God
 for mercy, knowing how great the provocation was. This they had done 
 several times before, upon similar occasions; and, though the people 
 had basely requited them for it, yet, God having graciously accepted 
 them, they still have recourse to the same method. This is praying 
 always. 

 2. Moses, perceiving that the <I>plague had begun in the
 congregation</I> of the rebels (that is, that body of them which was 
 gathered against Moses), sent Aaron by an act of his priestly office to 
 make atonement for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 And Aaron readily went and burned incense between the living and the 
 dead, not to purify the infected air, but to pacify an offended God, 
 and so stayed the progress of the judgment. By this it appeared,

 (1.) That Aaron was a very good man, and a man that had a true love for
 the children of his people, though they hated and envied him. Though 
 God was now avenging his quarrel and pleading the cause of his 
 priesthood, yet he interposes to turn away God's wrath. Nay, forgetting 
 his age and gravity, he ran into the midst of the congregation to help 
 them. He did not say, "Let them smart awhile, and then, when I come, I 
 shall be the more welcome;" but, as one tender of the life of every 
 Israelite, he makes all possible speed into the gap at which death was 
 entering. Moses and Aaron, who had been charged with killing the people 
 of the Lord, might justly have upbraided them now; could they expect 
 those to be their saviours whom they had so invidiously called their 
 murderers? But those good men have taught us here by their example not 
 to be sullen towards those that are peevish with us, nor to take the 
 advantage which men give us by their provoking language to deny them 
 any real kindness which it is in the power of our hands to do them. We 
 must render good for evil. 

 (2.) That Aaron was a very bold man--bold to venture into the midst of
 an enraged rabble that were gathered together against him, and who, for 
 aught he knew, might be the more exasperated by the plague that had 
 begun--bold to venture into the midst of the infection, where the 
 arrows of death flew thickest, and hundreds, nay thousands, were 
 falling on the right hand and on the left. To save their lives he put 
 his own into his hand, not counting it dear to him, so that he might 
 but fulfil his ministry. 

 (3.) That Aaron was a man of God, and <I>ordained for men, in things
 pertaining to God.</I> His call to the priesthood was hereby abundantly 
 confirmed and set above all contradiction; God had not only saved his 
 life when the intruders were cut off, but now made him an instrument 
 for saving Israel. Compare the censer of Aaron here with the <I>censers 
 of those sinners against their own souls.</I> Those provoked God's 
 anger, this pacified it; those destroyed men's lives, this saved them; 
 no room therefore is left to doubt of Aaron's call to the priesthood.
 Note, Those make out the best title to public honours that lay out 
 themselves the most for public good and obtain mercy of the Lord to be 
 faithful and useful. If any man will be great, let him make himself the 
 servant of all. 

 (4.) That Aaron was a type of Christ, who came into the world to make
 an atonement for sin and to turn away the wrath of God from us, and 
 who, by his mediation and intercession, <I>stands between the living 
 and the dead,</I> to secure his chosen Israel to himself, and save them 
 out of the midst of a world infected with sin and the curse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The result and issue of the whole matter. 

 1. God's justice was glorified in the death of some. Great execution
 the sword of the Lord did in a very little time. Though Aaron made all 
 the haste he could, yet, before he could reach his post of service, 
 there were 14,700 men laid dead upon the spot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 There were but few comparatively that died about the matter of Korah, 
 the ring-leaders only were made examples; but, the people not being led 
 to repentance by the patience and forbearance of God with them, justice 
 is not now so sparing of the blood of Israelites. They complained of 
 the death of a few hundreds as an unmerciful slaughter made among the 
 <I>people of the Lord,</I> but here God silences that complaint by the 
 slaughter of many thousands. Note, Those that quarrel with less 
 judgments prepare greater for themselves; for when God judges he will 
 overcome.

 2. His mercy was glorified in the preservation of the rest. God showed
 them what he could do by his power, and what he might do in justice, 
 but then showed them what he would do in his love and pity: he would, 
 notwithstanding all this, preserve them a people to himself in and by a 
 mediator. The cloud of Aaron's incense coming from his hand stayed the 
 plague. Note, It is much for the glory of God's goodness that many a 
 time even in wrath he remembers mercy. And, even when judgments have 
 been begun, prayer puts a stop to them; so ready is he to forgive, and 
 so little pleasure does he take in the death of sinners.</P>
