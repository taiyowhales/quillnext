 We had, in the foregoing chapter, the fulfilling of the dreams which 
 Joseph had interpreted: in this and the following chapters we 
 have the fulfilling of the dreams which Joseph himself had 
 dreamed, that his father's family should do homage to him. 
 The story is very largely and particularly related of what passed 
 between Joseph and his brethren, not only because it is an entertaining 
 story, and probably was much talked of, both among the 
 Israelites and among the Egyptians, but because it is very 
 instructive, and it gave occasion for the removal of Jacob's 
 family into Egypt, on which so many great events afterwards 
 depended. We have, in this chapter, 
 
 I. The humble application 
 of Jacob's sons to Joseph to buy corn, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.
 
 II. The fright 
 Joseph put them into, for their trial, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:7-20">ver. 7-20</A>.
 
 III. The conviction 
 they were now under of their sin concerning Joseph long
 before, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.
 
 IV. Their return to Canaan with corn, and 
 the great distress their good father was in upon hearing the 
 account of their expedition, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:25-38">ver. 25</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now when Jacob saw that there 
 was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
 unto his sons, Why do ye look one 
 upon another?
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, Behold, 
 I have heard that there is corn 
 in Egypt: get you down thither, and 
 buy for us from thence; that we may 
 live, and not die.
 &nbsp; 3 And Joseph's ten 
 brethren went down to buy corn in 
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 4 But Benjamin, Joseph's 
 brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; 
 for he said, Lest peradventure 
 mischief befal him.
 &nbsp; 5 And the sons 
 of Israel came to buy <I>corn</I> among 
 those that came: for the famine was 
 in the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 6 And Joseph 
 <I>was</I> the governor over the land, 
 <I>and</I> he <I>it was</I> that sold to all the people 
 of the land: and Joseph's brethren 
 came, and bowed down themselves before 
 him <I>with</I> their faces to the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though Jacob's sons were all married, and 
 had families of their own, yet, it should 
 seem, they were still incorporated in one society, 
 under the conduct and presidency of 
 their father Jacob. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders he gave them to go and buy 
 corn in Egypt,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. The 
 famine was grievous in the land of Canaan. 
 It is observable that all the three patriarchs,
 to whom Canaan was the land of promise, 
 met with famine in that land, which was not 
 only to try their faith, whether they could 
 trust God though he should slay them, 
 though he should starve them, but to teach 
 them to seek the better country, that is, the 
 heavenly,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14-16">Heb. xi. 14-16</A>.
 We have need 
 of something to wean us from this world,
 and make us long for a better. 
 
 2. Still, 
 when there was famine in Canaan, there was 
 corn in Egypt. Thus Providence orders it, 
 that one place should be a succour and supply 
 to another; for we are all brethren. The 
 Egyptians, the seed of accursed Ham, have
 plenty, when God's blessed Israel want: 
 thus God, in dispensing common favours, 
 often crosses hands. Yet observe, The plenty 
 Egypt now had was owing, under God, to 
 Joseph's prudence and care: if his brethren 
 had not sold him into Egypt, but respected 
 him according to his merits, who knows but 
 he might have done the same thing for 
 Jacob's family which now he had done for 
 Pharaoh, and the Egyptians might then have 
 come to them to buy corn? but those who 
 drive away from among them wise and good 
 men know not what they do. 
 
 3. <I>Jacob saw 
 that there was corn in Egypt;</I> he saw the 
 corn that his neighbours had bought there 
 and brought home. It is a spur to exertion 
 to see where supplies are to be had, and to 
 see others supplied. Shall others get food 
 for their souls, and shall we starve while it is 
 to be had? 
 
 4. He reproved his sons for 
 delaying to provide corn for their families. 
 <I>Why do you look one upon another?</I> Note, 
 When we are in trouble and want, it is folly 
 for us to stand looking upon one another, 
 that is, to stand desponding and despairing, 
 as if there were no hope, no help,--to stand 
 disputing either which shall have the honour 
 of going first or which shall have the safety 
 of coming last,--to stand deliberating and 
 debating what we shall do, and doing nothing,--to 
 stand dreaming under a spirit of 
 slumber, as if we had nothing to do, and to 
 stand delaying, as if we had time at command. 
 Let it never be said, "We left that 
 to be done to-morrow which we could as 
 well have done to-day." 
 
 5. He quickened 
 them to go to Egypt: <I>Get you down thither.</I> 
 Masters of families must not only pray for 
 daily bread for their families, and food convenient, 
 
 <A NAME="Page233"> </A>

 but must lay out themselves with 
 care and industry to provide it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their obedience to these orders,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 They <I>went down to buy corn;</I> they did not 
 send their servants, but very prudently went 
 themselves, to lay out their own money. 
 Let none think themselves too great nor too 
 good to take pains. Masters of families 
 should see with their own eyes, and take 
 heed of leaving too much to servants. Only 
 Benjamin went not with them, for he was 
 his father's darling. To Egypt they came, 
 among others, and, having a considerable 
 cargo of corn to buy, they were brought before 
 Joseph himself, who probably expected 
 they would come; and, according to the 
 laws of courtesy, <I>they bowed down themselves 
 before him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Now their empty sheaves 
 did obeisance to his full one. Compare this 
 with

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and 
 he knew them, but made himself 
 strange unto them, and spake roughly 
 unto them; and he said unto them, 
 Whence come ye? And they said, 
 From the land of Canaan to buy food.
 &nbsp; 8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but 
 they knew not him.
 &nbsp; 9 And Joseph 
 remembered the dreams which he 
 dreamed of them, and said unto them, 
 Ye <I>are</I> spies; to see the nakedness of 
 the land ye are come.
 &nbsp; 10 And they 
 said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to 
 buy food are thy servants come.
 &nbsp; 11 We <I>are</I> all one man's sons; we <I>are</I> 
 true <I>men,</I> thy servants are no spies.
 &nbsp; 12 And he said unto them, Nay, but 
 to see the nakedness of the land ye 
 are come.
 &nbsp; 13 And they said, Thy 
 servants <I>are</I> twelve brethren, the sons
 of one man in the land of Canaan; 
 and, behold, the youngest <I>is</I> this day 
 with our father, and one <I>is</I> not.
 &nbsp; 14 And Joseph said unto them, That <I>is 
 it</I> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye 
 <I>are</I> spies:
 &nbsp; 15 Hereby ye shall be 
 proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye 
 shall not go forth hence, except your 
 youngest brother come hither.
 &nbsp; 16 Send one of you, and let him fetch 
 your brother, and ye shall be kept in 
 prison, that your words may be proved, 
 whether <I>there be any</I> truth in you: or 
 else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye 
 <I>are</I> spies.
 &nbsp; 17 And he put them all 
 together into ward three days.
 &nbsp; 18 And Joseph said unto them the third 
 day, This do, and live; <I>for</I> I fear 
 God:
 &nbsp; 19 If ye <I>be</I> true <I>men,</I> let one of 
 your brethren be bound in the house 
 of your prison: go ye, carry corn for 
 the famine of your houses:
 &nbsp; 20 But 
 bring your youngest brother unto me; 
 so shall your words be verified, and 
 ye shall not die. And they did so.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may well wonder that Joseph, during 
 the twenty years that he had now been in 
 Egypt, especially during the last seven years 
 that he had been in power there, never sent 
 to his father to acquaint him with his circumstances; 
 nay, it is strange that he who 
 so often <I>went throughout all the land of 
 Egypt</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:45,46"><I>ch.</I> xli. 45, 46</A>)
 never made an excursion 
 to Canaan, to visit his aged father, 
 when he was in the borders of Egypt, that 
 lay next to Canaan. Perhaps it would not 
 have been above three or four days' journey 
 for him in his chariot. It is a probable conjecture 
 that his whole management of himself 
 in this affair was by special direction 
 from Heaven, that the purpose of God concerning 
 Jacob and his family might be 
 accomplished. When Joseph's brethren 
 came, he knew them by many a satisfactory 
 token, but they knew not him, little thinking 
 to find him there,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 He <I>remembered the 
 dreams</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 but they had forgotten them. 
 The laying up of God's oracles in our hearts 
 will be of excellent use to us in all our conduct. 
 Joseph had an eye to his dreams, 
 which he knew to be divine, in his carriage 
 towards his brethren, and aimed at the accomplishment 
 of them and the bringing of 
 his brethren to repentance for their former 
 sins; and both these points were gained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He showed himself very rigorous and 
 harsh with them. The very manner of his 
 speaking, considering the post he was in, was 
 enough to frighten them; for <I>he spoke 
 roughly to them,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 He charged them 
 with bad designs against the government
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 treated them as dangerous persons,
 saying, <I>You are spies,</I> and protesting <I>by the 
 life of Pharaoh</I> that they were so,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 Some make this an oath, others make it no 
 more than a vehement asseveration, like that, 
 <I>as thy soul liveth;</I> however it was more than 
 yea, yea, and nay, nay, and therefore came of 
 evil. Note, Bad words are soon learned by 
 converse with those that use them, but not 
 so soon unlearned. Joseph, by being much 
 at court, got the courtier's oath, <I>By the life 
 of Pharaoh,</I> perhaps designing hereby to 
 confirm his brethren in their belief that he 
 was an Egyptian, and not an Israelite. They 
 knew this was not the language of a son of 
 Abraham. When Peter would prove himself 
 no disciple of Christ, he cursed and swore. 
 Now why was Joseph thus hard upon his 
 brethren? We may be sure it was not from 
 a spirit of revenge, that he might now 
 trample upon those who had formerly 
 trampled upon him; he was not a man of 
 
 <A NAME="Page234"> </A>

 that temper. But, 
 
 1. It was to enrich his 
 own dreams, and complete the accomplishment 
 of them. 
 
 2. It was to bring them to 
 repentance. 
 
 3. It was to get out of them 
 an account of the state of their family, which 
 he longed to know: they would have discovered 
 him if he had asked as a friend, 
 therefore he asks as a judge. Not seeing his 
 brother Benjamin with them, perhaps he 
 began to suspect that they had made away 
 with him too, and therefore gives them occasion 
 to speak of their father and brother. 
 Note, God in his providence sometimes 
 seems harsh with those he loves, and speaks 
 roughly to those for whom yet he has great 
 mercy in store.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They, hereupon, were very submissive. 
 They spoke to him with all the respect imaginable: 
 <I>Nay, my lord</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)--a
 great change since they said, <I>Behold, this dreamer comes.</I> 
 They very modestly deny the charge: <I>We 
 are no spies.</I> They tell him their business, 
 that they came to buy food, a justifiable 
 errand, and the same that many strangers 
 came to Egypt upon at this time. They 
 undertake to give a particular account of 
 themselves and their family
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 and this 
 was what they wanted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He clapped them all up in prison for 
 three days,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 Thus God deals with the 
 souls he designs for special comfort and 
 honour; he first humbles them, and terrifies 
 them, and brings them under a spirit of 
 bondage, and then binds up their wounds by 
 the Spirit of adoption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He concluded with them, at last, that 
 one of them should be left as a hostage, and 
 the rest should go home and fetch Benjamin. 
 It was a very encouraging word he said to 
 them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 <I>I fear God;</I> as if he had said, 
 "You may assure yourselves I will do you 
 no wrong; I dare not, for I know that, high 
 as I am, there is one higher than I." Note, 
 With those that fear God we have reason to 
 expect fair dealing. The fear of God will be 
 a check upon those that are in power, to restrain 
 them from abusing their power to oppression 
 and tyranny. Those that have no 
 one else to stand in awe of ought to stand in 
 awe of their own consciences. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15">Neh. v. 15</A>,
 <I>So did not I, because of the fear of God.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And they said one to another, 
 We <I>are</I> verily guilty concerning our 
 brother, in that we saw the anguish 
 of his soul, when he besought us, and 
 we would not hear; therefore is this
 distress come upon us.
 &nbsp; 22 And Reuben 
 answered them, saying, Spake I 
 not unto you, saying, Do not sin 
 against the child; and ye would not 
 hear? therefore, behold, also his blood 
 is required.
 &nbsp; 23 And they knew not 
 that Joseph understood <I>them;</I> for he
 spake unto them by an interpreter.
 &nbsp; 24 And he turned himself about from 
 them, and wept; and returned to them 
 again, and communed with them, and 
 took from them Simeon, and bound 
 him before their eyes.
 &nbsp; 25 Then Joseph 
 commanded to fill their sacks 
 with corn, and to restore every man's 
 money into his sack, and to give them
 provision for the way: and thus did 
 he unto them.
 &nbsp; 26 And they laded 
 their asses with the corn, and departed
 thence.
 &nbsp; 27 And as one of them opened 
 his sack to give his ass provender in 
 the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, 
 it <I>was</I> in his sack's mouth.
 &nbsp; 28 And he said unto his brethren, My 
 money is restored; and, lo, <I>it is</I> even 
 in my sack: and their heart failed 
 <I>them,</I> and they were afraid, saying one 
 to another, What <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> God 
 hath done unto us?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The penitent reflection Joseph's
 brethren made upon the wrong they had formerly
 done to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 They talked the 
 matter over in the Hebrew tongue, not suspecting 
 that Joseph, whom they took for a 
 native of Egypt, understood them, much less 
 that he was the person they spoke of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They remembered with regret the barbarous 
 cruelty wherewith they persecuted 
 him: <I>We are verily guilty concerning our 
 brother.</I> We do not read that they said this 
 during their three days' imprisonment; but 
 now, when the matter had come to some
 issue and they saw themselves still embarrassed, 
 now they began to relent. Perhaps 
 Joseph's mention of <I>the fear of God</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)
 put them upon consideration and extorted 
 this reflection. Now see here, 
 
 (1.) The office 
 of conscience; it is a remembrancer, to bring 
 to mind things long since said and done, to 
 show us wherein we have erred, though it 
 was long ago, as the reflection here mentioned 
 was above twenty years after the sin 
 was committed. As time will not wear out 
 the guilt of sin, so it will not blot out the 
 records of conscience; when the guilt of this 
 sin of Joseph's brethren was fresh they made 
 light of it, and sat down to eat bread; but 
 now, long afterwards, their consciences reminded 
 them of it. 
 
 (2.) The benefit of 
 affliction; they often prove the happy and 
 effectual means of awakening conscience, and 
 bringing sin to our remembrance,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>.
 
 (3.) The evil of guilt concerning our 
 brethren; of all their sins, it was this that 
 conscience now reproached them for. Whenever 
 we think we have wrong done us, we 
 ought to remember the wrong we have done 
 to others,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:21,22">Eccl. vii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Reuben alone remembered, with comfort, 
 that he had been an advocate for his 
 
 <A NAME="Page235"> </A>

 brother, and had done what he could to prevent 
 the mischief they did him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 <I>Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin 
 against the child?</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) It is an aggravation 
 of any sin that it was committed 
 against admonitions. 
 
 (2.) When we come 
 to share with others in their calamities, it 
 will be a comfort to us if we have the testimony 
 of our consciences for us that we 
 did not share with them in their iniquities, 
 but, in our places, witnessed against them. 
 This shall be our rejoicing in the day of evil, 
 and shall take out the sting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joseph's tenderness towards them 
 upon this occasion. He retired from them 
 to weep,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 Though his reason directed 
 that he should still carry himself as a stranger 
 to them, because they were not as yet humbled 
 enough, yet natural affection could not 
 but work, for he was a man of a tender 
 spirit. This represents the tender mercies of 
 our God towards repenting sinners. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>,
 <I>Since I spoke against him I do 
 earnestly remember him still.</I> See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judg. x. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The imprisonment of Simeon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 He chose him for the hostage probably because 
 he remembered him to have been his 
 most bitter enemy, or because he observed 
 him now to be least humbled and concerned; 
 he bound him <I>before their eyes</I> to affect them 
 all; or perhaps it is intimated that, though 
 he bound him with some severity before 
 them, yet afterwards, when they were gone, 
 he took off his bonds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The dismission of the rest of them. 
 They came for corn, and corn they had; and 
 not only so, but every man had his money 
 restored in his sack's mouth. Thus Christ, 
 our Joseph, gives out supplies without money 
 and without price. Therefore the poor are 
 invited to buy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17,18">Rev. iii. 17, 18</A>.
 This put 
 them into great consternation
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 <I>Their 
 heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying 
 one to another, What is this that God hath 
 done to us?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was really a merciful event; for I 
 hope they had no wrong done to them when 
 they had their money given them back, but 
 a kindness; yet they were thus terrified by 
 it. Note, 
 
 (1.) Guilty consciences are apt to 
 take good providences in a bad sense, and to 
 put wrong constructions even upon those 
 things that make for them. They flee when 
 none pursues. 
 
 (2.) Wealth sometimes brings 
 as much care along with it as want does, and 
 more too. If they had been robbed of their 
 money, they could not have been worse 
 frightened than they were now when they 
 found their money in their sacks. Thus he 
 whose ground brought forth plentifully said, 
 <I>What shall I do?</I>

 2. Yet in their circumstances it was very 
 amazing. They knew that the Egyptians 
 abhorred a Hebrew
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 32</A>),
 and therefore, 
 since they could not expect to receive 
 any kindness from them, they concluded 
 that this was done with a design to pick a 
 quarrel with them, and the rather because 
 the man, the lord of the land, had charged 
 them as spies. Their own consciences also 
 were awake, and their sins set in order before 
 them; and this put them into confusion. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) When men's spirits are 
 sinking every thing helps to sink them. 
 
 (2.) When the events of Providence concerning 
 us are surprising it is good to enquire what 
 it is that God has done and is doing with us, 
 and to consider the operation of his hands.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And they came unto Jacob their 
 father unto the land of Canaan, and 
 told him all that befell unto them; 
 saying,
 &nbsp; 30 The man, <I>who is</I> the lord 
 of the land, spake roughly to us, and 
 took us for spies of the country.
 &nbsp; 31 And we said unto him, We <I>are</I> true 
 <I>men;</I> we are no spies:
 &nbsp; 32 We <I>be</I> 
 twelve brethren, sons of our father; 
 one <I>is</I> not, and the youngest <I>is</I> this 
 day with our father in the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 33 And the man, the lord of 
 the country, said unto us, Hereby
 shall I know that ye <I>are</I> true <I>men;</I> 
 leave one of your brethren <I>here</I> with 
 me, and take <I>food for</I> the famine of 
 your households, and be gone:
 &nbsp; 34 And bring your youngest brother unto 
 me: then shall I know that ye <I>are</I> no 
 spies, but <I>that</I> ye <I>are</I> true <I>men: so</I> 
 will I deliver you your brother, and 
 ye shall traffic in the land.
 &nbsp; 35 And 
 it came to pass as they emptied their 
 sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle 
 of money <I>was</I> in his sack: and when
 <I>both</I> they and their father saw the 
 bundles of money, they were afraid.
 &nbsp; 36 And Jacob their father said unto 
 them, Me have ye bereaved <I>of my 
 children:</I> Joseph <I>is</I> not, and Simeon 
 <I>is</I> not, and ye will take Benjamin 
 <I>away:</I> all these things are against me.
 &nbsp; 37 And Reuben spake unto his father, 
 saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring 
 him not to thee: deliver him into my 
 hand, and I will bring him to thee 
 again.
 &nbsp; 38 And he said, My son shall 
 not go down with you; for his brother 
 is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief 
 befal him by the way in the 
 which ye go, then shall ye bring down 
 my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

 Here is, 
 
 1. The report which Jacob's sons 
 made to their father of the great distress 
 they had been in in Egypt; how they had 
 been suspected, and threatened, and obliged 
 
 <A NAME="Page236"> </A>

 to leave Simeon a prisoner there, till they 
 should bring Benjamin with them thither. 
 Who would have thought of this when they 
 left home? When we go abroad we should 
 consider how many sad accidents, that we 
 little think of, may befal us before we return 
 home. <I>We know not what a day may bring 
 forth;</I> we ought therefore to be always ready 
 for the worst. 
 
 2. The deep impression this 
 made upon the good man. The very bundles 
 of money which Joseph returned, in kindness 
 to his father, frightened him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 for he 
 concluded it was done with some mischievous 
 design, or perhaps suspected his own sons 
 to have committed some offence, and so to 
 have run themselves into a <I>pr&aelig;munire--a 
 penalty,</I> which is intimated in what he says
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):
 <I>Me have you bereaved.</I> He seems to 
 lay the fault upon them; knowing their characters, 
 he feared they had provoked the 
 Egyptians, and perhaps forcibly, or fraudulently, 
 brought home their money. Jacob is 
 here much out of temper. 
 
 (1.) He has very 
 melancholy apprehensions concerning the 
 present state of his family: <I>Joseph is not, 
 and Simeon is not;</I> whereas Joseph was in 
 honour and Simeon in the way to it. Note, 
 We often perplex ourselves with our own 
 mistakes, even in matters of fact. True 
 griefs may arise from false intelligence and 
 suppositions,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:31">2 Sam. xiii. 31</A>.
 Jacob gives 
 up Joseph for gone, and Simeon and Benjamin 
 as being in danger; and he concludes, 
 <I>All these things are against me.</I> It proved 
 otherwise, that all these were for him, were 
 working together for his good and the good 
 of his family: yet here he thinks them all 
 against him. Note, Through our ignorance 
 and mistake, and the weakness of our faith, 
 we often apprehend that to be against us 
 which is really for us. We are afflicted in 
 body, estate, name, and relations; and we 
 think all these things are against us, whereas 
 these are really working for us the weight of 
 glory. 
 
 (2.) He is at present resolved that 
 Benjamin shall not go down. Reuben will 
 undertake to bring him back in safety
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),
 not so much as putting in, <I>If the Lord will,</I> 
 nor expecting the common disasters of travellers; 
 but he foolishly bids Jacob slay his 
 two sons (which, it is likely, he was very 
 proud of) if he brought him not back; as if 
 the death of two grandsons could satisfy 
 Jacob for the death of a son. No, Jacob's 
 present thoughts are, <I>My son shall not go 
 down with you.</I> He plainly intimates a distrust 
 of them, remembering that he never 
 saw Joseph since he had been with them; 
 therefore, "Benjamin shall not go with you, 
 by the way in which you go, for <I>you will bring 
 down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</I>" 
 Note, It is bad with a family when children 
 conduct themselves so ill that their parents 
 know not how to trust them.</P>
