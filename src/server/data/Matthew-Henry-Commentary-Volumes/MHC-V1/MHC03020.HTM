 The laws which before were made are in this chapter repeated and 
 penalties annexed to them, that those who would not be deterred from 
 sin by the fear of God might be deterred from it by the fear of 
 punishment. If we will not avoid such and such practices because the 
 law has made them sin (and it is most acceptable when we go on that
 principle of religion), surely we shall avoid them when the law has 
 made them death, from a principle of self-preservation. In this chapter 
 we have, 

 I. Many particular crimes that are made capital. I. Giving their
 children to Moloch,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever
 <I>he be</I> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that
 sojourn in Israel, that giveth <I>any</I> of his seed unto Molech; he
 shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone
 him with stones.
 &nbsp; 3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
 from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
 Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
 &nbsp; 4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes
 from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill
 him not:
 &nbsp; 5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
 family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
 him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
 &nbsp; 6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar
 spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will
 even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from
 among his people.
 &nbsp; 7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 which sanctify you.
 &nbsp; 9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
 surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his
 blood <I>shall be</I> upon him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses is here directed to say that again to the children of Israel 
 which he had in effect said before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We are sure it was no vain repetition, but very necessary, that they 
 might <I>give the more earnest heed to the things that were spoken,</I> 
 and might believe them to be of great consequence, being so often 
 inculcated. <I>God speaketh once, yea, twice,</I> and what he orders to 
 be said again we must be willing to hear again, because <I>for us it is 
 safe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Three sins are in these verses threatened with death:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Parents abusing their children, by sacrificing them to Moloch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 There is the grossest absurdity that can be in all the rites of
 idolatry, and they are all a great reproach to men's reason; but none 
 trampled upon all the honours of human nature as this did, the burning 
 of children in the fire to the honour of a dunghill-god. It was a plain 
 evidence that their gods were devils, who desired and delighted in the 
 misery and ruin of mankind, and that the worshippers were worse than 
 the beasts that perish, perfectly stripped, not only of reason, but of 
 natural affection. Abraham's offering Isaac could not give countenance, 
 much less could it give rise to this barbarous practice, since, though 
 that was commanded, it was immediately countermanded.  Yet such was the 
 power of the god of this world over the children of disobedience that 
 this monstrous piece of inhumanity was generally practised; and even 
 the Israelites were in danger of being drawn into it, which made it 
 necessary that this severe law should be made against it. It was not 
 enough to tell them they might spare their children (the fruit of their 
 body should never be accepted for the sin of their soul), but they must 
 be told, 

 (1.) That the criminal himself should be put to death as a murderer:
 <I>The people of the land shall stone him with stones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 which was looked upon as the worst of capital punishments among the
 Jews. If the children were sacrificed to the malice of the devil, the 
 parents must be sacrificed to the justice of God. And, if either the 
 fact could not be proved or the magistrates did not do their duty, God 
 would take the work into his own hands: <I>I will cut him off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, Those that escape punishment from men, yet shall not escape the
 righteous judgments of God; so wretchedly do those deceive themselves 
 that promise themselves impunity in sin. How can those escape against 
 whom God sets his face, that is, whom he frowns upon, meets as an 
 enemy, and fights against? The heinousness of the crime is here set 
 forth to justify the doom: it <I>defiles the sanctuary,</I> and 
 <I>profanes the holy name</I> of God, for the honour of both which he 
 is jealous. Observe, The malignity of the sin is laid upon that in it 
 which was peculiar to Israel. When the Gentiles sacrificed their 
 children they were guilty of murder and idolatry; but, if the 
 Israelites did it, they incurred the additional guilt of defiling the 
 sanctuary (which they attended upon even when they lay under this 
 guilt, as if there might be an agreement between the temple of God and 
 idols), and of <I>profaning the holy name of God,</I> by which they 
 were called, as if he allowed his worshippers to do such things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:23">Rom. ii. 23, 24</A>.

 (2.) That all his aiders and abetters should be cut off likewise by the
 righteous hand of God. If his neighbours concealed him, and would not 
 come in as witnesses against him,--if the magistrates connived at him, 
 and would not pass sentence upon him, rather pitying his folly than 
 hating his impiety,--God himself would reckon with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Misprision of idolatry is a crime cognizable in the court of heaven, 
 and which shall not go unpunished: <I>I will set my face against that 
 man</I> (that magistrate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">Jer. v. 1</A>)

 <I>and against his family.</I> Note,

 [1.] The wickedness of the master of a family often brings ruin upon a
 family; and he that should be the house-keeper proves the 
 house-breaker. 

 [2.] If magistrates will not do justice upon offenders, God will do
 justice upon them, because there is danger that many will <I>go a 
 whoring after those</I> who do but countenance sin by winking at it. 
 And, if the sins of leaders be leading sins, it is fit that their 
 punishments should be exemplary punishments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Children's abusing their parents, by cursing them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If children should speak ill of their parents, or wish ill to them, or 
 carry it scornfully or spitefully towards them, it was an iniquity to 
 be punished by the judges, who were employed as conservators both of 
 God's honour and of the public peace, which were both attacked by this 
 unnatural insolence. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>,

 <I>The eye that mocks at his father the ravens of the valley shall pick
 out,</I> which intimates that such wicked children were in a fair way 
 to be not only hanged, but hanged in chains. This law of Moses Christ 
 quotes and confirms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:4">Matt. xv. 4</A>),

 for it is as direct a breach of the fifth commandment as wilful murder
 is of the sixth. The same law which requires parents to be tender of 
 their children requires children to be respectful to their parents. He 
 that despitefully uses his parents, the instruments of his being, flies 
 in the face of God himself, the author of his being, who will not see 
 the paternal dignity and authority insulted and trampled upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Persons abusing themselves by consulting such as have <I>familiar 
 spirits,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 By this, as much as any thing, a man diminishes, disparages, and 
 deceives himself, and so abuses himself. What greater madness can there 
 be than for a man to go to a liar for information, and to an enemy for 
 advice? Those do so who turn after those that deal in the black art, 
 and know the depths of Satan. This is spiritual adultery as much as 
 idolatry is, giving that honour to the devil which is due to God only; 
 and the jealous God will give a bill of divorce to those that thus 
 <I>go a whoring from him,</I> and will <I>cut them off,</I> they having 
 first cut themselves off from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the midst of these particular laws comes in that general charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>,
 
 where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duties required; and they are two:--

 (1.) That in our principles, affections, and aims, we be holy:
 <I>Sanctify yourselves and be you holy.</I> We must cleanse ourselves 
 from all the pollutions of sin, consecrate ourselves to the service and 
 honour of God, and conform ourselves in every thing to his holy will 
 and image: this is to <I>sanctify ourselves.</I> 

 (2.) That in all our actions, and in the whole course of our
 conversation, we be obedient to the laws of God: <I>You shall keep my 
 statutes.</I> By this only can we make it to appear that we have 
 sanctified ourselves and are holy, even by our keeping God's 
 commandments; <I>the tree is known by its fruit.</I> Nor can we <I>keep 
 God's statutes,</I> as we ought, unless we first sanctify ourselves, 
 and be holy. Make the tree good, and the fruit will be good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reasons to enforce these duties. 

 (1.) "<I>I am the Lord your God;</I> therefore be holy, that you may
 resemble him whose people you are, and may be pleasing to him. Holiness 
 becomes his house and household." 

 (2.) <I>I am the Lord who sanctifieth you.</I> God sanctified them by
 peculiar privileges, laws, and favours, which distinguished them from 
 all other nations, and dignified them as a people set apart for God. He 
 gave them his word and ordinances to be means of their sanctification, 
 and his good Spirit to instruct them; therefore they must be holy, else 
 they received the grace of God herein in vain. Note, 

 [1.] God's people are, and must be, persons of distinction. God has
 distinguished them by his holy covenant, and therefore they ought to 
 distinguish themselves by their holy conversation. 

 [2.] God's sanctifying us is a good reason why we should sanctify
 ourselves, that we may comply with the designs of his grace, and not 
 walk contrary to them. If it be the Lord that sanctifies us, we may 
 hope the work shall be done, though it be difficult: the manner of 
 expression is like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5">2 Cor. v. 5</A>,

 <I>He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God.</I> And his
 grace is so far from superseding our care and endeavour that it most 
 strongly engages and encourages them. <I>Work out your salvation, for 
 it is God that worketh in you.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the man that committeth adultery with <I>another</I> man's
 wife, <I>even he</I> that committeth adultery with his neighbour's
 wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to
 death.
 &nbsp; 11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
 his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
 death; their blood <I>shall be</I> upon them.
 &nbsp; 12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them
 shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
 blood <I>shall be</I> upon them.
 &nbsp; 13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman,
 both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
 put to death; their blood <I>shall be</I> upon them.
 &nbsp; 14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it <I>is</I> wickedness:
 they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no
 wickedness among you.
 &nbsp; 15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
 death: and ye shall slay the beast.
 &nbsp; 16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down
 thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall
 surely be put to death; their blood <I>shall be</I> upon them.
 &nbsp; 17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter,
 or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
 nakedness; it <I>is</I> a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
 the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
 nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
 &nbsp; 18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
 shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and
 she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them
 shall be cut off from among their people.
 &nbsp; 19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
 sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
 kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
 &nbsp; 20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
 uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they
 shall die childless.
 &nbsp; 21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it <I>is</I> an
 unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they
 shall be childless.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Sins against the seventh commandment are here ordered to be severely 
 punished. These are sins which, of all others, fools are most apt to 
 make a mock at; but God would teach those the heinousness of the guilt 
 by the extremity of the punishment that would not otherwise be taught 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Lying with another man's wife was made a capital crime. The 
 adulterer and the adulteress that had joined in the sin must fall alike 
 under the sentence: they shall both be <I>put to death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Long before this, even in Job's time, this was reputed a <I>heinous 
 crime</I> and an <I>iniquity to be punished by the judges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:11">Job xxxi. 11</A>.

 It is a presumptuous contempt of an ordinance of God, and a violation
 of his covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:17">Prov. ii. 17</A>.

 It is an irreparable wrong to the injured husband, and debauches the
 mind and conscience of both the offenders as much as any thing. It is a 
 sin which headstrong and unbridled lusts hurry men violently to, and 
 therefore it needs such a powerful restraint as this. It is a sin which 
 defiles a land and brings down God's judgments upon it, which disquiets 
 families, and tends to the ruin of all virtue and religion, and 
 therefore is fit to be animadverted upon by the conservators of the 
 public peace: but see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:3-11">John viii. 3-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Incestuous connections, whether by marriage or not. 

 1. Some of them were to be punished with death, as a man's <I>lying
 with his father's wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Reuben would have been put to death for his crime 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:22">Gen. xxxv. 22</A>)

 if this law had been then made. It was the sin of the incestuous
 Corinthian, for which he was to be <I>delivered unto Satan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1,5">1 Cor. v. 1, 5</A>.

 A man's debauching his daughter-in-law, or his mother-in-law, or his
 sister, was likewise to be punished with death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:12,14,17"><I>v.</I> 12, 14, 17</A>.

 2.  Others of them God would punish with the curse of barrenness, as a
 man's defiling his aunt, or his brother's wife 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>):

 <I>They shall die childless.</I> Those that keep not within the divine 
 rules of marriage forfeit the blessings of marriage: <I>They shall 
 commit whoredom, and shall not increase,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:10">Hos. iv. 10</A>.

 Nay it is said, <I>They shall bear their iniquity,</I> that is, though
 they be not immediately cut off by the hand either of God or man for 
 this sin, yet the guilt of it shall lie upon them, to be reckoned for 
 another day, and not be purged with sacrifice or offering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The unnatural lusts of sodomy and bestiality (sins not to be 
 mentioned without horror) were to be punished with death, as they are 
 at this day by our law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:13,15,16"><I>v.</I> 13, 15, 16</A>.

 Even the beast that was thus abused was to be killed with the sinner, 
 who was thereby openly put to the greater shame: and the villany was 
 thus represented as in the highest degree execrable and abominable, all 
 occasions of the remembrance or mention of it being to be taken away. 
 Even the unseasonable use of the marriage, if presumptuous, and in 
 contempt of the law, would expose the offenders to the just judgment of 
 God: they <I>shall be cut off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 For this is the will of God, that <I>every man should possess his 
 vessel</I> (and the wife is called the weaker vessel) <I>in 
 sanctification and honour,</I> as becomes saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my
 judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to
 dwell therein, spue you not out.
 &nbsp; 23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
 cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
 therefore I abhorred them.
 &nbsp; 24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
 will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
 milk and honey: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, which have separated
 you from <I>other</I> people.
 &nbsp; 25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
 unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
 make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner
 of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have
 separated from you as unclean.
 &nbsp; 26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>am</I> holy, and
 have severed you from <I>other</I> people, that ye should be mine.
 &nbsp; 27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is
 a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
 with stones: their blood <I>shall be</I> upon them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The last verse is a particular law, which comes in after the general 
 conclusion, as if omitted in its proper place: it is for the putting of 
 those to death that dealt with familiar spirits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It would be an affront to God and to his lively oracles, a scandal to 
 the country, and a temptation to ignorant bad people, to consult them, 
 if such were known and suffered to live among them. Those that are in 
 league with the devil have in effect made a covenant with death and an 
 agreement with hell, and so shall their doom be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The rest of these verses repeat and inculcate what had been said 
 before; for to that unthinking forgetful people it was requisite that 
 there should be line upon line, and that general rules, with their 
 reasons, should be frequently insisted on, for the enforcement of 
 particular laws, and making them more effectual. Three things we are 
 here reminded of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their dignity. 

 1. They had the <I>Lord for their God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They were his, his care, his choice, his treasure, his jewels, his 
 kingdom of priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>That you should be mine.</I> Happy the people, and truly great, that 
 are in such a case.

 2. Their God was a holy God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 infinitely advanced above all others. His holiness is his glory, and it 
 was their honour to be related to him, while their neighbours were the 
 infamous worshippers of impure and filthy spirits.

 3. The great God had separated them from other people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Other nations were the common; they were the enclosure, beautified and 
 enriched with peculiar privileges, and designed for peculiar honours; 
 let them therefore value themselves accordingly, preserve their honour, 
 and not lay it in the dust, by walking in the way of the heathen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their duty; this is inferred from their dignity. God had done more 
 for them than for others, and therefore expected more from them than 
 from others. And what is it that the Lord their God requires, in 
 consideration of the great things done and designed? 

 1. <I>You shall keep all my statutes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 and there was all the reason in the world that they should, for the 
 statutes were their honour, and obedience to them would be their 
 lasting comfort.

 2. <I>You shall not walk in the manners of nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Being separated from them, they must not associate with them, nor learn 
 their ways. The manners of the nations were bad enough in them, but 
 would be much worse in God's people.

 3. You shall <I>put a difference between clean and unclean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 This is holiness, to discern between things that differ, not to live at 
 large, as if we might say and do any thing, but to speak and act with 
 caution. 

 4. <I>You shall not make your souls abominable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Our constant care must be to preserve the honour, by preserving the 
 purity, of our own souls, and never to do any thing to make them 
 abominable to God and to our own consciences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their danger. 

 1. They were going into an infected place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>You shall inherit their land,</I> a land <I>flowing with milk and 
 honey,</I> which they would have the comfort of if they kept their 
 integrity; but, withal, it was a land full of idols, idolatries, and 
 superstitious usages, which they would be apt to fall in love with, 
 having brought from Egypt with them a strange disposition to take that 
 infection.

 2.  If they took the infection, it would be of pernicious consequence
 to them.  The Canaanites were to be expelled for these very sins: 
 <I>They committed all these things, therefore I abhorred them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:23"><I>v.</I>  23</A>.

 See what an evil thing sin is; it provokes God to abhor his own 
 creatures, whereas otherwise he delights in the work of his hands.  
 And, if the Israelites trod in the steps of their impiety, they must 
 expect that the land would spue them out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 as he had told them before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 28</A>.

 If God spared not the natural branches, but broke them off, neither
 would he spare those who were grafted in, if they degenerated. Thus the 
 rejection of the Jews stands for a warning to all Christian churches to 
 take heed lest the kingdom of God be taken from them. Those that sin 
 like others must expect to smart like them; and their profession of 
 relation to God will be no security to them.</P>
