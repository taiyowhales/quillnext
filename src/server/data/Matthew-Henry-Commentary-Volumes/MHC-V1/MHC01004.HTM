 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have both the world and the church in a family,
 in a little family, in Adam's family, and a specimen given of the
 character and state of both in after-ages, nay, in all ages, to the
 end of time. As all mankind were represented in Adam, so that
 great distinction of mankind into saints and sinners, godly and
 wicked, the children of God and the children of the wicked one,
 was here represented in Cain and Abel, and an early instance is
 given of the enmity which was lately put between the seed of
 the woman and the seed of the serpent. We have here,

 I. The
 birth, names, and callings, of Cain and Abel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; 
 and she conceived, and bare 
 Cain, and said, I have gotten a man 
 from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 And she again 
 bare his brother Abel. And Abel was 
 a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a 
 tiller of the ground.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Adam and Eve had many sons and daughters, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>.
 But Cain and Abel seem to 
 have been the two eldest. Some think they 
 were twins, and, as Esau and Jacob, the 
 elder hated and the younger loved. Though 
 God had cast our first parents out of paradise, 
 he did not write them childless; but, to show 
 that he had other blessings in store for them, 
 he preserved to them the benefit of that first 
 blessing of increase. Though they were 
 sinners, nay, though they felt the humiliation 
 and sorrow of penitents, they did not write 
 themselves comfortless, having the promise 
 of a Saviour to support themselves with. We 
 have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The names of their two sons. 
 
 1. <I>Cain</I> 
 signifies <I>possession;</I> for Eve, when she bore 
 him, said with joy, and thankfulness, and 
 great expectation, <I>I have gotten a man from 
 the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>. Observe, Children are God's 
 gifts, and he must be acknowledged in the 
 building up of our families. It doubles and 
 sanctifies our comfort in them when we see 
 them coming to us from the hand of God, 
 who will not forsake the works and gifts of 
 his own hand. Though Eve bore him with 
 the sorrows that were the consequence of sin, 
 yet she did not lose the sense of the mercy in 
 her pains. Comforts, though alloyed, are 
 more than we deserve; and therefore our 
 complaints must not drown our thanksgivings. 
 Many suppose that Eve had a conceit 
 that this son was the promised seed, and 
 that therefore she thus triumphed in him, as 
 her words may be read, <I>I have gotten a man,
 the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>, God-man. If so, she was wretchedly 
 mistaken, as Samuel, when he said, 
 <I>Surely the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>'s <I>anointed is before me,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:6">1 Sam. xvi. 6</A>.
 When children are born, who 
 can foresee what they will prove? He that 
 was thought to be <I>a man, the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>, or at 
 least a man from the L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>, and for his 
 service as priest of the family, became an 
 enemy to the L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>. The less we expect 
 from creatures, the more tolerable will disappointments
 be.

 2. <I>Abel</I> signifies <I>vanity.</I> 
 When she thought she had obtained the promised 
 seed in Cain, she was so taken up with 
 that possession that another son was as vanity 
 to her. To those who have an interest in 
 Christ, and make him their all, other things 
 are as nothing at all. It intimates likewise 
 that the longer we live in this world the more 
 we may see of the vanity of it. What, at 
 first, we are fond of, as a possession, afterwards 
 we see cause to be dead to, as a trifle. 
 The name given to this son is put upon the 
 whole race, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:5">Ps. xxxix. 5</A>.
 Every man is at 
 his best estate <I>Abel--vanity.</I> Let us labour 
 to see both ourselves and others so. <I>Childhood 
 and youth are vanity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The employments of Cain and Abel. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. They both had a calling. 
 Though they were heirs apparent to the 
 world, their birth noble and their possessions 
 large, yet they were not brought up in 
 idleness. God gave their father a calling, 
 even in innocency, and he gave them one. 
 Note, It is the will of God that we should 
 every one of us have something to do in this 
 world. Parents ought to bring up their 
 children to business. "Give them a Bible 
 and a calling (said good Mr. Dod), and God 
 be with them." 
 
 2. Their employments were 
 different, that they might trade and exchange 
 with one another, as there was occasion. 
 The members of the body politic have need 
 one of another, and mutual love is helped by 
 mutual commerce. 
 
 3. Their employments 
 belonged to the husbandman's calling, their 
 father's profession--a needful calling, for <I>the 
 king himself is served of the field,</I> but a 
 laborious calling, which required constant 
 care and attendance. It is now looked 
 upon as a mean calling; the <I>poor of the land</I> 
 serve for <I>vine-dressers and husbandmen,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:16">Jer. lii. 16</A>.
 But the calling was far from being a 
 dishonour to them; rather, they were an 

 <A NAME="Page37"> </A>

 honour to it. 
 
 4. It should seem, by the order 
 of the story, that Abel, though the younger 
 brother, yet entered first into his calling, and 
 probably his example drew in Cain. 
 
 5. Abel 
 chose that employment which most befriended 
 contemplation and devotion, for to these a 
 pastoral life has been looked upon as being 
 peculiarly favourable. Moses and David kept 
 sheep, and in their solitudes conversed with 
 God. Note, That calling or condition of 
 life is best for us, and to be chosen by us, 
 which is best for our souls, that which least 
 exposes us to sin and gives us most opportunity 
 of serving and enjoying God.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge4_4"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ge4_5"> </A>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And in process of time it came 
 to pass, that Cain brought of the 
 fruit of the ground an offering unto 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 And Abel, he also 
 brought of the firstlings of his flock 
 and of the fat thereof. And the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had respect unto Abel and to 
 his offering:
 &nbsp; 5 But unto Cain and 
 to his offering he had not respect. 
 And Cain was very wroth, and his 
 countenance fell.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 
 
 I. The devotions of Cain 
 and Abel. <I>In process of time,</I> when they 
 had made some improvement in their respective 
 callings (Heb. <I>At the end of days,</I> 
 either at the end of the year, when they kept 
 their feast of in-gathering or perhaps an 
 annual fast in remembrance of the fall, or 
 at the end of the days of the week, the 
 seventh day, which was the sabbath)--at 
 some set time, Cain and Abel brought to 
 Adam, as the priest of the family, each of 
 them <I>an offering to the Lord,</I> for the doing of 
 which we have reason to think there was a 
 divine appointment given to Adam, as a 
 token of God's favour to him and his thoughts 
 of love towards him and his, notwithstanding 
 their apostasy. God would thus try Adam's 
 faith in the promise and his obedience to the 
 remedial law; he would thus settle a correspondence 
 again between heaven and earth, 
 and give <I>shadows of good things to come.</I> 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. That the religious worship 
 of God is no novel invention, but an ancient 
 institution. It is that which was <I>from the 
 beginning</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>);
 it is the <I>good old 
 way,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.
 The city of our God is indeed 
 that joyous city whose antiquity is of 
 ancient days, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:7">Isa. xxiii. 7</A>.
 Truth got the 
 start of error, and piety of profaneness. 
 
 2. That is a good thing for children to be 
 well taught when they are young, and trained 
 up betimes in religious services, that when 
 they come to be capable of acting for themselves 
 they may, of their own accord, <I>bring 
 an offering to God.</I> In this <I>nurture of the 
 Lord</I> parents must bring up their children, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19,Eph+6:4"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 19; Eph. vi. 4</A>.

 3. That we should 
 every one of us honour God with what we 
 have, according as he has prospered us. According 
 as their employments and possessions 
 were, so they brought their offering. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:1,2">1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2</A>.
 <I>Our merchandize and 
 our hire,</I> whatever they are, must be <I>holiness 
 to the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>.
 He must have 
 his dues of it in works of piety and charity, 
 the support of religion and the relief of the 
 poor. Thus we must now bring our offering 
 with an upright heart; <I>and with such sacrifices 
 God is well pleased.</I> 
 
 4. That hypocrites 
 and evil doers may be found going as far as 
 the best of God's people in the external services 
 of religion. Cain brought an offering 
 with Abel; nay, Cain's offering is mentioned 
 first, as if he were the more forward of the 
 two. A hypocrite may possibly hear as many 
 sermons, say as many prayers, and give as 
 much alms, as a good Christian, and yet, 
 for want of sincerity, come short of acceptance 
 with God. The Pharisee and the 
 publican went to the temple to pray, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:10">Luke xviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The different success of their devotions. 
 That which is to be aimed at in all 
 acts of religion is God's acceptance: we 
 speed well if we attain this, but in vain do 
 we worship if we miss of it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>.
 Perhaps, to a stander-by, the sacrifices of
 Cain and Abel would have seemed both 
 alike good. Adam accepted them both, but 
 God, <I>who sees not as man sees,</I> did not. God 
 had <I>respect to Abel and to his offering,</I> and 
 showed his acceptance of it, probably by 
 fire from heaven; but to <I>Cain and his offering 
 he had not respect.</I> We are sure there 
 was a good reason for this difference; the 
 Governor of the world, though an absolute 
 sovereign, does not act arbitrarily in dispensing 
 his smiles and frowns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a difference in the characters 
 of the persons offering. Cain was a wicked 
 man, led a bad life, under the reigning 
 power of the world and the flesh; and therefore 
 his sacrifice was an <I>abomination to the 
 Lord</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>);
 <I>a vain oblation,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13">Isa. i. 13</A>.
 God had no respect to Cain himself, and
 therefore no respect to his offering, as the
 manner of the expression intimates. But
 Abel was a righteous man; he is called <I>righteous
 Abel</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>);
 his heart was 
 upright and his life was pious; he was one 
 of those whom God's countenance beholds 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:7">Ps. xi. 7</A>)
 and whose prayer is therefore his 
 delight, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.
 God had respect to 
 him as a holy man, and therefore to his 
 offering as a holy offering. The tree must 
 be good, else the fruit cannot be pleasing to 
 the heart-searching God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was a difference in the offerings 
 they brought. It is expressly said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:4">Heb. xi. 4</A>),
 Abel's was a <I>more excellent sacrifice</I> than 
 Cain's: either, 
 
 (1.) In the nature of it. Cain's 
 was only a sacrifice of acknowledgment offered 
 to the Creator; the meat-offerings of 
 the fruit of the ground were no more, and, 
 for aught I know, they might be offered 
 in innocency. But Abel brought a sacrifice 

 <A NAME="Page38"> </A>

 of atonement, the blood whereof was shed in 
 order to remission, thereby owning himself a 
 sinner, deprecating God's wrath, and imploring 
 his favour in a Mediator. Or, 
 
 (2.) In the qualities of the offering. Cain brought 
 <I>of the fruit of the ground,</I> any thing that came 
 next to hand, what he had not occasion for 
 himself or what was not marketable. But 
 Abel was curious in the choice of his offering: 
 not the lame, nor the lean, nor the refuse, 
 but the <I>firstlings of the flock</I>--the best 
 he had, <I>and the fat thereof</I>--the best of those 
 best. Hence the Hebrew doctors give it 
 for a general rule that every thing that is 
 for the name of the good God must be the 
 goodliest and best. It is fit that he who is 
 the first and best should have the first and 
 best of our time, strength, and service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great difference was this, that Abel 
 offered in faith, and Cain did not. There 
 was a difference in the principle upon which 
 they went. Abel offered with an eye to 
 God's will as his rule, and God's glory as his 
 end, and in dependence upon the promise of a 
 Redeemer; but Cain did what he did only for 
 company's sake, or to save his credit, not in 
 faith, and so it turned into sin to him. Abel 
 was a penitent believer, like the publican that 
 went away justified: Cain was unhumbled; 
 his confidence was within himself; he was like 
 the Pharisee who glorified himself, but 
 was not so much as justified before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Cain's displeasure at the difference 
 God made between his sacrifice and Abel's. 
 Cain was very wroth, which presently appeared 
 in his very looks, for his countenance 
 fell, which bespeaks not so much his grief 
 and discontent as his malice and rage. His 
 sullen churlish countenance, and a down-look, 
 betrayed his passionate resentments: 
 he carried ill-nature in his face, and <I>the show 
 of his countenance witnessed against him.</I> 
 This anger bespeaks, 
 
 1. His enmity to God, 
 and the indignation he had conceived against 
 him for making such a difference between his 
 offering and his brother's. He should have 
 been angry at himself for his own infidelity 
 and hypocrisy, by which he had forfeited 
 God's acceptance; and his countenance 
 should have fallen in repentance and holy 
 shame, as the publican's, who <I>would not lift 
 up so much as his eyes to heaven,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Luke xviii. 13</A>.
 But, instead of this, he flies out against 
 God, as if he were partial and unfair in distributing 
 his smiles and frowns, and as if he 
 had done him a deal of wrong. Note, It is 
 a certain sign of an unhumbled heart to 
 quarrel with those rebukes which we have, 
 by our own sin, brought upon ourselves. 
 <I>The foolishness of man perverteth his way,</I> 
 and then, to make bad worse, <I>his heart fretteth
 against the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.

 2. His 
 envy of his brother, who had the honour to 
 be publicly owned. Though his brother 
 had no thought of having any slur put upon 
 him, nor did now insult over him to provoke 
 him, yet he conceived a hatred of him as an 
 enemy, or, which is equivalent, a rival. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) It is common for those who have 
 rendered themselves unworthy of God's favour 
 by their presumptuous sins to have indignation 
 against those who are dignified 
 and distinguished by it. The Pharisees 
 walked in this way of Cain, when they <I>neither 
 entered into the kingdom of God themselves</I> 
 nor <I>suffered those that were entering to go in,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:52">Luke xi. 52</A>.
 Their eye is evil, because 
 their master's eye and the eye of their fellow-servants 
 are good. 
 
 (2.) Envy is a sin that 
 commonly carries with it both its own discovery, 
 in the paleness of the looks, and its own 
 punishment, in the rottenness of the bones.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge4_6"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ge4_7"> </A>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Cain, 
 Why art thou wroth? and why is thy 
 countenance fallen?
 &nbsp; 7 If thou doest 
 well, shalt thou not be accepted? and 
 if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the 
 door. And unto thee <I>shall be</I> his desire, 
 and thou shalt rule over him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is here reasoning with Cain, to convince 
 him of the sin and folly of his anger 
 and discontent, and to bring him into a good 
 temper again, that further mischief might be 
 prevented. It is an instance of God's patience 
 and condescending goodness that he 
 would deal thus tenderly with so bad a man, 
 in so bad an affair. <I>He is not willing that 
 any should perish, but that all should come to 
 repentance.</I> Thus the father of the prodigal 
 argued the case with the elder son 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:28-32">Luke xv. 28</A>,
 &c.), and God with those Israelites who 
 said, <I>The way of the Lord is not equal,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25">Ezek. xviii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God puts Cain himself upon enquiring 
 into the cause of his discontent, and considering 
 whether it were indeed a just cause: 
 <I>Why is thy countenance fallen?</I> Observe, 
 
 1. That God takes notice of all our sinful passions 
 and discontents. There is not an angry 
 look, an envious look, nor a fretful look, that 
 escapes his observing eye. 
 
 2. That most of 
 our sinful heats and disquietudes would soon 
 vanish before a strict and impartial enquiry 
 into the cause of them. "<I>Why am I wroth?</I> 
 Is there a real cause, a just cause, a proportionable
 cause for it? Why am I so soon 
 angry? Why so very angry, and so implacable?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To reduce Cain to his right mind 
 again, it is here made evident to him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he had no reason to be angry at 
 God, for that he had proceeded according to 
 the settled and invariable rules of government 
 suited to a state of probation. He sets 
 before men life and death, the blessing and 
 the curse, and then <I>renders to them according 
 to their works,</I> and differences them according 
 as they difference themselves--so shall 
 their doom be. The rules are just, and 
 therefore his ways, according to those rules, 
 must needs be equal, and he will be justified 
 when he speaks.</P>

 <A NAME="Page39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God sets before Cain life and a blessing: 
 "<I>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be 
 accepted?</I> No doubt thou shalt, nay, thou 
 knowest thou shalt;" either, 
 
 [1.] "If thou 
 hadst done well, as thy brother did, thou 
 shouldst have been accepted, as he was." 
 <I>God is no respecter of persons,</I> hates nothing 
 that he had made, denies his favour to none 
 but those who have forfeited it, and is an 
 enemy to none but those who by sin have 
 made him their enemy: so that if we come 
 short of acceptance with him we must thank 
 ourselves, the fault is wholly our own; if we 
 had done our duty, we should not have 
 missed of his mercy. This will justify God 
 in the destruction of sinners, and will aggravate 
 their ruin; there is not a damned sinner 
 in hell, but, if he had done well, as he might 
 have done, had been a glorious saint in 
 heaven. Every mouth will shortly be stopped 
 with this. Or, 
 
 [2.] "If now thou do well, 
 if thou repent of thy sin, reform thy heart 
 and life, and bring thy sacrifice in a better 
 manner, if thou not only do that which is 
 good but do it well, thou shalt yet be accepted, 
 thy sin shall be pardoned, thy comfort and 
 honour restored, and all shall be well." See 
 here the effect of a Mediator's interposal between 
 God and man; we do not stand upon 
 the footing of the first covenant, which left 
 no room for repentance, but God had come 
 upon new terms with us. Though we have 
 offended, if we repent and return, we shall 
 find mercy. See how early the gospel was 
 preached, and the benefit of it here offered
 even to one of the chief of sinners.</P>

 (2.) He sets before him death and a curse: 
 But <I>if not well,</I> that is, "Seeing thou didst 
 not do well, didst not offer in faith and in a 
 right manner, <I>sin lies at the door,</I>" that is, 
 "sin was imputed to thee, and thou wast 
 frowned upon and rejected as a sinner. So 
 high a charge had not been laid at thy door, 
 if thou hadst not brought it upon thyself, 
 by not doing well." Or, as it is commonly 
 taken, "If now thou wilt not do well, if thou 
 persist in this wrath, and, instead of humbling 
 thyself before God, harden thyself against 
 him, <I>sin lies at the door,</I>" that is, 
 
 [1.] Further 
 sin. "Now that anger is in thy heart, 
 murder is at the door." The way of sin is 
 down-hill, and men go from bad to worse. 
 Those who do not sacrifice well, but are careless 
 and remiss in their devotion to God, 
 expose themselves to the worst temptations; 
 and perhaps the most scandalous sin lies at 
 the door. Those who do not keep God's ordinances 
 are in danger of committing all 
 abominations, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:30">Lev. xviii. 30</A>.
 Or, 
 
 [2.] The 
 punishment of sin. So near akin are sin and 
 punishment that the same word in Hebrew 
 signifies both. If sin be harboured in the 
 house, the curse waits at the door, like a 
 bailiff, ready to arrest the sinner whenever he 
 looks out. It lies as if it slept, but it lies at 
 the door where it will be soon awaked, and 
 then it will appear that the damnation slumbered 
 not. Sin will <I>find thee out,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:23">Num. xxxii. 23</A>.
 Yet some choose to understand this also 
 as an intimation of mercy. "If thou doest 
 not well, <I>sin</I> (that is, <I>the sin-offering</I>), lies at
 the door, and thou mayest take the benefit 
 of it." The same word signifies <I>sin</I> and <I>a 
 sacrifice for sin.</I> "Though thou hast not 
 done well, yet do not despair; the remedy is 
 at hand; the propitiation is not far to seek; 
 lay hold on it, and the iniquity of thy holy 
 things shall be forgiven thee." Christ, the 
 great sin-offering, is said to <I>stand at the door,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.
 And those well deserve to 
 perish in their sins that will not go to the
 door for an interest in the sin-offering. All 
 this considered, Cain had no reason to be 
 angry at God, but at himself only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had no reason to be angry at 
 his brother: "<I>Unto thee shall be his desire,</I> 
 he shall continue his respect to thee as an 
 elder brother, and thou, as the first-born, 
 shalt rule over him as much as ever." God's 
 acceptance of Abel's offering did not transfer 
 the birth-right to him (which Cain was jealous 
 of), nor put upon him that excellency of 
 dignity and of power which is said to belong 
 to it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 3</A>.
 God did not so intend it; 
 Abel did not so interpret it; there was no 
 danger of its being improved to Cain's 
 prejudice; why then should he be so much 
 exasperated? Observe here, 
 
 (1.) That the 
 difference which God's grace makes does not 
 alter the distinctions which God's providence 
 makes, but preserves them, and obliges us 
 to do the duty which results from them: believing 
 servants must be obedient to unbelieving 
 masters. Dominion is not founded 
 in grace, nor will religion warrant disloyalty 
 or disrespect in any relation. 
 
 (2.) That the 
 jealousies which civil powers have sometimes 
 conceived of the true worshippers of God as 
 dangerous to their government, enemies to 
 C&aelig;sar, and hurtful to kings and provinces (on 
 which suspicion persecutors have grounded
 their rage against them) are very unjust and 
 unreasonable. Whatever may be the case 
 with some who call themselves Christians, it 
 is certain that <I>Christians indeed</I> are the best 
 subjects, and the quiet in the land; their 
 desire is towards their governors, and these 
 shall rule over them.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge4_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And Cain talked with Abel his 
 brother: and it came to pass, when 
 they were in the field, that Cain rose 
 up against Abel his brother, and slew 
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the progress of Cain's anger, 
 and the issue of it in Abel's murder, which 
 may be considered two ways:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As Cain's sin; and a scarlet, crimson, 
 sin it was, a sin of the first magnitude, a sin 
 against the light and law of nature, and 
 which the consciences even of bad men have 
 startled at. See in it, 
 
 1. The sad effects of 
 sin's entrance into the world and into the 

 <A NAME="Page39"> </A>

 hearts of men. See what a root of bitterness 
 the corrupt nature is, which bears this gall 
 and wormwood. Adam's eating forbidden 
 fruit seemed but a little sin, but it opened 
 the door to the greatest. 
 
 2. A fruit of the 
 enmity which is in the seed of the serpent 
 against the seed of the woman. As Abel 
 leads the van in the <I>noble army of martyrs</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>),
 so Cain stands in the front
 of the ignoble army of persecutors, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:11">Jude 11</A>.
 So early did he that was after the flesh <I>persecute 
 him that was after the Spirit; and so 
 it is now,</I> more or less 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:29">Gal. iv. 29</A>),
 and so it 
 will be till the war shall end in the eternal 
 salvation of all the saints and the eternal 
 perdition of all that hate them. 
 
 3. See also 
 what comes of <I>envy, hatred, malice, and all 
 uncharitableness;</I> if they be indulged and 
 cherished in the soul, they are in danger of 
 involving men in the horrid guilt of murder 
 itself. Rash anger is heart-murder, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21,22">Matt. v. 21, 22</A>.
 Much more is malice so; he that 
 hates his brother is already a murderer before 
 God; and, if God leave him to himself, he 
 wants nothing but an opportunity to render 
 him a murderer before the world. Many 
 were the aggravations of Cain's sin. 
 
 (1.) It 
 was his brother, his own brother, that he 
 murdered, his own mother's son
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:20">Ps. l. 20</A>),
 whom he ought to have loved, his younger 
 brother, whom he ought to have protected. 
 
 (2.) He was a good brother, one who had 
 never done him any wrong, nor given him the 
 least provocation in word or deed, but one 
 whose desire had been always towards him, 
 and who had been, in all instances, dutiful 
 and respectful to him. 
 
 (3.) He had fair 
 warning given him, before, of this. God 
 himself had told him what would come of it, 
 yet he persisted in his barbarous design. 
 
 (4.) It should seem that he covered it with a 
 show of friendship and kindness: <I>He talked 
 with Abel his brother,</I> freely and familiarly, 
 lest Abel should suspect danger, and keep 
 out of his reach. Thus Joab kissed Abner, 
 and then killed him. Thus Absalom feasted 
 his brother Amnon and then killed him. 
 According to the Septuagint [a Greek version 
 of the Old Testament, supposed to have 
 been translated by seventy-two Jews, at the 
 desire of Ptolemy Philadelphus, above 200 
 years before Christ], Cain said to Abel, <I>Let 
 us go into the field;</I> if so, we are sure Abel 
 did not understand it (according to the modern 
 sense) as a challenge, else he would not 
 have accepted it, but as a brotherly invitation 
 to go together to their work. The Chaldee 
 paraphrast adds that Cain, when they were 
 in discourse in the field, maintained that 
 there was no judgment to come, no future 
 state, no rewards and punishments in the 
 other world, and that when Abel spoke in 
 defence of the truth Cain took that occasion 
 to fall upon him. However, 
 
 (5.) That which 
 the scripture tells us was the reason why 
 he slew him was a sufficient aggravation of 
 the murder; it was <I>because his own works 
 were evil and his brother's righteous,</I> so that 
 herein he showed himself to be <I>of that wicked 
 one</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:12">1 John iii. 12</A>),
 a <I>child of the devil,</I> as 
 being <I>an enemy to all righteousness,</I> even in 
 his own brother, and, in this, employed 
 immediately by the destroyer. Nay, 
 
 (6.) In 
 killing his brother, he directly struck at God 
 himself; for God's accepting Abel was the 
 provocation pretended, and for this very 
 reason he hated Abel, because God loved 
 him. 
 
 (7.) The murder of Abel was the more 
 inhuman because there were now so few men 
 in the world to replenish it. The life of a 
 man is precious at any time; but it was in a 
 special manner precious now, and could ill 
 be spared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As Abel's suffering. Death reigned 
 ever since Adam sinned, but we read not of 
 any taken captive by him till now; and now, 
 
 1. The first that dies is a saint, one that was 
 accepted and beloved of God, to show that, 
 though the promised seed was so far to destroy 
 him that had the power of death as to 
 save believers from its sting, yet still they 
 should be exposed to its stroke. The first that 
 went to the grave went to heaven. God 
 would secure to himself the first-fruits, the 
 first-born to the dead, that first opened the 
 womb into another world. Let this take off 
 the terror of death, that it was betimes the 
 lot of God's chosen, which alters the property 
 of it. Nay, 
 
 2. The first that dies is a 
 martyr, and dies for his religion; and of such 
 it may more truly be said than of soldiers 
 that they die on the bed of honour. Abel's 
 death has not only no curse in it, but it has 
 a crown in it; so admirably well is the property 
 of death altered that it is not only rendered 
 innocent and inoffensive to those that 
 die in Christ, but honourable and glorious to 
 those that die for him. Let us not think it 
 strange concerning the fiery trial, nor shrink 
 if we be called to resist unto blood; for we 
 know there is a crown of life for all that are 
 faithful unto death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a full account of the trial 
 and condemnation of the first murderer. Civil 
 courts of judicature not being yet erected for 
 this purpose, as they were afterwards 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>),
 God himself sits Judge; for he is the 
 God to whom vengeance belongs, and who 

 <A NAME="Page41"> </A>

 will be sure to make inquisition for blood, 
 especially the blood of saints. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The arraignment of Cain: <I>The Lord 
 said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?</I> 
 Some think Cain was thus examined the next 
 sabbath after the murder was committed, 
 when <I>the sons of God came,</I> as usual, <I>to present 
 themselves before the Lord,</I> in a religious 
 assembly, and Abel was missing, whose place 
 did not use to be empty; for the God of 
 heaven takes notice who is present at and 
 who is absent from public ordinances. Cain 
 is asked, not only because there is just cause 
 to suspect him, he having discovered a malice 
 against Abel and having been last with him, 
 but because God knew him to be guilty; yet 
 he asks him, that he may draw from him a 
 confession of his crime, for those who would 
 be justified before God must accuse themselves, 
 and the penitent will do so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Cain's plea: he pleads <I>not guilty,</I> and 
 adds rebellion to his sin. For, 
 
 1. He endeavours 
 to cover a deliberate murder with a 
 deliberate lie: <I>I know not.</I> He knew well 
 enough what had become of Abel, and yet 
 had the impudence to deny it. Thus, in 
 Cain, the devil was both a murderer and a 
 liar from the beginning. See how sinners' 
 minds are blinded, and their hearts hardened 
 by the deceitfulness of sin: those are strangely 
 blind that think it possible to conceal their 
 sins from a God that sees all, and those are 
 strangely hard that think it desirable to conceal 
 them from a God who pardons those 
 only that confess. 
 
 2. He impudently charges 
 his Judge with folly and injustice, in putting 
 this question to him: <I>Am I my brother's 
 keeper?</I> He should have humbled himself, 
 and have said, <I>Am not I my brother's murderer?</I> 
 But he flies in the face of God himself, 
 as if he had asked him an impertinent 
 question, to which he was no way obliged 
 to give an answer: "<I>Am I my brother's 
 keeper?</I> Surely he is old enough to take care 
 of himself, nor did I ever take any charge of 
 him." Some think he reflects on God and 
 his providence, as if he had said, "Art not 
 thou his keeper? If he be missing, on thee 
 be the blame, and not on me, who never 
 undertook to keep him." Note, A charitable 
 concern for our brethren, as their keepers, 
 is a great duty, which is strictly required of 
 us, but is generally neglected by us. Those 
 who are unconcerned in the affairs of their 
 brethren, and take no care, when they have 
 opportunity, to prevent their hurt in their 
 bodies, goods, or good name, especially in 
 their souls, do, in effect, speak Cain's language. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17,Php+2:4">Lev. xix. 17; Phil. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conviction of Cain, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 God gave no direct answer to his question, but 
 rejected his plea as false and frivolous: 
 "<I>What hast thou done?</I> Thou makest a light 
 matter of it; but hast thou considered what 
 an evil thing it is, how deep the stain, how 
 heavy the burden, of this guilt is? Thou 
 thinkest to conceal it, but it is to no purpose, 
 the evidence against thee is clear and 
 incontestable: <I>The voice of thy brother's blood 
 cries.</I>" He speaks as if the blood itself were 
 both witness and prosecutor, because God's 
 own knowledge testified against him and 
 God's own justice demanded satisfaction. 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. Murder is a crying sin, 
 none more so. Blood calls for blood, the 
 blood of the murdered for the blood of the 
 murderer; it cries in the dying words of 
 Zechariah 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:22">2 Chron. xxiv. 22</A>),
 <I>The Lord look 
 upon it and require it;</I> or in those of the 
 souls under the altar 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:10">Rev. vi. 10</A>),
 <I>How long, 
 Lord, holy, and true?</I> The patient sufferers 
 cried for pardon (<I>Father, forgive them</I>), but 
 their blood cries for vengeance. Though 
 they hold their peace, their blood has a loud 
 and constant cry, to which the ear of the 
 righteous God is always open. 
 
 2. The blood 
 is said to cry from the ground, the earth, 
 which is said <I>to open her mouth to receive his 
 brother's blood from his hand,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 The earth did, as it were, blush to see her own 
 face stained with such blood, and therefore 
 opened her mouth to hide that which she 
 could not hinder. When the heaven revealed 
 Cain's iniquity, the earth also rose up against 
 him 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:27">Job xx. 27</A>),
 and groaned on being thus 
 made <I>subject to vanity,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20,22">Rom. viii. 20, 22</A>.
 Cain, it is likely, buried the blood and the 
 body, to conceal his crime; but "murder 
 will out." He did not bury them so deep 
 but the cry of them reached heaven. 
 
 3. In 
 the original the word is plural, thy brother's 
 <I>bloods,</I> not only his blood, but the blood of 
 all those that might have descended from 
 him; or the blood of all the seed of the 
 woman, who should, in like manner, seal the 
 truth with their blood. Christ puts all on one 
 score 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>);
 or because account 
 was kept of every drop of blood shed. How 
 well is it for us that the blood of Christ 
 speaks better things than that of Abel! 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>.
 Abel's blood cried for vengeance, 
 Christ's blood cries for pardon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The sentence passed upon Cain: <I>And 
 now art thou cursed from the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is cursed, separated to all evil, laid 
 under the wrath of God, as it is revealed from 
 heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness 
 of men, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>.
 Who knows 
 the extent and weight of a divine curse, how 
 far it reaches, how deep it pierces? God's 
 pronouncing a man cursed makes him so; 
 for those whom he curses are cursed indeed. 
 The curse for Adam's disobedience terminated 
 on the ground: <I>Cursed is the ground for thy 
 sake;</I> but that for Cain's rebellion fell immediately 
 upon himself: <I>Thou art cursed;</I> 
 for God had mercy in store for Adam, but 
 none for Cain. We have all deserved this 
 curse, and it is only in Christ that believers 
 are saved from it and inherit the blessing, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10,13">Gal. iii. 10, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is cursed from the earth. Thence 
 the cry came up to God, thence the curse 

 <A NAME="Page42"> </A>

 came up to Cain. God could have taken 
 vengeance by an immediate stroke from 
 heaven, by the sword of an angel, or by a 
 thunderbolt; but he chose to make the earth 
 the avenger of blood, to continue him upon 
 the earth, and not immediately to cut him 
 off, and yet to make even this his curse. The 
 earth is always near us, we cannot fly from 
 it; so that, if this is made the executioner of 
 divine wrath, our punishment is unavoidable: 
 it is sin, that is, the punishment of sin, lying 
 at the door. Cain found his punishment 
 where he chose his portion and set his heart. 
 Two things we expect from the earth, and 
 by this curse both are denied to Cain and 
 taken from him: <I>sustenance</I> and <I>settlement.</I> 
 
 (1.) Sustenance out of the earth is here withheld 
 from him. It is a curse upon him in his 
 enjoyments, and particularly in his calling: 
 <I>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not 
 henceforth yield unto thee its strength.</I> Note, 
 Every creature is to us what God makes it, 
 a comfort or a cross, a blessing or a curse. 
 If the earth yield not her strength to us, we 
 must therein acknowledge God's righteousness; 
 for we have not yielded our strength 
 to him. The ground was cursed before to
 Adam, but it was now doubly cursed to Cain. 
 That part of it which fell to his share, and of 
 which he had the occupation, was made unfruitful 
 and uncomfortable to him by the 
 blood of Abel. Note, The wickedness of the 
 wicked brings a curse upon all they do and 
 all they have 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15-68">Deut. xxviii. 15</A>,
 &c.), and this 
 curse embitters all they have and disappoints 
 them in all they do. 
 
 (2.) Settlement on the 
 earth is here denied him: <I>A fugitive and a 
 vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</I> By this 
 he was condemned, 
 
 [1.] To perpetual disgrace 
 and reproach among men. It should 
 be ever looked upon as a scandalous thing to 
 harbour him, converse with him, or show him 
 any countenance. And justly was a man 
 that had divested himself of all humanity 
 abhorred and abandoned by all mankind, 
 and made infamous. 
 
 [2.] To perpetual disquietude 
 and horror in his own mind. His 
 own guilty conscience should haunt him 
 wherever he went, and make him <I>Magormissabib,</I> 
 a <I>terror round about.</I> What rest 
 can those find, what settlement, that carry 
 their own disturbance with them in their 
 bosoms wherever they go? Those must needs 
 be fugitives that are thus tossed. There is 
 not a more restless fugitive upon earth than 
 he that is continually pursued by his own 
 guilt, nor a viler vagabond than he that is at 
 the beck of his own lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This was the sentence passed upon Cain; 
 and even in this there was mercy mixed, inasmuch 
 as he was not immediately cut off, 
 but had space given him to repent; for God 
 is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that 
 any should perish.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the proceedings 
 against Cain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Cain's complaint of the sentence 
 passed upon him, as hard and severe. 
 Some make him to speak the language of 
 despair, and read it, <I>My iniquity is greater 
 than that it may be forgiven;</I> and so what he 
 says is a reproach and affront to the mercy of 
 God, which those only shall have the benefit 
 of that hope in it. There is forgiveness with 
 the God of pardons for the greatest sins and 
 sinners; but those forfeit it who despair of 
 it. Just now Cain made nothing of his sin, 
 but now he is in the other extreme: Satan 
 drives his vassals from presumption to despair. 
 We cannot think too ill of sin, provided 
 we do not think it unpardonable. But 
 Cain seems rather to speak the language of 
 indignation: <I>My punishment is greater than 
 I can bear;</I> and so what he says is a reproach 
 and affront to the justice of God, and a complaint, 
 not of the greatness of his sin, but of 
 the extremity of his punishment, as if this 
 were disproportionable to his merits. Instead 
 of justifying God in the sentence, he 
 condemns him, not accepting the punishment 
 of his iniquity, but quarrelling with it. 
 Note, Impenitent unhumbled hearts are therefore 
 not reclaimed by God's rebukes because 
 they think themselves wronged by them; and 
 it is an evidence of great hardness to be more 
 concerned about our sufferings than about 
 our sins. Pharaoh's care was concerning this 
 death only, not this sin 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:17">Exod. x. 17</A>);
 so was 
 Cain's here. He is a living man, and yet 
 complains of the punishment of his sin, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:39">Lam. iii. 39</A>.
 He thinks himself rigorously dealt 
 with when really he is favourably treated; 
 and he cries out of wrong when he has more 
 reason to wonder that he is out of hell. Woe 
 unto him that thus strives with his Maker, 
 and enters into judgment with his Judge. 
 Now, to justify this complaint, Cain descants 
 upon the sentence. 
 
 1. He sees himself excluded 
 by it from the favour of his God, 
 and concludes that, being cursed, he is hidden 
 from God's face, which is indeed the 
 true nature of God's curse; damned sinners 
 find it so, to whom it is said, <I>Depart from me 
 you cursed.</I> Those are cursed indeed that 
 are forever shut out from God's love and 
 care and from all hopes of his grace. 
 
 2. He 

 <A NAME="Page43"> </A>
 
 sees himself expelled from all the comforts of
 this life, and concludes that, being a fugitive, 
 he is, in effect, <I>driven out this day from the 
 face of the earth.</I> As good have no place on 
 earth as not have a settled place. Better rest 
 in the grave than not rest at all. 
 
 3. He sees 
 himself excommunicated by it, and cut off 
 from the church, and forbidden to attend on 
 public ordinances. His hands being full of 
 blood, he must <I>bring no more vain oblations,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13,15">Isa. i. 13, 15</A>.
 Perhaps this he means when 
 he complains that he is <I>driven out from the 
 face of the earth;</I> for being shut out of the 
 church, which none had yet deserted, he was 
 <I>hidden from God's face,</I> being not admitted to 
 come <I>with the sons of God to present himself 
 before the Lord.</I> 
 
 4. He sees himself exposed
 by it to the hatred and ill-will of all mankind:
 <I>It shall come to pass that every one that 
 finds me shall slay me.</I> Wherever he wanders, 
 he goes in peril of his life, at least he 
 thinks so; and, like a man in debt, thinks 
 every one he meets a bailiff. There were 
 none alive but his near relations; yet even of 
 them he is justly afraid who had himself been 
 so barbarous to his brother. Some read it, 
 <I>Whatsoever</I> finds me shall slay me; not only, 
 "Whosoever among men," but, "Whatsoever 
 among all the creatures." Seeing himself 
 thrown out of God's protection, he sees 
 the whole creation armed against him. Note, 
 Unpardoned guilt fills men with continual 
 terrors, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1,Job+15:20-21,Ps+53:5">Prov. xxviii. 1; Job xv. 20, 21; Ps. liii. 5</A>.
 It is better to fear and not sin than to 
 sin and then fear. Dr. Lightfoot thinks this 
 word of Cain should be read as a wish: <I>Now, 
 therefore, let it be that any that find me may 
 kill me.</I> Being bitter in soul, he <I>longs for 
 death, but it comes not</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:20-22">Job iii. 20-22</A>),
 as those under spiritual torments do, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:5-6">Rev. ix. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is God's confirmation of the sentence; 
 for when he judges he will overcome, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. How Cain is protected 
 in wrath by this declaration, notified, we may 
 suppose, to all that little world which was 
 then in being: <I>Whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance 
 shall be taken on him seven-fold,</I> because 
 thereby the sentence he was under 
 (that he should be a fugitive and a vagabond) 
 would be defeated. Condemned prisoners 
 are under the special protection of the law; 
 those that are appointed sacrifices to public 
 justice must not be sacrificed to private revenge. 
 God having said in Cain's case, <I>Vengeance 
 is mine, I will repay,</I> it would have 
 been a daring usurpation for any man to 
 take the sword out of God's hand, a contempt 
 put upon an express declaration of 
 God's mind, and therefore avenged seven-fold. 
 Note, God has wise and holy ends in 
 protecting and prolonging the lives even of 
 very wicked men. God deals with some according 
 to that prayer, <I>Slay them not, lest my 
 people forget; scatter them by thy power,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:11">Ps. lix. 11</A>.
 Had Cain been slain immediately, 
 he would have been forgotten 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:10">Eccl. viii. 10</A>);
 but now he lives a more fearful and lasting 
 monument of God's justice, hanged in chains, 
 as it were. 
 
 2. How he is marked in wrath: 
 <I>The Lord set a mark upon Cain,</I> to distinguish 
 him from the rest of mankind and to notify 
 that he was the man that murdered his brother, 
 whom nobody must hurt, but every 
 body must hoot at. God stigmatized him 
 (as some malefactors are burnt in the cheek), 
 and put upon him such a visible and indelible 
 mark of infamy and disgrace as would make 
 all wise people shun him, so that he could 
 not be otherwise than a fugitive and a vagabond, 
 and the off-scouring of all things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of Cain, 
 and what became of him after he was rejected 
 of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tamely submitted to that part of his 
 sentence by which he was hidden from God's 
 face; for 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 <I>he went out from the presence 
 of the Lord,</I> that is, he willingly renounced 
 God and religion, and was content to forego 
 its privileges, so that he might not be under 
 its precepts. He forsook Adam's family and 
 altar, and cast off all pretensions to the fear 
 of God, and never came among good people, 
 nor attended on God's ordinances, any more. 
 Note, Hypocritical professors, that have dissembled 
 and trifled with God Almighty, are 
 justly left to themselves, to do something 
 that is grossly scandalous, and so to throw off 
 that form of godliness to which they have 
 been a reproach, and under colour of which 
 they have denied the power of it. Cain went 
 out now from the presence of the Lord, and 
 we never find that he came into it again, to 
 his comfort. Hell is <I>destruction from the 
 presence of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:9">2 Thess. i. 9</A>.
 It is a 
 perpetual banishment from the fountain of all 
 good. This is the choice of sinners; and so 
 shall their doom be, to their eternal confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He endeavoured to confront that part 
 of the sentence by which he was made a fugitive 
 and a vagabond; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He chose his land. He went and <I>dwelt 
 on the east of Eden,</I> somewhere distant from 
 the place where Adam and his religious 
 family resided, distinguishing himself and 
 his accursed generation from the holy seed, 
 his camp from the <I>camp of the saints and the 
 beloved city,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9">Rev. xx. 9</A>.
 On the east of Eden, 
 the cherubim were, with the flaming sword, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24"><I>ch.</I> iii. 24</A>.
 There he chose his lot, as if to 
 defy the terrors of the Lord. But his 

 <A NAME="Page44"> </A>

 attempt to settle was in vain; for the land he 
 dwelt in was to him <I>the land of Nod</I> (that is, 
 of <I>shaking</I> or <I>trembling</I>), because of the continual
 restlessness and uneasiness of his own 
 spirit. Note, Those that depart from God 
 cannot find rest any where else. After Cain 
 went out from the presence of the Lord, he 
 never rested. Those that shut themselves 
 out of heaven abandon themselves to a perpetual 
 trembling. "<I>Return therefore to thy 
 rest, O my soul,</I> to thy rest in God; else thou 
 art for ever restless."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He built a city for a habitation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 <I>He was building a city,</I> so some read it, ever 
 building it, but, a curse being upon him and 
 the work of his hands, he could not finish it. 
 Or, as we read it, he <I>built a city,</I> in token of 
 a fixed separation from the church of God, to 
 which he had no thoughts of ever returning. 
 This city was to be the head-quarters of the 
 apostasy. Observe here, 
 
 (1.) Cain's defiance 
 of the divine sentence. God said he should 
 be a <I>fugitive and a vagabond.</I> Had he repented 
 and humbled himself, this curse might 
 have been turned into a blessing, as that of 
 the tribe of Levi was, that they should be 
 <I>divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel;</I> but 
 his impenitent unhumbled heart walking contrary 
 to God, and resolving to fix in spite of 
 heaven, that which might have been a blessing 
 was turned into a curse. 
 
 (2.) See what 
 was Cain's choice, after he had forsaken God; 
 he pitched upon a settlement in this world, 
 as his rest for ever. Those who looked for 
 the heavenly city chose, while on earth, to 
 dwell in tabernacles; but Cain, as one that 
 minded not <I>that</I> city, built himself one on 
 earth. Those that are cursed of God are 
 apt to seek their settlement and satisfaction 
 here below, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.
 
 (3.) See what method 
 Cain took to defend himself against 
 the terrors with which he was perpetually 
 haunted. He undertook this building, to 
 divert his thoughts from the consideration of 
 his own misery, and to drown the clamours 
 of a guilty conscience with the noise of axes 
 and hammers. Thus many baffle their convictions 
 by thrusting themselves into a hurry 
 of worldly business. 
 
 (4.) See how wicked 
 people often get the start of God's people, 
 and out-go them in outward prosperity. Cain 
 and his cursed race dwell in a city, while
 Adam and his blessed family dwell in tents. 
 We cannot judge of <I>love or hatred by all that 
 is before us,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:1,2">Eccl. ix. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His family also was built up. Here is 
 an account of his posterity, at least the heirs 
 of his family, for seven generations. His 
 son was <I>Enoch,</I> of the same name, but not 
 of the same character, with that holy man 
 that <I>walked with God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:22"><I>ch.</I> v. 22</A>.
 Good men 
 and bad may bear the same names: but God 
 can distinguish between Judas Iscariot and 
 Judas <I>not</I> Iscariot, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">John xiv. 22</A>.
 The names 
 of more of his posterity are mentioned, and 
 but just mentioned; not as those of the holy 
 seed
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:1-32"><I>ch.</I> v.</A>),
 where we have three verses concerning
 each, whereas here we have three or
 four in one verse. They are numbered in
 haste, as not valued or delighted in, in comparison
 with God's chosen.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 And Lamech took unto him

 Adah, and the name of the other 
 Zillah.
 &nbsp; 20 And Adah bare Jabal: 
 he was the father of such as dwell 
 in tents, and <I>of such as have</I> cattle.
 &nbsp; 21 And his brother's name <I>was</I> Jubal:

 <I>was</I> Naamah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here some particulars concerning 
 Lamech, the seventh from Adam in the 
 line of Cain. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His marrying two wives. It was one of 
 the degenerate race of Cain who first transgressed 
 that original law of marriage that 
 two only should be one flesh. Hitherto one 
 man had but one wife at a time; but Lamech 
 took two. <I>From the beginning it was not so.</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15,Mt+19:5">Mal. ii. 15; Matt. xix. 5</A>.
 See here, 
 
 1. Those who desert God's church and ordinances 
 lay themselves open to all manner of 
 temptation. 
 
 2. When a bad custom is begun 
 by bad men sometimes men of better characters 
 are, through unwariness, drawn in to 
 follow them. Jacob, David, and many 
 others, who were otherwise good men, were 
 afterwards ensnared in this sin which Lamech 
 begun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His happiness in his children, notwithstanding 
 this. Though he sinned, in marrying 
 two wives, yet he was blessed with 
 children by both, and those such as lived to 
 be famous in their generation, not for their 
 piety, no mention is made of this (for aught 
 that appears they were the heathen of that 
 age), but for their ingenuity. They were not 
 only themselves men of business, but men 
 that were serviceable to the world, and eminent 
 for the invention, or at least the improvement, 
 of some useful arts. 
 
 1. Jabal was a 
 famous shepherd; he delighted much in 
 keeping cattle himself, and was so happy in 
 devising methods of doing it to the best advantage, 
 and instructing others in them, that 
 the shepherds of those times, nay, the shepherds 
 of after-times, called him <I>father;</I> or 
 perhaps, his children after him being brought 
 up to the same employment, the family was a 
 family of shepherds. 
 
 2. Jubal was a famous 
 musician, and particularly an organist, and 
 the first that gave rules for the noble art or 
 science of music. When Jabal had set them 
 in a way to be rich, Jubal put them in a way 
 to be merry. Those that spend their days in 
 wealth will not be without the timbrel and 
 harp, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:12,13">Job xxi. 12, 13</A>.
 From his name, <I>Jubal,</I> 

 <A NAME="Page45"> </A>

 probably the jubilee-trumpet was so called; 
 for the best music was that which proclaimed 
 liberty and redemption. Jabal was their Pan 
 and Jubal their Apollo. 
 
 3. Tubal Cain was 
 a famous smith, who greatly improved the 
 art of working in brass and iron, for the service 
 both of war and husbandry. He was 
 their Vulcan. See here, 
 
 (1.) That worldly 
 things are the only things that carnal wicked 
 people set their hearts upon and are most ingenious 
 and industrious about. So it was 
 with this impious race of cursed Cain. Here 
 were a father of shepherds and a father of 
 musicians, but not a father of the faithful. 
 Here was one to teach in brass and iron, but 
 none to teach the good knowledge of the 
 Lord. Here were devices how to be rich, 
 and how to be mighty, and how to be merry, 
 but nothing of God, nor of his fear and service, 
 among them. Present things fill the 
 heads of most people. 
 
 (2.) That even those 
 who are destitute of the knowledge and grace 
 of God may be endued with many excellent 
 and useful accomplishments, which may make 
 them famous and serviceable in their generation. 
 Common gifts are given to bad men, 
 while God chooses to himself the foolish 
 things of the world.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge4_23"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ge4_24"> </A>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And Lamech said unto his wives, 
 Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye 
 wives of Lamech, hearken unto my 
 speech: for I have slain a man to my 
 wounding, and a young man to my 
 hurt.
 &nbsp; 24 If Cain shall be avenged 
 sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
 sevenfold.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By this speech of Lamech, which is here 
 recorded, and probably was much talked of 
 in those times, he further appears to have 
 been a wicked man, as Cain's accursed race 
 generally were. Observe, 
 
 1. How haughtily 
 and imperiously he speaks to his wives, as
 one that expected a mighty regard and observance: 
 <I>Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech.</I> 
 No marvel that he who had broken one law 
 of marriage, by taking two wives, broke another, 
 which obliged him to be kind and 
 tender to those he had taken, and to give 
 honour to the wife as to the weaker vessel. 
 Those are not always the most careful to do 
 their own duty that are highest in their demands 
 of respect from others, and most frequent 
 in calling upon their relations to know 
 their place and do their duty. 
 
 2. How 
 bloody and barbarous he was to all about 
 him: <I>I have slain,</I> or (as it is in the margin) 
 <I>I would slay a man in my wound, and a young 
 man in my hurt.</I> He owns himself a man of 
 a fierce and cruel disposition, that would lay 
 about him without mercy, and kill all that 
 stood in his way; be it a man, or a young 
 man, nay, though he himself were in danger 
 to be wounded and hurt in the conflict. 
 Some think, because 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)
 he compares himself 
 with Cain, that he had murdered some 
 of the holy seed, the true worshippers of 
 God, and that he acknowledged this to be the 
 wounding of his conscience and the hurt of 
 his soul; and yet that, like Cain, he continued 
 impenitent, trembling and yet unhumbled. 
 Or his wives, knowing what 
 manner of spirit he was of, how apt both to 
 give and to resent provocation, were afraid 
 lest somebody or other would be the death 
 of him. "Never fear," says he, "I defy any 
 man to set upon me; whosoever does, let me 
 alone to make my part good with him; I will 
 slay him, be he a man or a young man." 
 Note, It is a common thing for fierce and 
 bloody men to <I>glory in their shame</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>),
 as if it were both their safety and their 
 honour that they care not how many lives 
 are sacrificed to their angry resentments, nor 
 how much they are hated, provided they 
 may be feared. <I>Oderint, dum metuant--Let 
 them hate, provided they fear.</I> 
 
 3. How impiously 
 he presumes even upon God's protection
 in his wicked way, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 He had 
 heard that <I>Cain should be avenged seven-fold</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 that is, that if any man should dare 
 to kill Cain he should be severely reckoned 
 with and punished for so doing, though Cain 
 deserved to die a thousand deaths for the 
 murder of his brother, and hence he infers 
 that if any one should kill him for the 
 murders he had committed God would much 
 more avenge his death. As if the special 
 care God took to prolong and secure the life 
 of Cain, for special reasons peculiar to his 
 case (and indeed for his sorer punishment, as 
 the beings of the damned are continued) were 
 designed as a protection to all murderers. 
 Thus Lamech perversely argues, "If God 
 provided for the safety of Cain, much more 
 for mine, who, though I have slain many, yet 
 never slew my own brother, and upon no 
 provocation, as he did." Note, The reprieve 
 of some sinners, and the patience God exercises 
 towards them, are often abused to the 
 hardening of others in the like sinful ways, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>.
 But, though justice strike 
 some slowly, others cannot therefore be sure 
 but that they may be taken away with a swift 
 destruction. Or, if God should bear long 
 with those who thus presume upon his forbearance, 
 they do but hereby treasure up unto 
 themselves <I>wrath against the day of wrath.</I></P>

 of cursed Cain, till we find them all cut off

 This is the first mention of Adam in the 
 story of this chapter. No question, the murder 
 of Abel, and the impenitence and apostasy 
 of Cain, were a very great grief to him 
 and Eve, and the more because their own 
 wickedness did now correct them and their
 backslidings did reprove them. Their folly 
 had given sin and death entrance into the 
 world; and now they smarted by it, being, 
 by means thereof, deprived of <I>both their sons 
 in one day,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:45"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 45</A>.
 When parents are 
 grieved by their children's wickedness they 
 should take occasion thence to lament that 
 corruption of nature which was derived from 
 them, and which is the root of bitterness. 
 But here we have that which was a relief to 
 our first parents in their affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God gave them to see the re-building of 
 their family, which was sorely shaken and 
 weakened by that sad event. For, 
 
 1. They 
 saw their seed, <I>another seed instead of Abel,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Observe God's kindness and tenderness 
 towards his people, in his providential 
 dealings with them; when he takes away one 
 comfort from them, he gives them another 
 instead of it, which may prove a greater 
 blessing to them than that was in which they 
 thought their lives were bound up. This 
 other seed was he in whom the church was to 
 be built up and perpetuated, and he comes 
 instead of Abel, for the succession of confessors 
 is the revival of the martyrs and as it 
 were the resurrection of God's slain witnesses. 
 Thus we are <I>baptized for the dead</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:29">1 Cor. xv. 29</A>),
 that is, we are, by baptism, 
 admitted into the church, for or instead of 
 those who by death, especially by martyrdom, 
 are removed out of it; and we fill up their 
 room. Those who slay God's servants hope 
 by this means to wear out the saints of the 
 Most High; but they will be deceived. 
 Christ shall still see his seed; God can out 
 of stones raise up children for him, and make 
 the blood of the martyrs the seed of the 
 church, whose lands, we are sure, shall never 
 be lost for want of heirs. This son, by a 
 prophetic spirit, they called <I>Seth</I> (that is, <I>set, 
 settled,</I> or <I>placed</I>), because, in his seed, mankind
 should continue to the end of time, and 
 from him the Messiah should descend. While 
 Cain, the head of the apostasy, is made a 
 wanderer, Seth, from whom the true church 
 was to come, is one fixed. In Christ and his 
 church is the only true settlement. 
 
 2. They 
 saw their seed's seed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 <I>To Seth was 
 born a son called Enos,</I> that general name for 
 all men, which bespeaks the weakness, frailty, 
 and misery, of man's state. The best men are 
 most sensible of these, both in themselves and 
 their children. We are never so settled but 
 we must remind ourselves that we are frail.</P>

 II. God gave them to see the reviving of 
 religion in their family: <I>Then began men to 
 call upon the name of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 It is 
 small comfort to a good man to see his children's 
 children, if he do not, withal, see peace 
 upon Israel, and those that come of him 
 walking in the truth. Doubtless God's name 
 was called upon before, but now, 
 
 1. The worshippers 
 of God began to stir up themselves 
 to do more in religion than they had done; 
 perhaps not more than had been done at first, 
 but more than had been done of late, since 
 the defection of Cain. Now men began to 
 worship God, not only in their closets and 
 families, but in public and solemn assemblies. 
 Or now there was so great a reformation in 
 religion that it was, as it were, a new beginning 
 of it. <I>Then</I> may refer, not to the birth 
 of Enos, but to the whole foregoing story: 
 <I>then,</I> when men saw in Cain and Lamech the 
 sad effects of sin by the workings of natural 
 conscience,--when they saw God's judgments 
 upon sin and sinners,--<I>then</I> they were so 
 much the more lively and resolute in religion. 
 The worse others are the better we should 
 be, and the more zealous. 
 
 2. The worshippers 
 of God began to distinguish themselves. 
 The margin reads it, <I>Then began men to be 
 called by the name of the Lord,</I> or to call themselves 
 by it. Now that Cain and those that 
 had deserted religion had built a city, and 
 begun to declare for impiety and irreligion, 
 and called themselves the <I>sons of men,</I> those 
 that adhered to God began to declare for him
 and his worship, and called themselves the 
 <I>sons of God.</I> Now began the distinction between 
 professors and profane, which has been 
 kept up ever since, and will be while the 
 world stands.</P>
