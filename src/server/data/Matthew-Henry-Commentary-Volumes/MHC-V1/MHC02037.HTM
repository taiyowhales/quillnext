 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Bezaleel made the ark <I>of</I> shittim wood: two cubits and a
 half <I>was</I> the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
 of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
 &nbsp; 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and
 made a crown of gold to it round about.
 &nbsp; 3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, <I>to be set</I> by the
 four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and
 two rings upon the other side of it.
 &nbsp; 4 And he made staves <I>of</I> shittim wood, and overlaid them with
 gold.
 &nbsp; 5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
 to bear the ark.
 &nbsp; 6 And he made the mercy seat <I>of</I> pure gold: two cubits and a
 half <I>was</I> the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the
 breadth thereof.
 &nbsp; 7 And he made two cherubims <I>of</I> gold, beaten out of one piece
 made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;
 &nbsp; 8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
 <I>other</I> end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
 cherubims on the two ends thereof.
 &nbsp; 9 And the cherubims spread out <I>their</I> wings on high, <I>and</I>
 covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces
 one to another; <I>even</I> to the mercy seatward were the faces of
 the cherubims.

 I. It may be thought strange that Moses, when he had recorded so fully 
 the instructions given him upon the mount for the making of all these 
 things, should here record as particularly the making of them, when it 
 might have sufficed only to have said, in a few words, that each of 
 these things was made exactly according to the directions before 
 recited. We are sure that Moses, when he wrote by divine inspiration, 
 used no vain repetitions; there are no idle words in scripture. Why 
 then are so many chapters taken up with this narrative, which we are 
 tempted to think needless and tedious? But we must consider, 

 1. That Moses wrote primarily for the people of Israel, to whom it 
 would be of great use to read and hear often of these divine and sacred 
 treasures with which they were entrusted. These several ornaments 
 wherewith the tabernacle was furnished they were not admitted to see, 
 but the priests only, and therefore it was requisite that they should 
 be thus largely described particularly to them. That which they ought 
 to read again (lest they should fail of doing it) is written again and 
 again: thus many of the same passages of the history of Christ are in 
 the New Testament related by two or three, and some by four of the 
 evangelists, for the same reason.  The great things of God's law and 
 gospel we need to have inculcated upon us again and again. To write the 
 same (says St.  Paul) to me <I>is not grievous, but for you it is 
 safe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.

 2. Moses would thus show the great care which he and his workmen took 
 to make every thing exactly according to the pattern shown him in the 
 mount. Having before given us the original, he here givers us the copy, 
 that we may compare them, and observe how exactly they agree. Thus he 
 appeals to every reader concerning his fidelity to him that appointed 
 him, in all his house, and in all the particulars of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5">Heb. iii. 5</A>.

 And thus he teaches us to have respect to all God's commandments, even
 to every iota and tittle of them.

 3. It is intimated hereby that God takes delight in the sincere 
 obedience of his people, and keeps an exact account of it, which shall 
 be produced to their honour in the resurrection of the just. None can 
 be so punctual in their duty, but God will be as punctual in his 
 notices of it. He is <I>not unrighteous to forget the work and labour 
 of love,</I> in any instance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.

 4. The spiritual riches and beauties of the gospel tabernacle are 
 hereby recommended to our frequent and serious consideration. Go walk 
 about this Zion, view it and review it: the more you contemplate the 
 glories of the church, the more you will admire them and be in love 
 with them. The charter of its privileges, and the account of its 
 constitution, will very well bear a second reading.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In these verses we have an account of the making of the ark, with 
 its glorious and most significant appurtenances, the mercy-seat and the 
 cherubim. Consider these three together, and they represent the glory 
 of a holy god, the sincerity of a holy heart, and the communion that is 
 between them, in and by a Mediator. 

 1. It is the glory of a holy god that he dwells between the cherubim; 
 that is, is continually attended and adored by the blessed angels, 
 whose swiftness was signified by their faces being one towards another. 
 
 2. It is the character of an upright heart that, like the ark of the 
 testimony, it has the law of God hid and kept in it. 

 3. By Jesus Christ, the great propitiation, there is reconciliation 
 made, and a communion settled, between us and God: he interposes 
 between us and God's displeasure; and not only so, but through him we 
 become entitled to God's favour. If he write his law in our heart, he 
 will be to us a God and we shall be to him a people.  From the 
 mercy-seat he will teach us, there he will accept us, and show himself 
 merciful to our unrighteousness; and under the shadow of his wings we 
 shall be safe and easy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And he made the table <I>of</I> shittim wood: two cubits <I>was</I>
 the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
 and a half the height thereof:
 &nbsp; 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a
 crown of gold round about.
 &nbsp; 12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round
 about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round
 about.
 &nbsp; 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings
 upon the four corners that <I>were</I> in the four feet thereof.
 &nbsp; 14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
 staves to bear the table.
 &nbsp; 15 And he made the staves <I>of</I> shittim wood, and overlaid them
 with gold, to bear the table.
 &nbsp; 16 And he made the vessels which <I>were</I> upon the table, his
 dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover
 withal, <I>of</I> pure gold.
 &nbsp; 17 And he made the candlestick <I>of</I> pure gold: <I>of</I> beaten work
 made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls,
 his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:
 &nbsp; 18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
 branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
 three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
 &nbsp; 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch,
 a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another
 branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going
 out of the candlestick.
 &nbsp; 20 And in the candlestick <I>were</I> four bowls made like almonds,
 his knops, and his flowers:
 &nbsp; 21 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
 two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
 same, according to the six branches going out of it.
 &nbsp; 22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it
 <I>was</I> one beaten work <I>of</I> pure gold.
 &nbsp; 23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
 snuffdishes, <I>of</I> pure gold.
 &nbsp; 24 <I>Of</I> a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
 thereof.

 Here is, 

 1. The making of the table on which the show-bread was to be 
 continually placed. God is a good householder, that always keeps a 
 plentiful table. Is the world his tabernacle? His providence in it 
 spreads a table for all the creatures: he <I>provides food for all 
 flesh.</I> Is the church his tabernacle? His grace in it spreads a 
 table for all believers, furnished with the bread of life. But observe 
 how much the dispensation of the gospel exceeds that of the law. Though 
 here was a table furnished, it was only with <I>show-bread,</I> bread 
 to be looked upon, not to be fed upon, while it was on this table, and 
 afterwards only by the priests; but to the table which Christ has 
 spread in the new covenant all real Christians are invited guests; and 
 to them it is said, <I>Eat, O friends, come eat of my bread.</I> What 
 the law gave but a sight of at a distance, the gospel gives the 
 enjoyment of, and a hearty welcome to. 

 2. The making of the candlestick, which was not of wood overlaid with 
 gold, but all beaten work of pure gold only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+37:17,22"><I>v.</I> 17, 22</A>.

 This signified that light of divine revelation with which God's church
 upon earth (which is his tabernacle among men) has always been 
 enlightened, being always supplied with fresh oil from Christ the good 
 Olive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2,3">Zech. iv. 2, 3</A>.

 God's manifestations of himself in this world are but candle-light
 compared with the daylight of the future state. The Bible is a golden 
 candlestick; it is of pure gold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:10">Ps. xix. 10</A>.

 From it light is diffused to every part of God's tabernacle, that by it
 his spiritual priests may see to minister unto the Lord, and to do the 
 service of his sanctuary.  This candlestick has not only its bowls for 
 necessary use, but its knops and flowers for ornament; there are many 
 things which God saw fit to beautify his word with which we can no more 
 give a reason for than for these knops and flowers, and yet we are sure 
 that they were added for a good purpose. Let us bless God for this 
 candlestick, have an eye to it continually, and dread the removal of it 
 out of its place.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And he made the incense altar <I>of</I> shittim wood: the length
 of it <I>was</I> a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; <I>it was</I>
 foursquare; and two cubits <I>was</I> the height of it; the horns
 thereof were of the same.
 &nbsp; 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, <I>both</I> the top of it, and
 the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
 unto it a crown of gold round about.
 &nbsp; 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown
 thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to
 be places for the staves to bear it withal.
 &nbsp; 28 And he made the staves <I>of</I> shittim wood, and overlaid them
 with gold.
 &nbsp; 29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
 sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The making of the golden altar, on which incense was to be burnt
 daily, which signified both the prayers of saints and the intercession 
 of Christ, to which are owing the acceptableness and success of those 
 prayers. The rings and staves, and all the appurtenances of this altar, 
 were overlaid with gold, as all the vessels of the table and 
 candlestick were of gold, for these were used in the holy place. God is 
 the best, and we must serve him with the best we have; but the best we 
 can serve him with in his courts on earth is but as brass, compared 
 with the gold, the sinless and spotless perfection, with which his 
 saints shall serve him in his holy place above. 

 2. The preparing of the incense which was to be burnt upon this altar, 
 and with it the holy anointing oil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+37:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 according to the dispensatory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:22-38"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>,

 &c. God taught Bezaleel this art also; so that though he was not before
 acquainted with it yet he made up these things according to the work of 
 the apothecary, as dexterously and exactly as if he had been bred up to 
 the trade. Where God gives wisdom and grace, it will make the man of 
 God <I>perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good work.</I></P>
