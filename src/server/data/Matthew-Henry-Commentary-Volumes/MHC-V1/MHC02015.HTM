 In this chapter, 

 I. Israel looks back upon Egypt with a song of praise for their
 deliverance. Here is, 
 
 1. The song itself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-19">ver. 1-19</A>.

 2. The solemn singing of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 II. Israel marches forward in the wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:22">ver. 22</A>),

 and there,

 1. Their discontent at the waters of Marah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>),
 
 and the relief granted them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>.

 2. Their satisfaction in the waters of Elim,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for he hath
 triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into
 the sea.
 &nbsp; 2 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> my strength and song, and he is become my
 salvation: he <I>is</I> my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
 my father's God, and I will exalt him.
 &nbsp; 3 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> a man of war: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> his name.
 &nbsp; 4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea:
 his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
 &nbsp; 5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
 stone.
 &nbsp; 6 Thy right hand, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, is become glorious in power: thy
 right hand, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
 &nbsp; 7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
 them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
 <I>which</I> consumed them as stubble.
 &nbsp; 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
 together, the floods stood upright as an heap, <I>and</I> the depths
 were congealed in the heart of the sea.
 &nbsp; 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
 the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my
 sword, my hand shall destroy them.
 &nbsp; 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they
 sank as lead in the mighty waters.
 &nbsp; 11 Who <I>is</I> like unto thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, among the gods? who <I>is</I>
 like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful <I>in</I> praises, doing
 wonders?
 &nbsp; 12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed
 them.
 &nbsp; 13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people <I>which</I> thou
 hast redeemed: thou hast guided <I>them</I> in thy strength unto thy
 holy habitation.
 &nbsp; 14 The people shall hear, <I>and</I> be afraid: sorrow shall take
 hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
 &nbsp; 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
 Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of
 Canaan shall melt away.
 &nbsp; 16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of
 thine arm they shall be <I>as</I> still as a stone; till thy people
 pass over, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, till the people pass over, <I>which</I> thou hast
 purchased.
 &nbsp; 17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
 thine inheritance, <I>in</I> the place, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>which</I> thou hast made
 for thee to dwell in, <I>in</I> the Sanctuary, O Lord, <I>which</I> thy
 hands have established.
 &nbsp; 18 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall reign for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
 his horsemen into the sea, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought again the waters
 of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry
 <I>land</I> in the midst of the sea.
 &nbsp; 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a
 timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
 timbrels and with dances.
 &nbsp; 21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for he hath
 triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into
 the sea.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having read how that complete victory of Israel over the Egyptians was 
 obtained, here we are told how it was celebrated; those that were to 
 hold their peace while the deliverance was in working 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:14"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 14</A>)

 must not hold their peace now that it was wrought; the less they had to
 do then the more they had to do now. If God accomplishes deliverance by 
 his own immediate power, it redounds so much the more to his glory.  
 Moses, no doubt by divine inspiration, indited this song, and delivered 
 it to the children of Israel, to be sung before they stirred from the 
 place where they saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore. Observe, 

 1.  They expressed their joy in God, and thankfulness to him, by 
 singing; it is almost natural to us thus to give vent to our joy and 
 the exultations of our spirit. By this instance it appears that the 
 singing of psalms, as an act of religious worship, was used in the 
 church of Christ before the giving of the ceremonial law, and therefore 
 was no part of it, nor abolished with it. Singing is as much the 
 language of holy joy as praying is of holy desire. 

 2. Moses, who had gone before them through the sea, goes before them in 
 the song, and composes it for them. Note, Those that are active in 
 public services should not be neuters in public praises. 

 3. When the mercy was fresh, and they were much affected with it, then 
 they sang this song. Note, When we have received special mercy from 
 God, we ought to be quick and speedy in our returns of praise to him, 
 before time and the deceitfulness of our own hearts efface the good 
 impressions that have been made. David sang his triumphant song in the 
 day that the Lord delivered him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:1">2 Sam. xxii. 1</A>.

 <I>Bis dat qui cito dat--He gives twice who gives quickly.</I> 

 4. When they <I>believed the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 31</A>)

 then they sang this song: it was a song of faith; this connection is
 observed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:12">Ps. cvi. 12</A>):

 <I>Then believed they his words, they sang his praise.</I> If with the
 heart man believes, thus confession must be made. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The song itself; and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We may observe respecting this song, that it is, 

 (1.) An ancient song, the most ancient that we know of. 

 (2.) A most admirable composition, the style lofty and magnificent, the
 images lively and proper, and the whole very moving. 

 (3.) It is a holy song, consecrated to the honour of God, and intended
 to exalt his name and celebrate his praise, and his only, not in the 
 least to magnify any man: holiness to the Lord is engraven in it, and 
 to him they made melody in the singing of it. 

 (4.) It is a typical song. The triumphs of the gospel church, in the
 downfall of its enemies, are expressed in the song of Moses and the 
 song of the Lamb put together, which are said to be sung upon a sea of 
 glass, as this was upon the Red Sea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:2,3">Rev. xv. 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us observe what Moses chiefly aims at in this song.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gives glory to God, and triumphs in him; this is first in his 
 intention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I will sing unto the Lord.</I> Note, All our joy must terminate in 
 God, and all our praises be offered up to him, the Father of lights and 
 Father of mercies, <I>for he hath triumphed.</I> Note, All that love 
 God triumph in his triumphs; what is his honour should be our joy. 
 Israel rejoiced in God, 

 [1.] As their own God, and therefore their <I>strength, song,</I> and
 <I>salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Happy therefore the people whose God is the Lord; they need no more to 
 make them happy. They have work to do, temptations to grapple with,
 and afflictions to bear, and are weak in themselves; but he strengthens 
 them: his grace is their strength. They are often in sorrow, upon many 
 accounts, but in him they have comfort, he is <I>their song;</I> sin, 
 and death, and hell, threaten them, but he is, and will be, <I>their 
 salvation:</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:2">Isa. xii. 2</A>.

 [2.] <I>As their fathers' God.</I> This they take notice of, because,
 being conscious to themselves of their own unworthiness and 
 provocations, they had reason to think that what God had now done for 
 them was for their <I>fathers' sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:37">Deut. iv. 37</A>.

 Note, The children of the covenant ought to improve their fathers'
 relation to God as their God for comfort, for caution, and for 
 quickening. 
 
 [3.] As a God of infinite power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The Lord is a man of war,</I> that is, well able to deal with all 
 those that strive with their Maker, and will certainly be too hard for 
 them. 

 [4.] As a God of matchless and incomparable perfection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This is expressed, <I>First,</I> More generally: <I>Who is like unto 
 thee, O Lord, among the gods!</I> This is pure praise, and a high 
 expression of humble adoration.--It is a challenge to all other gods to 
 compare with him: "Let them stand forth, and pretend their utmost; none 
 of them dare make the comparison." Egypt was notorious for the 
 multitude of its gods, but the <I>God of the Hebrews</I> was too hard 
 for them and baffled them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:4,De+32:23-39">Num. xxxiii. 4; Deut. xxxii. 23-39</A>.

 The princes and potentates of the world are called <I>gods,</I> but
 they are feeble and mortal, none of them all comparable to Jehovah, the 
 almighty and eternal God.--It is confession of his infinite perfection, 
 as transcendent and unparalleled. Note, God is to be worshipped and 
 adored as a being of such infinite perfection that there is none like 
 him, nor any to be compared with him, as one that in all things has and 
 must have the pre-eminence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:6">Ps. lxxxix. 6</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> More particularly, 

 1. <I>He is glorious in holiness;</I> his holiness is his glory. It is 
 that attribute which angels adore,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa. vi. 3</A>.

 His holiness appeared in the destruction of Pharaoh, his hatred of sin,
 and his wrath against obstinate sinners. It appeared in the deliverance 
 of Israel, his delight in the holy seed, and his faithfulness to his 
 own promise. God is <I>rich in mercy</I>--this is his treasure, 
 <I>glorious in holiness</I>--this is his honour. Let us always give 
 thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 

 2. <I>He is fearful in praises.</I> That which is the matter of our 
 praise, though it is joyful to the servants of God, is dreadful and 
 very terrible to his enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:1-3">Ps. lxvi. 1-3</A>.

 Or it directs us in the manner of our praising God; we should praise
 him with a humble holy awe, and <I>serve the Lord with fear.</I> Even
 our spiritual joy and triumph must be balanced with a religious fear.
 
 3. He is <I>doing wonders,</I> wondrous to all, being above the power
 and out of the common course of nature; especially wondrous to us, in 
 whose favour they are wrought, who are so unworthy that we had little 
 reason to expect them. They were wonders of power and wonders of grace; 
 in both God was to be humbly adored.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He describes the deliverance they were now triumphing in, because 
 the song was intended, not only to express and excite their 
 thankfulness for the present, but to preserve and perpetuate the 
 remembrance of this work of wonder to after-ages. Two things were to be 
 taken notice of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The destruction of the enemy; the waters were divided,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>The floods stood upright as a heap.</I> Pharaoh and all his hosts 
 were buried in the waters. <I>The horse and his rider</I> could not 
 escape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 the <I>chariots,</I> and the <I>chosen captains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they themselves went into the sea, and they were overwhelmed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>The depths, the sea, covered them,</I> and the proud waters went 
 over the proud sinners; they <I>sank like a stone, like lead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:5,10"><I>v.</I> 5, 10</A>),

 under the weight of their own guilt and God's wrath. Their sin had made 
 them hard like a stone, and now they justly sink like a stone. Nay,
 <I>the earth itself swallowed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 their dead bodies sank into the sands upon which they were thrown up, 
 which sucked them in. Those whom the Creator fights against the whole
 creation is at war with. All this was the Lord's doing, and his only. 
 It was an act of his power: <I>Thy right hand, O Lord,</I> not ours, 
 <I>has dashed in pieces the enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It was with <I>the blast of thy nostrils</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and <I>thy wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and the <I>stretching out of thy right hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was an instance of his transcendent power--in <I>the greatness of 
 thy excellency;</I> and it was the execution of his justice: <I>Thou 
 sentest forth thy wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This destruction of the Egyptians was made the more remarkable by their 
 pride and insolence, and their strange assurance of success: <I>The 
 enemy said, I will pursue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Here is, <I>First,</I> Great confidence. When they pursue, they do not 
 question but they shall overtake; and, when they overtake, they do not 
 question but they shall overcome, and obtain so decisive a victory as 
 to <I>divide the spoil.</I> Note, It is common for men to be most 
 elevated with the hope of success when they are upon the brink of ruin, 
 which makes their ruin so much the sorer. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:24,25">Isa. xxxvii. 24, 25</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Great cruelty--nothing but killing, and slaying, and 
 destroying, and this will satisfy his lust; and a barbarous lust that 
 is which so much blood must be the satisfaction of. Note, It is a
 cruel hatred with which the church is hated; its enemies are bloody 
 men. This is taken notice of here to show, 

 1. That God resists the proud, and delights to humble those who lift up 
 themselves; he that says, "I will, and I will, whether God will or no," 
 shall be made to know that wherein he deals proudly God is above him. 
 
 2. That those who thirst for blood shall have enough of it. Those who
 love to be destroying shall be destroyed; for we know who has said, 
 <I>Vengeance is mine, I will repay.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The protection and guidance of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people,</I> led them forth out 
 of the bondage Egypt, led them forth out of the perils of the Red Sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>But the children of Israel went on dry land.</I> Note, The 
 destruction of the wicked serves for a foil to set off the salvation of 
 Israel, and to make it the more illustrious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13-15">Isa. xlv. 13-15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He sets himself to improve this wonderful appearance of God for 
 them. 

 [1.] In order to quicken them to serve God: in consideration of this,
 <I>I will prepare him habitation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 God having preserved them, and prepared a covert for them under which 
 they had been safe and easy, they resolve to spare no cost nor pains 
 for the erecting of a tabernacle to his honour, and there they will 
 exalt him, and mention, to his praise, the honour he had got upon 
 Pharaoh. God had now exalted them, making them great and high, and 
 therefore they will exalt him, by speaking of his infinite height and 
 grandeur. Note, Our constant endeavour should be, by praising his name 
 and serving his interests, to exalt God; and it is an advancement to us 
 to be so employed. 

 [2.] In order to encourage them to trust in God. So confident is this
 Psalmist of the happy issue of the salvation which was so gloriously 
 begun that he looks upon it as in effect finished already: "<I>Thou 
 hast guided them to thy holy habitation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Thou hast thus put them into the way to it, and wilt in due time bring 
 them to the end of that way," for God's work is perfect; or, "<I>Thou 
 hast guided them</I> to attend thy holy habitation in heaven with their 
 praises." Note, Those whom God takes under his direction he will guide 
 to his holy habitation in faith now, and in fruition shortly. Two ways 
 this great deliverance was encouraging:--<I>First,</I> It was such an 
 instance of God's power as would terrify their enemies, and quite 
 dishearten them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 The very report of the overthrow of the Egyptians would be more than 
 half the over throw of all their other enemies; it would sink their 
 spirits, which would go far towards the sinking of their powers and 
 interests; the Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, and Canaanites (with
 each of which nations Israel was to grapple), would be alarmed by it, 
 would be quite dispirited, and would conclude it was in vain to fight 
 against Israel, when a God of such power fought for them. It had this 
 effect; the Edomites were afraid of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:4">Deut. ii. 4</A>),

 so were the Moabites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:3">Num. xxii. 3</A>),

 and the Canaanites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9,10,5:1">Josh. ii. 9, 10; v. 1</A>.

 Thus God sent his fear before them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 27</A>),

 and cut off the spirit of princes. <I>Secondly,</I> It was such a
 beginning of God's favour to them as gave them an earnest of he 
 perfection of his kindness. This was but in order to something further: 
 <I>Thou shalt bring them in,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 If he thus <I>bring them out of Egypt,</I> notwithstanding their 
 unworthiness, and the difficulties that lay in the way of their escape, 
 doubtless he will bring them into Canaan; for has he begun (<I>so</I> 
 begun), and will he not make an end? Note, Our experiences of God's 
 power and favour should be improved for the support of our 
 expectations. "Thou <I>hast,</I> therefore, not only thou <I>canst,</I> 
 but we trust thou <I>wilt,</I>" is good arguing. <I>Thou wilt plant 
 them in the place which thou has made for thee to dwell in.</I> Note, 
 It is good dwelling where God dwells, in his church on earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>),

 in his church in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 Where he says, "This is my rest for ever," we should say, "Let it be
 ours." <I>Lastly,</I> The great ground of the encouragement which they 
 draw from this work of wonder is, <I>The Lord shall reign for ever and 
 ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They had now seen an end of Pharaoh's reign; but time itself shall not 
 put a period to Jehovah's reign, which, like himself, is eternal, and 
 not subject to change. Note, It is the unspeakable comfort of all God's 
 faithful subjects, not only that he does reign universally and with an 
 incontestable sovereignty, but that he will reign eternally, and there

 II. The solemn singing of this song, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 Miriam (or Mary, it is the same name) presided in an assembly of the 
 women, who (according to the softness of their sex, and the common 
 usage of those times for expressing joy, with timbrels and dances) sang 
 this song. Moses led the psalm, and gave it out for the men, and then 
 Miriam for the women. Famous victories were wont to be applauded by
 the daughters of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:6,7">1 Sam. xviii. 6, 7</A>);

 so was this. When God brought Israel out of Egypt, it is said 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4">Micah vi. 4</A>),

 <I>He sent before them Moses, Aaron, and Miriam,</I> though we read not
 of any thing memorable that Miriam did but this. But those are to be 
 reckoned great blessings to a people who assist them, and go before 
 them, in praising God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
 into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
 wilderness, and found no water.
 &nbsp; 23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
 waters of Marah, for they <I>were</I> bitter: therefore the name of it
 was called Marah.
 &nbsp; 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
 drink?
 &nbsp; 25 And he cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> showed him a tree,
 <I>which</I> when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
 sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
 there he proved them,
 &nbsp; 26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
 and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes,
 I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought
 upon the Egyptians: for I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that healeth thee.
 &nbsp; 27 And they came to Elim, where <I>were</I> twelve wells of water,
 and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
 waters.

 It should seem, it was with some difficulty that Moses prevailed with 
 Israel to leave that triumphant shore on which they sang the foregoing 
 song. They were so taken up with the sight, or with the song, or with 
 the spoiling of the dead bodies, that they cared not to go forward, but 
 Moses with much ado brought them from the Red Sea into a wilderness. 
 The pleasures of our way to Canaan must not retard our progress, but 
 quicken it, though we have a wilderness before us. Now here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That in the wilderness of Shur they had no water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This was a sore trial to the young travellers, and a diminution to 
 their joy; thus God would train them up to difficulties. David, in a 
 dry and thirsty land where no water is, reaches forth towards God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1">Ps. lxiii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That at Marah they had water, but it was bitter, so that though 
 they had been three days without water they could not drink it, because 
 it was extremely unpleasant to the taste or was likely to be 
 prejudicial to their health, or was so brackish that it rather 
 increased their thirst than quenched it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, God can embitter that to us from which we promise ourselves most 
 satisfaction, and often does so in the wilderness of this world, that 
 our wants and disappointments in the creature may drive us to the 
 Creator, in whose favour alone true comfort is to be had. Now in this 
 distress, 

 1. The people fretted and quarrelled with Moses, as if he had done ill 
 by them. <I>What shall we drink?</I> is all their clamour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Note, The greatest joys and hopes are soon turned into the greatest 
 griefs and fears with those that live by sense only, and not by faith.
 
 2. Moses prayed: <I>He cried unto the Lord,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The complaints which they brought to him he brought to God, on whom, 
 notwithstanding his elevation, Moses owned a constant dependence. Note, 
 It is the greatest relief of the cares of magistrates and ministers, 
 when those under their charge make them uneasy, that they may have 
 recourse to God by prayer: he is the guide of the church's guides and 
 to him, as the Chief Shepherd, the under-shepherds must upon all 
 occasions apply. 

 3. God provided graciously for them. He directed Moses to a tree, which 
 he cast into the waters, in consequence of which, all of a sudden, they 
 were made sweet. Some think this wood had a peculiar virtue in it for 
 this purpose, because it is said, <I>God showed him the tree.</I> God 
 is to be acknowledged, not only in the creating of things useful for 
 man, but in discovering their usefulness.  Or perhaps this was only a 
 sign, and not at all a means, of the cure, any more than the brazen 
 serpent, or Elisha's casting one cruse full of salt into the waters of 
 Jericho. Some make this tree typical of the cross of Christ, which 
 sweetens the bitter waters of affliction to all the faithful, and 
 enables them to rejoice in tribulation. The Jews' tradition is that the 
 wood of this tree was itself bitter, yet it sweetened the waters of 
 Marah; the bitterness of Christ's sufferings and death alters the 
 property of ours. 

 4. Upon this occasion, God came upon terms with them, and plainly told 
 them, now that they had got clear of the Egyptians, and had entered 
 into the wilderness, that they were upon their good behaviour, and that 
 according as they carried themselves so it would be well or ill with 
 them: <I>There he made a statute and an ordinance,</I> and settled 
 matters with them. <I>There he proved them,</I> that is, there he put 
 them upon the trial, admitted them as probationers for his favour. In 
 short, he tells them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,
 
 (1.) What he expected from them, and that was, in one word, obedience.
 They must diligently <I>hearken to his voice, and give ear to his 
 commandments,</I> that they might know their duty, and not transgress 
 through ignorance; and they must take care in every thing to do that 
 which was right in God's sight, and to <I>keep all his statutes.</I> 
 They must not think, now that they were delivered from their bondage in 
 Egypt, that they had no lord over them, but were their own masters; no, 
 therefore they must look upon themselves as God's servants, because he 
 had <I>loosed their bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16,Lu+1:74,75">Ps. cxvi. 16; Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 (2.) What they might then expect from him: <I>I will put none of these
 diseases upon thee,</I> that is, "I will not bring upon thee any of the 
 plagues of Egypt." This intimates that, if they were rebellious and 
 disobedient, the very plagues which they had seen inflicted upon their 
 enemies should be brought upon them; so it is threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:60">Deut. xxviii. 60</A>.

 God's judgments upon Egypt, as they were mercies to Israel, opening the 
 way to their deliverance, so they were warnings to Israel, and designed 
 to awe them into obedience. Let not the Israelites think, because God 
 had thus highly honoured them in the great things he had done for them, 
 and had proclaimed them to all the world his favourites, that therefore 
 he would connive at their sins and let them do as they would. No, God 
 is no respecter of persons; a rebellious Israelite shall fare no better 
 than a rebellious Egyptian; and so they found, to their cost, before 
 they got to Canaan. "But, if thou wilt be obedient, thou shalt be safe
 and happy;" the threatening is implied only, but the promise is 
 expressed: "<I>I am the Lord that healeth thee,</I> and will take care 
 of thy comfort wherever thou goest." Note, God is the great physician.  
 If we be kept well, it is he that keeps us; if we be made well, it is 
 he that restores us; he is our life, and the length of our days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That at Elim they had good water, and enough of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Though God may, for a time, order his people to encamp by the waters of 
 Marah, yet that shall not always be their lot. See how changeable our 
 condition is in this world, from better to worse, from worse to better.
 Let us therefore learn both how to be abased and how to abound, to 
 rejoice as though we rejoiced not when we are full, and to weep as 
 though we wept not when we are emptied. Here were twelve wells for 
 their supply, one for every tribe, that they might not strive for 
 water, as their fathers had sometimes done; and, for their pleasure, 
 there were seventy palm-trees, under the shadow of which their great 
 men might repose themselves. Note, God can find places of refreshment 
 for his people even in the wilderness of this world, wells in the 
 valley of Baca, lest they should faint in their mind with perpetual 
 fatigue: yet, whatever our delights may be in the land of our 
 pilgrimage, we must remember that we do but encamp by them for a time, 
 that here we have no continuing city.</P>
