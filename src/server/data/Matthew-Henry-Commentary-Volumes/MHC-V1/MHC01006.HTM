 The most remarkable thing we have upon record concerning the 
 old world is the destruction of it by the universal deluge, the 
 account of which commences in this chapter, wherein we have, 
 
 I. The abounding iniquity of that wicked world, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>,
 and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 II. The righteous God's just resentment of that
 abounding iniquity, and his holy resolution to punish
 it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 III. The special favour of God to his servant Noah.

 1. In
 the character given of him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 2. In the communication
 of God's purpose to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:13,17">ver. 13, 17</A>.

 3. In the directions he 
 gave him to make an ark for his own safety, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.
 
 4. In 
 the employing of him for the preservation of the rest of the 
 creatures, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>.
 Lastly, Noah's obedience to the instructions
 given him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:22">ver. 22</A>.
 And this concerning the old world
 is written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the new
 world have come.</P></FONT>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, when men 
 began to multiply on the face 
 of the earth, and daughters were 
 born unto them,
 &nbsp; 2 That the sons of 
 God saw the daughters of men that 
 they <I>were</I> fair; and they took them 
 wives of all which they chose.
 </FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the glory of God's justice, and for 
 warning to a wicked world, before the history 
 of the ruin of the old world, we have a full 
 account of its degeneracy, its apostasy from 
 God and rebellion against him. The destroying 
 of it was an act, not of an absolute sovereignty, 
 but of necessary justice, for the 
 maintaining of the honour of God's government. 
 Now here we have an account of two 
 things which occasioned the wickedness of 
 the old world:--
 
 1. The increase of mankind: 
 <I>Men began to multiply upon the face of the 
 earth.</I> This was the effect of the blessing 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>),
 and yet man's corruption so abused 
 and perverted this blessing that it was turned 
 into a curse. Thus sin takes occasion by 
 the mercies of God to be the more exceedingly 
 sinful. 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:16">Prov. xxix. 16</A>,
 <I>When the wicked are 
 multiplied, transgression increaseth.</I> The more 
 sinners the more sin; and the multitude of offenders 
 emboldens men. Infectious diseases 
 are most destructive in populous cities; 
 and sin is a spreading leprosy. Thus in the 
 New-Testament church, <I>when the number of 
 the disciples was multiplied, there arose a 
 murmuring</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1">Acts vi. 1</A>),
 and we read of a 
 nation that was multiplied, not to the increase 
 of their joy, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:3">Isa. ix. 3</A>.
 Numerous families 
 need to be well-governed, lest they become 
 wicked families. 
 
 2. Mixed marriages 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 <I>The sons of God</I> (that is, the professors of 
 religion, who were called by the name of the 
 Lord, and called upon that name), <I>married 
 the daughters of men,</I> that is, those that were 
 profane, and strangers to God and godliness. 
 The posterity of Seth did not keep by themselves, 
 as they ought to have done, both for 
 the preservation of their own purity and in 
 detestation of the apostasy. They intermingled 
 themselves with the excommunicated 
 race of Cain: <I>They took them wives of all 
 that they chose.</I> But what was amiss in these 
 marriages? 
 
 (1.) They chose only by the 
 eye: <I>They saw that they were fair,</I> which was 
 all they looked at. 
 
 (2.) They followed the 
 choice which their own corrupt affections 
 made: they took <I>all that they chose,</I> without 
 advice and consideration. But, 
 
 (3.) That 
 which proved of such bad consequence to 
 them was that they <I>married strange wives, 
 were unequally yoked with unbelievers,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14">2 Cor. vi. 14</A>.
 This was forbidden to Israel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3,4">Deut. vii. 3, 4</A>.
 It was the unhappy occasion of 
 Solomon's apostasy 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:1-4">1 Kings xi. 1-4</A>),
 and was of bad consequence to the Jews after 
 their return out of Babylon, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:1,2">Ezra ix. 1, 2</A>.
 Note, Professors of religion, in marrying 
 both themselves and their children, should 
 make conscience of keeping within the bounds 
 of profession. The bad will sooner debauch 
 the good than the good reform the bad. 
 Those that profess themselves the children 
 of God must not marry without his consent, 
 which they have not if they join in affinity 
 with his enemies.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge6_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, My spirit 
 shall not always strive with man, for 
 that he also <I>is</I> flesh: yet his days 
 shall be a hundred and twenty years.</FONT></P>


 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This comes in here as a token of God's 
 displeasure at those who married strange 
 wives; he threatens to withdraw from them 
 his Spirit, whom they had grieved by such 
 marriages, contrary to their convictions: 
 fleshly lusts are often punished with spiritual 
 judgments, the sorest of all judgments. Or 
 as another occasion of the great wickedness 
 of the old world; the Spirit of the Lord, 
 being provoked by their resistance of his 
 motions, ceased to strive with them, and then 
 all religion was soon lost among them. This 
 he warns them of before, that they might not 
 further vex his Holy Spirit, but by their 
 prayers might stay him with them. Observe 
 in this verse,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's resolution not always to strive 
 with man by his Spirit. The Spirit then 
 strove by Noah's preaching 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:19,20">1 Pet. iii. 19, 20</A>)
 and by inward checks, but it was in vain 
 with the most of men; therefore, says God, 
 <I>He shall not always strive.</I> Note, 
 
 1. The 

 <A NAME="Page52"> </A>

 blessed Spirit strives with sinners, by the 
 convictions and admonitions of conscience, 
 to turn them from sin to God. 
 
 2. If the 
 Spirit be resisted, quenched, and striven 
 against, though he strive long, he will not 
 strive always, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17">Hos. iv. 17</A>.

 3. Those are 
 ripening apace for ruin whom the Spirit of 
 grace has left off striving with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reason of this resolution: <I>For that 
 he also is flesh,</I> that is, incurably corrupt, and 
 carnal, and sensual, so that it is labour lost 
 to strive with him. Can the Ethiopian 
 change his skin? <I>He also,</I> that is, All, one 
 as well as another, they have all sunk into 
 the mire of flesh. Note, 
 
 1. It is the corrupt 
 nature, and the inclination of the soul towards 
 the flesh, that oppose the Spirit's 
 strivings and render them ineffectual. 
 
 2. When a sinner has long adhered to that 
 interest, and sided with the flesh against the 
 Spirit, the Spirit justly withdraws his agency, 
 and strives no more. None lose the Spirit's 
 strivings but those that have first forfeited 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A reprieve granted, notwithstanding: 
 <I>Yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty 
 years;</I> so long I will defer the judgment 
 they deserve, and give them space to prevent 
 it by their repentance and reformation. Justice 
 said, <I>Cut them down;</I> but mercy interceded, 
 <I>Lord, let them alone this year also;</I> 
 and so far mercy prevailed, that a reprieve 
 was obtained for six-score years. Note, The 
 time of God's patience and forbearance towards 
 provoking sinners is sometimes long, 
 but always limited: reprieves are not pardons; 
 though God bear a great while, he will not 
 bear always.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 There were giants in the earth 
 in those days; and also after that, 
 when the sons of God came in unto 
 the daughters of men, and they bare 
 <I>children</I> to them, the same <I>became</I> 
 mighty men which <I>were</I> of old, men 
 of renown.
 &nbsp; 5 And G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> saw that 
 the wickedness of man <I>was</I> great in 
 the earth, and <I>that</I> every imagination 
 of the thoughts of his heart <I>was</I> only 
 evil continually.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the 
 corruption of the old world. When the <I>sons 
 of God</I> had matched with the <I>daughters of 
 men,</I> though it was very displeasing to God, 
 yet he did not immediately cut them off, but 
 waited to see what would be the issue of 
 these marriages, and which side the children 
 would take after; and it proved (as usually 
 it does), that they took after the worst side. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The temptation they were under to 
 oppress and do violence. They were <I>giants,</I> 
 and they were <I>men of renown;</I> they became 
 too hard for all about them, and carried all 
 before them, 1. With their great bulk, as 
 the sons of Anak, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:33">Num. xiii. 33</A>.

 2. With 
 their great name, as the king of Assyria, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:11">Isa. xxxvii. 11</A>.
 These made them the <I>terror 
 of the mighty in the land of the living;</I> and, 
 thus armed, they daringly insulted the rights 
 of all their neighbours and trampled upon 
 all that is just and sacred. Note, Those 
 that have so much power over others as to 
 be able to oppress them have seldom so 
 much power over themselves as not to oppress; 
 great might is a very great snare to many. 
 This degenerate race slighted the honour 
 their ancestors had obtained by virtue and 
 religion, and made themselves a great name 
 by that which was the perpetual ruin of 
 their good name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The charge exhibited and proved 
 against them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 The evidence produced 
 was incontestable. God saw it, and that 
 was instead of a thousand witnesses. God 
 sees all the wickedness that is among the 
 children of men; it cannot be concealed from 
 him now, and, if it be not repented of, it 
 shall not be concealed by him shortly. Now 
 what did God take notice of? 
 
 1. He observed 
 that the streams of sin that flowed along in 
 men's lives, and the breadth and depth of 
 those streams: He <I>saw that the wickedness
 of man was great in the earth.</I> Observe the 
 connection of this with what goes before: 
 the oppressors were <I>mighty men and men of 
 renown;</I> and, <I>then, God saw that the wickedness 
 of man was great.</I> Note, The wickedness 
 of a people is great indeed when the 
 most notorious sinners are men of renown 
 among them. Things are bad when bad 
 men are not only honoured notwithstanding 
 their wickedness, but honoured for their 
 wickedness, and the vilest men exalted. 
 Wickedness is then great when great men 
 are wicked. Their wickedness was great, 
 that is, abundance of sin was committed in 
 all places, by all sorts of people; and such 
 sin as was in its own nature most gross, and 
 heinous, and provoking; it was committed 
 daringly, and with a defiance of heaven, nor 
 was any care taken by those that had power 
 in their hands to restrain and punish it. 
 This God saw. Note, All the sins of sinners 
 are known to God the Judge. Those that 
 are most conversant in the world, though 
 they see much wickedness in it, yet they 
 see but little of that which is; but God sees 
 all, and judges aright concerning it, how 
 great it is, nor can he be deceived in his 
 judgment. 
 
 2. He observed the fountain of 
 sin that was in men's hearts. Any one might 
 see that <I>the wickedness of man was great,</I> for 
 they declared their sin as Sodom; but God's 
 eye went further: <I>He saw that every imagination 
 of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
 continually</I>--a sad sight, and very offensive 
 to God's holy eye! This was the bitter root, 
 the corrupt spring: all the violence and 
 oppression, all the luxury and wantonness, 
 that were in the world, proceeded from the 
 corruption of nature; lust conceived them, 

 <A NAME="Page53"> </A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">Jam. i. 15</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:19">Matt. xv. 19</A>.

 (1.) The heart was naught; it was deceitful and desperately 
 wicked. The principles were corrupt, 
 and the habits and dispositions evil. 
 
 (2.) The thoughts of the heart were so. 
 Thought is sometimes taken for the settled 
 judgment or opinion, and this was bribed, 
 and biased, and misled; sometimes it signifies 
 the workings of the fancy, and these were 
 always either vain or vile, either weaving the 
 spider's web or hatching the cockatrice's egg. 
 
 (3.) The imagination of the thoughts of the 
 heart was so, that is, their designs and 
 devices were wicked. They did not do evil 
 through mere carelessness, as those that 
 walk at all adventures, not heeding what 
 they do; but they did evil deliberately and 
 designedly, contriving how to do mischief. 
 It was bad indeed; for it was only evil, continually 
 evil, and every imagination was so. 
 There was no good to be found among them, 
 no, not at any time: the stream of sin was 
 full, and strong, and constant; and God saw 
 it; see 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1-3">Ps. xiv. 1-3</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And it repented the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that

 whom I have created from the face of

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. God's resentment of man's 
 wickedness. He did not see it as an unconcerned 
 spectator, but as one injured and 
 affronted by it; he saw it as a tender father 
 sees the folly and stubbornness of a rebellious 
 and disobedient child, which not 
 only angers him, but grieves him, and makes 
 him wish he had been written childless. 
 The expressions here used are very strange: 
 <I>It repented the Lord that he had made man 
 upon the earth,</I> that he had made a creature 
 of such noble powers and faculties, and had 
 put him on this earth, which he built and 
 furnished on purpose to be a convenient, 
 comfortable, habitation for him; <I>and it 
 grieved him at his heart.</I> These are expressions 
 after the manner of men, and 
 must be understood so as not to reflect upon 
 the honour of God's immutability or felicity. 
 
 1. This language does not imply 
 any passion or uneasiness in God (nothing 
 can create disturbance to the Eternal Mind), 
 but it expresses his just and holy displeasure 
 against sin and sinners, against sin as odious 
 to his holiness and against sinners as obnoxious 
 to his justice. He is pressed by 
 the sins of his creatures 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13">Amos ii. 13</A>),
 wearied
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:24">Isa. xliii. 24</A>),
 broken
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>),
 grieved
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. cxv. 10</A>),
 and here <I>grieved to 
 the heart,</I> as men are when they are wronged 
 and abused by those they have been very 
 kind to, and therefore repent of their kindness, 
 and wish they had never fostered that 
 snake in their bosom which now hisses in 
 their face and stings them to the heart. 
 Does God thus hate sin? And shall we not
 hate it? Has our sin grieved him to the 
 heart? And shall we not be grieved and 
 pricked to the heart for it? O that this 
 consideration may humble us and shame us, 
 and that we may look on him whom we 
 have thus grieved, and mourn! 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 2. It does not imply any change of God's 
 mind; for <I>he is in one mind, and who can 
 turn him?</I> With him <I>there is not variableness.</I> 
 But it expressed a change of his way. 
 When God had made man upright, <I>he rested 
 and was refreshed</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:17">Exod. xxxi. 17</A>),
 and his 
 way towards him was such as showed he 
 was pleased with the work of his own hands; 
 but, now that man had apostatized, he could 
 not do otherwise than show himself displeased; 
 so that the change was in man, 
 not in God. God repented that he had 
 made man; but we never find him repenting 
 that he redeemed man (though that was a 
 work of much greater expense), because 
 special and effectual grace is given to secure 
 the great ends of redemption; so that those 
 <I>gifts and callings are without repentance,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:29">Rom. xi. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's resolution to destroy man for 
 his wickedness, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. When God 
 repented that he had made man, he resolved 
 to destroy man. Thus those that truly repent 
 of sin will resolve, in the strength of 
 God's grace, to mortify sin and to destroy 
 it, and so to undo what they have done 
 amiss. We do but mock God in saying 
 that we are sorry for our sin, and that it 
 grieves us to the heart, if we continue to 
 indulge it. In vain do we pretend a change 
 of our mind if we do not evidence it by a 
 change of our way. 
 
 2. He resolves to destroy 
 man. The original word is very significant: 
 <I>I will wipe off man from the earth</I> 
 (so some), as dirt or filth is wiped off from 
 a place which should be clean, and is thrown 
 to the dunghill, the proper place for it. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:13">2 Kings xxi. 13</A>.
 Those that are the spots 
 of the places they live in are justly wiped 
 away by the judgments of God. <I>I will blot 
 out man from the earth</I> (so others), as those 
 lines which displease the author are blotted 
 out a book, or as the name of a citizen is 
 blotted out of the rolls of the freemen, when 
 he is dead or disfranchised. 
 
 3. He speaks 
 of man as his own creature even when he 
 resolves upon his ruin: <I>Man whom I have 
 created.</I> "Though I have created him, this 
 shall not excuse him,"
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:11">Isa. xxvii. 11</A>.
 <I>He that made him will not save him;</I> he that is 
 our Creator, if he be not our ruler, will be 
 our destroyer. Or, "Because I have created 
 him, and he has been so undutiful and ungrateful 
 to his Creator, therefore I will destroy 
 him:" those forfeit their lives that do 
 not answer the end of their living. 
 
 4. Even 
 the brute-creatures were to be involved in 

 <A NAME="Page54"> </A>

 this destruction--<I>Beasts, and creeping things, 
 and the fowls of the air.</I> These were made for 
 man, and therefore must be destroyed with 
 man; for it follows: <I>It repenteth me that I 
 have made them;</I> for the end of their creation 
 also was frustrated. They were made that 
 man might serve and honour God with 
 them; and therefore were destroyed because 
 he had served his lusts with them, and made 
 them subject to vanity. 
 
 5. God took up 
 this resolution concerning man after his 
 Spirit had been long striving with him in 
 vain. None are ruined by the justice of 
 God but those that hate to be reformed by 
 the grace of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 But Noah found grace in the 
 eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 These <I>are</I> the
 generations of Noah: Noah was a 
 just man <I>and</I> perfect in his generations, 
 <I>and</I> Noah walked with God.
 &nbsp; 10 And Noah begat three sons, 
 Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Noah distinguished from 
 the rest of the world, and a peculiar mark of 
 honour put upon him. 
 
 1. When God was 
 displeased with the rest of the world, he favoured 
 Noah: <I>But Noah found grace in the 
 eyes of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 This vindicates God's 
 justice in his displeasure against the world, 
 and shows that he had strictly examined the 
 character of every person in it before he pronounced 
 it universally corrupt; for, there 
 being one good man, he found him out, and 
 smiled upon him. It also magnifies his 
 grace towards Noah that he was made a vessel 
 of God's mercy when all mankind besides 
 had become the generation of his wrath: 
 distinguishing favours bring under peculiarly 
 strong obligations. Probably Noah did not 
 find favour in the eyes of men; they hated 
 and persecuted him, because both by his life 
 and preaching he <I>condemned the world. But 
 he found grace in the eyes of the Lord,</I> and 
 this was honour and comfort enough. God 
 made more account of Noah than of all the 
 world besides, and this made him greater 
 and more truly honourable than all the 
 giants that were in those days, who became 
 mighty men and men of renown. Let this 
 be the summit of our ambition, to <I>find grace 
 in the eyes of the Lord;</I> herein let us labour, 
 that, present or absent, we may be accepted 
 of him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>.
 Those are highly favoured 
 whom God favours. 
 
 2. When the 
 rest of the world was corrupt and wicked, 
 Noah kept his integrity: <I>These are the generations 
 of Noah</I> (this is the account we have 
 to give of him), <I>Noah was a just man,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 This character of Noah comes in here either, 
 
 (1.) As the reason of God's favour to him; 
 his singular piety qualified him for singular 
 tokens of God's loving-kindness. Those 
 that would find grace in the eyes of the 
 Lord must be as Noah was and do as Noah 
 did; God loves those that love him: or, 
 
 (2.) As the effect of God's favour to him. It was 
 God's good-will to him that produced this 
 good work in him. He was a very good 
 man, but he was no better than the grace of 
 God made him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10">1 Cor. xv. 10</A>.
 Now observe 
 his character. 
 
 [1.] He <I>was a just man,</I> that 
 is, justified before God by faith in the promised 
 seed; for he was an <I>heir of the righteousness 
 which is by faith,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7">Heb. xi. 7</A>.
 He was 
 sanctified, and had right principles and dispositions 
 implanted in him; and he was 
 righteous in his conversation, one that made 
 conscience of rendering to all their due, to 
 God his due and to men theirs. Note, 
 None but a downright honest man can 
 find favour with God. That conversation 
 which will be pleasing to God must be governed 
 by <I>simplicity and godly sincerity,</I> not 
 by <I>fleshly wisdom,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>.
 God has 
 sometimes chosen the foolish things of the 
 world, but he never chose the knavish things 
 of it. 
 
 [2.] He was <I>perfect,</I> not with a sinless 
 perfection, but a perfection of sincerity; 
 and it is well for us that by virtue of the 
 covenant of grace, upon the score of Christ's 
 righteousness, sincerity is accepted as our 
 gospel perfection. 
 
 [3.] He <I>walked with God,</I> 
 as Enoch had done before him. He was 
 not only honest, but devout; he <I>walked,</I> that 
 is, he acted with God, as one always under 
 his eye. He lived a life of communion with 
 God; it was his constant care to conform 
 himself to the will of God, to please him,
 and to approve himself to him. Note, God 
 looks down upon those with an eye of favour 
 who sincerely look up to him with an eye of 
 faith. But, 
 
 [4.] That which crowns his 
 character is that thus he was, and thus he 
 did, <I>in his generation,</I> in that corrupt degenerate 
 age in which his lot was cast. It is 
 easy to be religious when religion is in 
 fashion; but it is an evidence of strong faith 
 and resolution to swim against a stream to 
 heaven, and to appear for God when no one 
 else appears for him: so Noah did, and it 
 is upon record, to his immortal honour.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 The earth also was corrupt before 
 God, and the earth was filled 
 with violence.

 upon the earth, and, behold, it was 
 corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted 
 his way upon the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The wickedness of that generation is here 
 again spoken of, either as a foil to Noah's 
 piety--he was just and perfect, when all the 
 earth was corrupt; or as a further justification 
 of God's resolution to destroy the 
 world, which he was now about to communicate 
 to his servant Noah. 
 
 1. All kinds of 
 sin was found among them, for it is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 that the earth was, 
 
 (1.) <I>Corrupt before 
 God,</I> that is, in the matters of God's worship; 
 either they had other gods before him, 
 or they worshipped him by images, or they 
 were corrupt and wicked in despite and 

 <A NAME="Page55"> </A>

 contempt of God, daring him and defying him 
 to his face. 
 
 (2.) <I>The earth was also filled 
 with violence</I> and injustice towards men. 
 There was no order nor regular government; 
 no man was safe in the possession of that 
 which he had the most clear and incontestable 
 right to, no, not the most innocent life; 
 there was nothing but murders, rapes, and 
 rapine. Note, Wickedness, as it is the 
 shame of human nature, so it is the ruin of 
 human society. Take away conscience and 
 the fear of God, and men become beasts and 
 devils to one another, like the fishes of the 
 sea, where the greater devour the less. Sin 
 fills the earth with violence, and so turns the 
 world into a wilderness, into a cock-pit. 
 
 2. The proof and evidence of it were undeniable; 
 for <I>God looked upon the earth,</I> and was 
 himself an eye-witness of the corruption that was 
 in it, of which before, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 The righteous 
 Judge in all his judgments proceeds 
 upon the infallible certainty of his own omniscience, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:13">Ps. xxxiii. 13</A>.

 3. That which 
 most aggravated the matter was the universal 
 spreading of the contagion: <I>All flesh had 
 corrupted his way.</I> It was not some particular 
 nations or cities that were thus wicked, 
 but the whole world of mankind were so; 
 there was none that did good, no, not one 
 besides Noah. Note, When wickedness has 
 become general and universal ruin is not far 
 off; while there is a remnant of praying 
 people in a nation, to empty the measure as 
 it fills, judgments may be kept off a great while; 
 but when all hands are at work to 
 pull down the fences by sin, and none stand 
 in the gap to make up the breach, what can 
 be expected but an inundation of wrath?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And God said unto Noah, The 
 end of all flesh is come before me; 
 for the earth is filled with violence 
 through them; and, behold, I will 
 destroy them with the earth.
 &nbsp; 14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; 
 rooms shalt thou make in the ark, 
 and shalt pitch it within and without 
 with pitch.
 &nbsp; 15 And this <I>is the fashion</I> 
 which thou shalt make it <I>of:</I> The
 length of the ark <I>shall be</I> three hundred 
 cubits, the breadth of it fifty 
 cubits, and the height of it thirty 
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 16 A window shalt thou 
 make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt
 thou finish it above; and the door of 
 the ark shalt thou set in the side 
 thereof; <I>with</I> lower, second, and 
 third <I>stories</I> shalt thou make it.
 &nbsp; 17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring 
 a flood of waters upon the earth, to 
 destroy all flesh, wherein <I>is</I> the breath 
 of life, from under heaven; <I>and</I> every 
 thing that <I>is</I> in the earth shall die.
 &nbsp; 18 But with thee will I establish my 
 covenant; and thou shalt come into 
 the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy 
 wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
 &nbsp; 19 And of every living thing of all 
 flesh, two of every <I>sort</I> shalt thou 
 bring into the ark, to keep <I>them</I> alive 
 with thee; they shall be male and 
 female.
 &nbsp; 20 Of fowls after their kind, 
 and of cattle after their kind, of every 
 creeping thing of the earth after his 
 kind, two of every <I>sort</I> shall come 
 unto thee, to keep <I>them</I> alive.
 &nbsp; 21 And take thou unto thee of all food 
 that is eaten, and thou shalt gather 
 <I>it</I> to thee; and it shall be for food 
 for thee, and for them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here it appears indeed that Noah <I>found 
 grace in the eyes of the Lord.</I> God's favour 
 to him was plainly intimated in what he 
 said of him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>,
 where his name is 
 mentioned five times in five lines, when 
 once might have served to make the sense
 clear, as if the Holy Ghost took a pleasure 
 in perpetuating his memory; but it appears 
 much more in what he says to him in these 
 verses--the informations and instructions 
 here given him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God here makes Noah the <I>man of his 
 counsel,</I> communicating to him his purpose to 
 destroy this wicked world by water. As, afterwards, 
 he told Abraham his resolution concerning 
 Sodom 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:17"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 17</A>,
 <I>Shall I hide from 
 Abraham?</I>) so here "Shall I hide from Noah 
 <I>the thing that I do,</I> seeing that he shall <I>become 
 a great nation?</I>" Note, <I>The secret of 
 the Lord is with those that fear him</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>);
 it was with <I>his servants the prophets</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7">Amos iii. 7</A>),
 by a spirit of revelation, informing 
 them particularly of his purposes; 
 it is with all believers by a spirit of wisdom 
 and faith, enabling them to understand and 
 apply the general declarations of the written 
 word, and the warnings there given. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God told Noah, in general, that he 
 would destroy the world 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 <I>The end of 
 all flesh has come before me; I will destroy 
 them;</I> that is, the ruin of this wicked 
 world is decreed and determined; <I>it has 
 come,</I> that is, it will come surely, and come 
 quickly. Noah, it is likely, in preaching to 
 his neighbours, had warned them, in general, 
 of the wrath of God that they would bring 
 upon themselves by their wickedness, and 
 now God seconds his endeavours by a particular 
 denunciation of wrath, that Noah 
 might try whether this would work upon 
 them. Hence observe, (1.) That God <I>confirmeth 
 the words of his messengers,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.
 
 (2.) That <I>to him that has,</I> and 
 uses what he has for the good of others, <I>more 
 shall be given,</I> more full instructions.</P>

 <A NAME="Page56"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He told him, particularly, that he would 
 destroy the world by a flood of waters: 
 <I>And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of 
 waters upon the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 God could
 have destroyed all mankind by the sword of 
 an angel, a flaming sword turning every way, 
 as he destroyed all the first-born of the 
 Egyptians and the camp of the Assyrians; 
 and then there needed no more than to set a 
 mark upon Noah and his family for their 
 preservation. But God chose to do it by a 
 <I>flood of waters,</I> which should drown the 
 world. The reasons, we may be sure, were 
 wise and just, though to us unknown. God 
 has many arrows in his quiver, and he may 
 use which he please: as he chooses the rod 
 with which he will correct his children, so 
 he chooses the sword with which he will cut 
 off his enemies. Observe the manner of 
 expression: "<I>I, even I, do bring a flood;</I> I that 
 am infinite in power, and therefore <I>can</I> do 
 it, infinite in justice, and therefore <I>will</I> do it." 
 
 (1.) It intimates the certainty of the judgment: 
 <I>I, even I,</I> will do it. That cannot but 
 be done effectually which God himself undertakes 
 the doing of. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:10">Job xi. 10</A>.

 (2.) It intimates the tendency of it to God's 
 glory and the honour of his justice. Thus 
 he will be magnified and exalted in the earth, 
 and all the world shall be made to know that 
 he is the God <I>to whom vengeance belongs;</I> 
 methinks the expression here is somewhat 
 like that, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>,
 <I>Ah, I will ease me of 
 mine adversaries.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God here makes Noah the <I>man of his 
 covenant,</I> another Hebrew periphrasis of a 
 friend 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 <I>But with thee will I establish 
 my covenant.</I> 
 
 1. The covenant of providence, 
 that the course of nature shall be continued 
 to the end of time, notwithstanding the interruption 
 which the flood would give to it. 
 This promise was immediately made to Noah and 
 his sons, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:8-11"><I>ch.</I> ix. 8</A>,
 &c. They were as
 trustees for all this part of the creation, and 
 a great honour was thereby put upon him 
 and his. 
 
 2. The covenant of grace, that 
 God would be to him a God and that out of
 his seed God would take to himself a people. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) When God makes a covenant, 
 he establishes it, he makes it sure, he makes 
 it good; his are everlasting covenants. 
 
 (2.) The covenant of grace has in it the recompence 
 of singular services, and the fountain 
 and foundation of all distinguishing favours; 
 we need desire no more, either to make up 
 our losses for God or to make up a happiness 
 for us in God, than to have his covenant 
 established with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God here makes Noah a monument 
 of sparing mercy, by putting him in a way to 
 secure himself in the approaching deluge, 
 that he might not perish with the rest of the 
 world: <I>I will destroy them,</I> says God, <I>with 
 the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 "But <I>make thee an ark;</I> 
 I will take care to preserve thee alive." 
 Note, Singular piety shall be recompensed 
 with distinguishing salvations, which are in 
 a special manner obliging. This will add 
 much to the honour and happiness of glorified 
 saints, that they shall be saved when 
 the greatest part of the world is left to perish. 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God directs Noah to <I>make an ark,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.
 This ark was like the hulk of a 
 ship, fitted not to sail upon the waters 
 (there was no occasion for that, when there 
 should be no shore to sail to), but to float 
 upon the waters, waiting for their fall. God 
 could have secured Noah by the ministration 
 of angels, without putting him to any care, 
 or pains, or trouble, himself; but he chose 
 to employ him in making that which was to 
 be the means of his preservation, both for 
 the trial of his faith and obedience and to 
 teach us that none shall be saved by Christ 
 but those only that <I>work out their salvation.</I> 
 We cannot do it without God, and he will 
 not without us. Both the providence of 
 God, and the grace of God, own and crown 
 the endeavours of the obedient and diligent. 
 God gave him very particular instructions 
 concerning this building, which could not 
 but be admirably well fitted for the purpose 
 when Infinite Wisdom itself was the architect. 
 
 (1.) It must be made of <I>gopher-wood.</I> 
 Noah, doubtless, knew what sort of wood 
 that was, though we now do not, whether 
 cedar, or cypress, or what other. 
 
 (2.) He 
 must make it three stories high within. 
 
 (3.) He must divide it into cabins, with partitions, 
 places fitted for the several sorts of 
 creatures, so as to lose no room. 
 
 (4.) Exact 
 dimensions were given him, that he might
 make it proportionable, and might have room 
 enough in it to answer the intention and no 
 more. Note, Those that work for God must 
 take their measures from him and carefully 
 observe them. Note, further, It is fit that 
 he who appoints us our habitation should 
 fix the bounds and limits of it. 
 
 (5.) He must 
 <I>pitch it within and without</I>--without, to shed 
 off the rain, and to prevent the water from 
 soaking in--within, to take away the bad
 smell of the beasts when kept close. Observe, 
 God does not bid him paint it, but 
 pitch it. If God gives us habitations that 
 are safe, and warm, and wholesome, we are 
 bound to be thankful, though they are not 
 magnificent or nice. 
 
 (6.) He must make a 
 little window towards the top, to let in light, 
 and (some think) that through that window 
 he might behold the desolations to be made 
 in the earth. 
 
 (7.) He must make a door in 
 the side of it, by which to go in and out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God promises Noah that he and his 
 shall be preserved alive in the ark 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 <I>Thou shalt come into the ark.</I> Note, What 
 we do in obedience to God, we ourselves are 
 likely to have the comfort and benefit of. 
 <I>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself.</I> 
 Nor was he himself only saved in the ark, 
 but <I>his wife, and his sons, and his sons' wives.</I> 
 Observe, 
 
 (1.) The care of good parents; they 
 are solicitous not only for their own 

 <A NAME="Page57"> </A>

 salvation, but for the salvation of their families, 
 and especially their children. 
 
 (2.) The 
 happiness of those children that have godly 
 parents. Their parents' piety often procures 
 them temporal salvation, as here; and it 
 furthers them in the way to eternal salvation, 
 if they improve the benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God here makes Noah a great blessing 
 to the world, and herein makes him an eminent 
 type of the Messiah, though not the 
 Messiah himself, as his parents expected, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:29"><I>ch.</I> v. 29</A>.

 1. God made him a preacher to the 
 men of that generation. As a watchman, he 
 received the word from God's mouth, that 
 he might give them warning, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17">Ezek. iii. 17</A>.
 Thus, <I>while the long-suffering of God waited,</I> 
 by his Spirit in Noah, he <I>preached to</I> the old 
 world, who, when Peter wrote, were <I>spirits in 
 prison</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18-20">1 Pet. iii. 18-20</A>),
 and herein he was 
 a type of Christ, who, in a land and age 
 wherein all flesh had corrupted their way, 
 went about preaching repentance and warning 
 men of a deluge of wrath coming. 
 
 2. God made him a saviour to the inferior creatures, 
 to keep the several kinds of them from 
 perishing and being lost in the deluge, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.
 This was a great honour put upon 
 him, that not only in him the race of mankind 
 should be kept up, and that from him 
 should proceed a new world, the church, the 
 soul of the world, and Messiah, the head of 
 that church, but that he should be instrumental 
 to preserve the inferior creatures, and 
 so mankind should in him acquire a new 
 title to them and their service. 
 
 (1.) He was 
 to provide shelter for them, that they might 
 not be drowned. <I>Two of every sort, male 
 and female,</I> he must take with him into 
 the ark; and lest he should make any difficulty 
 of gathering them together, and getting 
 them in, God promises 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)
 that they shall 
 of their own accord come to him. He that 
 makes the ox to know his owner and his 
 crib then made him know his preserver and 
 his ark. 
 
 (2.) He was to provide sustenance 
 for them, that they might not be starved, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 He must victual his ship according to 
 the number of his crew, that great family 
 which he had now the charge of, and according 
 to the time appointed for his confinement. 
 Herein also he was a type of Christ, 
 to whom it is owing that the world stands, 
 by whom all things consist, and who preserves 
 mankind from being totally cut off 
 and ruined by sin; in him the holy seed is 
 saved alive, and the creation rescued from 
 the vanity under which it groans. Noah 
 saved those whom he was to rule, so does 
 Christ, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:9">Heb. v. 9</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge6_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Thus did Noah; according to all 
 that God commanded him, so did he.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Noah's care and diligence in building the 
 ark may be considered, 
 
 1. As an effect of his 
 faith in the word of God. God had told him 
 he would shortly drown the world; he believed 
 it, feared the threatened deluge, and, 
 in that fear, prepared the ark. Note, We 
 ought to mix faith with the revelation God 
 has made of his wrath against all ungodliness 
 and unrighteousness of men; the 
 threatenings of the word are not false alarms. 
 Much might have been objected against the 
 credibility of this warning given to Noah. 
 "Who could believe that the wise God, who 
 made the world, should so soon unmake it 
 again, that he who had drawn the waters off 
 the dry land 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9,10"><I>ch.</I> i. 9, 10</A>)
 should cause them 
 to cover it again? How would this be reconciled 
 with the mercy of God, which is
 over all his works, especially that the innocent 
 creatures should die for man's sin? 
 Whence could water be had sufficient to 
 deluge the world? And, if it must be so, 
 why should notice be given of it to Noah 
 only?" But Noah's faith triumphed over 
 all these corrupt reasonings. 
 
 2. As an act 
 of obedience to the command of God. Had 
 he consulted with flesh and blood, many objections 
 would have been raised against it. 
 To rear a building, such a one as he never 
 saw, so large, and of such exact dimensions, 
 would put him upon a great deal of care, and 
 labour, and expense. It would be a work of 
 time; the vision was for a great while to 
 come. His neighbours would ridicule him 
 for his credulity, and he would be the song 
 of the drunkards; his building would be 
 called <I>Noah's folly.</I> If the worst came to the 
 worst, as we say, each would fare as well as 
 his neighbours. But these, and a thousand 
 such objections, Noah by faith got over. His 
 obedience was ready and resolute: <I>Thus did 
 Noah,</I> willingly and cheerfully, without murmuring 
 and disputing. God says, <I>Do this,</I> 
 and he does it. It was also punctual and 
 persevering: he did all exactly according to 
 the instructions given him, and, having 
 begun to build, did not leave off till he had 
 finished it; so did he, and so must we do. 
 
 3. As an instance of wisdom for himself, 
 thus to provide for his own safety. He 
 feared the deluge, and therefore prepared the 
 ark. Note, When God gives warning of 
 approaching judgments, it is our wisdom and 
 duty to provide accordingly. See
