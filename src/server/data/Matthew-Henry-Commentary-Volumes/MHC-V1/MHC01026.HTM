 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. Isaac in adversity, by reason of a famine 
 in the land, which, 
 
 1. Obliges him to change his quarters,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:1">ver. 1</A>.
 But, 
 
 2. God visits him with direction and comfort,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.
 
 3. He foolishly denies his wife, being in distress and is reproved 
 for it by Abimelech,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.
 
 II. Isaac in prosperity, by the 
 blessing of God upon him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.
 And, 
 
 1. The Philistines 
 were envious at him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.

 2. He continued industrious 
 in his business,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.
 
 3. God appeared to him, and encouraged 
 him, and he devoutly acknowledged God,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.
 
 4. The Philistines, at length, made court to him, and made a 
 covenant with him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:26-33">ver. 26-33</A>.
 
 5. The disagreeable marriage of 
 his son Esau was an alloy to the comfort of his prosperity,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:34,35">ver. 34, 35</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And there was a famine in the 
 land, beside the first famine that 
 was in the days of Abraham. And 
 Isaac went unto Abimelech king of 
 the Philistines unto Gerar.
 &nbsp; 2 And 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto him, and 
 said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell 
 in the land which I shall tell thee of:
 &nbsp; 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be 
 with thee, and will bless thee; for unto 
 thee, and unto thy seed, I will give 
 all these countries, and I will perform 
 the oath which I sware unto Abraham
 thy father;
 &nbsp; 4 And I will make thy 
 seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
 and will give unto thy seed all these 
 countries; and in thy seed shall all 
 the nations of the earth be blessed;
 &nbsp; 5 Because that Abraham obeyed my 
 voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, 
 my statutes, and my laws.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. God tried Isaac by his providence. 
 Isaac had been trained up in a believing dependence 
 upon the divine grant of the land 
 of Canaan to him and his heirs; yet now 
 there is <I>a famine in the land,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 What shall he think of the promise when the promised 
 land will not find him bread? Is such 
 a grant worth accepting, upon such terms, 
 and after so long a time? Yes, Isaac will 
 still cleave to the covenant; and the less 
 valuable Canaan in itself seems to be the 
 better he is taught to value it,
 
 1. As a 
 token of God's everlasting kindness to him; 
 and, 
 
 2. As a type of heaven's everlasting 
 blessedness. Note, The intrinsic worth of 
 God's promises cannot be lessened in a believer's 
 eye by any cross providences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He directed him under this trial by 
 his word. Isaac finds himself straitened by 
 the scarcity of provisions. Somewhere he 
 must go for supply; it should seem, he set 
 out for Egypt, whither his father went in the 
 like strait, but he takes Gerar in his way, 
 full of thoughts, no doubt, which way he had 
 best steer his course, till God graciously appeared 
 to him, and determined him, abundantly 
 to his satisfaction. 
 
 1. God bade him 
 stay where he was, and <I>not go down into 
 Egypt: Sojourn in this land,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 There was a famine in Jacob's days, and God bade 
 him <I>go down into Egypt</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:3,4"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 3, 4</A>),
 a famine in <I>Isaac's</I> days, and God bade him 
 <I>not to go down,</I> a famine in Abraham's days, 
 and God left him to his liberty, directing him 
 neither way. This variety in the divine procedure 
 (considering that Egypt was always a 
 place of trial and exercise to God's people) 
 some ground upon the different characters 
 of these three patriarchs. Abraham was a 
 man of very high attainments, and intimate 
 communion with God; and to him all places 
 and conditions were alike. Isaac was a very 
 good man, but not cut out for hardship; 
 therefore he is forbidden to go to Egypt. 
 Jacob was inured to difficulties, strong and 
 patient; and therefore he must go down 
 into Egypt, that <I>the trial of his faith might 
 be to praise, and honour, and glory.</I> Thus 
 God proportions his people's trials to their 
 strength. 
 
 2. He promised to be <I>with him, 
 and bless him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 As we may go any where 
 with comfort when God's blessing goes with 
 us, so we may stay any where contentedly 
 if that blessing rest upon us. 
 
 3. He renewed 
 the covenant with him, which had so often 
 been made with Abraham, repeating and 
 ratifying the promises of the land of Canaan, 
 a numerous issue, and the Messiah, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 Note, Those that must live by faith have 
 need often to review, and repeat to themselves, 
 the promises they are to live upon, 
 especially when they are called to any instance 
 of suffering or self-denial. 
 
 4. He recommended to him the good example of his 
 father's obedience, as that which had preserved 
 the entail of the covenant in his family
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 "<I>Abraham obeyed my voice;</I> do thou 
 do so too, and the promise shall be sure to 
 thee." Abraham's obedience is here celebrated, 
 to his honour; for by it he obtained 
 a good report both with God and men. A 
 great variety of words is here used to express 
 the divine will, to which Abraham was obedient 
 (<I>my voice, my charge, my commandments, 
 my statutes, and my laws</I>), which may intimate 
 that Abraham's obedience was universal; he 
 obeyed the original laws of nature, the revealed 
 laws of divine worship, particularly 
 that of circumcision, and all the extraordinary 
 precepts God gave him, as that of quitting 
 his country, and that (which some think is 
 more especially referred to) of the offering 
 up of his son, which Isaac himself had reason 
 enough to remember. Note, Those only 
 shall have the benefit and comfort of God's 
 covenant with their godly parents that tread 
 in the steps of their obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
 &nbsp; 7 And the men of the place asked <I>him</I> 
 of his wife; and he said, She <I>is</I> my 
 sister: for he feared to say, <I>She is</I> my 
 wife; lest, <I>said he,</I> the men of the 
 place should kill me for Rebekah;

 <A NAME="Page159"> </A>

 because she <I>was</I> fair to look upon.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass, when he had been 
 there a long time, that Abimelech king 
 of the Philistines looked out at a window, 
 and saw, and, behold, Isaac <I>was</I> 
 sporting with Rebekah his wife.
 &nbsp; 9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, 
 Behold, of a surety she <I>is</I> thy wife: 
 and how saidst thou, She <I>is</I> my sister? 
 And Isaac said unto him, Because I 
 said, Lest I die for her.
 &nbsp; 10 And 
 Abimelech said, What <I>is</I> this thou hast 
 done unto us? one of the people might 
 lightly have lien with thy wife, and 
 thou shouldest have brought guiltiness 
 upon us.
 &nbsp; 11 And Abimelech 
 charged all <I>his</I> people, saying, He that
 toucheth this man or his wife shall 
 surely be put to death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Isaac had now laid aside all thoughts of 
 going to Egypt, and, in obedience to the 
 heavenly vision, sets up his staff in Gerar, 
 the country in which he was born
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 yet there he enters into temptation, the same 
 temptation that his good father had been 
 once and again surprised and overcome by, 
 namely, to deny his wife, and to give out 
 that she was his sister. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he sinned,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Because his wife 
 was handsome, he fancied the Philistines 
 would find some way or other to take him 
 off, that some of them might marry her; and 
 therefore she must pass for his sister. It is 
 an unaccountable thing that both these great 
 and good men should be guilty of so strange 
 a piece of dissimulation, by which they so 
 much exposed both their own and their wives' 
 reputation. But we see, 
 
 1. That very good 
 men have sometimes been guilty of very 
 great faults and follies. Let those therefore 
 that stand take heed lest they fall, and those 
 that have fallen not despair of being helped 
 up again. 
 
 2. That there is an aptness in us 
 to imitate even the weaknesses and infirmities 
 of those we have a value for. We 
 have need therefore to keep our foot, lest, 
 while we aim to tread in the steps of good 
 men, we sometimes tread in their by-steps.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was detected, and the cheat 
 discovered, by the king himself. Abimelech 
 (not the same that was in Abraham's days,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:1-18"><I>ch.</I> 20</A>,
 for this was nearly 100 years after 
 that, but this was the common name of the 
 Philistine kings, as C&aelig;sar of the Roman 
 emperors) saw Isaac more familiar and 
 pleasant with Rebekah than he knew he 
 would be with his sister
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 he saw him 
 sporting with her, or <I>laughing;</I> it is the 
 same word with that from which Isaac had 
 his name. He was <I>rejoicing with the wife of
 his youth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:18">Prov. v. 18</A>.
 It becomes those in 
 that relation to be pleasant with one another, 
 as those that are pleased with one another. 
 Nowhere may a man more allow himself to be 
 innocently merry than with his own wife and 
 children. Abimelech charged him with the 
 fraud
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 showed him how frivolous his 
 excuse was and what might have been the 
 bad consequences of it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 and then, to 
 convince him how groundless and unjust his 
 jealousy of them was, took him and his family 
 under his particular protection, forbidding 
 any injury to be done to him or his wife 
 upon pain of death,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 Note, 
 
 1. A lying 
 tongue is but for a moment. Truth is the 
 daughter of time; and, in time, it will out. 
 
 2. One sin is often the inlet to many, and 
 therefore the beginnings of sin ought to be 
 avoided. 
 
 3. The sins of professors shame 
 them before those that are without. 
 
 4. God 
 can make those that are incensed against his 
 people, though there may be some colour of 
 cause for it, to know that it is at their peril 
 if they do them any hurt. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15">Ps. cv. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, 
 and received in the same year an hundredfold: 
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed him:
 &nbsp; 13 And the man waxed great, and 
 went forward, and grew until he became 
 very great:
 &nbsp; 14 For he had possession 
 of flocks, and possession of 
 herds, and great store of servants: 
 and the Philistines envied him.
 &nbsp; 15 For all the wells which his father's 
 servants had digged in the days of 
 Abraham his father, the Philistines 
 had stopped them, and filled them 
 with earth.
 &nbsp; 16 And Abimelech said 
 unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art 
 much mightier than we.
 &nbsp; 17 And Isaac 
 departed thence, and pitched his tent 
 in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
 &nbsp; 18 And Isaac digged again the wells 
 of water, which they had digged in the 
 days of Abraham his father; for the 
 Philistines had stopped them after the 
 death of Abraham: and he called their
 names after the names by which his father 
 had called them.
 &nbsp; 19 And Isaac's 
 servants digged in the valley, and 
 found there a well of springing water.
 &nbsp; 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did 
 strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, 
 The water <I>is</I> ours: and he called the 
 name of the well Esek; because they 
 strove with him.
 &nbsp; 21 And they digged 
 another well, and strove for that also: 
 and he called the name of it Sitnah.
 &nbsp; 22 And he removed from thence, and 
 digged another well; and for that they 
 strove not: and he called the name 
 of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now 
 
 <A NAME="Page160"> </A>

 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath made room for us, and 
 we shall be fruitful in the land.
 &nbsp; 23 And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 24 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared 
 unto him the same night, and said, I
 <I>am</I> the God of Abraham thy father: 
 fear not, for I <I>am</I> with thee, and will 
 bless thee, and multiply thy seed for 
 my servant Abraham's sake.
 &nbsp; 25 And 
 he builded an altar there, and called 
 upon the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and 
 pitched his tent there: and there 
 Isaac's servants digged a well.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tokens of God's good-will to Isaac. 
 He <I>blessed him,</I> and prospered him, and made 
 all that he had to thrive under his hands. 
 
 1. His corn multiplied strangely,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 He had no land of his own, but took land of 
 the Philistines, and sowed it; and (be it observed 
 for the encouragement of poor tenants, 
 that occupy other people's lands, and are 
 honest and industrious) God blessed him 
 with a great increase. He reaped <I>a hundred 
 fold;</I> and there seems to be an emphasis laid 
 upon the time: it was that <I>same year</I> when 
 there was a famine in the land; while others 
 scarcely reaped at all, he reaped thus plentifully. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13">Isa. lxv. 13</A>, 
 <I>My servants shall 
 eat, but you shall be hungry,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:19">Ps. xxxvii. 19</A>,
 <I>In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</I> 
 
 2. His cattle also increased,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 And then, 
 
 3. He had <I>great store of servants,</I> 
 whom he employed and maintained. Note, 
 <I>As goods are increased those are increased 
 that eat them,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:11">Eccl. v. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tokens of the Philistines' ill-will to 
 him. They <I>envied him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 It is an 
 instance, 
 
 1. Of the vanity of the world that 
 the more men have of it the more they are 
 envied, and exposed to censure and injury. 
 <I>Who can stand before envy?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:4">Prov. xxvii. 4</A>.
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>.

 2. Of the corruption of 
 nature; for that is a bad principle indeed 
 which makes men <I>grieve at the good of others,</I> 
 as if it must needs be ill with me because it is 
 well with my neighbor. 
 
 (1.) They had already 
 shown their ill-will to his family, by stopping 
 up the wells which his father had digged,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 This was spitefully done. Because 
 they had not flocks of their own to water at 
 these wells, they would not leave them for 
 the use of others; so absurd a thing is 
 malice. And it was perfidiously done, contrary 
 to the covenant of friendship they had 
 made with Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:31,32"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 31, 32</A>.
 No bonds will hold ill-nature. 
 
 (2.) They expelled 
 him out of their country,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 The king 
 of Gerar began to look upon him with a 
 jealous eye. Isaac's house was like a court, 
 and his riches and retinue eclipsed Abimelech's; 
 and therefore he must go further off. 
 They were weary of his neighbourhood, 
 because they saw that the Lord blessed him; 
 whereas, for that reason, they should the 
 rather have courted his stay, that they also 
 might be blessed for his sake. Isaac does 
 not insist upon the bargain he had made with 
 them for the lands he held, nor upon his occupying 
 and improving them, nor does he offer 
 to contest with them by force, though he had 
 become very great, but very peaceably departs 
 thence further from the royal city, and perhaps 
 to a part of the country less fruitful. 
 Note, We should deny ourselves both in our 
 rights and in our conveniences, rather than 
 quarrel: a wise and a good man will rather 
 retire into obscurity, like Isaac here into a 
 valley, than sit high to be the butt of envy 
 and ill-will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His constancy and continuance in his 
 business still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He kept up his husbandry, and continued 
 industrious to find wells of water, and 
 to fit them for his use,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,
 &c. Though he 
 had grown very rich, yet he was as solicitous 
 as ever about the state of his flocks, and still 
 looked well to his herds; when men grow 
 great, they must take heed of thinking 
 themselves too big and too high for their 
 business. Though he was driven from the 
 conveniences he had had, and could not follow 
 his husbandry with the same ease and advantage 
 as before, yet he set himself to make 
 the best of the country he had come into, 
 which it is every man's prudence to do. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He opened the wells that his father 
 had digged
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 and out of respect to his 
 father called them by the same names that 
 he had given them. Note, In our searches 
 after truth, that fountain of living water, it is 
 good to make use of the discoveries of former 
 ages, which have been clouded by the corruptions 
 of later times. Enquire for the old 
 way, the wells which our fathers digged, 
 which the adversaries of truth have stopped 
 up: <I>Ask thy elders, and they shall teach thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His servants dug new wells,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 Note, Though we must use the light of former 
 ages, it does not therefore follow that we 
 must rest in it, and make no advances. We 
 must still be building upon their foundation, 
 <I>running to and fro, that knowledge may be increased,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:4">Dan. xii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) In digging his wells he met with 
 much opposition,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 Those that open 
 the fountains of truth must expect contradiction. 
 The first two wells which they dug 
 were called <I>Esek</I> and <I>Sitnah, contention</I> and 
 <I>hatred.</I> See here, 
 
 [1.] What is the nature of 
 worldly things; they are make-bates and 
 occasions of strife. 
 
 [2.] What is often the 
 lot even of the most quiet and peaceable men 
 in this world; those that avoid striving yet 
 cannot avoid being striven with, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>.
 In this sense, Jeremiah was a <I>man of contention</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10">Jer. xv. 10</A>),
 and Christ himself, though 
 he is the prince of peace. 
 
 [3.] What a 
 mercy it is to have plenty of water, to have it 

 <A NAME="Page161"> </A>

 without striving for it. The more common 
 this mercy is the more reason we have to be
 thankful for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) At length he removed to a quiet 
 settlement, cleaving to his peaceable principle, 
 rather to fly than fight, and unwilling to 
 dwell with those that hated peace, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:6">Ps. cxx. 6</A>.
 He preferred quietness to victory. <I>He dug 
 a well, and for this they strove not,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 Note, Those that follow peace, sooner or 
 later, shall find peace; those that study to be 
 quiet seldom fail of being so. How unlike 
 was Isaac to his brother Ishmael, who, right 
 or wrong, would hold what he had, against 
 all the world!
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 12</A>.
 And which of 
 these would we be found the followers of? 
 This well they called <I>Rehoboth, enlargements,</I> 
 room enough: in the two former wells we 
 may see what the earth is, <I>straitness</I> and 
 <I>strife;</I> men cannot thrive, for the throng of
 their neighbours. This well shows us what 
 heaven is; it is <I>enlargement</I> and <I>peace,</I> room 
 enough there, for there are many mansions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He continued firm to his religion, and 
 kept up his communion with God. 
 
 (1.) God 
 graciously appeared to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 When the Philistines expelled him, forced him to 
 remove from place to place, and gave him continual 
 molestation, then God visited him, and 
 gave him fresh assurances of his favour. Note, 
 When men are found false and unkind, we 
 may comfort ourselves that God is faithful 
 and gracious; and his time to show himself so 
 is when we are most disappointed in our expectations 
 from men. When Isaac had come to Beer-sheba 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)
 it is probable that it 
 troubled him to think of his unsettled condition, 
 and that he could not be suffered to stay 
 long in a place; and, in the multitude of these 
 thoughts within him, that same night that 
 he came weary and uneasy to Beer-sheba 
 God brought him his comforts to delight his 
 soul. Probably he was apprehensive that 
 the Philistines would not let him rest there: 
 <I>Fear not,</I> says God to him, <I>I am with thee, 
 and will bless thee.</I> Those may remove 
 with comfort that are sure of God's presence 
 with them wherever they go. 
 
 (2.) He was 
 not wanting in his returns of duty to God; 
 for <I>there he built an altar, and called upon the 
 name of the Lord,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] Wherever 
 we go, we must take our religion along 
 with us. Probably Isaac's altars and his 
 religious worship gave offence to the Philistines, 
 and provoked them to be the more 
 troublesome to him; yet he kept up his duty, 
 whatever ill-will he might be exposed to by 
 it. 
 
 [2.] The comforts and encouragements 
 God gives us by his word should excite and 
 quicken us to every exercise of devotion by 
 which God may be honoured and our intercourse 
 with heaven maintained.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 Then Abimelech went to him 
 from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his 
 friends, and Phichol the chief captain 
 of his army. 
 &nbsp; 27 And Isaac said unto 
 them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing 
 ye hate me, and have sent me 
 away from you?
 &nbsp; 28 And they said, We saw certainly that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was 
 with thee: and we said, Let there be 
 now an oath betwixt us, <I>even</I> betwixt
 us and thee, and let us make a covenant 
 with thee;
 &nbsp; 29 That thou wilt 
 do us no hurt, as we have not touched 
 thee, and as we have done unto thee 
 nothing but good, and have sent thee 
 away in peace: thou <I>art</I> now the 
 blessed of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30 And he 
 made them a feast, and they did eat 
 and drink.
 &nbsp; 31 And they rose up betimes 
 in the morning, and sware one 
 to another: and Isaac sent them away, 
 and they departed from him in peace.
 &nbsp; 32 And it came to pass the same day, 
 that Isaac's servants came, and told 
 him concerning the well which they 
 had digged, and said unto him, We 
 have found water.
 &nbsp; 33 And he called 
 it Shebah: therefore the name of the 
 city <I>is</I> Beer-sheba unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the contests that had been 
 between Isaac and the Philistines issuing in 
 a happy peace and reconciliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Abimelech pays a friendly visit to Isaac, 
 in token of the respect he had for him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 Note, <I>When a man's ways please the Lord he 
 makes even his enemies to be at peace with him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>.
 Kings' hearts are in his hands, 
 and when he pleases he can turn them to 
 favour his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Isaac prudently and cautiously questions 
 his sincerity in this visit, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 Note, 
 In settling friendships and correspondences, 
 there is need of the wisdom of the serpent, 
 as well as the innocence of the dove; nor is 
 it any transgression of the law of meekness 
 and love plainly to signify our strong perception 
 of injuries received, and to stand 
 upon our guard in dealing with those that 
 have acted unfairly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abimelech professes his sincerity, in 
 this address to Isaac, and earnestly courts 
 his friendship,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.
 Some suggest that 
 Abimelech pressed for this league with him 
 because he feared lest Isaac, growing rich, 
 should, some time or other, avenge himself 
 upon them for the injuries he had received. 
 However, he professes to do it rather from a 
 principle of love. 
 
 1. He makes the best of 
 their behaviour towards him. Isaac complained 
 they had <I>hated him, and sent him away.</I> No, 
 said Abimelech, <I>we sent thee away in peace.</I> 
 They turned him off from the land he held 
 of them; but they suffered him to take away 
 his stock, and all his effects, with him. Note, 
 The lessening of injuries is necessary to the 
 
 <A NAME="Page162"> </A>

 preserving of friendship; for the aggravating 
 of them exasperates and widens breaches. 
 The unkindness done to us might have been 
 worse. 
 
 2. He acknowledges the token of 
 God's favour to him, and makes this the 
 ground of their desire to be in league with 
 him: <I>The Lord is with thee, and thou art the 
 blessed of the Lord.</I> As if he had said, "Be 
 persuaded to overlook and pass by the injuries 
 offered thee; for God had abundantly 
 made up to thee the damage thou receivedst." 
 Note, Those whom God blesses and favours 
 have reason enough to forgive those who hate 
 them, since the worst enemy they have cannot 
 do them any real hurt. Or, "For this reason 
 we desire thy friendship, because <I>God is with 
 thee.</I>" Note, It is good to be in covenant 
 and communion with those who are in covenant 
 and communion with God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>;
 present address to him was the result of 
 mature deliberation: <I>We said, Let there be 
 an oath between us.</I> Whatever some of his 
 peevish envious subjects might mean otherwise, 
 he and his prime-ministers of state, 
 whom he had now brought with him, designed 
 no other than a cordial friendship. 
 Perhaps Abimelech had received, by tradition, 
 the warning God gave to his predecessor not 
 to hurt Abraham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7"><I>ch.</I> xx. 7</A>),
 and this made 
 him stand in such awe of Isaac, who appeared 
 to be as much the favourite of Heaven as 
 Abraham was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Isaac entertains him and his company, 
 and enters into a league of friendship with 
 him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.
 Here see how generous the 
 good man was, 
 
 1. In giving: <I>He made them 
 a feast,</I> and bade them welcome. 
 
 (2.) In forgiving. 
 He did not insist upon the unkindnesses 
 they had done him, but freely entered 
 into a covenant of friendship with them, and 
 bound himself never to do them any injury. 
 Note, Religion teaches us to be neighbourly, 
 and, as much as in us lies, to <I>live peaceably 
 with all men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Providence smiled upon what Isaac 
 did; for the same day that he made this 
 covenant with Abimelech his servants brought 
 him the tidings of a well of water they had 
 found,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.
 He did not insist upon the 
 restitution of the wells which the Philistines 
 had unjustly taken from him, lest this should 
 break off the treaty, but sat down silent 
 under the injury; and, to recompense him 
 for this, immediately he is enriched with a 
 new well, which, because it suited so well to 
 the occurrence of the day, he called by an old 
 name, <I>Beer-sheba, The well of the oath.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34 And Esau was forty years old
 when he took to wife Judith the daughter
 of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath
 the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
 &nbsp; 35 Which were a grief of mind 
 unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Esau's foolish marriage--foolish, 
 some think, in marrying two wives together, 
 for which perhaps he is called a <I>fornicator</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:16">Heb. xii. 16</A>),
 or rather in marrying Canaanites, 
 who were strangers to the blessing of 
 Abraham, and subject to the curse of Noah, 
 for which he is called <I>profane;</I> for hereby he 
 intimated that he neither desired the blessing 
 nor dreaded the curse of God. 
 
 2. The grief 
 and trouble it created to his tender parents. 
 
 (1.) It grieved them that he married without 
 asking, or at least without taking, their 
 advice and consent: see whose steps those 
 children tread in who either contemn or contradict 
 their parents in disposing of themselves. 
 
 (2.) It grieved them that he married 
 the daughters of Hittites, who had no religion 
 among them; for Isaac remembered his 
 father's care concerning him, that he should 
 by no means marry a Canaanite. 
 
 (3.) It 
 should seem, the wives he married were provoking 
 in their conduct towards Isaac and 
 Rebekah; those children have little reason 
 to expect the blessing of God who do that 
 which is a grief of mind to their good parents.</P>
