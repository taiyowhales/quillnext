 Yet Moses has not done with the children of Israel; he seemed to have
 taken final leave of them in the close of the foregoing chapter, but
 still he has something more to say. He had preached them a farewell
 sermon, a very copious and pathetic discourse. After sermon he had
 given out a psalm, a long psalm; and now nothing remains but to dismiss
 them with a blessing; that blessing he pronounces in this chapter in
 the name of the Lord, and so leaves them. 

 I. He pronounces them all blessed in what God had done for them 
 already, especially in giving them his law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 II. He pronounces a blessing upon each tribe, which is both a prayer
 for and a prophecy of their felicity.

 1. Reuben,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:6">ver. 6</A>.

 2. Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:7">ver. 7</A>.
 
 3. Levi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.
 
 4. Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:42">ver. 42</A>.

 5. Joseph,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 6. Zebulun and Issachar,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>.
 
 7. Gad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 8. Dan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:22">ver. 22</A>.
 
 9. Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:23">ver. 23</A>.
 
 10. Asher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.

 III. He pronounces them all in general blessed upon the account of
 what God would be to them, and do for them if they were obedient, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26-29">ver. 26</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And this <I>is</I> the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
 blessed the children of Israel before his death.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
 unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten
 thousands of saints: from his right hand <I>went</I> a fiery law for
 them.
 &nbsp; 3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <I>are</I> in thy hand:
 and they sat down at thy feet; <I>every one</I> shall receive of thy
 words.
 &nbsp; 4 Moses commanded us a law, <I>even</I> the inheritance of the
 congregation of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people
 <I>and</I> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:1">first verse</A>

 is the title of the chapter: it is a blessing. In the foregoing chapter
 he had thundered out the terrors of the Lord against Israel for their 
 sin; it was a chapter like Ezekiel's roll, full of lamentation, and 
 mourning, and woe. Now to soften that, and that he might not seem to 
 part in anger, he here subjoins a blessing, and leaves his peace, which 
 should descend and rest upon all those among them that were the sons of 
 peace. Thus Christ's last work on earth was to bless his disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:50">Luke xxiv. 50</A>),

 like Moses here, in token of parting as friends. Moses blessed them, 

 1. As a prophet--a <I>man of God.</I> Note, It is a very desirable
 thing to have an interest in the prayers of those that have an interest 
 in heaven; it is a <I>prophet's reward.</I> In this blessing Moses not 
 only expresses his good wishes to this people, but by the spirit of 
 prophecy foretels things to come concerning them. 

 2. As a parent to Israel; for so good princes are to their subjects.
 Jacob upon his death-bed blessed his sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1">Gen. xlix. 1</A>),

 in conformity to whose example Moses here blesses the tribes that were
 descended from them, to show that though they had been very provoking 
 yet the entail of the blessing was not cut off. The doing of this 
 immediately before his death would not only be the more likely to leave 
 an impression upon them, but would be an indication of the great 
 good-will of Moses to them, that he desired their happiness, though he 
 must die and not share in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He begins his blessing with a lofty description of the glorious 
 appearances of God to them in giving them the law, and the great 
 advantage they had by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There was a visible and illustrious discovery of the divine majesty, 
 enough to convince and for ever silence atheists and infidels, to 
 awaken and affect those that were most stupid and careless, and to put 
 to shame all secret inclinations to other gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 1. His appearance was glorious: he shone forth like the sun when he 
 goes forth in his strength. Even Seir and Paran, two mountains at some 
 distance, were illuminated by the divine glory which appeared on Mount 
 Sinai, and reflected some of the rays of it, so bright was the 
 appearance, and so much taken notice of by the adjacent countries. To 
 this the prophet alludes, to set forth the wonders of the divine 
 providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:3,4,Ps+18:7-9">Hab. iii. 3, 4; Ps. xviii. 7-9</A>.

 The Jerusalem Targum has a strange gloss upon this, that, "when God
 came down to give the law, he offered it on Mount Seir to the Edomites, 
 but they refused it, because they found in it, <I>Thou shalt not 
 kill.</I> Then he offered it on Mount Paran to the Ishmaelites, but 
 they also refused it, because they found in it, <I>Thou shalt not 
 steal;</I> and then he came to Mount Sinai and offered it to Israel, 
 and they said, <I>All that the Lord shall say we will do.</I>" I would 
 not have transcribed so groundless a conceit but for the antiquity of 
 it.

 2. His retinue was glorious; he came with his holy myriads, as Enoch
 had long since foretold he should come in the last day to judge the 
 world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.

 These were the angels, those
 <I>chariots of God in the midst of which</I> the Lord was, on <I>that 
 holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17">Ps. lxviii. 17</A>.

 They attended the divine majesty, and were employed as his ministers in
 the solemnities of the day. Hence the law is said to <I>be given by the 
 disposition of angels,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:53,Heb+2:2">Acts vii. 53; Heb. ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gave them his law, which is, 

 1. Called <I>a fiery law,</I> because it was given them <I>out of the
 midst of the fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33">Deut. iv. 33</A>),

 and because it works like fire; if it be received, it is melting,
 warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if it be 
 rejected, it hardens, sears, torments, and destroys. The Spirit 
 descended in cloven tongues as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery 
 law. 

 2. It is said to <I>go from his right hand,</I> either because he wrote
 it on tables of stone, or to denote the power and energy of the law and 
 the divine strength that goes along with it, that it may not return 
 void. Or it came as a gift to them, and a precious gift it was, a 
 right-hand blessing. 

 3. It was an instance of the special kindness he had for them: <I>Yea,
 he loved the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and therefore, though it was a fiery law, yet it is said to <I>go for
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 that is, in favour to them. Note, The law of God written in the heart
 is a certain evidence of the love of God shed abroad there: we must 
 reckon God's law one of the gifts of his grace. Yea, he embraced the 
 people, or <I>laid them in his bosom;</I> so the word signifies, which 
 denotes not only the dearest love, but the most tender and careful 
 protection. <I>All his saints are in his hand.</I> Some understand it 
 particularly of his supporting them and preserving them alive at Mount 
 Sinai, when the terror was so great that Moses himself quaked; they 
 heard the voice of God and lived,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33"><I>ch.</I> iv. 33</A>.

 Or it denotes his forming them into a people by his law; he moulded and
 fashioned them as a potter does the clay. Or they were in his hand to 
 be covered and protected, used and disposed of, as the seven stars were 
 in the hand of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:16">Rev. i. 16</A>.

 Note, God has all his saints in his hand; and, though there are <I>ten 
 thousands of his saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 yet his hand, with which he measures the waters, is large enough, and
 strong enough, to hold them all, and we may be sure that <I>none can 
 pluck them out of his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">John x. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He disposed them to receive the law which he gave them: <I>They 
 sat down at thy feet,</I> as scholars at the feet of their master, in 
 token of reverence, in attendance and humble submission to what is 
 taught; so Israel sat at the foot of Mount Sinai, and promised to hear 
 and do whatever God should say. They were <I>struck to thy feet,</I> so 
 some read it; namely, by the terrors of Mount Sinai, which greatly 
 humbled them for the present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:19">Exod. xx. 19</A>.

 Every one then stood ready to receive God's words, and did so again
 when the law was publicly read to them, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:34">Josh. viii. 34</A>.

 It is a great privilege when we have heard the words of God to have
 opportunity of hearing them again.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:26">John xvii. 26</A>,

 <I>I have declared thy name, and will declare it.</I> So Israel not
 only had received the law, but should still receive it by their 
 prayers, and other lively oracles. The people are taught 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 in gratitude for the law of God, always to keep up an honourable
 remembrance both of the law itself and of Moses by whom it was given.
 Two of the Chaldee paraphrasts read it, <I>The children of Israel said, 
 Moses commanded us a law.</I> And the Jews say that as soon as a child 
 was able to speak his father was obliged to teach him these words: 
 <I>Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation 
 of Jacob.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are taught to speak with great respect of the law, and to call 
 it <I>the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</I> They looked 
 upon it, 

 (1.) As peculiar to them, and that by which they were distinguished
 from other nations, who neither had the knowledge of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:20">Ps. cxlvii. 20</A>),

 nor, if they had, were under those obligations to observe it that
 Israel were under: and therefore (says bishop Patrick), "when the Jews
 conquered any country, they did not force any to embrace the law of 
 Moses, but only to submit to the seven precepts of Noah."

 (2.) As entailed upon them; for so inheritances are to be transmitted
 to their posterity. And,

 (3.) As their wealth and true treasure. Those that enjoy the word of
 God and the means of grace have reason to say, We have a goodly 
 heritage. He is indeed a rich man in whom the word of Christ dwells 
 richly. Perhaps the law is called their <I>inheritance</I> because it 
 was given them with their inheritance, and we so annexed to it that the 
 forsaking of the law would be a forfeiture of the inheritance. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:111">Ps. cxix. 111</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are taught to speak with great respect of Moses; and they were 
 the more obliged to keep up his name because he had not provided for 
 the keeping of it up in his family; his posterity were never called the 
 <I>sons of Moses,</I> as the priests were the <I>sons of Aaron.</I> 
 
 (1.) They must own Moses a great benefactor to their nation, in that he
 <I>commanded them the law;</I> for, though it came from the hand of 
 God, it went through the hand of Moses. 

 (2.) <I>He was king in Jeshurun. Having commanded them the law,</I> as
 long as he lived he took care to see it observed and put in execution; 
 and they were very happy in having such a king, who ruled them, and 
 went in and out before them at all times, but did in a special manner 
 look great when the <I>heads of the people were gathered together</I> 
 in parliament, as it were, and Moses was president among them. Some 
 understand this of God himself; he did then declare himself their King 
 when he gave them the law, and he continued so long as they were 
 <I>Jeshurun,</I> an upright people, and till they rejected him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:12">1 Sam. xii. 12</A>.

 But it seems rather to be understood of Moses. A good government is a
 great blessing to any people, and what they have reason to be very 
 thankful for; and that constitution is very happy which as Israel's, 
 which as ours, divides the power between the king in Jeshurun and the 
 heads of the tribes, when they are gathered together.</P>

 <A NAME="De33_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <I>not</I> his men be few.
 &nbsp; 7 And this <I>is the blessing</I> of Judah: and he said, Hear, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands
 be sufficient for him; and be thou a help <I>to him</I> from his
 enemies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The blessing of Reuben. Though Reuben had lost the honour of his 
 birthright, yet Moses begins with him; for we should not insult over 
 those that are disgraced, nor desire to perpetuate marks of infamy upon 
 any, though ever so justly fastened at first,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Moses desires and foretels, 

 1. The preserving of this tribe. Though a frontier tribe on the other 
 side Jordan, yet, "<I>Let it live,</I> and not be either ruined by its 
 neighbours or lost among them." And perhaps he refers to those chosen 
 men of that tribe who, having had their lot assigned them already, left 
 their families in it, and were now ready to <I>go over armed before 
 their brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:27">Num. xxxii. 27</A>.

 "Let them be protected in this noble expedition, and have their heads
 covered in the day of battle."

 2. Let it be a numerous tribe; though their other honours be lost, so
 that they shall not excel, yet let them multiply." <I>Let Reuben live 
 and not die, though his men be few;</I> so bishop Patrick, thinks it 
 may be rendered. "Though he must not expect to flourish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:4">Gen. xlix. 4</A>),

 yet let him not perish." All the Chaldee paraphrasts refer this to the
 other world: <I>Let Reuben live in life eternal, and not die the second 
 death,</I> so Onkelos. <I>Let Reuben live in this world, and not die 
 that death which the wicked die in the world to come,</I> so Jonathan 
 and the Jerusalem Targum.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessing of Judah, which is put before Levi because our <I>Loud 
 sprang out of Judah,</I> and (as Dr. Lightfoot says) because of the 
 dignity of the kingdom above the priesthood. The blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 may refer either, 

 1. To the whole tribe in general. Moses prays for, and prophesies, the
 great prosperity of that tribe., That God would hear his prayers (see 
 an instance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:14,15">2 Chron. xiii. 14, 15</A>),

 settle him in his lot, prosper him in all his affairs, and give him
 victory over his enemies. It is taken for granted that the tribe of
 Judah would be both a praying tribe and an active tribe. "Lord," says 
 Moses, "hear his prayers, and give success to all his undertakings: 
 <I>let his hands be sufficient for him</I> both in husbandry and in 
 war." The voice of prayer should always be attended with the hand of 
 endeavour, and then we may expect prosperity. Or, 

 2. It may refer in particular to David, as a type of Christ, that God
 <I>would hear his prayers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:1">Ps. xx. 1</A>
 
 (and Christ was <I>heard always,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:42">John xi. 42</A>),

 that he would give him victory over his enemies, and success in his
 great undertakings. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:20-28">Ps. lxxxix. 20</A>,

 &c. And that prayer that God would <I>bring him to his people</I> seems
 to refer to Jacob's prophecy concerning Shiloh, That <I>to him should 
 the gathering of the people be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 The tribe of Simeon is omitted in the blessing, because Jacob had left
 it under a brand, and it had never done any thing, as Levi had done, to 
 retrieve its honour. It was lessened in the wilderness more than any
 other of the tribes; and Zimri, who was so notoriously guilty in the 
 matter of Peor but the other day, was of that tribe. Or, because the 
 lot of Simeon was an appendage to that of Judah, that tribe is included 
 in the blessing of Judah. Some copies of the LXX. join Simeon with 
 Reuben: <I>Let Reuben live and not die; and let Simeon be many in 
 number.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And of Levi he said, <I>Let</I> thy Thummim and thy Urim <I>be</I> with
 thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <I>and with</I> whom
 thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
 &nbsp; 9 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
 him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
 children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
 &nbsp; 10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law:
 they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice
 upon thine altar.
 &nbsp; 11 Bless, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, his substance, and accept the work of his
 hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and

 In blessing the tribe of Levi, Moses expresses himself more at large, 
 not so much because it was his own tribe (for he takes no notice of his 
 relation to it) as because it was God's tribe. The blessing of Levi has 
 reference.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To the high priest, here called God's <I>holy one</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 because his office was holy, in token of which, <I>Holiness to the
 Lord</I> was written upon his forehead. 

 1. He seems to acknowledge that God might justly have displaced Aaron
 and his seed, for his sin at Meribah,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7">Exod. xvii. 7</A>),

 which might be very remarkable, and which God might have an eye to in
 conferring the priesthood upon him, though no mention is made of it 
 there. All the Chaldee paraphrasts agree that it was a trial in which 
 he was <I>found perfect and faithful,</I> and <I>stood in the 
 trial;</I> therefore not that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:2">Num. xx. 2</A>.

 He prays that the office of the high priest might ever remain: <I>Let
 thy thummim and thy urim be with him.</I> It was given him for some 
 eminent piece of service, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:5">Mal. ii. 5</A>.

 "Lord, let it never be taken from him." Notwithstanding this blessing,
 the urim and thummim were lost in the captivity, and never restored 
 under the second temple. But this prayer has its full accomplishment
 in Jesus Christ, God's Holy One, and our great high priest, of whom 
 Aaron was a type: with him who had lain in the Father's bosom from 
 eternity the urim and thummim shall remain; for he is the wonderful and 
 everlasting counsellor. Some translate the thummim and urim 
 appellatively, the rather because the usual order is here inverted, and 
 here only. <I>Thummim</I> signifies <I>integrity,</I> and <I>Urim 
 illumination:</I> Let these be with thy holy one, that is, "Lord, let 
 the high priest ever be both an upright man and an understanding man." 
 A good prayer to be put up for the ministers of the gospel, that they 
 may have clear heads and honest hearts; light and sincerity make a 
 complete minister.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To the inferior priests and Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He commends the zeal of this tribe for God when they sided with 
 Moses (and so with God) against the worshippers of the golden calf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:26-28">Exod. xxxii. 26</A>,

 &c.), and, being employed in cutting off the ring-leaders in that
 wickedness, they did it impartially: the best friends they had in the 
 world, though as dear to them as their next relations, they did not 
 spare if they were idolaters. Note, Our regard to God and to his glory 
 ought always to prevail above our regard to any creature whatsoever. 
 And those who not only keep themselves pure from the common iniquities 
 of the times and places in which they live, but, as they are capable, 
 bear testimony against them, and <I>stand up for God against the 
 evil-doers,</I> shall have special marks of honour put upon them.
 Perhaps Moses may have an eye to the sons of Korah, who refused to join 
 with their father in his gain-saying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:11">Num. xxvi. 11</A>.

 Also to Phinehas, who <I>executed judgment,</I> and <I>stayed the
 plague.</I> And indeed the office of the priests and Levites, which 
 engaged their constant attendance, at least in their turns, at God's 
 altar, laid them under a necessity of being frequently absent from 
 their families, which they could not take such care of, nor make such 
 provision for, as other Israelites might. This was the constant 
 self-denial they submitted to, that they might <I>observe God's 
 word,</I> and keep the <I>covenant of priesthood.</I> Note, Those that 
 are called to minister in holy things must sit loose to the relations 
 and interests that are dearest to them in this world, and prefer the 
 gratifying of the best friend they have,

 2. He confirms the commission granted to this tribe to minister in holy 
 things, which was the recompence of their zeal and fidelity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 (1.) They were to deal for God with the people: "<I>They shall teach
 Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy laws,</I> both as preachers in thy 
 religious assemblies, reading and expounding the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:7,8">Neh. viii. 7, 8</A>),

 and as judges, determining doubtful and difficult cases that were
 brought before them,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:8,9">2 Chron. xvii. 8, 9</A>.

 The priests' lips kept this knowledge for the use of the people, who
 were to ask the law at their mouth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 Even Haggai, a prophet, consulted the priests in a case of conscience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:11-13">Hag. ii. 11</A>,

 &c. Note, Preaching is necessary, not only for
 the first planting of churches, but for the preserving and edifying of 
 churches when they are planted. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:23,24">Ezek. xliv. 23, 24</A>.

 (2.) They were to deal for the people with God, in burning incense to
 the praise and glory of God, and offering sacrifices to make atonement 
 for sin and to obtain the divine favour. This was the work of the 
 priests, but the Levites attended and assisted in it. Those that would 
 have benefit by their incense and offerings must diligently and 
 faithfully observe their instructions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He prays for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (1.) That God would prosper them in their estates, and make that which
 was allotted them for their maintenance comfortable to them. <I>Bless, 
 Lord, his substance.</I> The provision made for them was very 
 plentiful, and came to them easily, and yet they could have no joy of 
 it unless God blessed it to them; and, since God himself was their 
 portion, a particular blessing might be expected to attend this 
 portion. <I>Bless, Lord, his virtue;</I> so some read it. "Lord,
 increase thy graces in them, and make them more and more fit for their 
 work."

 (2.) That he would accept them in their services: "<I>Accept the work
 of his hands,</I> both for himself and for the people for whom he 
 ministers." Acceptance with God is that which we should all aim at, and 
 be ambitious of, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or no

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>),

 and it is the most valuable blessing we can desire either for ourselves
 or others. 

 (3.) That he would take his part against all his enemies: <I>Smite
 through the loins of those that rise against him.</I> He supposes that 
 God's ministers would have many enemies: some would hate their persons 
 for their faithfulness, and would endeavour to do them a mischief; 
 others would envy them their maintenance, and endeavour sacrilegiously 
 to deprive them of it; others would oppose them in the execution of 
 their office and not submit to the sentence of the priests; and some 
 would aim to overthrow the office itself. Now he prays that God would 
 blast all such attempts, and return the mischief upon the heads of the 
 authors. This prayer is a prophecy that God will certainly reckon with 
 those that are enemies to his ministers, and will keep up a ministry in 
 his church to the end of time, in spite of all the designs of the gates 
 of hell against it. Saul rose up against the Lord's priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:18">1 Sam. xxii. 18</A>),

 and this filled the measure of his sin.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The blessing of Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Benjamin is put next to
 Levi, because the temple, where the priests' work lay, was just upon 
 the edge of the lot of this tribe; and it is put before Joseph because 
 of the dignity of Jerusalem (part of which was in this tribe) above 
 Samaria, which was in the tribe of Ephraim, and because Benjamin 
 adhered to the house of David, and to the temple of the Lord, when the 
 rest of the tribes deserted both with Jeroboam. 

 1. Benjamin is here called the <I>beloved of the Lord,</I> and the
 father of this tribe was Jacob's beloved son, the <I>son of his right 
 hand.</I> Note, Those are blessed indeed that are beloved of the Lord. 
 Saul the first king, and Paul the great apostle, were both of this 
 tribe. 

 2. He is here assured of the divine protection: he shall <I>dwell
 safely.</I> Note, Those are safe whom God loves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1">Ps. xci. 1</A>.

 3. It is here intimated that the temple in which God would dwell should
 be built in the borders of this tribe. Jerusalem the holy city was in
 the lot of this tribe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:28">Josh. xviii. 28</A>);

 and though Zion, the city of David, is supposed to belong to Judah, yet
 Mount Moriah, on which the temple was built, was in Benjamin's lot. God 
 is <I>therefore</I> said to dwell <I>between his shoulders,</I> because 
 the temple stood on that mount, as the head of a man upon his 
 shoulders. And by this means Benjamin was covered all the day long 
 under the protection of the sanctuary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:2">Ps. cxxv. 2</A>),

 which is often spoken of as a place of refuge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4,5,Ne+6:10">Ps. xxvii. 4, 5; Neh. vi. 10</A>.
 
 Benjamin, dwelling by the temple of God, <I>dwelt in safety by him.</I>
 Note, It is a happy thing to be in the neighbourhood of the temple. 
 This situation of Benjamin, it is likely, was the only thing that kept 
 that tribe in adherence with Judah to the divine institutions, when the 
 other ten tribes apostatized. Those have corrupt and wicked hearts 
 indeed who, the nearer they are to the church, are so much the further 
 from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessing of Joseph, including both Manasseh and Ephraim. In 
 Jacob's blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1-27">Gen. xlix.</A>)

 that of Joseph is the largest, and so it is
 here; and thence Moses here borrows the title he gives to Joseph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that he was <I>separated from his brethren,</I> or, as it might be
 read, <I>a Nazarite among them,</I> both in regard of his piety, 
 wherein it appears, by many instances, he excelled them all, and of his 
 dignity in Egypt, where he was both their ruler and benefactor. His 
 brethren separated him from them by making him a slave, but God 
 distinguished him from them by making him a prince. Now the blessings 
 here prayed for, and prophesied of, for this tribe, are great plenty 
 and great power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Great plenty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>.
 
 In general: <I>Blessed of the Lord be his
 land.</I> Those were very fruitful countries that fell into the lot of 
 Ephraim and Manasseh, yet Moses prays they might be watered with the 
 blessing of God, which makes rich, and on which all fruitfulness 
 depends. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He enumerates many particulars which he prays may contribute to 
 the wealth and abundance of those two tribes, looking up to the Creator 
 for the benefit and serviceableness of all the inferior creatures, for 
 they are all that to us which he makes them to be. He prays, 

 [1.] For seasonable rains and dews, <I>the precious things of 
 heaven;</I> and so precious they are, though but pure water, that 
 without them the fruits of the earth would all fail and be cut off. 
 
 [2.] For plentiful springs, which help to make the earth fruitful, 
 called here <I>the deep that coucheth beneath;</I> both are the 
 <I>rivers of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>),

 and he made particularly the <I>fountains of waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>.
 
 [3.] For the benign influences of the heavenly bodies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>for the precious fruits</I> (the word signifies that which is most
 excellent, and the best in its kind) put forth by the quickening heat 
 of the sun, and the cooling moisture of the moon. "Let them have the 
 yearly fruits in their several months, according to the course of 
 nature, in one month olives, in another dates," &c. So some understand 
 it. 

 [4.] For the fruitfulness even of their hills and mountains, which in 
 other countries used to be barren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 Let them have <I>the chief things of the ancient mountains;</I> and, if
 the mountains be fruitful, the fruits on them will be first and best 
 ripened. They are called ancient mountains, not because prior in time 
 to other mountains, but because , like the first-born, they were 
 superior in worth and excellency; and lasting hills, not only because 
 as other mountains they were immovable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab. iii. 6</A>),

 but because the fruitfulness of them should continue. 

 [5.] For the productions of the lower grounds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>For the precious things of the earth.</I> Though the earth itself
 seems a useless worthless lump of matter, yet there are precious things 
 produced out of it, for the support and comfort of human life. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:5">Job xxviii. 5</A>.

 <I>Out of it cometh bread,</I> because out of it came our bodies, and
 to it they must return. But what are the <I>precious things of the 
 earth</I> to a soul that came from God and must return to him? Or what 
 is its fulness to the fulness that is in Christ, whence we receive 
 grace for grace? Some make these precious things here prayed for to be
 figures of <I>spiritual blessings in heavenly things by Christ,</I> the 
 gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He crowns all with the good-will, or favourable acceptance, of him 
 that <I>dwelt in the bush</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that is, of God, that God who appeared to Moses in the bush that burned
 and was not consumed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:2">Exod. iii. 2</A>),

 to give him his commission for the bringing of Israel out of Egypt.
 Though God's glory appeared there but for a while, yet it is said to 
 dwell there, because it continued as long as there was occasion for it: 
 <I>the good-will of the shechinah in the bush;</I> so it might be read, 
 for <I>shechinah</I> signifies <I>that which dwelleth;</I> and, though 
 it was but a little while a dweller in the bush, yet it continued to 
 dwell with the people of Israel. <I>My dweller in the bush;</I> so it 
 should be rendered; that was an appearance of the divine Majesty to 
 Moses only, in token of the particular interest he had in God, which he 
 desires to improve for the good of this tribe. Many a time God has
 appeared to Moses, but now that he is just dying he seems to have the 
 most pleasing remembrance of that which was the first time, when his 
 acquaintance with the visions of the Almighty first began, and his 
 correspondence with heaven was first settled: that was a time of love 
 never to be forgotten. It was at the bush that God declared himself 
 <I>the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</I> and so confirmed the 
 promise made to the fathers, that promise which reached as far as the 
 resurrection of the body and eternal life, as appears by our Saviour's 
 argument from it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:37">Luke xx. 37</A>.

 So that, when he prays for the good-will of him that <I>dwelt in the
 bush,</I> he has an eye to the covenant then and there renewed, on 
 which all our hopes of God's favour must be bottomed. Now he concludes 
 this large blessing with a prayer for the favour or good-will of God, 
 
 [1.] Because that is the fountain and spring-head of all these 
 blessings; they are gifts of God's good-will; they are so to his own 
 people, whatever they are to others. Indeed when Ephraim (a descendant 
 from Joseph) slid back from God, <I>as a backsliding heifer,</I> those 
 fruits of his country were so far from being the gifts of God's 
 good-will that they were intended but to fatten him for the slaughter,
 <I>as a lamb in a large place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16,17">Hos. iv. 16, 17</A>.

 [2.] Because that is the comfort and sweetness of all these blessings; 
 then we have joy of them when we taste God's good-will in them. 

 [3.] Because that is better than all these, infinitely better; for if 
 we have but the favour and good-will of God we are happy, and may be 
 easy in the want of all these things, and may rejoice in the God of our 
 salvation <I>though the fig-tree do not blossom, and there be no fruit 
 in the vine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Great power Joseph is here blessed with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Here are three instances of his power foretold:

 (1.) His authority among his brethren: <I>His glory is like the
 firstling of his bullock,</I> or young bull, which is a stately 
 creature, and therefore was formerly used as an emblem of royal 
 majesty. Joshua, who was to succeed Moses, was of the tribe of Ephraim 
 the son of Joseph, and his glory was indeed illustrious, and he was an 
 honour to his tribe. In Ephraim was the royal city of the ten tribes 
 afterwards. And of Manasseh were Gideon, Jephthah, and Jair, who were 
 all ornaments and blessings to their country. Some think he is compared 
 to the firstling of the bullock because the birthright which Reuben 
 lost devolved upon Joseph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:1,2">1 Chron. v. 1, 2</A>),

 and to the firstling of <I>his</I> bullock, because Bashan, which was
 in the lot of Manasseh, was famous for bulls and cows, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:12.Am+4:1">Ps. xxii. 12; Amos iv. 1</A>.

 (2.) His force against his enemies and victory over them: <I>His horns
 are like the horn of a unicorn,</I> that is, "The forces he shall bring 
 into the field shall be very strong and formidable, and <I>with them he 
 shall push the people,</I>" that is, "He shall overcome all that stand 
 in his way." It appears from the Ephraimites' contests, both with 
 Gideon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:1">Judg. viii. 1</A>)
 
 and with Jephthah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:1">Judg. xii. 1</A>),

 that they were a warlike tribe and fierce. Yet we find the children of
 Ephraim, when they had forsaken the covenant of God, though they were 
 <I>armed, turning back in the day of battle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:9,10">Ps. lxxviii. 9, 10</A>);

 for, though here pronounced <I>strong and bold as unicorns,</I> when
 God had departed from them they became as weak as other men.

 (3.) The numbers of his people, in which Ephraim, though the younger
 house, exceeded, Jacob having, in the foresight of the same thing, 
 crossed hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:19">Gen. xlviii. 19</A>.

 <I>They are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and the thousands of
 Manasseh.</I> Jonathan's Targum applies it to the ten thousands of
 Canaanites conquered by Joshua, who was of the tribe of Manasseh. And
 the gloss of the Jerusalem Targum upon the former part of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:17">this verse</A>

 is observable, that "as the firstlings of the bullock were never to be
 worked, nor could the unicorn ever be tamed, so Joseph should continue 
 free; and they would have continued free if they had not by sin sold 
 themselves." </P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
 and, Issachar, in thy tents.
 &nbsp; 19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they
 shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck <I>of</I>
 the abundance of the seas, and <I>of</I> treasures hid in the sand.
 &nbsp; 20 And of Gad he said, Blessed <I>be</I> he that enlargeth Gad: he
 dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
 head.
 &nbsp; 21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there,
 <I>in</I> a portion of the lawgiver, <I>was he</I> seated; and he came with
 the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 his judgments with Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The blessings of Zebulun and Issachar put together, for they were 
 both the sons of Jacob by Leah, and by their lot in Canaan they were 
 neighbours; it is foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they should both have a comfortable settlement and employment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Zebulun must rejoice, for he shall have cause to rejoice; and Moses 
 prays that he may have cause in his going out, either to war (for 
 <I>Zebulun jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:18">Judg. v. 18</A>),

 or rather to sea, for Zebulun was a <I>haven of ships,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:13">Gen. xlix. 13</A>.
 
 And Issachar must rejoice in his tents, that is, in his business at
 home, his husbandry, to which the men of that tribe generally confined 
 themselves, because they saw that rest was good, and when the sea was 
 rough the land was pleasant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:14,15">Gen. xlix. 14, 15</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) That the providence of God, as it variously appoints the bounds of
 men's habitation, some in the city and some in the country, some in the 
 seaports and some in the inland towns, so it wisely disposes men's 
 inclinations to different employments for the good of the public, as 
 each member of the body is situated and qualified for the service of 
 the whole. The genius of some men leads them to a book, of others to 
 the sea, of others to the sword; some are inclined to rural affairs, 
 others to trade, and some have a turn for mechanics; and it is well it 
 is so. <I>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:17">1 Cor. xii. 17</A>.

 It was for the common good of Israel that the men of Zebulun were
 merchants and that the men of Issachar were husbandmen. 

 (2.) That whatever our place and business are it is our wisdom and duty
 to accommodate ourselves to them, and it is a great happiness to be 
 well pleased with them. Let Zebulun rejoice in his going out; let him 
 thank God for the gains and make the best of the losses and 
 inconveniences of his merchandise, and not despise the meanness, nor 
 envy the quietness, of Issachar's tents. Let <I>Issachar rejoice in his 
 tents,</I> let him be well pleased with the retirements and content 
 with the small profits of his country seats, and not grudge that he has 
 not Zebulun's pleasure of travelling and profit of trading. Every
 business has both its conveniences and inconveniences, and therefore 
 whatever Providence has made our business we ought to bring our minds 
 to it; and it is really a great happiness, whatever our lot is, to be 
 easy with it. <I>This is the gift of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:19">Eccl. v. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they should both be serviceable in their places to the honour 
 of God and the interests of religion in the nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They shall call the people to the mountain,</I> that is, to the
 <I>temple,</I> which Moses foresaw should be built upon a mountain. I 
 see not why this should be confined (as it is by most interpreters) to 
 Zebulun; if both Zebulun and Issachar received the comforts of their 
 respective employments, why may we not suppose that they both took care 
 to give God the glory of them? Two things they shall do for God:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They shall invite others to his service. <I>Call the people to the
 mountain.</I> 

 [1.] Zebulun shall improve his acquaintance and commerce with the
 neighbouring nations, to whom he goes out, for this noble purpose, to 
 propagate religion among them, and to invite them into the service of 
 the God of Israel. Note, Men of great business, or large conversation, 
 should wisely and zealously endeavour to recommend the practice of 
 serious godliness to those with whom they converse and among whom their 
 business lies. Such are blessed, for they are blessings. It were well 
 if the enlargement of trade with foreign countries might be made to 
 contribute to the spreading of the gospel. This prophecy concerning
 Zebulun perhaps looks as far as the preaching of Christ and his 
 apostles, which began in the land of Zebulun

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:14,15">Matt. iv. 14, 15</A>);

 then they <I>called the people to the mountain,</I> that is, to the
 kingdom of the Messiah, which is called the <I>mountain of the Lord's 
 house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:2">Isa. ii. 2</A>.

 [2.] Issachar that tarries at home, and dwells in tents, shall call 
 upon his neighbours to go up to the sanctuary at the times appointed 
 for their solemn feasts, either because they should be more zealous and 
 forward than their neighbours (and it has been often observed that 
 though those that with Zebulun dwell in the haven of ships, which are 
 places of concourse, have commonly more of the <I>light</I> of 
 religion, those that with Issachar dwell in tents in the country have 
 more of the <I>life</I> and <I>heat</I> of it), and may therefore with 
 their zeal provoke those to a holy emulation that have more knowledge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>);

 or because they were more observant of the times appointed for their
 feasts than others were. One of the Chaldee paraphrasts reads the 
 foregoing verse, <I>Rejoice, Issachar, in the tents of thy schools,</I> 
 supposing they would many of them be scholars, and would use their 
 learning for that purpose, according to the revolutions of the year, to 
 give notice of the times of the feasts; for almanacs were not then so 
 common as they are now. And Onkelos more particularly, <I>Rejoice, 
 Issachar, when thou goest to compute the times of the solemnities at 
 Jerusalem;</I> for then <I>the tribes of Israel shall be gathered to 
 the mountain of the house of the sanctuary.</I> So he reads the 
 beginning of this verse; and many think this is the meaning of that 
 character of the men of Issachar in David's time, That <I>they had 
 understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:32">1 Chron. xii. 32</A>.

 And the character which follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 of the men of Zebulun, that they were such as <I>went forth to battle,
 expert in war,</I> perhaps may explain the blessing of that tribe here.
 Note, Those that have not opportunity as Zebulun had of bringing into 
 the church those that are without may yet be very serviceable to its 
 interest by helping to quicken, encourage, and build up, those that are 
 within. And it is good work to call people to God's ordinances, to put 
 those in remembrance that are forgetful, and to stir up those that are 
 slothful, who will follow, but care not to lead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall not only invite others to the service of God, but they 
 shall abound in it themselves: <I>There they shall offer sacrifices of 
 righteousness.</I> They shall not send others to the temple and stay at 
 home themselves, under pretence that they cannot leave their business; 
 but, when they stir up others to <I>go speedily to pray before the 
 Lord,</I> they shall say, <I>We will go also,</I> as it is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:12">Zech. viii. 21</A>.
 
 Note, The good we exhort others to we should ourselves be examples of.
 And, when they come to the temple, they shall not appear before the 
 Lord empty, but shall bring for the honour and service of God according 
 as he has prospered them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 [1.] It is here foretold that both these tribes should grow rich.
 Zebulun that goes abroad shall <I>suck of the abundance of the 
 seas,</I> which are full breasts to the merchants, while Issachar, that 
 tarries at home, shall enrich himself with <I>treasures hid in the 
 sands,</I> either the fruits of the earth or the underground treasures 
 of metals and minerals, or (because the word for sand here signifies 
 properly the sand of the sea) the rich things thrown up by the sea, for 
 the lot of Issachar reached to the sea-side. Perhaps their success in 
 <I>calling the people to the mount</I> is intimated by their <I>sucking 
 of the abundance of the seas,</I> for we have a like phrase used for 
 the bringing in of the nations to the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:5">Isa. lx. 5</A>),

 <I>The abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 <I>Thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles.</I> It is foretold, 

 [2.] That these tribes, being thus enriched, should <I>consecrate their
 gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:13">Mic. iv. 13</A>.

 The <I>merchandise</I> of Zebulun, and the <I>hire</I> of Issachar,
 shall be <I>holiness to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>),

 for thereof they shall <I>offer sacrifices of righteousness,</I> that
 is, sacrifices according to the law. Note, We must serve and honour God 
 with what we have; and where he sows plentifully he expects to reap 
 accordingly. Those that <I>suck of the abundance of the seas, and of 
 the treasures hid in the sand,</I> ought to offer sacrifices of 
 righteousness proportionable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessing of the tribe of Gad comes next, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 This was one of the tribes that was already seated on that side Jordan 
 where Moses now was. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He foretels what this tribe would be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 (1.) That it would be enlarged, as at present it had a spacious
 allotment; and he gives God the glory both of its present and of its 
 future extent: <I>Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad.</I> We find how 
 this tribe was enlarged by their success in a war which it seems they 
 carried on very religiously against the Hagarites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:19,20,22">1 Chron. v. 19, 20, 22</A>.

 Note, God is to have the glory of all our enlargements. 

 (2.) That it would be a valiant and victorious tribe, would, if let
 alone, dwell secure and fearless as a lion; but, if provoked, would, 
 like a lion, <I>tear the arm with the crown of the head;</I> that is, 
 would pull in pieces all that stood in his way, both the arm (that is, 
 the strength) and the crown of the head (that is, the policy and 
 authority) of his enemies. In David's time there were Gadites whose 
 faces were <I>as the faces of lions,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:8">1 Chron. xii. 8</A>.

 Some reckon Jehu to be of this tribe, because the first mention we have
 of him is at Ramoth Gilead, which belonged to Gad, and they think this 
 may refer to his valiant acts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He commends this tribe for what they had done and were now doing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 (1.) They had done very wisely for themselves, when they chose their
 lot with the first, in a country already conquered: <I>He provided the 
 first part for himself;</I> though he had a concern for his brethren, 
 yet his charity began at home, and he was willing to see himself first 
 served, first settled. The Gadites were the first and most active 
 movers for an allotment on that side Jordan, and therefore are still 
 mentioned before the Reubenites in the history of that affair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:2">Num. xxxii. 2</A>.

 And thus, while the other tribes had their portion assigned them by
 Joshua the conqueror, Gad and his companions had theirs from Moses the 
 law-giver, and in it they were seated by law; or (as the word is) 
 <I>covered</I> or protected by a special providence which watched over 
 those that were left behind, while the men of war went forward with 
 their brethren. Note, <I>Men will praise thee when thou doest well for 
 thyself</I> (when thou providest first for thyself, as Gad did),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18">Ps. xlix. 18</A>.

 And God will praise thee when thou doest well for thy soul, which is
 indeed thyself, and providest the first part for that in a portion from 
 the law-giver.

 (2.) They were now doing honestly and bravely for their brethren; for
 they <I>came with the heads of the people,</I> before whom they went 
 armed over Jordan, to <I>execute the justice of the Lord</I> upon the 
 Canaanites, under the conduct of Joshua, to whom we afterwards find 
 they solemnly vowed obedience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:12,16">Josh. i. 12, 16</A>.

 This was what they undertook to do when they had their lot assigned
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:27">Num. xxxii. 27</A>.
 
 This they did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:12">Josh. iv. 12</A>.

 And, when the wars of Canaan were ended, Joshua dismissed them with a
 blessing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:7">Josh. xxii. 7</A>.
 
 Note, It is a blessed and honourable thing to be helpful to our
 brethren in their affairs, and particularly to assist in executing the 
 justice of the Lord by suppressing that which is provoking to him: it 
 was this that was counted to Phinehas for righteousness.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The blessing of Dan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Jacob in his blessing had compared him to a serpent for subtlety; Moses
 compares him to a lion for courage and resolution: and what could stand 
 before those that had the head of a serpent and the heart of a lion?
 He is compared to the lions that leaped from Bashan, a mountain noted 
 for fierce lions, whence they came down to leap upon their prey in the 
 plains. This may refer either, 

 1. To the particular victories obtained by Samson (who was of this
 tribe) over the Philistines. <I>The Spirit of the Lord began to move 
 him in the camp of Dan</I> when he was very young, as <I>a lion's 
 whelp,</I> so that in his attacks upon the Philistines he surprised 
 them, and overpowered them by main strength, as a lion does his prey; 
 and one of his first exploits was the rending of a lion. Or, 

 2. To a more general achievement of that tribe, when a party of them,
 upon information brought them of the security of Laish, which lay in 
 the furthest part of the land of Canaan from them, surprised it, and 
 soon made themselves masters of it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:27">Judg. xviii. 27</A>.

 And, the mountains of Bashan lying not far from that city, probably
 thence they made their descent upon it; and therefore are here said to 
 <I>leap from Bashan.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessing of Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He looks upon this tribe with wonder, and applauds it: "O Naphtali, 
 thou art happy, thou shalt be so, mayest thou be ever so!" Three things 
 make up the happiness of this tribe:--

 1. Be thou <I>satisfied with favour.</I> Some understand it of the 
 favour of men, their good-will and good word. Jacob had described this 
 tribe to be, generally, courteous obliging people, giving goodly words, 
 as the loving hind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:21">Gen. xlix. 21</A>.

 Now what should they get by being so? Moses here tells them they
 should have an interest in the affections of their neighbours, and be 
 satisfied with favour. Those that are loving shall be beloved. But 
 others understand it of the favour of God, and with good reason; for 
 that only is the favour that is satisfying to the soul and puts true 
 gladness into the heart. Those are happy indeed that have the favour of 
 God; and those shall have it that place their satisfaction in it, and 
 reckon that, in having that, they have enough and desire no more. 

 2. Be thou <I>full with the blessing of the Lord,</I> that is, not only
 with those good things that are the fruits of the blessing (corn, and 
 wine, and oil), but with the blessing itself; that is, the grace of 
 God, according to his promise and covenant. Those who have that 
 blessing may well reckon themselves full: they need nothing else to 
 make them happy. "The portion of the tribe of Naphtali" (the Jews say)
 "was so fruitful, and the productions so forward, though it lay north, 
 that those of that tribe were generally the first that brought their 
 first-fruits to the temple; and so they had first the blessing from the 
 priest, which was the blessing of the Lord." Capernaum, in which Christ 
 chiefly resided, lay in this tribe.

 3. Be thou <I>in possession of the sea and the south;</I> so it may be
 read, that is, of that sea which shall lie south of thy lot, that was 
 the sea of Galilee, which we so often read of in the gospels, directly 
 north of which the lot of this tribe lay, and which was of great 
 advantage to this tribe, witness the wealth of Capernaum and Bethsaida, 
 which lay within this tribe, and upon the shore of that sea. See how
 Moses was guided by a spirit of prophesy in these blessings; for before 
 the lot was cast into the lap he foresaw and foretold how the disposal 
 of it would be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The blessing of Asher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Four things he prays for and prophecies concerning this tribe, which 
 carries blessedness in its name; for Leah called the father of it 
 <I>Asher,</I> saying <I>Happy am I,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:13">Gen. xxx. 13</A>.

 1. The increase of their numbers. They were now a numerous tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:47">Num. xxvi. 47</A>.

 "Let it be more so: <I>Let Asher be blessed with children.</I>" Note,
 Children, especially children of the covenant, are blessings, not 
 burdens.

 2. Their interest in their neighbours: <I>Let him be acceptable to his
 brethren.</I> Note, It is a very desirable thing to have the love and 
 good-will of those we live among: it is what we should pray to God for, 
 who has all hearts in his hand; and what we should endeavour to gain by 
 meekness and humility, and a readiness, as we have ability and 
 opportunity, to do good to all men. 
 
 3. The richness of their land.

 (1.) Above ground: <I>Let him dip his foot in oil,</I> that is, "Let
 him have such plenty of it in his lot that he may not only anoint his 
 head with it, but, if he please, wash his feet in it," which was not 
 commonly done; yet we find our blessed Saviour so acceptable to his 
 brethren that his feet were anointed with the most precious ointment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:46">Luke vii. 46</A>.

 (2.) Under ground: <I>Thy shoes shall be iron and brass,</I> that is,
 "Thou shalt have great plenty of these metals (mines of them) in thy 
 own ground, which by an uncommon blessing shall have both its surface 
 and its bowels rich:" or, if they had them not as the productions of 
 their own country, they should have them imported from abroad; for the 
 lot of this tribe lay on the sea-coast. The Chaldee paraphrasts 
 understand this figuratively: "Thou shalt be strong and bright, as iron 
 and brass." 

 4. The continuance of their strength and vigour: <I>As thy days, so
 shall thy strength be.</I> Many paraphrase it thus, "The strength of 
 thy old age shall be like that of thy youth; thou shalt not feel a 
 decay, nor be the worse for the wearing, but shalt renew thy youth; as 
 if not thy shoes only, but thy bones, were iron and brass." The day is 
 often in scripture put for the events of the day; and, taking it so 
 here, it is a promise that God would graciously support them under 
 their trials and troubles, whatever they were. And so it is a promise 
 sure to all the spiritual seed of Abraham, that God will wisely 
 proportion their graces and comforts to the services and sufferings he 
 calls them out to. Have they work appointed them? They shall have 
 strength to do it. Have they burdens appointed them? They shall have 
 strength to bear them; and never be <I>tempted above that they are 
 able.</I> Faithful is he that has thus promised, and hath caused us to 
 hope in this promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are the last words of all that ever Moses, that great writer, 
 that great dictator, either wrote himself or had written from his 
 dictation; they are therefore very remarkable, and no doubt we shall 
 find them very improving. Moses, the man of God (who had as much reason 
 as ever any mere man had to know both), with his last breath magnifies 
 both the God of Israel and the Israel of God. They are both 
 incomparable in his eye; and we are sure that in this his judgment of 
 both his eye did not wax dim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. No God like the God of Israel. None of the gods of the nations were 
 capable of doing that for their worshippers which Jehovah did for his: 
 <I>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Note, When we are expecting that God should bless us in doing well for 
 us we must bless him by speaking well of him: and one of the most 
 solemn ways of praising God is by acknowledging that there is none like 
 him. Now, 

 1. This was the honour of Israel. Every nation boasted of its god; but
 none had such a God to boast of as Israel had. 

 2. It was their happiness that they were taken into covenant with such
 a God. Two things he takes notice of as proofs of the incontestable 
 pre-eminence of the God of Jeshurun above all other gods:

 (1.) His sovereign power and authority: <I>He rides upon the
 heavens,</I> and with the greatest state and magnificence on the skies. 
 Riding on the heavens denotes his greatness and glory, in which he 
 manifests himself to the upper world, and the use he makes of the 
 influences of heaven, and the productions of the clouds, in bringing to 
 pass his own counsels in this lower world: he manages and directs them 
 as a man does the horse he rides on. When he has any thing to do for
 his people he <I>rides upon the heavens</I> to do it; for he does it 
 swiftly and strongly: no enemy can either anticipate or obstruct the 
 progress of him that rides on the heavens.

 (2.) His boundless eternity; he is the eternal God, and his arms are
 <I>everlasting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The gods of the heathen were but lately invented, and would shortly 
 perish; but the God of Jeshurun is eternal: he was before all worlds, 
 and will be when time and days shall be no more. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:12">Hab. i. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. No people like the Israel of God. Having pronounced each tribe 
 happy, in the close he pronounces all together very happy, so happy in 
 all respects that there was no nation under the sun comparable to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Happy art thou, O Israel,</I> a people whose God is the Lord, on
 that account truly happy, and <I>none like unto thee.</I> If Israel 
 honour God as a non-such God, he will favour them so as to make them a 
 non-such people, the envy of all their neighbours and the joy of all 
 their well-wishers. <I>Who is like unto thee, O people? Behold, thou 
 art fair, my love,</I> says Christ of his spouse. To which she 
 presently returns, <I>Behold thou art fair, my beloved. What one 
 nation</I> (no, not all the nations together) is <I>like thy people 
 Israel?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:23">2 Sam. vii. 23</A>.

 What is here said of the church of Israel and the honours and
 privileges of it is certainly to be applied to <I>the church of the 
 first-born,</I> that are written in heaven. The Christian church is the 
 Israel of God, as the apostle calls it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16">Gal. vi. 16</A>),

 on which there shall be peace, and which is dignified above all
 societies in the world, as Israel was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Never were people so well seated and sheltered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>The eternal God is thy refuge.</I> Or, as the word signifies, "thy
 <I>habitation,</I> or <I>mansion-house,</I> in which thou art safe, and 
 easy, and at rest, as a man in his own house." Every Israelite indeed 
 is at home in God; the soul returns to him, and reposes in him as its 
 resting-place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:7">Ps. cxvi. 7</A>),
 
 its hiding-place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:7">Ps. xxxii. 7</A>.

 And those that make him their habitation shall have all the comforts
 and benefits of a habitation in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1">Ps. xci. 1</A>.

 Moses had an eye to God as the habitation of Israel when they were
 wandering in the wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1">Ps. xc. 1</A>):
 
 <I>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.</I> And
 now that they were going to settle in Canaan they must not change their 
 habitation; still they will need, and still they shall have, the 
 eternal God for their dwelling-place; without him Canaan itself would 
 be a wilderness, and a land of darkness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Never were people so well supported and borne up: <I>Underneath are 
 the everlasting arms;</I> that is, the almighty power of God is engaged 
 for the protection and consolation of all that trust in him, in their 
 greatest straits and distresses, and under the heaviest burdens. The 
 everlasting arms shall support, 

 (1.) The interests of the church in general, that they shall not sink,
 or be run down; underneath the church is that rock of ages on which it 
 is built, and against which the gates of hell shall never prevail,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Matt. xvi. 18</A>.

 (2.) The spirits or particular believers, so that, though they may be
 oppressed, they shall not be overwhelmed by any trouble. How low soever 
 the people of God are at any time brought, everlasting arms are 
 underneath them to keep the spirit from sinking, from fainting, and the 
 faith from failing, even when they are pressed above measure. The 
 everlasting covenant, and the everlasting consolations that flow from 
 it, are indeed everlasting arms, with which believers have been 
 wonderfully sustained, and kept cheerful in the worst of times; divine 
 grace is sufficient for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9">2 Cor. xii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Never were people so well commanded and led on to battle: "<I>He 
 shall thrust out the enemy from before thee</I> by his almighty power, 
 which will make room for thee; and by a commission which will bear thee 
 out he shall say, <I>Destroy them.</I>" They were now entering upon a 
 land that was in the full possession of a strong and formidable people, 
 and who, being its first planters, looked upon themselves as its 
 rightful owners; how shall Israel justify, and how shall they 
 accomplish, the expulsion of them? 

 (1.) God will give them a commission to destroy the Canaanites, and
 that will justify them, and bear them out in it, against all the world. 
 He that is sovereign Lord of all lives and all lands not only allowed 
 and permitted, but expressly commanded and appointed the children of 
 Israel both to take possession of the land of Canaan and to put the 
 sword to the people of Canaan, which, being thus authorized, they might 
 not only lawfully but honourably do, without incurring the least stain 
 or imputation of theft by the one or murder by the other.

 (2.) God will give them power and ability to destroy them; nay, he will
 in effect do it to their hands: he will <I>thrust out the enemy from 
 before them;</I> for the very fear of Israel shall put them to flight. 
 God <I>drive out the heathen to plant his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:2">Ps. xliv. 2</A>.

 Thus believers are more than conquerors over their spiritual enemies,
 through Christ that loved them. The captain of our salvation <I>thrust 
 out the enemy from before us</I> when he overcame the world and spoiled 
 principalities and powers on the cross; and the word of command to us 
 is, "<I>Destroy them;</I> pursue the victory, and you shall divide the 
 spoil."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Never were people so well secured and protected 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Israel shall then dwell in safety alone.</I> Those that dwell in
 God, and make his name their strong tower, <I>dwell in safety;</I> the 
 <I>place of their defence is the munitions of rocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:16">Isa. xxxiii. 16</A>.
 
 They shall dwell in safety alone.

 (1.) Though alone. Though they contract no alliances with their
 neighbours, nor have any reason to expect help or succour from any of 
 them, yet they shall dwell in safety; they shall really be safe, and 
 they shall think themselves so.

 (2.) Because alone. They shall dwell in safety as long as they
 continue pure, and unmixed with the heathen, a singular and peculiar 
 people. Their distinction from other nations, though it made them 
 <I>like a speckled bird</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9">Jer. xii. 9</A>),

 and exposed them to the ill-will of those about them, yet was really
 their preservation from the mischief their neighbours wished them, as 
 it kept them under the divine protection. All that keep close to God 
 shall be kept safely by him. It is promised that in the kingdom of 
 Christ <I>Israel shall dwell safely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:6">Jer. xxiii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Never were people so well provided for: <I>The fountain of Jacob</I> 
 (that is, the present generation of that people, which is as the 
 fountain to all the streams that shall hereafter descend and be derived 
 from it) shall now presently be fixed upon a good land. <I>The eye of 
 Jacob</I> (so it might be read, for the same word signifies a fountain 
 and an eye) <I>is upon the land of corn and wine,</I> that is, where 
 they now lay encamped they had Canaan in their eye, it was just before 
 their faces, on the other side the river, and they would have it in 
 their hands and under their feet quickly. This land upon which they had 
 set their eye was blessed both with the fatness of the earth and the 
 dew of heaven; it was a <I>land of corn and wine,</I> substantial and 
 useful productions: also his heavens (as if the heavens were 
 particularly designed to be blessings to that land) <I>shall drop down 
 dew,</I> without which, though the soil were ever so good, the corn and 
 wine would soon fail. Every Israelite indeed has his eye, the eye of 
 faith, upon the better country, the heavenly Canaan, which is richly 
 replenished with better things than corn and wine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Never were people so well helped. If they were in any strait, God 
 himself rode upon the heavens for <I>their help,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 And they were <I>a people saved by the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 If they were in danger of any harm, or in want of any good, they had an 
 eternal God to go to, an almighty power to trust to; nothing could hurt 
 those whom God helped, nor was it possible that the people should 
 perish which <I>was saved by the Lord.</I> Those that are added to the 
 gospel Israel are <I>such as shall be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:47">Acts ii. 47</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Never were people so well armed. God himself was the shield of their 
 help by whom they were armed defensively, and sufficiently guarded 
 against all assailants: and he was the <I>sword of their 
 excellency,</I> by whom they were armed offensively, and made both 
 formidable and successful in all their wars. God is called the <I>sword 
 of their excellency</I> because, in fighting for them, he made them to 
 excel other people, or because in all he did for them he had an eye to 
 his sanctuary among them, which is called the <I>excellency of 
 Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4,Eze+24:21,Am+6">Ps. xlvii. 4;
 Ezek. xxiv. 21; Amos vi. 8</A>.

 Those in whose hearts is the excellency of holiness have God himself
 for their shield and sword--are defended by the whole armour of God; 
 his word is their sword, and faith in it is their shield, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16,17">Eph. vi. 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. Never were people so well assured of victory over their enemies:
 <I>They shall be found liars unto thee;</I> That is, "shall be forced 
 to submit to thee sorely against their will, so that it will be but a 
 counterfeit submission; yet the point shall be gained, for thou shalt 
 <I>tread upon their necks</I>" (so the LXX.), which we find done,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:24">Josh. x. 24</A>.

 "Thou shalt tread down their strong-holds, be they ever so high, and
 trample upon their palaces and temples, though esteemed ever so sacred.
 <I>If thy enemies be found liars to thee</I>" (so some read it), 
 "<I>thou shalt tread upon their high places;</I> if they will not be 
 held by the bonds of leagues and treaties, they shall be broken by the 
 force of war." Thus shall the God of peace tread Satan under the feet 
 of all believers, and shall <I>do it shortly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20">Rom. xvi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now lay all this together, and then you will say, <I>Happy art thou, O 
 Israel! Who is like unto thee, O people!</I> Thrice happy the people
 whose God is the Lord.</P>
