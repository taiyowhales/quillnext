 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And thou shalt make an altar <I>of</I> shittim wood, five cubits
 long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and
 the height thereof <I>shall be</I> three cubits.
 &nbsp; 2 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
 thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay
 it with brass.
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
 shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
 all the vessels thereof thou shalt make <I>of</I> brass.
 &nbsp; 4 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network <I>of</I> brass; and
 upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
 corners thereof.
 &nbsp; 5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
 that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.
 &nbsp; 6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves <I>of</I> shittim
 wood, and overlay them with brass.
 &nbsp; 7 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
 shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.
 &nbsp; 8 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was showed thee
 in the mount, so shall they make <I>it.</I>

 As God intended in the tabernacle to manifest his presence among his 
 people, so there they were to pay their devotions to him, not in the 
 tabernacle itself (into that only the priests entered as God's domestic 
 servants), but in the court before the tabernacle, where, as common 
 subjects, they attended. There an altar was ordered to be set up, to 
 which they must bring their sacrifices, and on which their priests must 
 offer them to God: and this altar was to sanctify their gifts. Here 
 they were to present their services to God, as from the mercy-seat he 
 gave his oracles to them; and thus a communion was settled between God 
 and Israel. Moses is here directed about, 

 1. The dimensions of it; it was square,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 2. The horns of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which were for ornament and for use; the sacrifices were <I>bound with 
 cords to the horns of the altar,</I> and to them malefactors fled for 
 refuge. 
 
 3. The materials; it was of wood overlaid with brass,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 4. The appurtenances of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which were all of brass.

 5. The grate, which was let into the hollow of the altar, about the
 middle of it, in which the fire was kept, and the sacrifice burnt; it 
 was made of network like a sieve, and hung hollow, that the fire might 
 burn the better, and that the ashes might fall through into the hollow 
 of the altar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 6. The staves with which it must be carried,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 And, <I>lastly,</I> he is referred to the pattern shown him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 Now this brazen altar was a type of Christ dying to make atonement for 
 our sins: the wood would have been consumed by the fire from heaven if 
 it had not been secured by the brass; nor could the human nature of 
 Christ have borne the wrath of God if it had not been supported by a 
 divine power. Christ sanctified himself for his church, as their altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>),

 and by his mediation sanctifies the daily services of his people, who
 have also <I>a right to eat of this altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10">Heb. xiii. 10</A>),

 for they serve at it as spiritual priests. To the horns of this altar
 poor sinners fly for refuge when justice pursues them, and they are 
 safe in virtue of the sacrifice there offered.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the
 south side southward <I>there shall be</I> hangings for the court <I>of</I>
 fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:
 &nbsp; 10 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets
 <I>shall be of</I> brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
 <I>shall be of</I> silver.
 &nbsp; 11 And likewise for the north side in length <I>there shall be</I>
 hangings of an hundred <I>cubits</I> long, and his twenty pillars and
 their twenty sockets <I>of</I> brass; the hooks of the pillars and
 their fillets <I>of</I> silver.
 &nbsp; 12 And <I>for</I> the breadth of the court on the west side <I>shall
 be</I> hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their
 sockets ten.
 &nbsp; 13 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward
 <I>shall be</I> fifty cubits.
 &nbsp; 14 The hangings of one side <I>of the gate shall be</I> fifteen
 cubits: their pillars three, and their sockets three.
 &nbsp; 15 And on the other side <I>shall be</I> hangings fifteen <I>cubits:</I>
 their pillars three, and their sockets three.
 &nbsp; 16 And for the gate of the court <I>shall be</I> an hanging of
 twenty cubits, <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
 twined linen, wrought with needlework: <I>and</I> their pillars <I>shall
 be</I> four, and their sockets four.
 &nbsp; 17 All the pillars round about the court <I>shall be</I> filleted
 with silver; their hooks <I>shall be of</I> silver, and their sockets
 <I>of</I> brass.
 &nbsp; 18 The length of the court <I>shall be</I> an hundred cubits, and
 the breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits <I>of</I>
 fine twined linen, and their sockets <I>of</I> brass.
 &nbsp; 19 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service
 thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court,
 <I>shall be of</I> brass.

 Before the tabernacle there was to be a court or yard, enclosed with 
 hangings of the finest linen that was used for tents. This court, 
 according to the common computation of cubits, was fifty yards long, 
 and twenty-five broad. Pillars were set up at convenient distances, in 
 sockets of brass, the pillars filleted with silver, and silver 
 tenter-hooks in them, on which the linen hangings were fastened: the 
 hanging which served for the gate was finer than the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This court was a type of the church, enclosed and distinguished from 
 the rest of the world, the enclosure supported by pillars, denoting the 
 stability of the church, hung with the clean linen, which is said to be 
 the <I>righteousness of saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>.

 These were the courts David longed for and coveted to reside in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:2,10">Ps. lxxxiv. 2, 10</A>),

 and into which the people of God entered with praise and thanksgiving

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:4">Ps. c. 4</A>);

 yet this court would contain but a few worshippers. Thanks be to God,
 now, under the gospel, the enclosure is taken down. God's will is that
 men <I>pray every where;</I> and there is room for all that in every 
 place call on the name of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they
 bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp
 to burn always.
 &nbsp; 21 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail,
 which <I>is</I> before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order
 it from evening to morning before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: <I>it shall be</I> a
 statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the
 children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read of the candlestick in the twenty-fifth chapter; here is an 
 order given for the keeping of the lamps constantly burning in it, else 
 it was useless; in every candlestick there should be a burning and 
 shining light; candlesticks without candles are as <I>wells without 
 water</I> or as <I>clouds without rain.</I> Now, 

 1. The people were to provide the oil; from them the Lord's ministers 
 must have their maintenance. Or, rather, the pure oil signified the 
 gifts and graces of the Spirit, which are communicated to all believers 
 from Christ the good olive, of whose fulness we receive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:11,12">Zech. iv. 11, 12</A>),

 and without which our light cannot shine before men. 

 2. The priests were to light the lamps, and to tend them; it was part 
 of their daily service to <I>cause the lamp to burn always,</I> night 
 and day; thus it is the work of ministers, by the preaching and 
 expounding of the scriptures (which are as a lamp), to enlighten the 
 church, God's tabernacle upon the earth, and to direct the spiritual 
 priests in his service. This is to be <I>a statute for ever,</I> that 
 the lamps of the word be lighted as duly as the incense of prayer and 
 praise is offered.</P>
