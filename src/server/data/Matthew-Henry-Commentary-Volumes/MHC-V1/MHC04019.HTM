 This chapter is only concerning the preparing and using of the ashes 
 which were to impregnate the water of purification. The people had 
 complained of the strictness of the law, which forbade their near 
 approach to the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:13"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 13</A>.

 In answer to this complaint, they are here directed to purify
 themselves, so as that they might come as far as they had occasion 
 without fear. Here is, 

 I. The method of preparing these ashes, by the burning of a red heifer,
 with a great deal of ceremony,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. The way of using them. 

 1. They were designed to purify persons from the pollution contracted
 by a dead body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.

 2. They were to be put into running water (a small quantity of them),
 with which the person to be cleansed must be purified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:17-22">ver.  17-22</A>.
 
 And that this ceremonial purification was a type and figure of the
 cleansing of the consciences of believers from the pollutions of sin 
 appears by the apostle's discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:13,14">Heb. ix. 13, 14</A>,

 where he compares the efficacy of the blood of Christ with the
 sanctifying virtue that was in "the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the 
 unclean."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 This <I>is</I> the ordinance of the law which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they
 bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein <I>is</I> no blemish,
 <I>and</I> upon which never came yoke:
 &nbsp; 3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
 bring her forth without the camp, and <I>one</I> shall slay her before
 his face:
 &nbsp; 4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
 finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle
 of the congregation seven times:
 &nbsp; 5 And <I>one</I> shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and
 her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
 &nbsp; 6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and
 scarlet, and cast <I>it</I> into the midst of the burning of the
 heifer.
 &nbsp; 7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe
 his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp,
 and the priest shall be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
 bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 9 And a man <I>that is</I> clean shall gather up the ashes of the
 heifer, and lay <I>them</I> up without the camp in a clean place, and
 it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel
 for a water of separation: it <I>is</I> a purification for sin.
 &nbsp; 10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
 clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the
 children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among
 them, for a statute for ever.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the divine appointment concerning the solemn burning of a 
 red heifer to ashes, and the preserving of the ashes, that of them 
 might be made, not a beautifying, but a purifying, water, for that was 
 the utmost the law reached to; it offered not to adorn as the gospel 
 does, but to cleanse only. This burning of the heifer, though it was 
 not properly a sacrifice of expiation, being not performed at the 
 altar, yet was typical of the death and sufferings of Christ, by which 
 he intended, not only to satisfy God's justice, but to purify and 
 pacify our consciences, that we may have peace with God and also peace 
 in our own bosoms, to prepare for which Christ died, not only like the 
 bulls and goats at the altar, but like the heifer without the camp.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There was a great deal of care employed in the choice of the heifer 
 that was to be burnt, much more than in the choice of any other 
 offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It must not only be without blemish, typifying the spotless purity and 
 sinless perfection of the Lord Jesus, but it must a red heifer, because 
 of the rarity of the colour, that it might be the more remarkable: the 
 Jews say, "If but two hairs were black or white, it was unlawful." 
 Christ, as man, was the Son of Adam, <I>red earth,</I> and we find him 
 red in his apparel, red with his own blood, and red with the blood of 
 his enemies. And it must be one on which never came yoke, which was not 
 insisted on in other sacrifices, but thus was typified the voluntary 
 offer of the Lord Jesus, when he said, <I>Lo, I come,</I> He was bound 
 and held with no other cords than those of his own love. This heifer 
 was to be provided at the expense of the congregation, because they 
 were all to have a joint interest in it; and so all believers have in 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There was to be a great deal of ceremony in the burning of it. The 
 care of doing it was committed to Eleazar, not to Aaron himself, 
 because it was not fit that he should do any thing to render himself 
 ceremonially unclean, no, not so much as <I>till the evening</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 yet it being an affair of great concern especially in the significancy 
 of it, it was to be performed by him that was next to Aaron in dignity. 
 The chief priests of that time had the principal hand in the death of 
 Christ.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The heifer was to be slain without the camp, as an impure thing, 
 which bespeaks the insufficiency of the methods prescribed by the 
 ceremonial law to take away sin. So far were they from cleansing 
 effectually that they were themselves unclean; as if the pollution that 
 was laid upon them continued to cleave to them. Yet, to answer this 
 type, our Lord Jesus, being made sin and a curse for us, <I>suffered 
 without the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12">Heb. xiii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Eleazar was to <I>sprinkle the blood directly before the door of the 
 tabernacle,</I> and looking steadfastly towards it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This made it in some sort an expiation; for the sprinkling of the blood 
 before the Lord was the chief solemnity in all the sacrifices of 
 atonement; therefore, though this was not done at the altar, yet, being 
 done towards the sanctuary, it was intimated that the virtue and 
 validity of it depended upon the sanctuary, and were derived from it. 
 This signified the satisfaction that was made to God by the death of 
 Christ, our great high priest, who <I>by the eternal Spirit</I> (and 
 the Spirit is called the finger of God, as Ainsworth observes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:20">Luke xi. 20</A>)

 <I>offered himself without spot unto God;</I> directly before the
 sanctuary, when he said, <I>Father, into thy hands I commit my 
 spirit.</I> It also signifies how necessary it was to the purifying of 
 our hearts that satisfaction should be made to divine justice. This 
 sprinkling of the blood put virtue into the ashes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The heifer was to be <I>wholly burnt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This typified the extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus, both in soul 
 and body, as a sacrifice made by fire. The priest was to cast into the 
 fire, while it was burning, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet, which were 
 used in the cleansing of lepers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:6,7">Lev. xiv. 6, 7</A>),

 that the ashes of these might be mingled with the ashes of the heifer,
 because they were designed for purification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The ashes of the heifer (separated as well as they could from the 
 ashes of the wood wherewith it was burnt) were to be carefully gathered 
 up by the hand of a clean person, and (as the Jews say) pounded and 
 sifted, and so laid up for the use of the congregation, as there was 
 occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not only for that generation, but for posterity; for the ashes of this 
 one heifer were sufficient to season as many vessels of water as the 
 people of Israel would need for many ages. The Jews say that this one 
 served till the captivity, nearly 1000 years, and that there was never 
 another heifer burnt till Ezra's time, after their return, to which 
 tradition of theirs, grounded (I suppose) only upon the silence of 
 their old records, I see no reason we have to give credit, since in the 
 later times of their church, of which they had more full records, they 
 find eight burnt between Ezra's time and the destruction of the second 
 temple, which was about 500 years, These ashes are said to be laid up 
 here as <I>a purification for sin,</I> because, though they were 
 intended to purify only from ceremonial uncleanness, yet they were a 
 type of that purification for sin which our Lord Jesus made by his 
 death. Ashes mixed with water are used in scouring, but these had their 
 virtue purely from the divine institution, and their accomplishment and 
 perfection in Christ, who is <I>the end of this law for 
 righteousness.</I> Now observe,

 (1.) That the water of purification was made so by the ashes of a
 heifer, whose blood was sprinkled before the sanctuary; so that which 
 cleanses our consciences is the abiding virtue of the death of Christ; 
 it is his blood that <I>cleanses from all sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1 John i. 7</A>.

 (2.) That the ashes were sufficient for all the people. There needed
 not to be a fresh heifer slain for every person or family that had 
 occasion to be purified, but this one was enough for all, even for the 
 strangers that sojourned among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 so there is virtue enough in the blood of Christ for all that repent 
 and believe the gospel, for every Israelite, and not for their sins 
 only, but for <I>the sins of the whole world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2">1 John ii. 2</A>.

 (3.) That these ashes were capable of being preserved without waste to
 many ages. No bodily substance is so incorruptible as ashes are, which 
 (says bishop Patrick) made these a very fit emblem of the everlasting 
 efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ.  He is able to save, and, in order 
 to that, able to cleanse, to the uttermost, both of person and times.

 (4.) These ashes were laid up as a stock or treasure, for the constant
 purification of Israel from their pollutions; so the blood of Christ is 
 laid up for us in the word and sacraments, as an inexhaustible fountain 
 of merit, to which by faith we may have recourse daily for the purging 
 of our consciences; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. All those that were employed in this service were made ceremonially 
 unclean by it; even Eleazar himself, though he did but sprinkle the 
 blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 <I>He that burned the heifer was unclean</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and he that <I>gathered up the ashes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 so all that had a hand in putting Christ to death contracted guilt by 
 it: his betrayer, his prosecutors, his judge, his executioner, all did 
 what they did with wicked hands, though it was <I>by the determinate 
 counsel and foreknowledge of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>);

 yet some of them were, and all might have been cleansed by the virtue
 of that same blood which they had brought themselves under the guilt 
 of. Some make this to signify the imperfection of the legal services, 
 and their insufficiency to take away sin, inasmuch as those who 
 prepared for the purifying of others were themselves polluted by the 
 preparation. The Jews say, This is a mystery which Solomon himself did 
 not understand, that the same thing should pollute those that were 
 clean and purify those that were unclean. But (says bishop Patrick) it 
 is not strange to those who consider that all the sacrifices which were 
 offered for sin were therefore looked upon as impure, because the sins 
 of men were laid upon them, as all our sins were upon Christ, who 
 therefore is said to be <I>made sin for us,</I>

 seven days.
 &nbsp; 12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
 seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the

 &nbsp; 13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead,

 uncleanness <I>is</I> yet upon him.
 &nbsp; 14 This <I>is</I> the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come

 seven days.
 &nbsp; 15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
 <I>is</I> unclean.

 open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
 shall be unclean seven days.
 &nbsp; 17 And for an unclean <I>person</I> they shall take of the ashes of
 the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
 be put thereto in a vessel:
 &nbsp; 18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip <I>it</I> in the
 water, and sprinkle <I>it</I> upon the tent, and upon all the vessels,

 the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
 shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
 water, and shall be clean at even.
 &nbsp; 20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
 himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation,
 because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the water of
 separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he <I>is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
 sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he
 that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until
 even.
 &nbsp; 22 And whatsoever the unclean <I>person</I> toucheth shall be
 unclean; and the soul that toucheth <I>it</I> shall be unclean until
 even.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions are here given concerning the use and application of the 
 ashes which were prepared for purification. they were laid up to be 
 laid out; and therefore, though now one place would serve to keep them 
 in, while all Israel lay so closely encamped, yet it is probable that 
 afterwards, when they came to Canaan, some of these ashes were kept in 
 every town, for there would be daily use for them.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In what cases there needed a purification with these ashes. No other 
 is mentioned here than the ceremonial uncleanness that was contracted 
 by the touch of a dead body, or of the bone or grave of a dead man, or 
 being in the tent or house where a dead body lay, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:11,14-16"><I>v.</I> 11, 14-16</A>.

 This I look upon to have been one of the greatest burdens of the 
 ceremonial law, and one of the most unaccountable. He that touched the 
 carcase of an unclean beast, or any living man under the greatest 
 ceremonial uncleanness, was made unclean by it only <I>till the 
 evening,</I> and needed only common water to purify himself with; but 
 he that came near the dead body of man, woman, or child, much bear the 
 reproach of his uncleanness seven days, must twice be purified with the 
 water of separation, which he could not obtain without trouble and 
 charge, and till he was purified must not come near the sanctuary upon 
 pain of death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This was strange, considering, 

 (1.) that whenever any died (and we are in deaths oft) several persons
 must unavoidable contract this pollution, the body must be stripped, 
 washed, wound up, carried out, and buried, and this could not be done 
 without many hands, and yet all defiled, which signifies that in our 
 corrupt and fallen state there is none that lives and sins not; we 
 cannot avoid being polluted by the defiling world we pass through, and 
 we offend daily, yet the impossibility of our being sinless does not 
 make sin the less polluting.

 (2.) that taking care of the dead, to see them decently buried, is not
 only necessary, but a very good office, and an act of kindness, both to 
 the honour of the dead and the comfort of the living, and yet 
 uncleanness was contracted by it, which intimates that the pollutions 
 of sin mix with and cleave to our best services. <I>There is not a just 
 man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not;</I> we are apt some way 
 or other to do amiss even in our doing good.

 (3.) That this pollution was contracted by what was done privately in
 their own houses, which intimates (as bishop Patrick observes) that God 
 sees what is done in secret, and nothing can be concealed from the 
 divine Majesty.

 (4.) This pollution might be contracted, and yet a man might never know
 it, as by the touch of a grave which appeared not, of which our Saviour 
 says, Those that <I>walk over it are not aware of it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:44">Luke xi. 44</A>),

 which intimates the defilement of the conscience by sins of ignorance,
 and the cause we have to cry out, "Who can understand his errors?" and 
 to pray, "Cleanse us from secret faults, faults which we ourselves do 
 not see ourselves guilty of."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But why did the law make a dead corpse such a defiling thing? 

 (1.) Because death is the <I>wages of sin, entered into the world</I>
 by it, and reigns by the power of it. Death to mankind is another thing 
 from what it is to other creatures: it is a curse, it is the execution 
 of the law, and therefore the defilement of death signifies the 
 defilement of sin.

 (2.) Because the law could not conquer death, nor abolish it and alter
 the property of it, as the gospel does by bringing life and immortality 
 to light, and so introducing a better hope. Since our Redeemer was dead 
 and buried, death is no more destroying to the Israel of God, and 
 therefore dead bodies are no more defiling; but while the church was 
 under the law, to show that it <I>made not the comers thereunto 
 perfect,</I> the pollution contracted by dead bodies could not but form 
 in their minds melancholy and uncomfortable notions concerning death, 
 while believers now through Christ can triumph over it. <I>O grave! 
 where is thy victory?</I> Where is thy pollution?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the ashes were to be used and applied in these cases. 

 1. A small quantity of the ashes must be put into a cup of spring
 water, and mixed with the water, which thereby was made, as it is here 
 called, a <I>water of separation,</I> because it was to be sprinkled on 
 those who were separated or removed from the sanctuary by their 
 uncleanness. As the ashes of the heifer signified the merit of Christ, 
 so the running water signified the power and grace of the blessed 
 Spirit, who is compared to rivers of living water; and it is by his 
 operation that the righteousness of Christ is applied to us for our 
 cleansing. Hence we are said to be washed, that is, sanctified and 
 justified, not only in the name of the Lord Jesus, but by the <I>Spirit 
 of our God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11,1Pe+1:2">1 Cor. vi. 11; 1 Pet. i. 2</A>.

 Those that promise themselves benefit by the righteousness of Christ,
 while they submit not to the grace and influence of the Spirit, do but 
 deceive themselves, for we cannot put asunder what God has joined, nor 
 be purified by the ashes otherwise than in the running water.

 2. This water must be applied by a bunch of hyssop dipped in it, with
 which the person or thing to be cleansed must be sprinkled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 in allusion to which David prays, <I>Purge me with hyssop.</I> Faith is 
 the bunch of hyssop wherewith the conscience is sprinkled and the heart 
 purified. Many might be sprinkled at once, and the water with which the 
 ashes were mingled might serve for many sprinklings, till it was all 
 spent; and a very little lighting upon a man served to purify him, if 
 done with that intention. In allusion to this application of the water 
 of separation by sprinkling, the blood of Christ is said to be the 
 <I>blood of sprinkling</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>),

 and with it were are said to be <I>sprinkled from an evil
 conscience</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>),

 that is, we are freed from the uneasiness that arises from a sense of
 our guilt.  And it is foretold that Christ, by his baptism, shall 
 <I>sprinkle many nations,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:15">Isa. lii. 15</A>.

 3. The unclean person must be sprinkled with this water on <I>the third
 day</I> after his pollution, and <I>on the seventh day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:12-19"><I>v.</I> 12-19</A>.
 
 The days were reckoned (we may suppose) from the last time of his 
 touching or coming near the dead body; for he would not begin the days 
 of his cleansing while he was still under a necessity of repeating the 
 pollution; but when the dead body was buried, so that there was no 
 further occasion of meddling with it, then he began to reckon his days. 
 Then, and then only, we may with comfort apply Christ's merit to our 
 souls, when we have forsaken sin, and cease all <I>fellowship with the 
 unfruitful works of</I> death and <I>darkness.</I> The repetition of 
 the sprinkling teaches us often to renew the actings of repentance and 
 faith, wash as Naaman, <I>seven times;</I> we need to do that often 
 which is so necessary to be well done. 

 4. Though the pollution contracted was only ceremonial, yet the neglect
 of the purification prescribed would turn into moral guilt: <I>He that 
 shall be unclean</I> and shall <I>not purify himself, that soul shall 
 be cut off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Note, It is a dangerous thing to contemn divine institutions, though 
 they may seem minute. A slight wound, if neglected, may prove fatal; a 
 sin we call little, if not repented of, will be our ruin, when great 
 sinners that repent shall find mercy. Our uncleanness separates us from 
 God, but it is our being unclean and not purifying ourselves that will 
 separate us for ever from him: it is not the wound that is fatal, so 
 much as the contempt of the remedy.

 5.  Even he that <I>sprinkled the water of separation,</I> or
 <I>touched</I> it, or <I>touched the unclean person,</I> must be 
 <I>unclean till the evening,</I> that is, must not come near the 
 sanctuary on that day,

 Thus God would show them the imperfection of those services, and their 
 insufficiency to purify the conscience, that they might look for the 
 Messiah, who in the fulness of time should by the eternal Spirit offer 
 himself without spot unto God, and so <I>purge our consciences from 
 dead works</I> (that is, from sin, which defiles like a dead body, and 
 is therefore called a <I>body of death</I>), that we may have liberty 
 of access to the sanctuary, to serve the living God with living 
 sacrifices.</P>
