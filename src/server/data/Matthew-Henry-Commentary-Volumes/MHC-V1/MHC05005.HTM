 In this chapter we have the second edition of the ten commandments. 

 I.  The general intent of them; they were in the nature of a covenant
 between God and Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The particular precepts are repeated
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:6-21">ver. 6-21</A>),

 with the double delivery of them, both by word and writing,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:22">ver. 22</A>.

 III. The settling of the correspondence thenceforward between God and
 Israel, by the mediation and ministry of Moses. 

 1. It was Israel's humble petition that it might be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:23-27">ver. 23-27</A>.
 
 2. It was God's gracious grant that it should be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:28-31">ver. 28-31</A>.

 And hence he infers the obligation they were under to obedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:32,33">ver. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
 Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
 this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
 &nbsp; 2 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
 &nbsp; 3 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made not this covenant with our fathers, but with
 us, <I>even</I> us, who <I>are</I> all of us here alive this day.
 &nbsp; 4 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
 midst of the fire,
 &nbsp; 5 (I stood between the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and you at that time, to show you
 the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire,
 and went not up into the mount;) saying,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. Moses summons the assembly. He <I>called all Israel;</I> not only 
 the elders, but, it is likely, as many of the people as could come 
 within hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The greatest of them were not above God's command, nor the meanest of
 them below his cognizance; but they were all bound to do. 

 2. He demands attention: "<I>Hear, O Israel;</I> hear and heed, hear
 and remember, hear, that you may learn, and keep, and do; else your 
 hearing is to no purpose." When we hear the word of God we must set 
 ourselves to learn it, that we may have it ready to us upon all 
 occasions, and what we have learned we must put in practice, for that 
 is the end of hearing and learning; not to fill our heads with notions, 
 or our mouths with talk, but to rectify and direct our affections and 
 conversations. 

 3. He refers them to the covenant made with them in Horeb, as that
 which they must govern themselves by. See the wonderful condescension 
 of divine grace in turning the command into a covenant, that we might 
 be the more strongly bound to obedience by our own consent and the more 
 encouraged in it by the divine promise, both which are supposed in the 
 covenant.  The promises and threatenings annexed to some of the 
 precepts, as to the second, third, and fifth, make them amount to a 
 covenant. Observe,

 (1.) The parties to this covenant. God made it, <I>not with our
 fathers,</I> not with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; to them God gave the 
 <I>covenant of circumcision</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:8">Acts vii. 8</A>),

 but not that of the ten commandments. The light of divine revelation
 shone gradually, and the children were made to know more of God's mind 
 than their fathers had done. "The covenant was made with us, or our 
 immediate parents that represented us, before Mount Sinai, and 
 transacted for us."

 (2.) The publication of this covenant. God himself did, as it were,
 read the articles to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 He <I>talked with you face to face; word to word,</I> so the Chaldee.
 Not in dark visions, as of old he spoke to the fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:12,13">Job iv. 12, 13</A>),

 but openly and clearly, and so that all the thousands of Israel might
 hear and understand. He spoke to them, and then received the answer 
 they returned to him: thus was it transacted <I>face to face.</I>

 (3.) The mediator of the covenant: <I>Moses stood between God and
 them,</I> at the foot of the mount 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and carried messages between them both for the settling of the
 preliminaries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:1-25">Exod. xix.</A>)

 and for the changing of the ratifications,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1-8">Exod. xxiv.</A>

 Herein Moses was a type of Christ, who <I>stands between God and man,
 to show us the word of the Lord,</I> a blessed days-man, that has laid 
 his hand upon us both, so that we may both hear from God and speak to 
 him without trembling.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which brought thee out of the land
 of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
 &nbsp; 7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
 &nbsp; 8 Thou shalt not make thee <I>any</I> graven image, <I>or</I> any
 likeness <I>of any thing</I> that <I>is</I> in heaven above, or that <I>is</I>
 in the earth beneath, or that <I>is</I> in the waters beneath the
 earth:
 &nbsp; 9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them:
 for I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>am</I> a jealous God, visiting the iniquity
 of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
 <I>generation</I> of them that hate me,
 &nbsp; 10 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and
 keep my commandments.
 &nbsp; 11 Thou shalt not take the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in vain:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will not hold <I>him</I> guiltless that taketh his name
 in vain.
 &nbsp; 12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 hath commanded thee.
 &nbsp; 13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:
 &nbsp; 14 But the seventh day <I>is</I> the sabbath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God:
 <I>in it</I> thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
 daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox,
 nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that <I>is</I>
 within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may
 rest as well as thou.
 &nbsp; 15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
 and <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God brought thee out thence through a
 mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
 &nbsp; 16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath
 commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may
 go well with thee, in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth
 thee.
 &nbsp; 17 Thou shalt not kill.
 &nbsp; 18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
 &nbsp; 19 Neither shalt thou steal.
 &nbsp; 20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
 &nbsp; 21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither
 shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
 manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
 <I>thing</I> that <I>is</I> thy neighbour's.
 &nbsp; 22 These words the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto all your assembly in the
 mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the
 thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
 wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the repetition of the ten commandments, in which observe, 

 1.  Though they had been spoken before, and written, yet they are again
 rehearsed; for precept must be upon precept, and line upon line, and 
 all little enough to keep the word of God in our minds and to preserve 
 and renew the impressions of it. We have need to have the same things 
 often inculcated upon us. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.

 2. There is some variation here from that record

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:1-26">Exod. xx.</A>),

 as there is between the Lord's prayer as it is in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:9-13">Matt. vi.</A>

 and as it is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:2-4">Luke xi.</A>

 In both it is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things than
 to the words unalterably. 

 3.  The most considerable variation is in the fourth commandment. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:8-11">Exod. xx.</A>

 the reason annexed is taken from the creation of the world; here it is
 taken from their deliverance out of Egypt, because that was typical of 
 our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian 
 sabbath was to be observed: <I>Remember that thou wast a servant, and 
 God brought thee out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>.
 
 And Therefore,

 (1.) "It is fit that thy servants should be favoured by the
 sabbath-rest; for thou knowest the heart of a servant, and how welcome 
 one day's ease will be after six days' labour."

 (2.) "It is fit that thy God should be honoured by the sabbath-work,
 and the religious services of the day, in consideration of the great 
 things he has done for thee." In the resurrection of Christ we were 
 brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, <I>with a 
 mighty hand and an outstretched arm;</I> therefore, by the 
 gospel-edition of the law, we are directed to observe the first day of 
 the week, in remembrance of that glorious work of power and grace. 

 4.  It is added in the fifth commandment, <I>That it may go well with
 thee,</I> which addition the apostle quotes, and puts first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:3">Eph. vi. 3</A>),

 <I>that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long.</I>
 If there be instances of some that have been very dutiful to their 
 parents, and yet have not lived long upon earth, we may reconcile it to 
 the promise by this explication of it, Whether they live long or no, it 
 shall go well with them, either in this world or in a better.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:12">Eccl. viii. 12</A>.

 5. The last five commandments are connected or coupled together, which
 they are not in Exodus: <I>Neither shalt thou commit adultery, neither 
 shalt thou steal, &c.,</I> which intimate that God's commands are all 
 of a piece: the same authority that obliges us to one obliges us to 
 another; and we must not be partial in the law, but have respect to all 
 God's commandments, for he that <I>offends in one point is guilty of 
 all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:10,11">Jam. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 6. That these commandments were given with a great deal of awful
 solemnity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 (1.) They were spoken with <I>a great voice out of the fire, and thick
 darkness.</I> That was a dispensation of terror, designed to make the 
 gospel of grace the more welcome, and to be a specimen of the terrors 
 of the judgment-day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3,4">Ps. l. 3, 4</A>.

 (2.) <I>He added no more.</I> What other laws he gave them were sent by
 Moses, but no more were spoken in the same manner that the ten 
 commandments were. <I>He added no more,</I> therefore we must not add: 
 the law of the Lord is perfect.

 (3.) <I>He wrote them in two tables of stone,</I> that they might be
 preserved from corruption, and might be transmitted pure and entire to 
 posterity, for whose use they were intended, as well as for the present 
 generation. These being the heads of the covenant, the chest in which 
 the written tables were deposited was called the <I>ark of the 
 covenant.</I> See

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the
 midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,)
 that ye came near unto me, <I>even</I> all the heads of your tribes,
 and your elders;
 &nbsp; 24 And ye said, Behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God hath showed us his
 glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
 midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with
 man, and he liveth.
 &nbsp; 25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
 consume us: if we hear the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God any more,
 then we shall die.
 &nbsp; 26 For who <I>is there of</I> all flesh, that hath heard the voice
 of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
 <I>have,</I> and lived?
 &nbsp; 27 Go thou near, and hear all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God shall say:
 and speak thou unto us all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God shall speak unto
 thee; and we will hear <I>it,</I> and do <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 28 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard the voice of your words, when ye spake
 unto me; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
 words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have
 well said all that they have spoken.
 &nbsp; 29 O that there were such a heart in them, that they would
 fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be
 well with them, and with their children for ever!
 &nbsp; 30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.
 &nbsp; 31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak
 unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
 judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do <I>them</I>
 in the land which I give them to possess it.
 &nbsp; 32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath
 commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
 the left.
 &nbsp; 33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath
 commanded you, that ye may live, and <I>that it may be</I> well with
 you, and <I>that</I> ye may prolong <I>your</I> days in the land which ye
 shall possess.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Moses reminds them of the agreement of both the parties that were 
 now treating, in the mediation of Moses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the consternation that the people were put into by that 
 extreme terror with which the law was given. They owned that they could 
 not bear it any more: "<I>This great fire will consume us;</I> this 
 dreadful voice will be fatal to us; we shall certainly die if we hear 
 it any more," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 They wondered that they were not already struck
 dead with it, and took it for an extraordinary instance of the divine 
 power and goodness, not only that they were thus spoken to, but that 
 they were enabled to bear it. For <I>who ever heard the voice of the 
 living God, as we have, and lived?</I> God's appearances have always 
 been terrible to man, ever since the fall: but Christ, having taken 
 away sin, invites us to come boldly to the throne of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their earnest request that God would henceforth speak to them by 
 Moses, with a promise that they would hear what he said as from God 
 himself, and do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 It seems by this,

 (1.) That they expected to receive further commands from God and were
 willing to hear more from him.

 (2.) That they thought Moses able to bear those discoveries of the
 divine glory which they by reason of guilt were sensible of their 
 inability to stand up under. They believed him to be a favourite of 
 Heaven, and also one that would be faithful to them; yet at other times 
 they murmured at him, and but a little before this were ready to stone 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:4">Exod. xvii. 4</A>.

 See how men's convictions correct their passions. 

 (3.) That now they were in a good mind, under the strong convictions of
 the word they heard. Many have their consciences startled by the law 
 that have them not purified; fair promises are extorted from them, but 
 no good principles fixed and rooted in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God's approbation of their request. 

 (1.) He commends what they said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 They spoke it to Moses, but God took notice of it; for there is not a
 word in our tongue but he knows it. He acknowledges, <I>They have well 
 said.</I> Their owning the necessity of a mediator to deal between them 
 and God was well said.  Their desire to receive further directions from 
 God by Moses, and their promise to observe what directions should be 
 given them, were well said. And what is well said shall have its praise 
 with God, and should have with us. What is good, as far as it goes, let 
 it be commended.

 (2.) He wishes they were but sincere in it: <I>O that there were such a
 heart in them!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 [1.] Such a heart as they should have, a heart to fear God, and keep
 his commandments for ever. Note, The God of heaven is truly and 
 earnestly desirous of the welfare and salvation of poor sinners. He has 
 given abundant proof that he is so: he gives us time and space to 
 repent, by his mercies invites us to repentance, and waits to be 
 gracious; he has sent his Son to redeem us, published a general offer 
 of pardon and life, promised his Spirit to those that pray for him, and 
 has said and sworn that he has no pleasure in the ruin of sinners. 

 [2.] Such a heart as they now had, or one would think they had. Note,
 It would be well with many if there were always such a heart in them as 
 there seems to be sometimes, when they are under conviction of sin, or 
 the rebukes of Providence, or when they come to look death in the face: 
 <I>How gracious will they be when these pangs come upon them!</I> O 
 that there were always such a heart in them!

 (3.) He appoints Moses to be his messenger to them, to receive the law
 from his mouth and to communicate it to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Here the matter was settled by consent of both parties that God should
 hence-forward speak to us by men like ourselves, by Moses and the 
 prophets, by the apostles and the evangelists, and, if we believe not 
 these, neither should we be persuaded though God should speak to us as 
 he did to Israel at Mount Sinai, or send expresses from heaven or 
 hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hence he infers a charge to them to observe and do all that God had 
 commanded them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Seeing God had shown himself so tender of them, and so willing to
 consider their frame and gratify them in what they desired, and withal 
 so ready to make the best of them,--seeing they themselves had desired 
 to have Moses for their teacher, who was now teaching them,--and seeing 
 they had promised so solemnly, and under the influence of so many good 
 causes and considerations, that they would hear and do, he charges them 
 to <I>walk in all the ways that God had commanded them,</I> assuring 
 them that it would be highly for their advantage to do so. The only way 
 to be happy is to be holy. <I>Say to the righteous, It shall be well 
 with them.</I></P>
