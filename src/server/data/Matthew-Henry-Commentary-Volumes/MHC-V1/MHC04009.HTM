 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
 the first month of the second year after they were come out of
 the land of Egypt, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
 appointed season.
 &nbsp; 3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep
 it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
 according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.
 &nbsp; 4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
 keep the passover.
 &nbsp; 5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
 month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
 of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and
 they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
 &nbsp; 7 And those men said unto him, We <I>are</I> defiled by the dead
 body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer
 an offering of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in his appointed season among the
 children of Israel?
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will command concerning you.
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
 or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body,
 or <I>be</I> in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall
 keep it, <I>and</I> eat it with unleavened bread and bitter <I>herbs.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
 bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they
 shall keep it.
 &nbsp; 13 But the man that <I>is</I> clean, and is not in a journey, and
 forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut
 off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
 &nbsp; 14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
 passover unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; according to the ordinance of the
 passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye
 shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that
 was born in the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An order given for the solemnization of the passover, the day 
 twelvemonth after they came out of Egypt, on the fourteenth day of the 
 first month of the second year, some days before they were numbered, 
 for that was done in the beginning of the second month. Observe, 

 1. God gave particular orders for the keeping of this passover,
 otherwise (it should seem) they would not have kept it, for, in the 
 first institution of this ordinance, it was appointed to be kept when 
 they should <I>come into the land of promise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:25">Exod. xii. 25</A>.

 And, no passover till they came to Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:10">Josh. v. 10</A>.

 This was an early indication of the abolishing of the ceremonial
 institutions at last, that, so soon after they were first appointed, 
 some of them were suffered to lie asleep for so many years. The 
 ordinance of the Lord's supper (which came in the room of the passover) 
 was not thus intermitted or set aside in the first days of the 
 Christian church, though those were days of greater difficulty and 
 distress than Israel knew in the wilderness; nay, in the times of 
 persecution, the Lord's supper was celebrated more frequently than 
 afterwards. The Israelites in the wilderness could not forget their 
 deliverance out of Egypt, their present state was a constant memorandum 
 of it to them. All the danger was when they came to Canaan; there 
 therefore they had need to be reminded of the <I>rock out of which they 
 were hewn.</I> However, because the first passover was celebrated in a 
 hurry, and was rather the substance itself than the sign, it was the 
 will of God that at the return of the year, when they were more 
 composed, and better acquainted with the divine law, they should 
 observe it again, that their children might more distinctly understand 
 the solemnity and the better remember it hereafter. Calvin supposes 
 that they were obliged to keep it now, and notes it as an instance of 
 their carelessness that they had need to be reminded of an institution 
 which they so lately received.

 2. Moses faithfully transmitted to the people the orders given him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Thus Paul delivered to the churches what he <I>received of the Lord</I> 
 concerning the gospel passover, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23">1 Cor. xi. 23</A>.

 Note, Magistrates must be monitors, and ministers must <I>stir up men's
 minds by way of remembrance</I> to that which is good.

 3. The people observed the orders given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though they had lately kept the feast of dedication

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:1-89"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>),

 yet they did not desire to excuse themselves with that from keeping
 this feast. Note, Extraordinary performances must not supersede or 
 jostle out or stated services. They kept the passover even in the 
 wilderness: though our condition be solitary and unsettled, yet we must 
 keep up our attendance on God by holy ordinances as we have 
 opportunity, for in them we may find the best conversation and the best 
 repose. Thus is God' Israel provided for in a desert.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Instructions given concerning those that were ceremonially unclean 
 when they were to eat the passover. The law of the passover required 
 every Israelite to eat of it. Some subsequent laws had forbidden those 
 that had contracted any ceremonial pollution to eat of the holy things; 
 those whose minds and consciences are defiled by sin are utterly unfit 
 for communion with God, and cannot partake, with any true comfort, of 
 the gospel passover, till they are cleansed by true repentance and 
 faith: and a sad dilemma they are in; if they come not to holy 
 ordinances, they are guilty of a contempt of them; if they do come in 
 their pollution, they are guilty of a profanation of them. They must 
 therefore wash, and then <I>compass God's altar.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the case that happened in Israel when this passover was to 
 be kept: <I>Certain men were defiled by the dead body of a man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and they lay under that defilement seven days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:11"><I>ch.</I> xix. 11</A>),
 
 and in that time might not eat of the holy things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:20">Lev. vii. 20</A>.

 This was not their iniquity, but their infelicity: some persons must
 touch dead bodies, to bury them out of sight, and therefore they could, 
 with the better grace, bring their complaint to Moses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application made to Moses by the person concerned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, It is people's wisdom, in difficult cases concerning sin and 
 duty, to consult with their ministers whom God has set over them, and 
 to <I>ask the law at their mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 These means we must use in pursuance of our prayers to God to lead us
 in a plain path. Observe with what trouble and concern these men
 complained that they were kept back from offering to the Lord. They did 
 not complain of the law as unjust, but lamented their unhappiness that 
 they fell under the restraint of it at this time, and desired some 
 expedient might be found out for their relief. Note, It is a blessed 
 thing to see people hungering and thirsting after God's ordinances, and 
 to hear them complaining of that which prevents their enjoyment of 
 them. It should be a trouble to us when by any occasion we are kept 
 back from bringing our offering in the solemnities of a sabbath or a 
 sacrament, as it was to David when he was banished from the altar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1,2">Ps. xlii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The deliberation of Moses in resolving this case. Here seemed to be 
 law against law; and, though it is a rule that the latter law must 
 explain the former, yet he pitied these Israelites that were thus 
 deprived of the privilege of the passover, and therefore took time to 
 consult the oracles, and to know what was the mind of God in this case: 
 <I>I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Ministers must take example hence in resolving cases of conscience. 
 
 (1.) They must not determine rashly, but take time to consider, that
 every circumstance may be duly weighted, the case viewed in a true 
 light, and spiritual things compared with spiritual. 

 (2.) They must ask counsel at God's mouth, and not determine according
 to the bias of their own fancy or affection, but impartially, according 
 to the mind of God, to the best of their knowledge. We have no such 
 oracle to consult as Moses had, but we must have recourse to <I>the law 
 and the testimony,</I> and speak according to that rule; and if, in 
 difficult cases, we take time to spread the matter in particular before 
 God by humble believing prayer, we have reason to hope that the Spirit 
 who is promised to <I>lead us into all truth</I> will enable us to 
 direct others <I>in the good and right way.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The directions which God gave in this case, and in other similar 
 cases, explanatory of the law of the passover. The disagreeable 
 accident produced good laws. 

 (1.) Those that happened to be ceremonially unclean at the time when
 the passover should be eaten were allowed to eat it that day month, 
 when they were clean; so were those that happened to be <I>in a journey 
 afar off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 See here,

 [1.] That when we are to attend upon God in solemn ordinances it is
 very necessary both that we be clean and that we be composed. 

 [2.] That that may excuse the deferring of a duty for a time which yet
 will not justify us in the total neglect and omission of it. He that is 
 at variance with his brother may <I>leave his gift before the 
 altar,</I> while he goes to be <I>reconciled to his brother;</I> but 
 when he has done his part towards it, whether it be effected or no, he 
 must <I>come again and offer his gift,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:23,24">Matt. v. 23, 24</A>.

 This secondary passover was to be kept on the same day of the month
 with the first, because the ordinance was a memorial of their 
 deliverance on that day of the month. Once we find the whole
 congregation keeping the passover on this fourteenth day of the second 
 month, in Hezekiah's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:15">2 Chron. xxx. 15</A>),

 which perhaps may help to account for the admission of some that were
 not clean to the eating of it. Had the general passover been kept in 
 the first month, the unclean might have been put off till the second; 
 but, that being kept in the second month, they had no warrant to eat it 
 in the third month, and therefore, rather than not eat of it at all, 
 they were admitted, though not cleansed <I>according to the 
 purification of the sanctuary,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 (2.) Whenever the passover was kept in the second month, all the rites
 and ceremonies of it must be strictly observed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They must not think that, because the time was dispensed with, any part 
 of the solemnity of it might be abated; when we cannot do as we would 
 we must do the utmost we can in the service of God.

 (3.) This allowance in a case of necessity would be no means
 countenance or indulge any in their neglect to keep the passover at the 
 time appointed, when they were not under the necessity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When a person is under no incapacity to eat the passover in the 
 appointed time, if he neglects it then, upon the presumption of the 
 liberty granted by this law, he puts an affront upon God, impiously 
 abuses his kindness, and he shall certainly <I>bear his sin,</I> and 
 <I>be cut off from his people.</I> Note, As those who against their 
 minds are forced to absent themselves from God's ordinances may 
 comfortably expect the favours of God's grace under their affliction, 
 so those who of choice absent themselves may justly expect the tokens 
 of God's wrath for their sin. <I>Be not deceived, God is not 
 mocked.</I>

 (4.) Here is a clause added in favour of strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Though it was requisite that the stranger who would join with them in 
 eating the passover should be circumcised as a proselyte to their 
 religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:48,49">Exod. xii. 48, 49</A>),

 yet this kind admission of those that were not native Israelites to eat
 the passover was an intimation of the favour designed for the poor 
 Gentiles by Christ. As then there was one law, so in the days of the 
 Messiah there should be one gospel, for the stranger and for him that 
 was born in the land; for <I>in every nation he that fears God and 
 works righteousness is accepted of him,</I> and this was a truth before 
 Peter perceived it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34,35">Acts x. 34, 35</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
 covered the tabernacle, <I>namely,</I> the tent of the testimony: and
 at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance
 of fire, until the morning.
 &nbsp; 16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it <I>by day,</I> and the
 appearance of fire by night.
 &nbsp; 17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
 after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
 where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their
 tents.
 &nbsp; 18 At the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the children of Israel
 journeyed, and at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they pitched: as
 long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their
 tents.
 &nbsp; 19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many
 days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and journeyed not.
 &nbsp; 20 And <I>so</I> it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
 tabernacle; according to the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they abode
 in their tents, and according to the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they
 journeyed.
 &nbsp; 21 And <I>so</I> it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
 morning, and <I>that</I> the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
 they journeyed: whether <I>it was</I> by day or by night that the
 cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
 &nbsp; 22 Or <I>whether it were</I> two days, or a month, or a year, that
 the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
 children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but
 when it was taken up, they journeyed.
 &nbsp; 23 At the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they rested in the tents, and
 at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they journeyed: they kept the
 charge of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the hand of
 Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the history of the cloud; not a natural history: <I>who 
 knows the balancings of the clouds?</I> but a divine history of a cloud 
 that was appointed to be the visible sign and symbol of God's presence 
 with Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When the tabernacle was finished this cloud, which before had hung 
 on high over their camp, settled upon the tabernacle, and covered it, 
 to show that God manifests his presence with his people in and by his 
 ordinances; there he makes himself known, and to them we must look if 
 we would <I>see the beauty of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4,Eze+37:26,27">Ps. xxvii. 4; Ezek. xxxvii. 26, 27</A>.

 Thus God glorified his own appointments, and signified his acceptance
 of his people's love and obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That which appeared as a cloud by day appeared as a fire all night. 
 Had it been a cloud only, it would not have been visible by night; and, 
 had it been a fire only, it would have been scarcely discernible by 
 day; but God would give them sensible demonstrations of the constancy 
 of his presence with them, and his care of them, and that he <I>kept 
 them night and day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:3,Ps+121:6">Isa. xxvii. 3; Ps. cxxi. 6</A>.

 And thus we are taught to <I>set God always before us,</I> and to see
 him near us both night and day. Something of the nature of that divine 
 revelation which the Old-Testament church was governed by might also be 
 signified by these visible signs of God's presence, the cloud denoting 
 the darkness and the fire the terror of that dispensation, in 
 comparison with the more clear and comfortable discoveries God has made 
 of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This pillar of cloud and fire directed and determined all the 
 motions, marches, and encampments, of Israel in the wilderness. 

 1. As long as the cloud rested upon the tabernacle, so long they 
 continued in the same place, and never stirred; though no doubt they 
 were very desirous to be pressing forward in their journey towards 
 Canaan, where they longed to be and hoped to be quickly, yet as long as 
 the cloud rested, if it was a month or a year, so long they rested, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, He that believeth doth not make haste. There is no time lost 
 while we are waiting God's time. It is as acceptable a piece of 
 submission to the will of God to sit still contentedly when our lot 
 requires it as to work for him when we are called to it.

 2. When the cloud was taken up, they removed, how comfortably soever
 they were encamped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Whether it moved by day or night, they delayed not to attend its 
 motions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and probably there were some appointed to stand sentinel day and night
 within sight of it, to give timely notice to the camp of its beginning 
 to stir, and this called <I>keeping the charge of the Lord.</I> The 
 people, being thus kept at a constant uncertainty, and having no time 
 fixed for stopping or removing, were obliged to hold themselves in 
 constant readiness to march upon very short warning. And for the same 
 reason we are kept at uncertainty concerning the time of our putting 
 off the earthly house of this tabernacle, that we may be always ready 
 to <I>remove at the commandment of the Lord.</I>

 3. As long and as far as the cloud moved, so long and so far they
 marched, and just where it abode they pitched their tents about it, and 
 God's tent under it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, It is uncomfortable staying when God has departed, but very safe 
 and pleasant going when we see God go before us and resting where he 
 appoints us to rest. This is repeated again and again in these verses, 
 because it was a constant miracle, and often repeated, and what never 
 failed in all their travels, and because it is a matter which we should 
 take particular notice of as very significant and instructive. It is 
 mentioned long after by David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:39">Ps. cv. 39</A>),

 and by the people of God after their captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Neh+9:19">Neh. ix. 19</A>.

 And the guidance of this cloud is spoken of as signifying the guidance
 of the blessed Spirit.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:14">Isa. lxiii. 14</A>,

 <I>The Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest, and so didst thou lead
 thy people.</I> This teaches us,

 (1.) The particular care God takes of his people. Nothing could be more
 expressive and significant of God's tenderness of Israel than the 
 guidance of this cloud was; it led them by the <I>right way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:7">Ps. cvii. 7</A>),

 went on their pace: God did by it, as it were, cover them with his
 feathers. We are not now to expect such sensible tokens of the divine 
 presence and guidance as this was, but the promise is sure to all God's 
 spiritual Israel that he will <I>guide them by his counsel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:24">Ps. lxxiii. 24</A>),

 <I>even unto death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:14">Ps. xlviii. 14</A>),

 that all the children of God shall be <I>led by the Spirit of God</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:14">Rom. viii. 14</A>),

 that he will <I>direct the paths</I> of those who in <I>all their ways
 acknowledge him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:6">Prov. iii. 6</A>.

 There is a particular providence conversant about all their affairs, to
 direct and overrule them for the best. <I>The steps of a good man are
 ordered by the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:23">Ps. xxxvii. 23</A>.

 (2.) The particular regard we ought to have to God in all our ways. In
 our affections and actions we must follow the direction of his word and 
 Spirit; all the motions of our souls must be guided by the divine will; 
 at the commandment of the Lord our hearts should always move and rest; 
 in all our affairs we must follow Providence, reconciling ourselves to 
 all its disposals, and bringing our mind to our condition, whatever it 
 is. The people of Israel, having the cloud for their guide, were eased 
 of the trouble of holding councils of war, to consider when and whither 
 they should march, which might have occasioned strifes and debates 
 among them: nor needed they to send spies before to inform them of the 
 posture of the country, or pioneers to clear the way, or officers to 
 mark out their camp; the pillar of cloud did all this for them: and 
 those that by faith commit their works to the Lord, though they are 
 bound to the prudent use of means, yet may in like manner be easy in 
 the expectation of the event. <I>"Father, thy will be done;</I> dispose 
 of me and mine as thou pleasest; here I am, desirous to be found 
 <I>waiting on my God continually,</I> to journey and rest at <I>the 
 commandment of the Lord.</I> What thou wilt, and where thou wilt, only 
 let me be thine, and always in the way of my duty." </P>
