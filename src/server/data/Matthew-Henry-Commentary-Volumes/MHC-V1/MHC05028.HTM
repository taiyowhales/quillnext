 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is a very large exposition of two words in the foregoing
 chapter, the blessing and the curse. Those were pronounced blessed in
 general that were obedient, and those cursed that were disobedient;
 but, because generals are not so affecting, Moses here descends to
 particulars, and describes the blessing and the curse, not in their
 fountains (these are out of sight, and therefore the most considerable,
 yet least considered, the favour of God the spring of all the
 blessings, and the wrath of God the spring of all the curses), but in 
 their streams, the sensible effects of the blessing and the curse, for 
 they are real things and have real effects. 

 I. He describes the blessings that should come upon them if they were
 obedient; personal, family, and especially national, for in that
 capacity especially they are here treated with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. He more largely describes the curses which would come upon them if
 they were disobedient; such as would be, 

 1. Their extreme vexation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15-44">ver. 15-44</A>.

 2.  Their utter ruin and destruction at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:45-68">ver. 45-68</A>.

 This chapter is much to the same purport with 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:1-46">Lev. xxvi.</A>,

 setting before them life and death, good and evil; and the promise, in
 the close of that chapter, of their restoration, upon their repentance, 
 is here likewise more largely repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1-20"><I>ch.</I> xxx.</A>

 Thus, as they had precept upon precept in the repetition of the law, so
 they had line upon line in the repetition of the promises and 
 threatenings. And these are both there and here delivered, not only as 
 sanctions of the law, what should be conditionally, but as predictions 
 of the event, what would be certainly, that for a while the people of 
 Israel would be happy in their obedience, but that at length they would 
 be undone by their disobedience; and therefore it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 1</A>)
 
 that all those things would come upon them, both the blessing and the
 curse.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
 unto the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to observe <I>and</I> to do all
 his commandments which I command thee this day, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
 &nbsp; 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake
 thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 3 Blessed <I>shalt</I> thou <I>be</I> in the city, and blessed <I>shalt</I>
 thou <I>be</I> in the field.
 &nbsp; 4 Blessed <I>shall be</I> the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of
 thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy
 kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
 &nbsp; 5 Blessed <I>shall be</I> thy basket and thy store.
 &nbsp; 6 Blessed <I>shalt</I> thou <I>be</I> when thou comest in, and blessed
 <I>shalt</I> thou <I>be</I> when thou goest out.
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
 to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee
 one way, and flee before thee seven ways.
 &nbsp; 8 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
 storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he
 shall bless thee in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee.
 &nbsp; 9 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall establish thee a holy people unto himself, as
 he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and walk in his ways.
 &nbsp; 10 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called
 by the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they shall be afraid of thee.
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the
 fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the
 fruit of thy ground, in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto thy
 fathers to give thee.
 &nbsp; 12 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven
 to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
 the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
 and thou shalt not borrow.
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
 thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that
 thou hearken unto the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which I
 command thee this day, to observe and to do <I>them:</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
 command thee this day, <I>to</I> the right hand, or <I>to</I> the left, to
 go after other gods to serve them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The blessings are here put before the curses, to intimate, 

 1. That God is slow to anger, but swift to show mercy: he has said it,
 and sworn, that he would much rather we would obey and live than sin 
 and die. It is his delight to bless. 

 2. That though both the promises and the threatenings are designed to 
 bring and hold us to our duty, yet it is better that we be allured to 
 that which is good by a filial hope of God's favour than that we be 
 frightened to it by a servile fear of his wrath. That obedience pleases 
 best which comes from a principle of delight in God's goodness.  
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the conditions upon which the blessing is promised. 

 1.  It is upon condition that they <I>diligently hearken to the voice
 of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),

 that they hear God speaking to them by his word, and use their utmost
 endeavours to acquaint themselves with his will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 2. Upon condition that they <I>observe and do all his commandments</I> 
 (and in order to obedience there is need of observation) and that they 
 <I>keep the commandments of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 
 <I>and walk in his ways.</I> Not only do them for once, but keep them
 for ever; not only set out in his ways, but walk in them to the end. 

 3.  Upon condition that they should not <I>go aside either to the right
 hand or to the left,</I> either to superstition on the one hand, or 
 profaneness on the other; and particularly that they should not go 
 after other gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 which was the sin that of all others they were most prone to, and God
 would be most displeased with. Let them take care to keep up religion, 
 both the form and power of it, in their families and nation, and God 
 would not fail to bless them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particulars of this blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is promised that the providence of God should prosper them in all 
 their outward concerns. These blessings are said to <I>overtake 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Good people sometimes, under the sense of their unworthiness, are ready
 to fly from the blessing and to conclude that it belongs not to them,; 
 but the blessing shall find them out and follow them notwithstanding. 
 Thus in the great day the blessing will overtake the righteous that 
 say, <I>Lord, when saw we thee hungry and fed thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:37">Matt. xxv. 37</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Several things are enumerated in which God by his providence would 
 bless them:--

 [1.] They should be safe and easy; a blessing should rest upon their 
 persons wherever they were, <I>in the city,</I> or <I>in the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Whether their habitation was in town or country, whether they were
 husbandmen or tradesmen, whether their business called them into the 
 city or into the field, they should be preserved from the dangers and 
 have the comforts of their condition. This blessing should attend them 
 in their journeys, going out and coming in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Their persons should be protected, and the affair they went about
 should succeed well.  Observe here, What a necessary and constant 
 dependence we have upon God both for the continuance and comfort of 
 this life. We need him at every turn, in all the various movements of 
 life; we cannot be safe if he withdraw his protection, nor easy if he 
 suspend his favour; but, if he bless us, go where we will it is well 
 with us.

 [2.] Their families should be built up in a numerous issue: blessed 
 <I>shall be the fruit of thy body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and in that the Lord shall <I>make thee plenteous</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 in pursuance of the promise made to Abraham, that his seed should be
 <I>as the stars of heaven</I> for multitude, and that God would be a 
 God to them, than which a greater blessing, and more comprehensive, 
 could not be entailed upon the fruit of their body. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9">Isa. lxi. 9</A>.

 [3.] They should be rich, and have an abundance of all the good things 
 of this life, which are promised them, not merely that they might have 
 the pleasure of enjoying them, but (as bishop Patrick observes out of 
 one of the Jewish writers) that they might have wherewithal to honour 
 God, and might be helped and encouraged to serve him cheerfully and to 
 proceed and persevere in their obedience to him. A blessing is 
 promised, <I>First,</I> On all they had without doors, corn and cattle 
 in the field

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:4,11"><I>v.</I> 4, 11</A>),

 their cows and sheep particularly, which would be blessed for the
 owners' sakes, and made blessings to them. In order to this, it is 
 promised that God would give them <I>rain in due season,</I> which is 
 called his <I>good treasure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 because with this river of God the earth is enriched, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>.

 Our constant supplies we must see coming from God's good treasure, and
 own our obligations to him for them; if he withhold his rain, the 
 fruits both of the ground and of the cattle soon perish. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> On all they had within doors, the basket and the store

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 the store-houses or barns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When it is brought home, God will bless it, and not blow upon it as
 sometimes he does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6,9">Hag. i. 6, 9</A>.

 We depend upon God and his blessing, not only for our yearly corn out
 of the field, but for our daily bread out of our basket and store, and 
 therefore are taught to pray for it every day.

 [4.] They should have success in all their employments, which would be 
 a constant satisfaction to them: "<I>The Lord shall command the 
 blessing</I> (and it is he only that can command it) upon thee, not 
 only in all thou hast, but in all thou doest, all <I>that thou settest 
 thy hand to,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This intimated that even when they were rich they must not be idle, but
 must find some good employment or other to set their hand to, and God 
 would own their industry, and <I>bless the work of their hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 for that which <I>makes rich,</I> and keeps so, is <I>the blessing of
 the Lord</I> upon <I>the hand of the diligent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:4,22">Prov. x. 4, 22</A>.

 [5.] They should have honour among their neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>The Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations.</I> He
 made them so, by taking them into covenant with himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:19"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 19</A>.

 And he would make them more and more so by their outward prosperity, if
 they would not by sin disparage themselves. Two things should help to 
 make them great among the nations:--<I>First,</I> Their wealth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt lend to many nations</I> upon interest" (which they were
 allowed to take form the neighbouring nations), "but thou shalt not 
 have occasion to borrow." This would give them great influence with all 
 about them; for the borrower is servant to the lender. It may be meant 
 of trade and commerce, that they should export abundantly more than 
 they should import, which would keep the balance on their side.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> Their power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>The Lord shall make thee the head,</I> to give law to all about
 thee, to exact tribute, and to arbitrate all controversies." Every 
 sheaf should bow to theirs, which would make them so considerable that 
 <I>all the people of the earth</I> would be <I>afraid of them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that is, would reverence their true grandeur, and dread making them
 their enemies. The flourishing of religion among them, and the blessing 
 of God upon them, would make them formidable to all their neighbours, 
 terrible as an army with banners.  

 [6.] They should be victorious over their enemies, and prosper in all 
 their wars. If any were so daring as to rise up against them to oppress 
 them, or encroach upon them, it should be at their peril, they should 
 certainly fall before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The forces of the enemy, though entirely drawn up to come against them
 one way, should be entirely routed, and flee before them seven ways, 
 each making the best of his way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From the whole we learn (though it were well if men would believe 
 it) that religion and piety are the best friends to outward prosperity. 
 Though temporal blessings do not take up so much room in the promises 
 of the New Testament as they do in those of the Old, yet it is enough 
 that our Lord Jesus has given us his word (and surely we may take his 
 word) that if we <I>seek first the kingdom of God, and the 
 righteousness thereof, all other things</I> shall be added to us, as 
 far as Infinite Wisdom sees good; and who can desire them further? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Matt. vi. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is likewise promised that the grace of God should <I>establish 
 them a holy people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Having taken them into covenant with himself, he would keep them in
 covenant; and, provided they used the means of stedfastness, he would 
 give them the grace of stedfastness, that they should not depart from 
 him. Note, Those that are sincere in holiness God will establish in 
 holiness; and he is <I>of power to do it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25">Rom. xvi. 25</A>.

 He that is holy shall be holy still; and those whom God establishes in
 holiness he thereby establishes a people to himself, for a long as we 
 keep close to God he will never forsake us. This establishment of their 
 religion would be the establishment of their reputation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>All the people of the earth shall see,</I> and own, <I>that thou art
 called by the name of the Lord,</I> that is, "that thou art a most 
 excellent and glorious people, under the particular care and 
 countenance of the great God. They shall be made to know that a people 
 called by the name Jehovah are without doubt the happiest people under 
 the sun, even their enemies themselves being judges." The favourites of 
 Heaven are truly great, and, first or last, it will be made to appear 
 that they are so, if not in this world, yet at that day when those who 
 confess Christ now shall be confessed by him before men and angels, as 
 those whom he delights to honour.</P>

 &nbsp; 20 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,

 &nbsp; 22 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
 fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and
 with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they

 &nbsp; 23 And thy heaven that <I>is</I> over thy head shall be brass, and
 the earth that is under thee <I>shall be</I> iron.
 &nbsp; 24 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust:
 from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 25 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall cause thee to be smitten before thine
 enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven
 ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
 unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray <I>them</I> away.
 &nbsp; 27 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with
 the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
 canst not be healed.
 &nbsp; 28 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
 astonishment of heart:

 darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt
 be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save
 <I>thee.</I>
 &nbsp; 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with
 her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
 thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 31 Thine ox <I>shall be</I> slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt
 not eat thereof: thine ass <I>shall be</I> violently taken away from

 <I>shall be</I> given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
 rescue <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 32 Thy sons and thy daughters <I>shall be</I> given unto another
 people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail <I>with longing</I> for
 them all the day long: and <I>there shall be</I> no might in thine
 hand.
 &nbsp; 33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
 which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed
 and crushed alway:
 &nbsp; 34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
 thou shalt see.
 &nbsp; 35 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs,
 with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy
 foot unto the top of thy head.
 &nbsp; 36 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
 over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have
 known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.
 &nbsp; 37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
 byword, among all nations whither the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall lead thee.
 &nbsp; 38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
 gather <I>but</I> little in; for the locust shall consume it.
 &nbsp; 39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress <I>them,</I> but shalt
 neither drink <I>of</I> the wine, nor gather <I>the grapes;</I> for the
 worms shall eat them.
 &nbsp; 40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
 thou shalt not anoint <I>thyself</I> with the oil; for thine olive
 shall cast <I>his fruit.</I>
 &nbsp; 41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not
 enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.
 &nbsp; 42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust
 consume.
 &nbsp; 43 The stranger that <I>is</I> within thee shall get up above thee
 very high; and thou shalt come down very low.
 &nbsp; 44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
 shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having viewed the bright side of the cloud, which is towards the 
 obedient, we have now presented to us the dark side, which is towards 
 the disobedient. If we do not keep God's commandments, we not only come 
 short of the blessing promised, but we lay ourselves under the curse, 
 which is as comprehensive of all misery as the blessing is of all 
 happiness.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The equity of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, nor for some 
 light cause; God seeks not occasion against us, nor is he apt to 
 quarrel with us. That which is here mentioned as bringing the curse is, 
 
 1. Despising God, refusing to <I>hearken to his voice</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 which bespeaks the highest contempt imaginable, as if what he said were
 not worth the heeding, or we were not under any obligation to him. 

 2.  Disobeying him, <I>not doing his commandments,</I> or not observing
 to do them. None fall under his curse but those that rebel against his 
 command. 

 3. Deserting him. "It is because of the <I>wickedness of thy
 doings,</I> not only whereby thou hast slighted me, but <I>whereby thou 
 hast forsaken me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God never casts us off till we first cast him off. It intimates that
 their idolatry, by which they forsook the true God for false gods, 
 would be their destroying sin more than any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The extent and efficacy of this curse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, it is declared, "<I>All these curses shall come upon 
 thee</I> from above, <I>and shall overtake thee;</I> though thou 
 endeavour to escape them, it is to no purpose to attempt it, they shall 
 follow thee whithersoever thou goest, and seize thee, overtake thee, 
 and overcome thee," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is said of the sinner, when God's wrath is in pursuit of him, that
 he <I>would fain flee out of his hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:22">Job xxvii. 22</A>),

 but he cannot; if he <I>flee from the iron weapon,</I> yet <I>the bow
 of steel shall</I> reach him and <I>strike him through.</I> There is no 
 running from God but by running to him, no fleeing from his justice but 
 by fleeing to his mercy. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:7,8">Ps. xxi. 7, 8</A>.

 (1.) Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows him; wherever
 he is, it rests upon him. He is cursed <I>in the city</I> and <I>in the 
 field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>.

 The strength of the city cannot shelter him from it, the pleasant air
 of the country is no fence against these pestilential steams. He is 
 cursed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 when he comes in, for the curse is <I>upon the house of the wicked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>),

 and he is cursed when he goes out, for he cannot leave that curse
 behind him, nor get rid of it, which has entered into his bowels like 
 water and like oil into his bones.

 (2.) Whatever he has is under a curse: <I>Cursed is the ground for his
 sake,</I> and all that is on it, or comes out of it, and so he is 
 cursed from the ground, as Cain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:11">Gen. iv. 11</A>.

 The <I>basket and store</I> are cursed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 All his enjoyments being forfeited by him are in a manner forbidden to
 him, as cursed things, which he has no title to.  To those whose 
 <I>mind and conscience are defiled</I> every thing else is so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 They are all embittered to him; he cannot take any true comfort in
 them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them, and he is so far 
 from having any security of the continuance of them that, if his eyes 
 be open, he may see them all condemned and ready to be confiscated, and 
 with them all his joys and all his hopes gone for ever.

 (3.) Whatever he does is under a curse too. It is a curse in all that
 <I>he sets his hand to</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 a constant disappointment, which those are subject to that set their
 hearts upon the world, and expect their happiness in it, and which 
 cannot but be a constant vexation. This curse is just the reverse of 
 the blessing in the former part of the chapter. Thus whatever bliss 
 there is in heaven there is not only the want of it, but the contrary 
 to it, in hell. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13">Isa. lxv. 13</A>,

 <I>My servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Many particular judgments are here enumerated, which would be the 
 fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the 
 Jews for their apostasy and disobedience. These judgments threatened 
 are of divers kinds, for God has many arrows in his quiver, <I>four 
 sore judgments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:21">Ezek. xiv. 21</A>),

 and many more. They are represented as very terrible, and the
 descriptions of them are exceedingly lively and affecting, that men, 
 knowing these terrors of the Lord, might, if possible, be persuaded. 
 The threatenings of the same judgment are several times repeated, that 
 they might make the more deep and lasting impressions, and to intimate 
 that, if men persisted in their disobedience, the judgment which they 
 thought was over, and of which they said, "Surely the bitterness of it 
 is past," would return with double force; for when God judges he will 
 overcome. 

 (1.) Bodily diseases are here threatened, that they should be
 epidemical in their land. These God sometimes makes use of for the 
 chastisement and improvement of his own people. <I>Lord, behold, he 
 whom thou lovest is sick.</I> But here they are threatened to be 
 brought upon his enemies as tokens of his wrath, and designed for their 
 ruin. So that according to the temper of our spirits, under sickness, 
 accordingly it is to us a blessing or a curse. But, whatever sickness 
 may be to particular persons, it is certain that epidemical diseases 
 raging among a people are national judgments, and are so to be 
 accounted. He here threatens, 
 
 [1.] Painful diseases

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 a sore botch, beginning in the legs and knees, but spreading, like
 Job's boils, from heat to foot. 
 
 [2.] Shameful diseases

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 the botch of Egypt (such boils and blains as the Egyptians had been
 plagued with, when God brought Israel from among them), and the emerods
 and scab, vile diseases, the just punishment of those who by sin had
 made themselves vile. 
 
 [3.] Mortal diseases, the pestilence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 the consumption (put for all chronical diseases), and the fever (for
 all acute diseases), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:16">Lev. xxvi. 16</A>.

 And all incurable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 (2.) Famine, and scarcity of provisions; and this, 

 [1.] For want of rain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>):

 <I>Thy heaven over thy head,</I> that part that is over thy land,
 <I>shall be as</I> dry <I>as brass,</I> while the heavens over other 
 countries shall distil their dews; and, when the heaven is as brass, 
 the earth of course will be as iron, so hard and unfruitful.  Instead 
 of rain, the dust shall be blown out of the highways into the field, 
 and spoil the little that there is of the fruits of the earth.  

 [2.] By destroying insects. The locust should destroy the corn, so that 
 they should not have so much as their <I>seed again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:38,42"><I>v.</I> 38, 42</A>.

 And the fruit of the vine, which should make glad their hearts, should
 all be worm-eaten, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 And the olive, some way or other, should be made to <I>cast its
 fruit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The heathen use many superstitious customs in honour of their idol-gods
 for preserving the fruits of the earth; but Moses tells Israel that the 
 only way they had to preserve them was to keep God's commandments; for 
 he is a God that will not be sported with, like their idols, but will 
 be served in spirit and truth.  This threatening we find fulfilled in 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1,Jer+14:1,Joe+1:4">1 Kings xvii. 1; 
 Jer. xiv. 1, &c.; Joel i. 4</A>.

 (3.) That they should be smitten before their enemies in war, who, it
 is likely, would be the more cruel to them, when they had them at their 
 mercy, for the severity they had used against the nations of Canaan, 
 which their neighbours in after-ages would be apt to remember against 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It would make their flight the more shameful, and the more grievous,
 that they might have triumphed over their enemies if they had but been 
 faithful to their God. The carcases of those that were slain in war, or 
 died in captivity among strangers, should be <I>meat for the fowls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 and an Israelite, having forfeited the favour of his God, should have
 so little humanity shown him as that <I>no man should drive them 
 away,</I> so odious would God's curse make him to all mankind.

 (4.) That they should be infatuated in all their counsels, so as not to
 discern their own interest, nor bring any thing to pass for the public 
 good: <I>The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 Note, God's judgments can reach the minds of men to fill them with
 darkness and horror, as well as their bodies and estates; and those are 
 the sorest of all judgments which make men a terror to themselves, and 
 their own destroyers. That which they contrived to secure themselves by 
 should still turn to their prejudice.  Thus we often find that the 
 allies they confided in <I>distressed them</I> and <I>strengthened them 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:20">2 Chron. xxviii. 20</A>.

 Those that will not walk in God's counsels are justly left to be ruined
 by their own; and those that are wilfully blind to their duty deserve 
 to be made blind to their interest, and, seeing they <I>loved darkness 
 rather than light,</I> let them <I>grope at noon-day</I> as in the 
 dark. 

 (5.) That they should be plundered of all their enjoyments, stripped of
 all by the proud and imperious conqueror, such as Benhadad was to Ahab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:5,6">1 Kings xx. 5, 6</A>.

 Not only their houses and vineyards should be taken from them, but
 their wives and children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:30,32"><I>v.</I> 30, 32</A>.

 Their dearest comforts, which they took most pleasure in, and promised
 themselves most from, should be the entertainment and triumph of their 
 enemies. As they had dwelt in houses which they built not, and eaten of 
 vineyards which they planted not

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10,11"><I>ch.</I> vi. 10, 11</A>),

 so others should do by them. Their oxen, asses, and sheep, like Job's,
 should be taken away before their eyes, and they should not be able to 
 recover them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 And all the fruit of their land and labours should be devoured and
 eaten up by the enemy; so that they and theirs would want necessaries, 
 while their enemies were revelling with that which they had laboured 
 for.

 (6.) That they should be carried captives into a far country; nay, into
 <I>all the kingdoms of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Their sons and daughters, whom they promised themselves comfort in,
 should go into captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and they themselves at length, and their king in whom they promised
 themselves safety and settlement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:36"><I>v.</I>  36</A>.

 This was fully accomplished when the ten tribes first were carried
 captive into Assyria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6">2 Kings xvii. 6</A>),

 and not long after the two tribes into Babylon, and two of their kings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:15,15,25:7,21">2 Kings  xxiv. 14, 15; xxv. 7, 21</A>.

 That which is mentioned as an aggravation of their captivity is that
 they should go into an unknown country, the language and customs of 
 which would be very uncouth, and their treatment among them barbarous, 
 and there they should <I>serve other gods,</I> that is, be compelled to 
 do so by their enemies, as they were in Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:6">Dan. iii. 6</A>.

 Note, God often makes men's sin their punishment, and chooses their
 delusions.  You shall <I>serve other gods,</I> that is, "You shall 
 serve those that do serve them;" a nation is often in scripture called 
 by the name of its gods, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:7">Jer. xlviii. 7</A>.

 They had made idolaters their associates, and now god made idolaters
 their oppressors.

 (7.) That those who remained should be insulted and tyrannized over by 
 strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:43,44"><I>v.</I> 43, 44</A>.

 So the ten tribes were by the colonies which the king of Assyria sent
 to take possession of their land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:24">2 Kings xvii. 24</A>.

 Or this may be meant of the gradual encroachments which the strangers
 within their gates should make upon them, so as insensibly to worm them 
 out of their estates. We read of the fulfilling of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:9">Hos. vii. 9</A>,

 <I>Strangers have devoured his strength.</I> Foreigners ate the bread 
 out of the mouths of trueborn Israelites, by which they were justly 
 chastised for introducing strange gods. 

 (8.) That their reputation among their neighbours should be quite sunk, 
 and those that had been a name, and a praise, should be an 
 astonishment, a proverb, and a by-word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Some have observed the fulfilling of this threatening in their present
 state; for, when we would express the most perfidious and barbarous 
 treatment, we say, <I>None but a Jew would have done so.</I> Thus is 
 sin a reproach to any people.

 (9.) To complete their misery, it is threatened that they should be put
 quite out of the possession of their minds by all these troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be mad for the sight of thy eyes,</I> that is, quite
 bereaved of all comfort and hope, and abandoned to utter despair. Those 
 that walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason 
 itself, when every thing about them looks frightful; and their 
 condition is woeful indeed that are <I>mad for the sight of their 
 eyes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
 pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because
 thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to keep
 his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:
 &nbsp; 46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
 upon thy seed for ever.
 &nbsp; 47 Because thou servedst not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God with joyfulness,
 and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all <I>things;</I>
 &nbsp; 48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in
 nakedness, and in want of all <I>things:</I> and he shall put a yoke
 of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
 &nbsp; 49 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring a nation against thee from far, from
 the end of the earth, <I>as swift</I> as the eagle flieth; a nation
 whose tongue thou shalt not understand;
 &nbsp; 50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
 person of the old, nor show favour to the young:
 &nbsp; 51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of
 thy land, until thou be destroyed: which <I>also</I> shall not leave
 thee <I>either</I> corn, wine, or oil, <I>or</I> the increase of thy kine,
 or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.
 &nbsp; 52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high
 and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout
 all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
 throughout all thy land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath given thee.
 &nbsp; 53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
 thy sons and of thy daughters, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath given
 thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine
 enemies shall distress thee:
 &nbsp; 54 <I>So that</I> the man <I>that is</I> tender among you, and very
 delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward
 the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children
 which he shall leave:
 &nbsp; 55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
 children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in
 the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall
 distress thee in all thy gates.
 &nbsp; 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
 adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
 delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
 husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
 daughter,
 &nbsp; 57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
 feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall
 eat them for want of all <I>things</I> secretly in the siege and
 straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy
 gates.
 &nbsp; 58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law
 that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this
 glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
 &nbsp; 59 Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will make thy plagues wonderful, and the
 plagues of thy seed, <I>even</I> great plagues, and of long
 continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
 &nbsp; 60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
 which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.
 &nbsp; 61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which <I>is</I> not
 written in the book of this law, them will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> bring upon
 thee, until thou be destroyed.
 &nbsp; 62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
 stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the
 voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 63 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rejoiced over
 you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will rejoice
 over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall
 be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
 &nbsp; 64 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall scatter thee among all people, from the
 one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
 serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,
 <I>even</I> wood and stone.
 &nbsp; 65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither
 shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall give
 thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
 mind:
 &nbsp; 66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
 fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:
 &nbsp; 67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and
 at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
 of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
 thine eyes which thou shalt see.
 &nbsp; 68 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships,
 by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
 again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen
 and bondwomen, and no man shall buy <I>you.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have thought that enough had been said to possess them with a 
 dread of that <I>wrath of God</I> which is <I>revealed from heaven 
 against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</I> But to show how 
 deep the treasures of that wrath are, and that still there is more and 
 worse behind, Moses, when one would have thought that he had concluded 
 this dismal subject, begins again, and adds to this roll of curses many 
 similar words: as Jeremiah did to his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:32">Jer. xxxvi. 32</A>.

 It should seem that in the former part of this commination Moses
 foretells their captivity in Babylon, and the calamities which 
 introduced and attended that, by which, even after their return, they 
 were brought to that low and poor condition which is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.
 
 That their enemies should be <I>the head,</I> and they <I>the tail:</I>
 but here, in this latter part, he foretels their last destruction by 
 the Romans and their dispersion thereupon. And the present deplorable 
 state of the Jewish nation, and of all that have incorporated 
 themselves with them, by embracing their religion, does so fully and 
 exactly answer to the prediction in these verses that it serves for an 
 incontestable proof of the truth of prophecy, and consequently of the 
 divine authority of the scripture. And, this last destruction being 
 here represented as more dreadful than the former, it shows that their 
 sin, in rejecting Christ and his gospel, was more heinous and more 
 provoking to God than idolatry itself, and left them more under the 
 power of Satan; for their captivity in Babylon cured them effectually 
 of their idolatry in seventy years' time; but under this last 
 destruction now for above 1600 years they continue incurably averse to 
 the Lord Jesus.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is here said in general of the wrath of God, which should light 
 and lie upon them for their sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That, if they would not be <I>ruled by the commands of God,</I> they 
 should certainly be <I>ruined by his curse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>.

 Because thou didst not <I>keep his commandments</I> (especially that of
 hearing and obeying the great prophet), <I>these curses shall come upon 
 thee,</I> as upon a people appointed to destruction, the generation of 
 God's wrath: and they shall be <I>for a sign</I> and <I>for a 
 wonder.</I> It is amazing to think that a people so long the favourites 
 of Heaven should be so perfectly abandoned and cast off, that a people 
 so closely incorporated should be so universally dispersed, and yet 
 that a people so scattered in all nations should preserve themselves 
 distinct and not mix with any, but like Cain be fugitives and 
 vagabonds, and yet marked to be known.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, if they would not serve God with cheerfulness, they should be 
 compelled to <I>serve their enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>),

 that they might know the difference

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8">2 Chron. xii. 8</A>),
 
 which, some think, is the meaning of
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24,25">Ezek. xx. 24, 25</A>,

 <I>Because they despised my statutes, I gave them statutes that were
 not good.</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) It is justly expected from those to whom God gives an abundance of
 the good things of this life that they should serve him. What does he 
 maintain us for out that we may do his work, and be some way 
 serviceable to his honour?

 (2.) The more God gives us the more cheerfully we should serve him; our
 abundance should be oil to the wheels of our obedience. God is a Master 
 that will be served with gladness, and delights to hear us sing at our 
 work.

 (3.) If, when we receive the gifts of God's bounty, we either do not
 serve him at all or serve him with reluctance, it is a righteous thing 
 with him to make us know the hardships of want and servitude.  Those 
 deserve to have cause given them to complain who complain without a 
 cause.  <I>Tristis es et felix--Happy, and yet not easy!</I> Blush at 
 thy own folly and ingratitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, if they would not <I>give glory to God</I> by a reverential 
 obedience, he would get <I>him honour upon them</I> by <I>wonderful</I> 
 plagues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:58,59"><I>v.</I> 58, 59</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) God justly expects from us that we should fear his fearful name;
 and, which is strange, that name which is here proposed as the object 
 of our fear is, T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD THY</FONT> 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>, which is very fitly here put in our Bibles in 
 capital letters; for nothing can sound more truly august. As nothing is 
 more comfortable, so nothing more awful, than this, that he with whom 
 we have to do is Jehovah, a being infinitely perfect and blessed, and 
 the author of all being; and that he is our God, our rightful Lord and 
 owner, from whom we are to receive laws and to whom we are to give 
 account: this is great, and greatly to be feared.

 (2.) We may justly expect from God that, if we do not fear his fearful
 name, we shall feel his fearful plagues; for one way or other God will 
 be feared. All God's plagues are dreadful, but some are wonderful, 
 carrying in them extraordinary signatures of divine power and justice, 
 so that a man, upon the first view of them, may say, <I>Verily, there 
 is a God that judgeth in the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the destruction threatened is described. Moses is here upon the
 same melancholy subject that our Saviour is discoursing of to his
 disciples in his farewell sermon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:4-28">Matt. xxiv.</A>),

 namely, The destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Five things are here foretold as steps to their ruin:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they should be invaded by a foreign enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>):

 <I>A nation from far,</I> namely, the Romans, <I>as swift as the
 eagle</I> hastening to the prey. Our Saviour makes use of this 
 similitude, in foretelling this destruction, that <I>where the carcase 
 is there will the eagles be gathered together,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28">Matt. xxiv. 28</A>.

 And bishop Patrick observes (to make the accomplishment the more
 remarkable) that the ensign of the Roman armies was an eagle. This 
 nation is said to be of a fierce countenance, an indication of a fierce 
 nature, stern and severe, that would not pity the weakness and 
 infirmity either of little children or of old people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the country should be laid waste, and all the fruits of it 
 eaten up by this army of foreigners, which is the natural consequence 
 of an invasion, especially when it is made, as that by the Romans was, 
 for the chastisement of rebels: He <I>shall eat the fruits of thy 
 cattle and land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 so that the inhabitants should be starved, while the invaders were fed
 to the full.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That their cities should be besieged, and that such would be the 
 obstinacy of the besieged, and such the vigour of the besiegers, that 
 they would be reduced to the last extremity, and at length fall into 
 the hands of the enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 No place, though ever so well fortified, no, not Jerusalem itself,
 though it held out long, would escape. Two of the common consequences 
 of a long siege are here foretold:--

 [1.] A miserable famine, which would prevail to such a degree that, for 
 want of food, they should <I>kill and eat their own children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 Men should do so, notwithstanding their hardiness, and ability to bear
 hunger; and, though obliged by the law of nature to provide for their 
 own families, yet should refuse to give to the wife and children that 
 were starving any of the child that was barbarously butchered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:54,55"><I>v.</I>  54, 55</A>.
 
 Nay, women, ladies of quality, notwithstanding their natural
 niceness about their food, and their natural affection to their 
 children, yet, for want of food, should so far forget all humanity as 
 to kill and eat them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56,57"><I>v.</I> 56, 57</A>.

 Let us observe, by the way, how hard this fate must needs be to the
 tender and delicate women, and learn not to indulge ourselves in 
 tenderness and delicacy, because we know not what we may be reduced to 
 before we die; the more nice we are, the harder it will be to us to 
 bear want, and the more danger we shall be in or sacrificing reason, 
 and religion, and natural affection itself, to the clamours and 
 cravings of an unmortified and ungoverned appetite.  This threatening 
 was fulfilled in the letter of it, more than once, to the perpetual 
 reproach of the Jewish nation: never was the like done either by Greek 
 or barbarian, but in the siege of Samaria, a woman <I>boiled her own 
 son,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:28,29">2 Kings vi. 28, 29</A>.

 And it is spoken of as commonly done among them in the siege of
 Jerusalem by the Babylonians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:10">Lam. iv. 10</A>.

 And, in the last siege by the Romans, Josephus tells us of a noble
 woman that killed and ate her own child, through the extremity of the 
 famine, and when she had eaten one half secretly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>),

 that she might have it to herself, the mob, smelling meat, got into the
 house, to whom she showed the other half, which she had kept till 
 another time, inviting them to share with her.  What is too barbarous 
 for those to do that are abandoned of God! 

 [2.] Sickness is another common effect of a strait and long siege, and 
 that is here threatened: <I>Sore sickness, and of long continuance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:59"><I>v.</I>  59</A>.

 These should attend the Jews wherever they went afterwards, the
 diseases of Egypt, leprosies, botches, and foul ulcers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.

 Nay, as if the particular miseries here threatened were not enough, he
 concludes with an <I>et cetera,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.

 The Lord will bring upon thee every sickness, and every plague, though
 it be <I>not written in the book of this law.</I> Those that fall under 
 the curse of God will find that the one half was not told them of the 
 weight and terror of that curse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That multitudes of them should perish, so that they should become 
 <I>few in number,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>.

 It was a nation that God had wonderfully increased, so that they were
 <I>as the stars of heaven for multitude;</I> but, for their sin, they 
 were <I>diminished and brought low,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38,39">Ps. cvii. 38, 39</A>.

 It is computed that in the destruction of the Jewish nation by the
 Romans, as appears by the account Josephus gives of it, above two 
 millions fell by the sword at several places, besides what perished by 
 famine and pestilence; so that the whole country was laid waste and 
 turned into a wilderness. That is a terrible word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>),

 <I>As the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, so he will rejoice
 over you to destroy you.</I> Behold here <I>the goodness and severity 
 of God:</I> mercy here shines brightly in the pleasure God takes in 
 doing good--he rejoices in it; yet justice here appears no less 
 illustrious in the pleasure he takes in destroying the impenitent; not 
 as it is the making of his creatures miserable, but as it is the 
 asserting of his own honour and the securing of the ends of his 
 government. See what a malignant mischievous thing sin is, which (as I 
 may say) makes it necessary for the God of infinite goodness to rejoice 
 in the destruction of his own creatures, even those that had been 
 favourites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That the remnant should be scattered throughout the nations This 
 completes their woe: <I>The Lord shall scatter thee among all 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>.

 This is remarkably fulfilled in their present dispersion, for there are
 Jews to be fond almost in all countries that are possessed either by 
 Christians or Mahometans, and in such numbers that it has been said, If 
 they could unite in one common interest, they would be a very 
 formidable body, and able to deal with the most powerful states and 
 princes; but they abide under the power of this curse, and are so 
 scattered that they are not able to incorporate. It is here foretold 
 that in this dispersion,

 [1.] They should have no religion, or none to any purpose, should have 
 no temple, nor altar, nor priesthood, for they should <I>serve other 
 gods.</I> Some think this has been fulfilled in the force put upon the 
 Jews in popish countries to worship the images that are used in the 
 Romish church, to their great vexation. 

 [2.] They should have no rest, no rest of body: <I>The sole of thy foot 
 shall not have rest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>),

 but be continually upon the remove, either in hope of gain or fear of
 persecution; all wandering Jews: no rest of the mind (which is much 
 worse), but a <I>trembling heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>);
 
 <I>no assurance of life</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>);
 
 weary both of light and darkness, which are, in their turns, both
 welcome to a quiet mind, but to them both day and night would be a 
 terror, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>.
 
 Such was once the condition of Job
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:4">Job vii. 4</A>),

 but to them this should be constant and perpetual; that blindness and
 darkness which the apostle speaks of as having happened to Israel, and 
 that guilt which <I>bowed down their back always</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8-10">Rom. xi. 8-10</A>),

 must needs occasion a constant restlessness and amazement. Those are a
 torment to themselves, and to all about them, that fear day and night 
 and are always uneasy. Let good people strive against it, and not give 
 way to that fear which has torment; and let wicked people not be secure 
 in their wickedness, for their hearts cannot endure, nor can their 
 hands be strong, when the terrors of God set themselves in array 
 against them. Those that say <I>in the morning, O that it were 
 evening,</I> and <I>in the evening, O that it were morning,</I> show, 
 <I>First,</I> A constant fret and vexation, chiding the hours for 
 lingering and complaining of the length of every minute. Let time be 
 precious to us when we are in prosperity, and then it will not be so 
 tedious to us when we are in afflictions as otherwise it would.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> A constant fright and terror, afraid in the morning of 
 the <I>arrow that flieth by day,</I> and therefore wishing the day 
 over; but what will this do for them? When evening comes, the trembling 
 heart is no less apprehensive of the <I>terror by night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:5,6">Ps. xci. 5, 6</A>.

 Happy they whose minds, being stayed on God, are <I>quiet from the fear
 of evil!</I> Observe here, The terror arises not only from the sight of 
 the eyes, but from the fear of the heart, not only from real dangers, 
 but from imaginary ones; the causes of fear, when they come to be 
 enquired into, often prove to be only the creatures of the fancy.  </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the close, God threatens to leave them as he found them, in a 
 <I>house of bondage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68"><I>v.</I> 68</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again,</I> that is into such a
 miserable state as they were in when they were slaves to the Egyptians, 
 and ruled by them with rigour.  God had brought them out of Egypt, and 
 had said, <I>They shall see it no more again</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 16</A>);

 but now they should be reduced to the same state of slavery that they
 had been in there. To be sold to strangers would be bad enough, but 
 much worse to be sold to their enemies. Even slaves may be valued as 
 such, but a Jew should have so ill a name for all that is base that 
 when he was exposed to sale no man would buy him, which would make his 
 master that had him to sell the more severe with him. Thirty Jews (they 
 say) have been sold for one small piece of money, as they sold our 
 Saviour for thirty pieces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Upon the whole matter, 

 (1.) The accomplishment of these predictions upon the Jewish nation
 shows that Moses spoke by the Spirit of God, who certainly foresees the 
 ruin of sinners, and gives them warning of it, that they may prevent it 
 by a true and timely repentance, or else be left inexcusable.

 (2.) Let us all hence learn to stand in awe and not to sin. I have
 heard of a wicked man, who, upon reading the threatenings of this 
 chapter, was so enraged that he tore the leaf out of the Bible, as 
 Jehoiakim cut Jeremiah's roll; but to what purpose is it to deface a 
 copy, while the original remains upon record in the divine counsels, by 
 which it is unalterably determined that <I>the wages of sin is 
 death,</I> whether men will hear or whether they will forbear?</P>
