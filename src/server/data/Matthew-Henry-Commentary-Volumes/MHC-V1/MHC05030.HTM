 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have thought that the threatenings in the close of the 
 foregoing chapter had made a full end of the people of Israel, and had 
 left their case for ever desperate; but in this chapter we have a plain 
 intimation of the mercy God had in store for them in the latter days, 
 so that mercy at length rejoices against judgment, and has the last 
 word. Here we have, 

 I. Exceedingly great and precious promises made to them, upon their
 repentance and return to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. The righteousness of faith set before them in the plainness and
 easiness of the commandment that was now given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 III. A fair reference of the whole matter to their choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:15-20">ver. 15</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come
 upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
 thee, and thou shalt call <I>them</I> to mind among all the nations,
 whither the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath driven thee,
 &nbsp; 2 And shalt return unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and shalt obey his
 voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy
 children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;
 &nbsp; 3 That then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
 compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
 the nations, whither the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath scattered thee.
 &nbsp; 4 If <I>any</I> of thine be driven out unto the outmost <I>parts</I> of
 heaven, from thence will the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God gather thee, and from
 thence will he fetch thee:
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
 fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee
 good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
 heart of thy seed, to love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God with all thine heart,
 and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will put all these curses upon thine
 enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and do
 all his commandments which I command thee this day.
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will make thee plenteous in every work
 of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
 cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will
 again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
 fathers:
 &nbsp; 10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to
 keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this
 book of the law, <I>and</I> if thou turn unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God with
 all thine heart, and with all thy soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses may be considered either as a conditional promise or as an 
 absolute prediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are chiefly to be considered as a conditional promise, and so 
 they belong to all persons and all people, and not to Israel only; and 
 the design of them is to assure us that the greatest sinners, if they 
 repent and be converted, shall have their sins pardoned, and be 
 restored to God's favour. This is the purport of the covenant of grace, 
 it leaves room for repentance in case of misdemeanour, and promises 
 pardon upon repentance, which the covenant of innocency did not. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the repentance is described which is the condition of these 
 promises. 

 (1.) It begins in <I>serious consideration,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 "Thou shalt call to mind that which thou hadst forgotten or not
 regarded." Note, Consideration is the first step towards conversion. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:8">Isa. xlvi. 8</A>, 

 <I>Bring to mind, O you transgressors.</I> The prodigal son came to
 himself first, and then to his father. That which they should call to 
 mind is the blessing and the curse. If sinners would but seriously 
 consider the happiness they have lost by sin and the misery they have 
 brought themselves into, and that by repentance they may escape that 
 misery and recover that happiness, they would not delay to <I>return to 
 the Lord their God.</I> The prodigal <I>called to mind the blessing and 
 the curse</I> when he considered his present poverty and the plenty of 
 bread <I>in his father's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17">Luke xv. 17</A>.

 (2.) It consists in sincere conversion. The effect of the consideration
 cannot but be godly sorrow and shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9,7:16">Ezek. vi. 9; vii. 16</A>.

 But that which is the life and soul of repentance, and without which
 the most passionate expressions are but a jest, is <I>returning to the 
 Lord our God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>.
 
 If thou turn
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 <I>with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</I> We must return to our
 allegiance to God as our Lord and ruler, our dependence upon him as our 
 Father and benefactor, our devotedness to him as our highest end, and 
 our communion with him as our God in covenant. We must return to God 
 from all that which stands in opposition to him or competition with 
 him. In this return to God we must be upright--with the heart and soul, 
 and universal--with all the heart and all the soul.

 (3.) It is evidenced by a constant obedience to the holy will of God:
 If thou shalt <I>obey his voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>thou and thy children;</I> for it is not enough that we do our duty
 ourselves, but we must train up and engage our children to do it. Or 
 this comes in as the condition of the entail of the blessing upon their 
 children, provided their children kept close to their duty.  

 [1.] This obedience must be with an eye to God: Thou shalt <I>obey his
 voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and hearken to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 [2.] It must be sincere, and cheerful, and entire: <I>With all thy
 heart, and with all thy soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 [3.] It must be from a principle of love, and that love must be <I>with
 all thy heart and with all thy soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is the heart and soul that God looks at and requires; he will have
 these or nothing, and these entire or not at all.

 [4.] It must be universal: <I>According to all that I command thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 <I>to do all his commandments;</I> for he that allows himself in the
 breach of one commandment involves himself in the guilt of contemning 
 them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:10">James ii. 10</A>.

 An upright heart has <I>respect to all God's commandments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:6">Ps. cxix. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the favour is which is promised upon this repentance. Though 
 they are brought to God by their trouble and distress, in the nations 
 whither they were driven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 yet God will graciously accept of them notwithstanding; for on this
 errand afflictions are sent, to bring us to repentance. Though they are 
 <I>driven out to the utmost parts of heaven,</I> yet thence their 
 penitent prayers shall reach God's gracious ear, and there his favour 
 shall find them out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>Undique ad c&aelig;los tantundem est vi&aelig;--From every place there is
 the same way to heaven.</I> This promise Nehemiah pleads in his prayer 
 for dispersed Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:9">Neh. i. 9</A>.
 
 It is here promised,

 (1.) That God would have compassion upon them, as proper objects of his
 pity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Against sinners that go on in sin God has indignation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:20"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 20</A>),

 but on those that repent and bemoan themselves he has compassion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18,20">Jer. xxxi. 18, 20</A>.

 True penitents may take great encouragement from the compassions and
 tender mercies of our God, which never fail, but overflow.

 (2.) That he would <I>turn their captivity, and gather them from the
 nations whither they were scattered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 though ever so remote, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 One of the Chaldee paraphrasts applies this to the Messiah, explaining
 it thus: <I>The word of the Lord shall gather you by the hand of Elias 
 the great priest, and shall bring you by the hand of the king 
 Messiah;</I> for this was God's covenant with him, that he should 
 <I>restore the preserved of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6">Isa. xlix. 6</A>.

 And this was the design of his death, to <I>gather into one the
 children of God that were scattered abroad,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51,52">John xi. 51, 52</A>.

 <I>To him shall the gathering of the people be.</I> 

 (3.) That he would <I>bring them into their land again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, Penitent sinners are not only delivered out of their misery, but
 restored to true happiness in the favour of God. The land they are 
 brought into to possess it is , though not the same, yet in some 
 respects better than that which our first father Adam possessed, and 
 out of which he was expelled.

 (4.) That he would <I>do them good</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and <I>rejoice over them for good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 For there is joy in heaven upon the repentance and conversion of
 sinners: the father of the prodigal <I>rejoiced over him for good.</I>

 (5.) That he would multiply them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and that, when they grew numerous, every mouth might have meat: he
 would <I>make them plenteous in every work of their hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 National repentance and reformation bring national plenty, peace, and
 prosperity. It is promised, <I>The Lord will make thee plenteous</I> in 
 the fruit of thy cattle and land, for good. Many have plenty for hurt; 
 the prosperity of fools destroys them.  Then it is for good when with 
 it God gives us grace to use it for his glory.

 (6.) That he would transfer the curses they had been under to their
 enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When God was gathering them in to re-establish them they would meet
 with much opposition; but the same curses that had been a burden upon 
 them should become a defence to them, by being turned upon their 
 adversaries. The cup of trembling should be taken out of their hand, 
 and put into the hand of those that afflicted them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa.  li. 22, 23</A>.

 (7.) That he would give them his grace to change their hearts, and rule
 there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, to love the Lord.</I>
 Note, 

 [1.] The heart must be circumcised to love God. The filth of the flesh
 must be put away; and the foolishness of the heart, as the Chaldee 
 paraphrase expounds it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11,12,Ro+2:29">Col. ii. 11, 12; Rom. ii. 29</A>.

 Circumcision was a seal of the covenant; the heart is then
 <I>circumcised to love God</I> when it is strongly engaged and held by 
 that bond to this duty.

 [2.] It is the work of God's grace to circumcise the heart, and to shed
 abroad the love of God there; and this grace is given to all that 
 repent and seek it carefully. Nay, that seems to be rather a promise 
 than a precept

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord.</I> He that
 requires us to return promises grace to enable us to return: and it is 
 our fault if that grace be not effectual. herein the covenant of grace 
 is well ordered, that whatsoever is required in the covenant is 
 promised.  <I>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my 
 Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23">Prov. i. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is observable how Moses here calls God <I>the Lord thy God</I> 
 twelve times in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1-10">these ten verses</A>,

 intimating,

 (1.) That penitents may take direction and encouragement in their
 return to God from their relation to him. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>,

 "<I>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God;</I>
 therefore to thee we are bound to come, whither else should we go? And 
 therefore we hope to find favour with thee."

 (2.) That those who have revolted from God, if they return to him and
 do their first works, shall be restored to their former state of honour 
 and happiness. <I>Bring hither the first robe.</I> In the threatenings 
 of the former chapter he is all along called the <I>Lord,</I> a God of 
 power and the Judge of all: but, in the promises of this chapter, 
 <I>the Lord thy God,</I> a God of grace, and in covenant with thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This may also be considered as a prediction of the repentance and 
 restoration of the Jews: <I>When all these things shall have come upon 
 thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 the blessing first, and after that the curse, then the mercy in reserve
 shall take place.  Though their hearts were wretchedly hardened, yet 
 the grace of God could soften and change them; and then, though their 
 case was deplorably miserable, the providence of God would redress all 
 their grievances. Now, 

 1. It is certain that this was fulfilled in their return from their
 captivity in Babylon. It was a wonderful instance of their repentance 
 and reformation that Ephraim, who had been joined to idols, renounced 
 them, and said, <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I> That 
 captivity effectually cured them of idolatry; and then God planted them 
 again in their own land and did them good.  But, 

 2. Some think that it is yet further to be accomplished in the
 conversion of the Jews who are now dispersed, their repentance for the 
 sin of their fathers in crucifying Christ, their return to God through 
 him, and their accession to the Christian church. But, <I>alas!  who 
 shall live when God doth this?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it <I>is</I>
 not hidden from thee, neither <I>is</I> it far off.
 &nbsp; 12 It <I>is</I> not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
 up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
 and do it?
 &nbsp; 13 Neither <I>is</I> it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
 shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may
 hear it, and do it?
 &nbsp; 14 But the word <I>is</I> very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in
 thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses here urges them to obedience from the consideration of the 
 plainness and easiness of the command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This is true of the law of Moses. They could never plead in excuse 
 of their disobedience that God had enjoined them that which was either 
 unintelligible or impracticable, impossible to be known or to be done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>It is not hidden from thee.</I> That is, not send messengers to
 heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 to enquire what thou must do to please God; nor needest thou <I>go
 beyond sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 as the philosophers did, that travelled through many and distant
 regions in pursuit of learning; no, thou art not put to that labour and 
 expense; nor is the commandment within the reach of those only that 
 have a great estate or a refined genius, but it is <I>very nigh unto 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is written in thy books, made plain upon tables, so that he that
 runs may read it; thy priests' lips keep this knowledge, and, when any 
 difficulty arises, thou mayest <I>ask the law at their mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 It is not communicated in a strange language; but it is in thy mouth,
 that is, in the vulgar tongue that is commonly used by thee, in which 
 thou mayest hear it read, and talk of it familiarly among thy children. 
 It is not wrapped up in obscure phrases or figures to puzzle and amuse 
 thee, or in hieroglyphics, but it is in thy heart; it is delivered in 
 such a manner as that it is level to thy capacity, even to the capacity 
 of the meanest."

 2. "It is not too <I>hard</I> nor <I>heavy</I> for thee:" so the
 Septuagint reads it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Thou needest not say, "As good attempt to climb to heaven, or flee upon
 the wings of the morning to the uttermost part of the sea, as go about 
 to do all the words of this law:" no, the matter is not so; it is no 
 such intolerable yoke as some ill-minded people represent it. It was 
 indeed a heavy yoke in comparison with that of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:10">Acts xv. 10</A>),

 but not in comparison with the idolatrous services of the neighbouring
 nations. God appeals to themselves that he had not <I>made them to 
 serve with an offering, nor wearied them with incense,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23,Mic+6:3">Isa. xliii. 23; Mic. vi. 3</A>.

 But he speaks especially of the moral law, and its precepts: "That is
 very nigh thee, consonant to the law of nature, which would have been 
 found in every man's heart, and every man's mouth, if he would but have 
 attended to it. There is that in thee which <I>consents to the law that 
 it is good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:16">Rom. vii. 16</A>.

 Thou hast therefore no reason to complain of any insuperable difficulty
 in the observance of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This is true of the gospel of Christ, to which the apostle applies 
 it, and makes it the language of the <I>righteousness which is of 
 faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6-8">Rom. x. 6-8</A>.

 And many think this is principally intended by Moses here; for he
 <I>wrote of Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:46">John v. 46</A>.

 This is God's commandment now under the gospel that we <I>believe in
 the name of his Son Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23">1 John iii. 23</A>.

 If we ask, as the blind man did, <I>Lord, who is he?</I> or where is
 he, that we may believe on him?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:36">John ix. 36</A>),

 this scripture gives an answer, We need not go up to heaven, to fetch
 him thence, for he has come down thence in his incarnation; nor down to 
 the deep, to fetch him thence, for thence he has come up in his 
 resurrection. But the word is nigh us, and Christ in that word; so that 
 if we believe with the heart that the promises of the incarnation and 
 resurrection of the Messiah are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, and 
 receive him accordingly, and confess him with our mouth, we have then 
 Christ with us, and we shall be saved.  He is near, very near, that 
 justifies us. The law was plain and easy, but the gospel much more 
 so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and
 death and evil;
 &nbsp; 16 In that I command thee this day to love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to
 walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes
 and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
 possess it.
 &nbsp; 17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear,
 but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
 &nbsp; 18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish,
 <I>and that</I> ye shall not prolong <I>your</I> days upon the land,
 whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
 &nbsp; 19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you,
 <I>that</I> I have set before you life and death, blessing and
 cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may
 live:
 &nbsp; 20 That thou mayest love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, <I>and</I> that thou
 mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for
 he <I>is</I> thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
 dwell in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto thy fathers, to
 Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

 Moses here concludes with a very bright light, and a very strong fire, 
 that, if possible, what he had been preaching of might find entrance 
 into the understanding and affections of this unthinking people. What 
 could be said more moving, and more likely to make deep and lasting 
 impressions? The manner of his treating with them is so rational, so 
 prudent, so affectionate, and every way so apt to gain the point, that 
 it abundantly shows him to be in earnest, and leaves them inexcusable 
 in their disobedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He states the case very fairly. He appeals to themselves concerning 
 it whether he had not laid the matter as plainly as they could wish 
 before them. 

 1. Every man covets to obtain life and good, and to escape death and
 evil, desires happiness and dreads misery. "Well," says he, "I have 
 shown you the way to obtain all the happiness you can desire and to 
 avoid all misery. Be obedient, and all shall be well, and nothing 
 amiss." Our first parents ate the forbidden fruit, in hopes of getting 
 thereby the knowledge of good and evil; but it was a miserable 
 knowledge they got, of good by the loss of it, and of evil by the sense 
 of it; yet such is the compassion of God towards man that, instead of 
 giving him to his own delusion, he has favoured him by his word with 
 such a knowledge of good and evil as will make him for ever happy if it 
 be not his own fault. 

 2. Every man is moved and governed in his actions by hope and fear,
 hope of good and fear of evil, real of apparent.  "Now," says Moses, "I 
 have tried both ways; if you will be either drawn to obedience by the 
 certain prospect of advantage by it, or driven to obedience by the no 
 less certain prospect of ruin in case you be disobedient--if you will 
 be wrought upon either way, you will be kept close to God and your 
 duty; but, if you will not, you are utterly inexcusable." Let us, then, 
 hear the conclusion of the whole matter.

 (1.) If they and theirs would love God and serve him, they should live
 and be happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If they would love God, and evidence the sincerity of their love by
 keeping his commandments--if they would make conscience of keeping his 
 commandments, and do it from a principle of love--then God would do 
 them good, and they should be as happy as his love and blessing could 
 make them.

 (2.) If they or theirs should at any time turn from God, desert his
 service, and worship other gods this would certainly be their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Observe, It is not for every failure in the particulars of their duty
 that ruin is threatened, but for apostasy and idolatry: though every 
 violation of the command deserved the curse, yet the nation would be 
 destroyed by that only which is the violation of the marriage covenant. 
 The purport of the New Testament is much the same; this, in like 
 manner, sets before us life and death, good and evil; <I>He that 
 believes shall be saved; he that believes not shall be damned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.

 And this faith includes love and obedience. <I>To those who by patient
 continuance in well doing seek for glory, honour, and immortality,</I> 
 God will give <I>eternal life. But to those that are contentious, and 
 do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness</I> (and so, in effect, 
 worship other gods and serve them), will be rendered the indignation 
 and wrath of an immortal God, the consequence of which must needs be 
 the tribulation and anguish of an immortal soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7-9">Rom. ii. 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having thus stated the case, he fairly puts them to their choice, 
 with a direction to them to choose well. He appeals to heaven and earth 
 concerning his fair and faithful dealing with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They could not but own that whatever was the issue he had delivered his
 soul; therefore, that they might deliver theirs, he bids them choose 
 life, that is, choose to do their duty, which would be their life. 
 Note,

 1.  Those shall have life that choose it: those that choose the favour
 of God and communion with him for their felicity, and prosecute their 
 choice as they ought, shall have what they choose. 

 2. Those that come short of life and happiness must thank themselves;
 they would have had it if they had chosen it when it was put to their 
 choice: but they die because they <I>will</I> die; that is, because 
 they do not like the life promised upon the terms proposed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:20">last verse</A>,

 1. He shows them, in short, what their duty is, <I>to love God,</I> and
 to love him as <I>the Lord,</I> a Being most amiable, and as <I>their 
 God,</I> a God in covenant with them; and, as an evidence of this love, 
 to <I>obey his voice</I> in every thing, and by a constancy in this 
 love and obedience to <I>cleave to him,</I> and never to forsake him in 
 affection or practice. 

 2. He shows them what reason there was for this duty, inconsideration,

 (1.) Of their dependence upon God: <I>He is thy life, and the length of
 thy days.</I> He gives life, preserves life, restores life, and 
 prolongs it by his power though it is a frail life, and by his patience 
 though it is a forfeited life: he sweetens life with his comforts, and 
 is the sovereign Lord of life; <I>in his hand our breath is.</I> 
 Therefore we are concerned to keep ourselves in his love; for it is 
 good having him our friend, and bad having him our enemy.

 (2.) Of their obligation to him for the promise of Canaan made to their
 fathers and ratified with an oath. And,

 (3.) Of their expectations from him in performance of that promise:
 "Love God, and serve him, that thou mayest dwell in that land of 
 promise which thou mayest be sure he can give, and uphold to thee who 
 is <I>thy life and the length of thy days.</I>" All these are arguments 
 to us to continue in love and obedience to the God of our mercies.</P>
