 In this chapter we have an account of three more of the plagues of
 Egypt. 
 
 I. Murrain among the cattle, which was fatal to them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.
 
 II. Boils upon man and beast,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 III. Hail, with thunder and lightning.

 1. Warning is given of this plague, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>.
 
 2. It is inflicted, to their great terror, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>.

 3. Pharaoh, in a fright, renews his treaty with Moses, but instantly
 breaks his word,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
 him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
 that they may serve me.
 &nbsp; 2 For if thou refuse to let <I>them</I> go, and wilt hold them
 still,
 &nbsp; 3 Behold, the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is upon thy cattle which <I>is</I> in
 the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon
 the oxen, and upon the sheep: <I>there shall be</I> a very grievous
 murrain.
 &nbsp; 4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
 cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all <I>that is</I> the
 children's of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 shall do this thing in the land.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
 of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died
 not one.
 &nbsp; 7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the
 cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was
 hardened, and he did not let the people go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Warning given of another plague, namely, the murrain of beasts. When 
 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, after he had seemed to relent under the 
 former plague, then Moses is sent to tell him there is another coming, 
 to try what that would do towards reviving the impressions of the 
 former plagues. Thus is the wrath of God revealed from heaven, both in 
 his word and in his works, <I>against all ungodliness and 
 unrighteousness of men.</I> 

 1. Moses puts Pharaoh in a very fair way to prevent it: <I>Let my 
 people go,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This was still the demand. God will have Israel released; Pharaoh 
 opposes it, and the trial is, <I>whose word shall stand.</I> See how 
 jealous God is for his people. When <I>the year of his redeemed has 
 come,</I> he will <I>give Egypt for their ransom;</I> that kingdom 
 shall be ruined, rather than Israel shall not be delivered. See how 
 reasonable God's demands are. Whatever he calls for, it is but <I>his 
 own:</I> They are my people, therefore let them go. 

 2. He describes the plague that should come, if he refused,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 <I>The hand of the Lord</I> immediately, without the stretching out of 
 Aaron's hand, <I>is upon the cattle,</I> many of which, some of all 
 kinds, should die by a sort of pestilence. This was greatly to the loss 
 of the owners: they had made Israel poor, and now God would make them 
 poor. Note, The hand of God is to be acknowledged even in the sickness 
 and death of cattle, or other damage sustained in them; for a 
 <I>sparrow falls not to the ground without our Father.</I> 

 3. As an evidence of the special hand of God in it, and of his 
 particular favour to his own people, he foretels that none of their 
 cattle should die, though they breathed in the same air and drank of 
 the same water with the Egyptians' cattle: <I>The Lord shall sever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, When God's judgments are abroad, though they may fall both on the 
 righteous and the wicked, yet God makes such a distinction that they 
 are not the same to the one that they are to the other. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7">Isa. xxvii. 7</A>.

 The providence of God is to be acknowledged with thankfulness in the 
 life of the cattle, for he preserveth man and beast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>.

 4. To make the warning the more remarkable, the time is fixed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>To-morrow</I> it shall be done. We know not what any day will bring 
 forth, and therefore we cannot say what we will do to-morrow, but it is 
 not so with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The plague itself inflicted. The cattle died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, The creature is made subject to vanity by the sin of man, being 
 liable, according to its capacity, both to serve his wickedness and to 
 share in his punishment, as in the universal deluge.  
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20,22">Rom. viii. 20, 22</A>.

 Pharaoh and the Egyptians sinned; but the <I>sheep, what had they 
 done?</I> Yet they are plagued. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:4">Jer. xii. 4</A>,

 For the <I>wickedness of the land, the beasts are consumed.</I> The
 Egyptians afterwards, and (some think) now, worshipped their cattle; it 
 was among them that the Israelites learned to make a god of a calf: in 
 this therefore the plague here spoken of meets with them. Note, What we 
 make an idol of it is just with God to remove from us, or embitter to 
 us. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1">Isa. xix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The distinction put between the cattle of the Egyptians and the 
 Israelites' cattle, according to the word of God: Not <I>one of the 
 cattle of the Israelites died,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Does God take care of oxen?  Yes, he does; his providence extends 
 itself to the meanest of his creatures. But it is written also for our 
 sakes, that, trusting in God, and making him our refuge, we may not be 
 <I>afraid of the pestilence that walketh in darkness,</I> no, not 
 though <I>thousands fall at our side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:6,7">Ps. xci. 6, 7</A>.

 Pharaoh sent to see if the cattle of the Israelites were infected, not
 to satisfy his conscience, but only to gratify his curiosity, or with 
 design, by way of reprisal, to repair his own losses out of their 
 stocks; and, having no good design in the enquiry, the report brought 
 to him made no impression upon him, but, on the contrary, his heart was 
 hardened.  Note, To those that are wilfully blind, even those methods 
 of conviction which are ordained to life prove a savour of death unto 
 death.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex9_9"> </A>

 <A NAME="Ex9_11"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ex9_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
 handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
 toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
 shall be a boil breaking forth <I>with</I> blains upon man, and upon
 beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before
 Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a
 boil breaking forth <I>with</I> blains upon man, and upon beast.
 &nbsp; 11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of
 the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
 Egyptians.
 &nbsp; 12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
 not unto them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had spoken unto Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, concerning the plague of boils and blains,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When they were not wrought upon by the death of their cattle, God 
 sent a plague that seized their own bodies, and touched them to the 
 quick. If less judgments do not do their work, God will send greater. 
 Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and go 
 forth to meet him in the way of his judgments, that his anger may be 
 turned away from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The signal by which this plague was summoned was the sprinkling of 
 warm ashes from the <I>furnace, towards heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>),

 which was to signify the heating of the air with such an infection as 
 should produce in the bodies of the Egyptians sore boils, which would 
 be both noisome and painful. Immediately upon the scattering of the 
 ashes, a scalding dew came down out of the air, which blistered 
 wherever it fell. Note, Sometimes God shows men their sin in their 
 punishment; they had oppressed Israel in the furnaces, and now the 
 ashes of the furnace are made as much a terror to them as ever their 
 task-masters had been to the Israelites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The plague itself was very grievous--a common eruption would be so,
 especially to the nice and delicate, but these eruptions were 
 inflammations, like Job's. This is afterwards called the <I>botch of 
 Egypt</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:27">Deut. xxviii. 27</A>),

 as if it were some new disease, never heard of before, and known ever
 after by that name, Note, Sores in the body are to be looked upon as 
 the punishments of sin, and to be hearkened to as calls to 
 repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The magicians themselves were struck with these boils, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 1. Thus they were punished, 

 (1.) For helping to harden Pharaoh's heart, as Elymas for seeking to
 <I>pervert the right ways of the Lord;</I> God will severely reckon 
 with those that strengthen the hands of the wicked in their wickedness. 
 
 (2.) For pretending to imitate the former plagues, and making
 themselves and Pharaoh sport with them. Those that would produce lice 
 shall, against their wills, produce boils. Note, It is ill jesting with 
 God's judgments, and more dangerous than playing with fire. <I>Be you 
 not mockers, lest your bands be made strong.</I> 

 2.  Thus they were shamed in the presence of their admirers. How weak 
 were their enchantments, which could not so much as secure themselves!  
 The devil can give no protection to those that are in confederacy with 
 him.  

 3.  Thus they were driven from the field. Their power was restrained 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:18"><I>ch.</I> viii. 18</A>),

 but they continued to confront Moses, and confirm Pharaoh in his
 unbelief, till now, at length, they were forced to retreat, and could 
 not stand before Moses, to which the apostle refers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:9">2 Tim. iii. 9</A>)

 when he says that their <I>folly was made manifest unto all
 men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Pharaoh continued obstinate, for now <I>the Lord hardened</I> his 
 heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Before, he had hardened his own heart, and resisted the grace of God; 
 and now God justly gave him up to his own heart's lusts, to a reprobate 
 mind, and strong delusions, permitting Satan to blind and harden him, 
 and ordering every thing, henceforward, so as to make him more and more 
 obstinate. Note, Wilful hardness is commonly punished with judicial 
 hardness. If men shut their eyes against the light, it is just with God 
 to close their eyes. Let us dread this as the sorest judgment a man can 
 be under on this side hell.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex9_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
 and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
 &nbsp; 14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine
 heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou
 mayest know that <I>there is</I> none like me in all the earth.
 &nbsp; 15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee
 and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 16 And in very deed for this <I>cause</I> have I raised thee up, for
 to show <I>in</I> thee my power; and that my name may be declared
 throughout all the earth.
 &nbsp; 17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou
 wilt not let them go?
 &nbsp; 18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
 very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
 foundation thereof even until now.
 &nbsp; 19 Send therefore now, <I>and</I> gather thy cattle, and all that
 thou hast in the field; <I>for upon</I> every man and beast which
 shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the
 hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
 &nbsp; 20 He that feared the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> among the servants of
 Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
 &nbsp; 21 And he that regarded not the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> left his
 servants and his cattle in the field.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general declaration of the wrath of God against Pharaoh for his 
 obstinacy. Though God has hardened his heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 yet Moses must repeat his applications to him; God suspends his grace 
 and yet demands obedience, to punish him for requiring bricks of the 
 children of Israel when he denied them straw. God would likewise show 
 forth a pattern of long-suffering, and how he waits to be gracious to a 
 <I>rebellious and gainsaying people.</I> Six times the demand had been
 made in vain, yet Moses must make it the seventh time: <I>Let my people 
 go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 A most dreadful message Moses is here ordered to deliver to him, 
 whether he will hear or whether he will forbear. 

 1. He must tell him that he is marked for ruin, that he now stands as 
 the butt at which God would shoot all the arrows of his wrath,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 "Now I will send <I>all my plagues.</I>" Now that no place is found for 
 repentance in Pharaoh, nothing can prevent his utter destruction, for 
 that only would have prevented it. Now that God begins to <I>harden his 
 heart,</I> his case is desperate. "I will send my plagues <I>upon thy 
 heart,</I> not only temporal plagues upon thy body, but spiritual 
 plagues upon thy soul." Note, God can send plagues upon thy soul." 
 Note, God can send plagues upon the heart, either by making it 
 senseless or by making it hopeless--and these are the worst plagues.
 Pharaoh must now expect no respite, no cessation of arms, but to be 
 followed with plague upon plague, till he is utterly consumed. Note, 
 When God judges he will overcome; none ever hardened his heart against 
 him and prospered. 

 2. He must tell him that he is to remain in history a standing monument 
 of the justice and power of God's wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>For this cause have I raised thee up</I> to the throne at this 
 time, and made thee to stand the shock of the plagues hitherto, to 
 <I>show in thee my power.</I>" Providence ordered it so that Moses 
 should have a man of such a fierce and stubborn spirit as he was to 
 deal with; and every thing was so managed in this transaction as to 
 make it a most signal and memorable instance of the power God has to 
 humble and bring down the proudest of his enemies. Every thing 
 concurred to signalize this, that God's name (that is, his 
 incontestable sovereignty, his irresistible power, and his inflexible 
 justice) might be declared throughout all the earth, not only to all 
 places, but through all ages while the earth remains. Note, God 
 sometimes raises up very bad men to honour and power, spares them long, 
 and suffers them to grow insufferably insolent, that he may be so much 
 the more glorified in their destruction at last. See how the
 neighbouring nations, at that time, improved the ruin of Pharaoh to the
 glory of God. Jethro said upon it, <I>Now know I that the Lord is
 greater than all gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 11</A>.

 The apostle illustrates the doctrine of God's sovereignty with this
 instance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:17">Rom. ix. 17</A>.

 To justify God in these resolutions, Moses is directed to ask him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people?</I> Pharaoh was a 
 great king; God's people were poor shepherds at the best, and now poor 
 slaves; and yet Pharaoh shall be ruined if he exalt himself against 
 them, for it is considered as exalting himself against God. This was 
 not the first time that God reproved kings for their sakes, and let 
 them know that he would not suffer his people to be trampled upon and 
 insulted, no, not by the most powerful of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular prediction of the plague of hail 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and a gracious advice to Pharaoh and his people to send for their 
 servants and cattle out of the field, that they might be sheltered from 
 the hail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, When God's justice threatens ruin his mercy, at the same time, 
 shows us a way of escape from it, so unwilling is he that any should 
 perish. See here what care God took, not only to distinguish between 
 Egyptians and Israelites, but between some Egyptians and others. If 
 Pharaoh will not yield, and so prevent the judgment itself, yet an 
 opportunity is given to those that have any dread of God and his word 
 to save themselves from sharing in the judgment. Note, Those that will 
 take warning may take shelter; and those that will not may thank 
 themselves if they fall by the overflowing scourge, and the hail which 
 will <I>sweep away the refuge of lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17">Isa. xxviii. 17</A>.

 See the different effect of this warning.

 1. <I>Some believed the things that were spoken,</I> and they feared,
 and housed their servants and cattle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20)</A>,

 like Noah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7">Heb. xi. 7</A>),

 and it was their wisdom. Even among the servants of Pharaoh there were
 some that trembled at God's word; and shall not the sons of Israel 
 dread it?  But, 

 2. Others believed not: though, whatever plague Moses had hitherto 
 foretold, the event exactly answered to the prediction; and though, if 
 they had had any reason to question this, it would have been no great 
 damage to them to have kept their cattle in the house for one day, and 
 so, supposing it a doubtful case, to have chosen the surer side; yet 
 they were so foolhardy as in defiance to the truth of Moses, and the 
 power of God (of both which they had already had experience enough, to 
 their cost), to leave their cattle in the field, Pharaoh himself, it is 
 probable, giving them an example of the presumption,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Note, Obstinate infidelity, which is deaf to the fairest warnings and 
 the wisest counsels, leaves the blood of those that perish upon their 
 own heads.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand
 toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt,
 upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
 throughout the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the
 ground; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
 grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt
 since it became a nation.
 &nbsp; 25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
 <I>was</I> in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
 herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
 &nbsp; 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel
 <I>were,</I> was there no hail.
 &nbsp; 27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
 unto them, I have sinned this time: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> righteous, and
 I and my people <I>are</I> wicked.
 &nbsp; 28 Intreat the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> (for <I>it is</I> enough) that there be no
 <I>more</I> mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
 shall stay no longer.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the
 city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; <I>and</I> the
 thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that
 thou mayest know how that the earth <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s.
 &nbsp; 30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not
 yet fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God.
 &nbsp; 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley
 <I>was</I> in the ear, and the flax <I>was</I> bolled.
 &nbsp; 32 But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they <I>were</I>
 not grown up.
 &nbsp; 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread
 abroad his hands unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and the thunders and hail ceased,
 and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
 thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart,
 he and his servants.
 &nbsp; 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
 the children of Israel go; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had spoken by Moses.

 The threatened plague of hail is here summoned by the powerful hand and 
 rod of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 and it obeys the summons, or rather the divine command; for <I>fire and 
 hail fulfil God's word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.

 And here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What desolations it made upon the earth. The thunder, and fire from 
 heaven (or lightning), made it both the more dreadful and the more 
 destroying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 Note, God makes the clouds, not only his store-houses whence he drops 
 fatness on his people, but his magazines whence, when he pleases, he 
 can draw out a most formidable train of artillery, with which to 
 destroy his enemies. He himself speaks of the <I>treasures of hail 
 which he hath reserved against the day of battle and war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>.

 Woeful havoc this hail made in the land of Egypt. It killed both men
 and cattle, and battered down, not only the herbs, but the trees,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The corn that was above ground was destroyed, and that only preserved 
 which as yet had not come up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 Note, God has many ways of <I>taking away the corn in the season 
 thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Hos. ii. 9</A>),

 either by a secret blasting, or a noisy hail.  In this plague the
 <I>hot thunderbolts,</I> as well as the hail, are said to destroy 
 <I>their flocks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:47,48">Ps. lxxviii. 47, 48</A>;

 and see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:32,33">Ps. cv. 32, 33</A>.

 Perhaps David alludes to this when, describing God's glorious
 appearances for the discomfiture of his enemies, he speaks of the
 hailstones and coals of fire he threw among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:12,13">Ps. xviii. 12, 13</A>.

 And there is a plan reference to it on the pouring out of the seventh
 vial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:21">Rev. xvi. 21</A>.

 Notice is here taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 of the land of Goshen's being preserved from receiving any damage by 
 this plague. God has the directing of the pregnant clouds, and causes 
 it to rain or hail on one city and not on another, either in mercy or 
 in judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a consternation it put Pharaoh in. See what effect it had upon 
 him, 
 
 1. He humbled himself to Moses in the language of a penitent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 No man could have spoken better. He owns himself on the wrong side in 
 his contest with the God of the Hebrews: "<I>I have sinned</I> in 
 standing it out so long." He owns the equity of God's proceedings 
 against him: <I>The Lord is righteous,</I> and must be justified when 
 he speaks, though he speak in thunder and lightning. He condemns 
 himself and his land: "<I>I and my people are wicked,</I> and deserve 
 what is brought upon us." He begs the prayers of Moses: "<I>Entreat the 
 Lord</I> for me, that this direful plague may be removed." And, 
 <I>lastly,</I> he promises to yield up his prisoners: <I>I will let you 
 go.</I> What could one desire more? And yet his heart was hardened all 
 this while. Note, The terror of the rod often extorts penitent 
 acknowledgments from those who have no penitent affections; under the 
 surprise and smart of affliction, they start up, and say that which is 
 pertinent enough, not because they are deeply affected, but because 
 they know that they should be and that <I>it is meet to be said.</I> 

 2.  Moses, hereupon, becomes an intercessor for him with God. Though he 
 had all the reason in the world to think that he would immediately 
 repent of his repentance, and told him so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 yet he promises to be this friend in the court of heaven. Note, Even 
 those whom we have little hopes of, yet we should continue to pray for, 
 and to admonish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:23">1 Sam. xii. 23</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) The place Moses chose for his intercession. He went <I>out of the
 city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 not only for privacy in his communion with God, but to show that he 
 durst venture abroad into the field, notwithstanding the hail and 
 lightning which kept Pharaoh and his servants withindoors, knowing that 
 every hail-stone had its direction from his God, who meant him no hurt. 
 Note, Peace with God makes men thunderproof, for thunder is the voice 
 of their Father. 

 (2.) The gesture: He <I>spread abroad his hands unto the Lord</I>--an
 outward expression of earnest desire and humble expectation. Those that 
 come to God for mercy must stand ready to receive it. 

 (3.) The end Moses aimed at in interceding for him: <I>That thou mayest
 know,</I> and be convinced, <I>that the earth is the Lord's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 that is, that God has a sovereign dominion over all the creatures, that 
 they all are ruled by him, and therefore that thou oughtest to be so. 
 See what various methods God uses to bring men to their proper senses. 
 Judgments are sent, judgments removed, and all for the same end, to 
 make men know that he Lord reigns. 
 
 (4.) The success of it.

 [1.] He prevailed with God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 But, 

 [2.] He could not prevail with Pharaoh: <I>He sinned yet more, and
 hardened his heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 The prayer of Moses opened and shut heaven, like Elias's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17,18">Jam. v. 17, 18</A>),

 and such is the power of God's two witnesses
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Rev. xi. 6</A>);

 yet neither Moses nor Elias, nor those two witnesses, could subdue the
 hard hearts of men. Pharaoh was frightened into a compliance by the 
 judgment, but, when it was over, his convictions vanished, and his fair 
 promises were forgotten.  Note, Little credit is to be given to 
 confessions upon the rack. Note also, Those that are not bettered by 
 judgments and mercies are commonly made worse.</P>
