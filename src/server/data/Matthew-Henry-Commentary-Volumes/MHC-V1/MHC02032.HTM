 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very lamentable interruption which the story of this chapter 
 gives to the record of the establishment of the church, and of religion 
 among the Jews. Things went on admirably well towards that happy 
 settlement: God had shown himself very favourable, and the people also 
 had seemed to be pretty tractable. Moses had now almost completed his 
 forty days upon the mount, and, we may suppose, was pleasing himself 
 with the thoughts of the very joyful welcome he should have to the camp 
 of Israel at his return, and the speedy setting up of the tabernacle 
 among them. But, behold, the measures are broken, the sin of Israel 
 turns away those good things from them, and puts a stop to the current 
 of God's favours; the sin that did the mischief (would you think it?) 
 was worshipping a golden calf. The marriage was ready to be solemnized 
 between God and Israel, but Israel plays the harlot, and so the match 
 is broken, and it will be no easy matter to piece it again. Here is, 

 I. The sin of Israel, and of Aaron particularly, in making the golden
 calf for a god

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 and worshipping it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>. 

 II. The notice which God gave of this to Moses, who was now in the
 mount with him,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 and the sentence of his wrath against them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>. 

 III. The intercession which Moses immediately made for them in the
 mount

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>), 

 and the prevalency of that intercession,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:14">ver. 14</A>. 

 IV. His coming down from the mount, when he became an eye-witness of
 their idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>), 

 in abhorrence of which, and as an expression of just indignation, he
 broke the tables

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:19">ver. 19</A>), 

 and burnt the golden calf,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:20">ver. 20</A>. 

 V. The examination of Aaron about it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>. 

 VI. Execution done upon the ring-leaders in the idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:25-29">ver. 25-29</A>. 

 VII. The further intercession Moses made for them, to turn away the
 wrath of God from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:30-32">ver. 30-32</A>),

 and a reprieve granted thereupon, reserving them for a further
 reckoning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:33-35">ver. 33</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out
 of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
 and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
 for <I>as for</I> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
 land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
 &nbsp; 2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings,
 which <I>are</I> in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
 daughters, and bring <I>them</I> unto me.
 &nbsp; 3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which <I>were</I>
 in their ears, and brought <I>them</I> unto Aaron.
 &nbsp; 4 And he received <I>them</I> at their hand, and fashioned it with a
 graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said,
 These <I>be</I> thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the
 land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5 And when Aaron saw <I>it,</I> he built an altar before it; and
 Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow <I>is</I> a feast to the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
 offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down
 to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 While Moses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, the people 
 had time to meditate upon what had been delivered, and prepare 
 themselves for what was further to be revealed, and forty days was 
 little enough for that work; but, instead of that, there were those 
 among them that were contriving how to break the laws they had already 
 received, and to anticipate those which they were in expectation of. On 
 the thirty-ninth day of the forty, the plot broke out of rebellion 
 against the Lord. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A tumultuous address which the people made to Aaron, who was 
 entrusted with the government in the absence of Moses: <I>Up, make us 
 gods, which shall go before us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See the ill effect of Moses's absence from them; if he had not had
 God's call both to go and stay, he would not have been altogether free 
 from blame. Those that have the charge of others, as magistrates, 
 ministers, and masters of families, ought not, without just cause, to 
 absent themselves from their charge, <I>lest Satan get advantage</I> 
 thereby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See the fury and violence of a multitude when they are influenced 
 and corrupted by such as lie in wait to deceive. Some few, it is 
 likely, were at first possessed with this humour, while many, who would 
 never have thought of it if they had not put it into their hearts, were 
 brought to follow their pernicious ways; and presently such a multitude 
 were carried down the stream that the few who abhorred the proposal 
 durst not so much as enter their protestation against it. <I>Behold how 
 great a matter a little fire kindles!</I> Now what was the matter with 
 this giddy multitude?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They were weary of waiting for the promised land. They thought 
 themselves detained too long at mount Sinai; though there they lay very 
 safe and very easy, well fed and well taught, yet they were impatient 
 to be going forward. They had a God that staid with them, and 
 manifested his presence with them by the cloud; but this would not 
 serve. They must have a god to go before them; they are for hastening 
 to the land <I>flowing with milk and honey,</I> and cannot stay to take 
 their religion along with them. Note, Those that would anticipate God's 
 counsels are commonly precipitate in their own. We must first wait for 
 God's law before we catch at his promises. He that believeth doth not 
 make haste, not more haste than good speed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were weary of waiting for the return of Moses. When he went 
 up into the mount, he had not told them (for God had not told him) how 
 long he must stay; and therefore, when he had outstayed their time, 
 though they were every way well provided for in his absence, some bad 
 people advanced I know not what surmises concerning his delay: <I>As 
 for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of Egypt, we wot not 
 what has become of him.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] How slightly they speak of his person--<I>this Moses.</I> Thus 
 ungrateful are they to Moses, who had shown such a tender concern for 
 them, and thus do they walk contrary to God. While God delights to put 
 honour upon him, they delight to put contempt upon him, and this to the 
 face of Aaron his brother, and now his viceroy. Note, The greatest 
 merits cannot secure men from the greatest indignities and affronts in 
 this ungrateful world. 

 [2.] How suspiciously they speak of his delay: <I>We wot not what has
 become of him.</I> They thought he was either consumed by the devouring 
 fire or starved for want to food, as if that God who kept and fed them, 
 who were so unworthy, would not take care for the protection and supply 
 of Moses his favourite. Some of them, who were willing to think well of 
 Moses, perhaps suggested that he was translated to heaven like Enoch; 
 while others that cared not how ill they thought of him insinuated that 
 he had deserted his undertaking, as unable to go on with it, and had 
 returned to his father-in-law to keep his flock. All these suggestions 
 were perfectly groundless and absurd, nothing could be more so; it was 
 easy to tell <I>what had become of him:</I> he was seen to go into the 
 cloud, and the cloud he went into was still seen by all Israel upon the 
 top of the mount; they had all the reason in the world to conclude that 
 he was safe there; if the Lord had been pleased to kill him, he would 
 not have shown him such favours as these. If he tarried long, it was 
 because God had a great deal to say to him, for their good; he resided 
 upon the mount as the ambassador, and he would certainly return as soon 
 as he had finished the business he went upon; and yet they make this 
 the colour for their wicked proposal: <I>We wot not what has become of 
 him.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Those that are resolved to think ill, when 
 they have ever so much reason to think well, commonly pretend that they 
 know not what to think. <I>Secondly,</I> Misinterpretations of our
 Redeemer's delays are the occasion of a great deal of wickedness. Our 
 Lord Jesus has gone up into the mount of glory, where he is appearing 
 in the presence of Gold for us, but out of our sight; the heavens must 
 contain him, must conceal him, that we may live by faith. There he has 
 been long; there he is yet. Hence unbelievers suggest that they know 
 not what has become of him; and ask, <I>Where is the promise of his 
 coming?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4">2 Pet. iii. 4</A>),

 as if, because he has not come yet, he would never come. The wicked
 servant emboldens himself in his impieties with this consideration, 
 <I>My Lord delays his coming. Thirdly,</I> Weariness in waiting betrays 
 us to a great many temptations. This began Saul's ruin; he staid for 
 Samuel to the last hour of the time appointed, but had not patience to 
 stay that hour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:8">1 Sam. xiii. 8</A>,

 &c.); so Israel here, if they could but have staid one day longer,
 would have seen what had become of Moses. <I>The Lord is a God of
 judgment,</I> and must be waited for till he comes waited for though he 
 tarry; and then we shall not lose our labour, for he that shall come 
 will come, and will not tarry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They were weary of waiting for a divine institution of religious 
 worship among them for that was the thing they were now in expectation 
 of. They were told that they must <I>serve God in this mountain,</I> 
 and fond enough they would be of the pomp and ceremony of it; but, 
 because that was not appointed them so soon as they wished, they would 
 set their own wits on work to devise signs of God's presence with them, 
 and would glory in them, and have a worship of their own invention, 
 probably such as they had seen among the Egyptians; for Stephen says 
 that when they said unto Aaron, <I>Make us gods,</I> they did, in 
 heart, <I>turn back into Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:39,40">Acts vii. 39, 40</A>.

 This was a very strange motion, <I>Up, make us gods.</I> If they knew
 not what had become of Moses, and thought him lost, it would have been 
 decent for them to have appointed a solemn mourning for him for certain 
 days; but see how soon so great a benefactor is forgotten. If they had 
 said, "Moses is lost, make us a governor," there would have been some 
 sense in it, though a great deal of ingratitude to the memory of Moses, 
 and contempt of Aaron and Hur who were left lords-justices in his 
 absence; but to say, <I>Moses is lost, make us a god,</I> was the 
 greatest absurdity imaginable. Was Moses their god? Had he ever 
 pretended to be so? Whatever had become of Moses, was it not evident, 
 beyond contradiction that God was still with them? And had they any 
 room to question his leading their camp who victualled it so well every 
 day? Could they have any other god that would provide so well for them
 as he had done, nay as he now did? And yet, <I>Make us gods, which 
 shall go before us! Gods!</I> How many would they have? Is not one 
 sufficient? <I>Make us gods!</I> and what good would gods of their own
 making do them? They must have such gods to go before them as could not 
 go themselves further than they were carried. So wretchedly besotted 
 and intoxicated are idolaters: they are <I>mad upon their idols,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:38">Jer. l. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the demand which Aaron makes of their jewels thereupon: 
 <I>Bring me your golden ear-rings,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We do not find that he said one word to discountenance their proposal;
 he did not reprove their insolence, did not reason with them to 
 convince them of the sin and folly of it, but seemed to approve the 
 motion, and showed himself not unwilling to humour them in it. One 
 would hope he designed, at first, only to make a jest of it, and, by 
 setting up a ridiculous image among them, to expose the motion, and 
 show them the folly of it. But, if so, it proved ill jesting with sin: 
 it is of dangerous consequence for the unwary fly to play about the 
 candle. Some charitably suppose that when Aaron told them to break off 
 their ear-rings, and bring them to him, he did it with design to crush 
 the proposal, believing that though their covetousness would have let 
 them <I>lavish gold out of the bag</I> to make an idol of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:6">Isa. xlvi. 6</A>),

 yet their pride would not have suffered them to part with the golden
 ear-rings. But it is not safe to try how far men's sinful lusts will 
 carry them in a sinful way, and what expense they will be at; it proved 
 here a dangerous experiment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the making of the golden calf,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 1. The people brought in their ear-rings to Aaron, whose demand of 
 them, instead of discouraging the motion, perhaps did rather gratify 
 their superstition, and beget in them a fancy that the gold taken from 
 their ears would be the most acceptable, and would make the most 
 valuable god. Let their readiness to part with their rings to make an 
 idol of shame us out of our niggardliness in the service of the true 
 God. Did they not draw back from the charge of their idolatry? And 
 shall we grudge the expenses of our religion, or starve so good a 
 cause? 

 2. Aaron melted down their rings, and, having a mould prepared for the 
 purpose, poured the melted gold into it, and then produced it in the 
 shape of an ox or calf, giving it some finishing strokes with a graving 
 tool. Some think that Aaron chose this figure, for a sign or token of 
 the divine presence, because he thought the head and horns of an ox a 
 proper emblem of the divine power, and yet, being so plain and common a 
 thing, he hoped the people would not be so sottish as to worship it. 
 But it is probable that they had learnt of the Egyptians thus to 
 represent the Deity, for it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:8">Ezek. xx. 8</A>),

 <I>They did not forsake the idols of Egypt,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:8"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8</A>),

 <I>Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt. Thus they changed
 their glory into the similitude of an ox</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:20">Ps. cvi. 20</A>),

 and proclaimed their own folly, beyond that of other idolaters, who
 worshipped the host of heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Having made the calf in Horeb, they <I>worshipped the graven 
 image,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:19">Ps. cvi. 19</A>.

 Aaron, seeing the people fond of their calf, was willing yet further to
 humour them, and he built an altar before it, and proclaimed a feast to 
 the honour of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 a feast of dedication. Yet he calls it <I>a feast to Jehovah;</I> for,
 brutish as they were, they did not imagine that this image was itself a 
 god, nor did they design to terminate their adoration in the image, but 
 they made it for a representation of the true God, whom they intended 
 to worship in and through this image; and yet this did not excuse them 
 from gross idolatry, any more than it will excuse the papists, whose 
 plea it is that they do not worship the image, but God by the image, so 
 making themselves just such idolaters as the worshippers of the golden 
 calf, whose feast was a feast to Jehovah, and proclaimed to be so, that 
 the most ignorant and unthinking might not mistake it. The people are 
 forward enough to celebrate this feast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They rose up early on the morrow,</I> to show how well pleased they
 were with the solemnity, and, according to the ancient rites of 
 worship, they offered sacrifice to this new-made deity, and then 
 feasted upon the sacrifice; thus having, at the expense of their 
 ear-rings, made their god, they endeavour, at the expense of their 
 beasts, to make this god propitious. Had they offered these sacrifices
 immediately to Jehovah, without the intervention of an image, they 
 might (for aught I know) have been accepted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24"><I>ch.</I> xx. 24</A>);

 but having set up an image before them as a symbol of God's presence,
 and so changed the truth of God into a lie, these sacrifices were an 
 abomination, nothing could be more so. When the idolatry of theirs is
 spoken of in the New Testament the account of their feast upon the 
 sacrifice is quoted and referred to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:7">1 Cor. x. 7</A>):

 <I>They sat down to eat and drink</I> of the remainder of what was
 sacrificed, and then <I>rose up to play,</I> to play the fool, to play 
 the wanton. Like god, like worship. They would not have made a calf 
 their god if they had not first made their belly their god; but, when 
 the god was a jest, no marvel that the service was sport. Being
 <I>vain in their imaginations,</I> they became vain in their worship, 
 so great was this vanity. Now,

 1. It was strange that any of the people, especially so great a number 
 of them, should do such a thing. Had they not, but the other day, in 
 this very place, heard the voice of the Lord God speaking to them out 
 of the midst of the fire, <I>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven 
 image?</I> Had they not heard the thunder, seen the lightnings, and 
 felt the earthquake, with the dreadful pomp of which this law was 
 given? Had they not been particularly cautioned not to make <I>gods of 
 gold?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:23"><I>ch.</I> xx. 23</A>.

 Nay, had they not themselves solemnly entered into covenant with God,
 and promised that all that which he had said unto them they <I>would 
 do, and would be obedient?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:7"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 7</A>.

 And yet, before they stirred from the place where this covenant had
 been solemnly ratified, and before the cloud was removed from the top 
 of mount Sinai, thus to break an express command, in defiance of an 
 express threatening that this <I>iniquity should be visited upon them 
 and their children</I>--what shall be think of it? It is a plain 
 indication that the law was no more able to sanctify than it was to 
 justify; by it is the knowledge of sin, but not the cure of it. This is 
 intimated in the emphasis laid upon the place where this sin was 
 committed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:19">Ps. cvi. 19</A>).

 <I>They made a calf in Horeb,</I> the very place where the law was
 given. It was otherwise with those that received the gospel; they 
 immediately <I>turned from idols;</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9">1 Thess. i. 9</A>.

 2. It was especially strange that Aaron should be so deeply implicated
 in this sin, that he should make the calf, and proclaim the feast! Is 
 this Aaron, the saint of the Lord, the brother of Moses his prophet, 
 that could <I>speak so well.</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:14"><I>ch.</I> iv. 14</A>),

 and yet speaks not one word against this idolatry? Is this he that had
 not only seen, but had been employed in summoning, the plagues of 
 Egypt, and the judgments, executed upon the gods of the Egyptians? 
 What! and yet himself copying out the abandoned idolatries of Egypt? 
 With what face could they say, <I>These are thy gods</I> that 
 <I>brought thee out of Egypt,</I> when they thus bring the idolatry of 
 Egypt (the worst thing there) along with them? Is this Aaron, who had 
 been with Moses in the mount

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:24,24:9"><I>ch.</I> xix. 24; xxiv. 9</A>),

 and knew that there was no manner of similitude seen there, by which
 they might make an image? Is this Aaron who was entrusted with the care 
 of the people in the absence of Moses? Is he aiding and abetting in
 this rebellion against the Lord? How was it possible that he should
 ever do so sinful a thing? Either he was strangely surprised into it,
 and did it when he was half asleep, or he was frightened into it by the 
 outrages of the rabble. The Jews have a tradition that his colleague 
 Hur opposing it the people fell upon him and stoned him (and therefore 
 we never read of him after) and that this frightened Aaron into a 
 compliance. And God left him to himself,

 [1.] To teach us what the best of men are when they are so left, that 
 we may <I>cease from man,</I> and that he who <I>thinks he stands may 
 take heed lest he fall.</I> 

 [2.] Aaron was, at this time, destined by the divine appointment to the 
 great office of the priesthood; though he knew it not, Moses in the 
 mount did. Now, lest he should be <I>lifted up, above measure,</I> with 
 the honours that were to be put upon him, a messenger of Satan was 
 suffered to prevail over him, that the remembrance thereof might keep 
 him humble all his days. He who had once shamed himself so far as to 
 build an altar to a golden calf must own himself altogether unworthy of 
 the honour of attending at the altar of God, and purely indebted to 
 free grace for it. Thus pride and boasting were for ever silenced, and 
 a good effect brought out of a bad cause. By this likewise it was
 shown that <I>the law made those priests who had infirmity, and needed 
 first to offer for their own sins.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 11 And Moses besought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God, and said, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, why
 doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast
 brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with
 a mighty hand?
 &nbsp; 12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
 did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
 consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
 wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
 &nbsp; 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
 thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
 multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that
 I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall
 inherit <I>it</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> repented of the evil which he thought to do
 unto his people.

 Here, 

 I. God acquaints Moses with what was doing in the camp while he was 
 absent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 He could have told him sooner, as soon as the first step was taken
 towards it, and have hastened him down to prevent it; but he suffered 
 it to come to this height, for wise and holy ends, and then sent him 
 down to punish it. Note, It is no reproach to the holiness of God that 
 he suffers sin to be committed, since he knows, not only how to 
 restrain it when he pleases, but how to make it serviceable to the 
 designs of his own glory. Observe what God here says to Moses 
 concerning this sin.

 1. That they had <I>corrupted themselves.</I> Sin is the corruption or
 depravation of the sinner, and it is a self-corruption; <I>every man is 
 tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lust.</I> 

 2. That they had <I>turned aside out of the way.</I> Sin is a deviation 
 from the way of our duty into a by-path. When they promised to do all
 that God should command them, they set out as fair as could be; but now 
 they missed their way, and turned aside.

 3. That they had turned aside quickly, quickly after the law was given
 them and they had promised to obey it, quickly after God had done such 
 great things for them and declared his kind intentions to do greater.
 <I>They soon forgot his works.</I> To fall into sin quickly after we 
 have renewed our covenants with God, or received special mercy from 
 him, is very provoking. 

 4. He tells him particularly what they had done: <I>They have made a
 calf, and worshipped it.</I> Note, Those sins which are concealed from 
 our governors are naked and open before God. He sees that which they
 cannot discover, nor is any of the wickedness in the world hidden from 
 him. We could not bear to see the thousandth part of that provocation 
 which God sees every day and yet keeps silence. 

 5. He seems to disown them, in saying to Moses, They are <I>thy people
 whom thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt;</I> as if he had 
 said, "I will not own any relation to them, or concern for them; let it 
 never be said that they are my people, or that I brought them out of 
 Egypt." Note, Those that corrupt themselves not only shame themselves, 
 but even make God himself ashamed of them and of his kindness to them. 
 
 6. He sends him down to them with all speed: <I>Go, get thee down.</I>
 He must break off even his communion with God to go and do his duty as 
 a magistrate among the people; so must Joshua, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:10"><I>ch.</I> vii. 10</A>.

 Every thing is beautiful in its season.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He expresses his displeasure against Israel for this sin, and the 
 determination of his justice to cut them off,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 1. He gives this people their true character: "<I>It is a stiff-necked
 people,</I> unapt to come under the yoke of the divine law, and 
 governed as it were by a spirit of contradiction, averse to all good 
 and prone to evil, obstinate against the methods employed for their 
 cure." Note, The righteous God sees, not only what we do, but what we 
 are, not only the actions of our lives, but the dispositions of our 
 spirits, and has an eye to them in all his proceedings. 

 2. He declares what was their just desert--that his wrath should <I>wax 
 hot against them,</I> so as to consume them at once, and <I>blot out 
 their name from under heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:14">Deut. ix. 14</A>);

 not only cast them out of covenant, but chase them out of the world.
 Note, Sin exposes us to the wrath of God; and that wrath, if it be not 
 allayed by divine mercy, will burn us up as stubble. It were just with 
 God to let the law have its course against sinners, and to cut them off 
 immediately in the very act of sin; and, if he should do so, it would 
 be neither loss nor dishonour to him.

 3. He holds out inducements to Moses not to intercede for them:
 <I>Therefore, let me alone.</I> What did Moses, or what could he do, to 
 hinder God from consuming them? When God resolves to abandon a people, 
 and the decree of ruin has gone forth, no intercession can prevent it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14,15:1">Ezek. xiv. 14; Jer. xv. 1</A>.

 But God would thus express the greatness of his just displeasure
 against them, after the manner of men, who would have none to intercede 
 for those they resolve to be severe with. Thus also he would put an 
 honour upon prayer, intimating that nothing but the intercession of 
 Moses could save them from ruin, that he might be a type of Christ, by 
 whose mediation alone God would <I>reconcile the world unto 
 himself.</I> That the intercession of Moses might appear the more 
 illustrious, God fairly offers him that, if he would not interpose in 
 this matter, he would <I>make of him a great nation,</I> that either, 
 in process of time, he would raise up a people out of his loins, or 
 that he would immediately, by some means or other, bring another great 
 nation under his government and conduct, so that he should be no loser 
 by their ruin. Had Moses been of a narrow selfish spirit, he would have 
 closed with this offer; but he prefers the salvation of Israel before 
 the advancement of his own family. Here was a man fit to be a 
 governor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Moses earnestly intercedes with God on their behalf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>):

 he besought the Lord his God. If God would not be called <I>the God of
 Israel,</I> yet he hoped he might address him as <I>his own God.</I> 
 What interest we have at the throne of grace we should improve for the 
 church of God, and for our friends. Now Moses is standing in the gap to 
 turn away the wrath of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23">Ps. cvi. 23</A>.

 He wisely took the hint which God gave him when he said, <I>Let me
 alone,</I> which, though it seemed to forbid his interceding, did 
 really encourage it, by showing what power the prayer of faith has with 
 God. In such a case, God <I>wonders if there be no intercessor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16">Isa. lix. 16</A>.

 Observe,

 1. His prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Turn from thy fierce wrath;</I> not as if he thought God was not
 justly angry, but he begs that he would not be so greatly angry as to 
 consume them. "Let mercy rejoice against judgment; <I>repent of this 
 evil;</I> change the sentence of destruction into that of correction."

 2. His pleas. He fills his mouth with arguments, not to move God, but
 to express his own faith and to excite his own fervency in prayer. He 
 urges,

 (1.) God's interest in them, the great things he had already done for
 them, and the vast expense of favours and miracles he had been at upon 
 them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God had said to Moses
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 They are <I>thy people, whom thou broughtest up out of Egypt;</I> but
 Moses humbly turns them back upon God again: "They are <I>thy 
 people,</I> thou art their Lord and owner; I am but their servant. 
 <I>Thou broughtest them forth out of Egypt;</I> I was but the 
 instrument in thy hand; that was done in order to their deliverance 
 which thou only couldest do." Though their being his people was a 
 reason why he should be angry with them for setting up another god, yet 
 it was a reason why he should not be so angry with them as to consume 
 them. Nothing is more natural than for a father to correct his son, but 
 nothing more unnatural than for a father to slay his son. And as the 
 relation is a good plea ("they are <I>thy people</I>"), so is the 
 experience they had had of his kindness to them: "Thou <I>broughtest 
 them out of Egypt,</I> though they were unworthy, and had there served 
 the gods of the Egyptians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15">Josh. xxiv. 15</A>.

 If thou didst that for them, notwithstanding their sins in Egypt, wilt
 thou undo it for their sins of the same nature in the wilderness?" 

 (2.) He pleads the concern of God's glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Wherefore should the Egyptians say, For mischief did he bring them
 out?</I> Israel is dear to Moses as his kindred, as his charge; but it 
 is the glory of God that he is most concerned for; this lies nearer his 
 heart than any thing else. If Israel could perish without any reproach 
 to God's name, Moses could persuade himself to sit down contented; but 
 he cannot bear to hear God reflected on, and therefore this he insists 
 upon, <I>Lord, what will the Egyptians say?</I> Their eyes, and the 
 eyes of all the neighbouring nations, were now upon Israel; from the 
 wondrous beginnings of that people, they raised their expectations of 
 something great in their latter end; but, if a people so strangely 
 saved should be suddenly ruined, what would the world say of it, 
 especially the Egyptians, who have such an implacable hatred both to 
 Israel and to the God of Israel? They would say, "God was either weak, 
 and could not, or fickle, and would not, complete the salvation he 
 began; he brought them forth to that mountain, not to sacrifice (as was 
 pretended), but to be sacrificed." They will not consider the 
 provocation given by Israel, to justify the proceeding, but will think 
 it cause enough for triumph that God and his people could not agree, 
 but that their God had done that which they (the Egyptians) wished to 
 see done. Note, The glorifying of God's name, as it ought to be our 
 first petition (it is so in the Lord's prayer), so it ought to be our 
 great plea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:9">Ps. lxxix. 9</A>,

 <I>Do not disgrace the throne of thy glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:21">Jer. xiv. 21</A>;

 and see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:8,9">Jer. xxxiii. 8, 9</A>.

 And, if we would with comfort plead this with God as a reason why he
 should not destroy us, we ought to plead it with ourselves as a reason 
 why we should not offend him: <I>What will the Egyptians say?</I> We 
 ought always to be careful that the name of God and his doctrine be not 
 blasphemed through us.

 (3.) He pleads God's promise to the patriarchs that he would multiply
 their seed, and give them the land of Canaan for an inheritance, and 
 this promise confirmed by an oath, an oath by himself, since he could 
 swear by no greater,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 God's promises are to be our pleas in prayer; for what he has promised
 he is able to perform, and the honour of this truth is engaged for the 
 performance of it. "Lord, if Israel be cut off, what will become of the 
 promise? Shall their unbelief make that of no effect? God forbid." Thus 
 we must take our encouragement in prayer from God only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God graciously abated the rigour of the sentence, and <I>repented 
 of the evil he thought to do</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 though he designed to punish them, yet he would not ruin them. See
 here,

 1. The power of prayer; God suffers himself to be prevailed with by the
 humble believing importunity of intercessors. 

 2. The compassion of God towards poor sinners, and how ready he is to
 forgive. Thus he has given other proofs besides his own oath that he 
 has no pleasure in the death of those that die; for he not only pardons 
 upon the repentance of sinners, but spares and reprieves upon the 
 intercession of others for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
 tables of the testimony <I>were</I> in his hand: the tables <I>were</I>
 written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
 <I>were</I> they written.
 &nbsp; 16 And the tables <I>were</I> the work of God, and the writing <I>was</I>
 the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
 &nbsp; 17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they
 shouted, he said unto Moses, <I>There is</I> a noise of war in the
 camp.
 &nbsp; 18 And he said, <I>It is</I> not the voice of <I>them that</I> shout for
 mastery, neither <I>is it</I> the voice of <I>them that</I> cry for being
 overcome: <I>but</I> the noise of <I>them that</I> sing do I hear.
 &nbsp; 19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
 that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
 hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
 beneath the mount.
 &nbsp; 20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt <I>it</I> in
 the fire, and ground <I>it</I> to powder, and strawed <I>it</I> upon the
 water, and made the children of Israel drink <I>of it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The favour of God to Moses, in trusting him with the two tables of 
 the testimony, which, though of common stone, were far more valuable 
 than all the precious stones that adorned the breast-plate of Aaron. 
 The topaz of Ethiopia could not equal them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 God himself, without the ministry either of man or angel (for aught
 that appears), wrote the ten commandments on these tables, <I>on both 
 their sides,</I> some on one table and some on the other, so that they 
 were folded together like a book, to be deposited in the ark.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The familiarity between Moses and Joshua. While Moses was in the 
 cloud, as in the presence-chamber, Joshua continued as near as he 
 might, in the anti-chamber (as it were), waiting till Moses came out, 
 that he might be ready to attend him; and though he was all alone for 
 forty days (fed, it is likely, with manna), yet he was not weary of 
 waiting, as the people were, but when Moses came down he came with him, 
 and not till then. And here we are told what constructions they put 
 upon the noise that they heard in the camp,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Though Moses had been so long in immediate converse with God, yet he
 did not disdain to talk freely with his servant Joshua. Those whom God 
 advances he preserves from being puffed up. Nor did he disdain to talk 
 of the affairs of the camp. Blessed Paul was not the less mindful of 
 the church on earth for having been in the third heavens, where he 
 heard unspeakable words. Joshua, who was a military man, and had the 
 command of the train-bands, feared there was <I>a noise of war in the 
 camp,</I> and then he would be missed; but Moses, having received 
 notice of it from God, better distinguished the sound, and was aware 
 that it was <I>the voice of those that sing.</I> It does not however 
 appear that he told Joshua what he knew of the occasion of their 
 singing; for we should not be forward to proclaim men's faults: they 
 will be known too soon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great and just displeasure of Moses against Israel, for their 
 idolatry. Knowing what to expect, he was presently aware of the golden 
 calf, and the sport the people made with it. He saw how merry they 
 could be in his absence, how soon he was forgotten among them, and what 
 little thought they had of him and his return. He might justly take 
 this ill, as an affront to himself, but this was the least part of the 
 grievance; he resented it as an offence to God, and the scandal of his 
 people. See what a change it is to come down from the mount of 
 communion with God to converse with a world that <I>lies in 
 wickedness.</I> In God we see nothing but what is pure and pleasant, in 
 the world nothing but pollution and provocation. Moses was the meekest 
 man on the earth, and yet when he saw <I>the calf, and the dancing,</I> 
 his <I>anger waxed hot.</I> Note, It is no breach of the law of 
 meekness to show our displeasure at the wickedness of the wicked. Those 
 are <I>angry and sin not</I> that are angry at sin only, not as against 
 themselves, but as against God. Ephesus is famous for patience, and yet 
 <I>cannot bear those that are evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2">Rev. ii. 2</A>.

 It becomes us to be cool in our own cause, but warm in God's. Moses
 showed himself very angry, both by breaking the tables and burning the 
 calf, that he might, by these expressions of strong indignation, awaken 
 the people to a sense of the greatness of the sin they had been guilty 
 of, which they would have been ready to make light of if he had not 
 thus shown his resentment, as one in earnest for their conviction.

 1. To convince them that they had forfeited and lost the favour of God,
 <I>he broke the tables,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Though God knew of their sin, before Moses came down, yet he did not
 order him to leave the tables behind him, but gave them to him to take 
 down in his hand, that the people might see how forward God was to take 
 them into covenant with himself, and that nothing but their own sin 
 prevented it; yet he put in into his heart, when the iniquity of 
 Ephraim was discovered (as the expression is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:1">Hos. vii. 1</A>),

 to break the tables before their eyes (as it is
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:17">Deut. ix. 17</A>),

 that the sight of it might the more affect them, and fill them with
 confusion, when they saw what blessings they had lost. Thus, they
 being guilty of so notorious an infraction of the treaty now on foot, 
 the writings were torn, even when they lay ready to be sealed. Note,
 The greatest sign of God's displeasure against any person or people is 
 his taking his law from them. The breaking of the tables is the 
 breaking of the <I>staff of beauty and band</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:10,14">Zech. xi. 10, 14</A>);

 it leaves a people unchurched and undone. Some think that Moses sinned
 in breaking the tables, and observe that, when men are angry, they are 
 in danger of breaking all God's commandments; but it rather seems to be 
 an act of justice than of passion, and we do not find that he himself 
 speaks of it afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:17">Deut. ix. 17</A>)

 with any regret.

 2. To convince them that they had betaken themselves to a God that
 could not help them, he <I>burnt the calf</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 melted it down, and then filed it to dust; and, that the powder to
 which it was reduced might be taken notice of throughout the camp, he 
 strewed it upon that water of which they all drank. That it might 
 appear that <I>an idol is nothing in the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4">1 Cor. viii. 4</A>);

 he reduced this to atoms, that it might be as near nothing as could be.
 To show that false gods cannot help their worshippers, he here showed 
 that this could not save itself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2">Isa. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.

 And to teach us that all the relics of idolatry ought to be abolished,
 and that the names of Baalim should be taken away, the very dust to 
 which it was ground was scattered. Filings of gold are precious (we 
 say), and therefore are carefully gathered up; but the filings of the 
 golden calf were odious, and must be scattered with detestation. Thus
 the idols of silver and gold must be cast to the moles and the bats 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20,30:22">Isa. ii. 20; xxx. 22</A>),

 and Ephraim shall say, <I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I>
 His mixing this powder with their drink signified to them that the 
 curse they had thereby brought upon themselves would mingle itself with 
 all their enjoyments, and embitter them; it would enter into their 
 bowels like water, and like oil into their bones. <I>The backslider in
 heart shall be filled with his own ways;</I> he shall drink as he 
 brews. These were indeed waters of Marah.</P>

 that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
 &nbsp; 22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
 knowest the people, that they <I>are set</I> on mischief.

 us: for <I>as for</I> this Moses, the man that brought us up out of
 the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
 &nbsp; 24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them
 break <I>it</I> off. So they gave <I>it</I> me: then I cast it into the
 fire, and there came out this calf.
 &nbsp; 25 And when Moses saw that the people <I>were</I> naked; (for Aaron
 had made them naked unto <I>their</I> shame among their enemies:)
 &nbsp; 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who <I>is</I>
 on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s side? <I>let him come</I> unto me. And all the sons of
 Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
 &nbsp; 27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel,
 Put every man his sword by his side, <I>and</I> go in and out from
 gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
 and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
 &nbsp; 28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
 and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
 &nbsp; 29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he
 may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses, having shown his just indignation against the sin of Israel by 
 breaking the tables and burning the calf, now proceeds to reckon with 
 the sinners and to call them to an account, herein acting as the 
 representative of God, who is not only a holy God, and hates sin, but a 
 just God, and is engaged in honour to punish it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:18">Isa. lix. 18</A>.

 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He begins with Aaron, as God began with Adam, because he was the 
 principal person, though not first in the transgression, but drawn into 
 it. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The just reproof Moses gives him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He does not order him to be cut-off, as those

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 that had been the ring-leaders in the sin. Note, A great deal of
 difference will be made between those that presumptuously rush into sin 
 and those that through infirmity are surprised into it, between those 
 that overtake the fault that flees from them and those that are 
 overtaken in the fault they flee from. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>.

 Not but that Aaron deserved to be cut off for this sin, and would have
 been so if Moses had not interceded particularly for him, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:20">Deut. ix. 20</A>.

 And having prevailed with God for him, to save him from ruin, he here
 expostulates with him, to bring him to repentance. He puts Aaron upon
 considering,

 (1.) What he had done to this people: <I>Thou hast brought so great a 
 sin upon them.</I> The sin of idolatry is a great sin, so great a sin 
 that the evil of it cannot be expressed; the people, as the first 
 movers, might be said to bring the sin upon Aaron; but he being a 
 magistrate, who should have suppressed it, and yet aiding and abetting 
 it, might truly be said to bring it upon them, because he hardened 
 their hearts and strengthened their hands in it. It is a shocking thing 
 for governors to humour people in their sins, and give countenance to 
 that to which they should be a terror. Observe, in general, Those who 
 bring sin upon others, either by drawing them into it or encouraging 
 them in it, do more mischief than they are aware of; we really hate 
 those whom we either bring or suffer sin upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>.

 Those that share in sin help to break their partners, and really ruin
 one another.

 (2.) What moved him to it: <I>What did this people unto thee?</I> He
 takes it for granted that it must needs be something more than ordinary 
 that prevailed with Aaron to do such a thing, thus insinuating an 
 excuse for him, because he knew that his heart was upright: "<I>What 
 did they?</I> Did they accost thee fairly, and wheedle thee into it; 
 and durst thou displease thy God, to please the people? Did they 
 overcome thee by importunity; and hadst thou so little resolution left 
 as to yield to the stream of a popular clamour? Did they threaten to 
 stone thee; and couldest not thou have opposed God's threatenings to 
 theirs, and frightened them worse than they could frighten thee?" Note, 
 We must never be drawn into sin by any thing that man can say or do to 
 us, for it will not justify us to say that we were so drawn in. Men can 
 but tempt us to sin; they cannot force us. Men can but frighten us; if 
 we do not comply, they cannot hurt us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The frivolous excuse Aaron makes for himself. We will hope that he 
 testified his repentance for the sin afterwards better than he did now; 
 for what he says here has little in it of the language of a penitent. 
 If a just man fall, he shall rise again, but perhaps not quickly. 

 (1.) He deprecates the anger of Moses only, whereas he should have 
 deprecated God's anger in the first place: <I>Let not the anger of my 
 Lord wax hot,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 (2.) He lays all the fault upon the people: <I>They are set on
 mischief, and they said, Make us gods.</I> It is natural to us to 
 endeavour thus to transfer our guilt; we have it in our kind, Adam and 
 Eve did so; sin is a brat that nobody is willing to own. Aaron was now 
 the chief magistrate and had power over the people, and yet pleads that 
 the people overpowered him; he that had authority to restrain them, yet 
 had so little resolution as to yield to them.

 (3.) It is well if he did not intend a reflection upon Moses, as
 accessory to the sin, by staying so long on the mount, in repeating, 
 without need, that invidious surmise of the people, <I>As for this 
 Moses, we know not what has become of him,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 (4.) He extenuates and conceals his own share in the sin, as if he had
 only bidden them <I>break off their gold</I> that they had about them, 
 intending to make a hasty assay for the present, and to try what he 
 could make of the gold that was next hand: and childishly insinuates 
 that when he cast the gold into the fire it came out, either by 
 accident or by the magic art of some of the mixed multitude (as the 
 Jewish writers dream), in this shape; but not a word of his graving
 and fashioning it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 But Moses relates to all ages what he did
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 though he himself here would not own it. Note, <I>He that covers his
 sin shall not prosper,</I> for sooner or later it will be discovered.
 Well, this was all Aaron had to say for himself; and he had better have 
 said nothing, for his defence did but aggravate his offence; and yet he 
 is not only spared, but preferred; as sin did abound, grace did much 
 more abound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people are next to be judged for this sin. The approach of 
 Moses soon spoiled their sport and turned their dancing into trembling. 
 Those that hectored Aaron into a compliance with them in their sin 
 durst not look Moses in the face, nor make the least opposition to the 
 severity which he thought fit to use both against the idol and against 
 the idolaters. Note, It is not impossible to make those sins which were 
 committed with daring presumption appear contemptible, when the 
 insolent perpetrators of them slink away overwhelmed in their own 
 confusion. <I>The king that sits upon the throne of judgment scatters 
 away all evil with his eyes.</I> Observe two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they were exposed to shame by their sin: <I>The people were 
 naked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 not so much because they had some of them lost their ear-rings (that
 was inconsiderable), but because they had lost their integrity, and lay 
 under the reproach of ingratitude to their best benefactor, and a 
 treacherous revolt from their rightful Lord. It was a shame to them, 
 and a perpetual blot, that they <I>changed their glory into the 
 similitude of an ox.</I> Other nations boasted that they were true to 
 their false gods; well may Israel blush for being false to the true 
 God. Thus were they <I>made naked,</I> stripped of their ornaments, and 
 exposed to contempt; stripped of their armour, and liable to insults. 
 Thus our first parents, when they had sinned, became <I>naked, to their 
 shame.</I> Note, Those that do dishonour to God really bring the 
 greatest dishonour upon themselves: so Israel here did, and Moses was 
 concerned to see it, though they themselves were not; he <I>saw that 
 they were naked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The course that Moses took to roll away this reproach, not by 
 concealing the sin, or putting any false colour upon it, but by 
 punishing it, and so bearing a public testimony against it. Whenever it 
 should be case in their teeth that they had <I>made a calf in 
 Horeb,</I> they might have this to say, in answer to those that 
 reproached them, that though it was true there were those that did so, 
 yet justice was executed upon them. The government disallowed the sin, 
 and suffered not the sinners to go unpunished. They did so, but they 
 paid dearly for it. Thus (said God) thou shalt <I>put the evil 
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:5">Deut. xiii. 5</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By whom vengeance was taken--by the children of Levi 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:26,28"><I>v.</I> 26, 28</A>);

 not by the immediate hand of God himself, as on Nadab and Abihu, but by
 the sword of man, to teach them that idolatry was an <I>iniquity to be 
 punished by the judge,</I> being a <I>denial of the God that is 
 above,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:28,De+13:9">Job xxxi. 28; Deut. xiii. 9</A>.

 It was to be done by the sword of their own brethren, that the
 execution of justice might redound more to the honour of the nation. 
 And, if they must fall now into the hands of man, better so than flee 
 before their enemies. The innocent must be culled out to be the 
 executioners of the guilty, that it might be the more effectual warning 
 to themselves, that they did not the like another time; and the putting 
 of them upon such an unpleasant service, and so much against the grain 
 as this must needs be, to kill their next neighbours, was a punishment 
 to them too for not appearing sooner to prevent the sin, and make head 
 against it. The Levites particularly were employed in doing this 
 execution; for, it should seem, there were more of them than of any 
 other tribe that had kept themselves free from the contagion, which was 
 the more laudable because Aaron, the head of their tribe, was so deeply 
 concerned in it. Now here we are told,

 [1.] How the Levites were called out to this service: <I>Moses stood in 
 the gate of the camp,</I> the place of judgment; there he <I>displayed 
 a banner,</I> as it were, because of the truth, to enlist soldiers for 
 God. He proclaimed, <I>Who is on the Lord's side?</I> The idolaters had 
 set up the golden calf for their standard, and now Moses set up his, in 
 opposition to them. Now <I>Moses clad himself with zeal</I> as with a 
 robe, and summoned all those to appear forthwith that were on God's 
 side, against the golden calf. He does not proclaim, as Jehu, "<I>Who 
 is on my side</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:32">2 Kings ix. 32</A>),

 to avenge the indignity done to me?" but, <I>Who is on the Lord's
 side?</I> It was God's cause that he espoused <I>against the 
 evil-doers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:16">Ps. xciv. 16</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> There are two great interests on foot in the world,
 with the one or the other of which all the children of men are siding. 
 The interest of sin and wickedness is the devil's interest, and all 
 wicked people side with that interest; the interest of truth and 
 holiness is God's interest, with which all godly people side; and it is 
 a case that will not admit a neutrality. <I>Secondly,</I> It concerns 
 us all to enquire whether we are on the Lord's side or not. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Those who are on his side are comparatively but few, 
 and sometimes seem fewer than really they are. <I>Fourthly,</I> God 
 does sometimes call out those that are on his side to appear for him, 
 as witnesses, as soldiers, as intercessors.

 [2.] How they were commissioned for this service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Slay every man his brother,</I> that is, "Slay all those that you
 know to have been active for the making and worshipping of the golden 
 calf, though they were your own nearest relations, or dearest friends." 
 The crime was committed publicly, the Levites saw who of their 
 acquaintance were concerned in it, and therefore needed no other 
 direction than their own knowledge whom to slay. And probably the 
 greatest part of those that were guilty were known, and known to be so, 
 by some or other of the Levites who were employed in the execution.
 Yet, it should seem, they were to slay those only whom they found 
 <I>abroad in the streets</I> of the camp; for it might be hoped that 
 those who had retired into their tents were ashamed of what they had 
 done, and were upon their knees, repenting. Those are marked for ruin 
 who persist in sin, and are not ashamed of the abominations they have 
 committed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:12">Jer. viii. 12</A>.

 But how durst the Levites encounter so great a body, who probably were
 much enraged by the burning of their calf? It is easy to account for 
 this; a sense of guilt disheartened the delinquents, and a divine 
 commission animated the executioners. And one thing that put life into 
 them was that Moses had said, <I>Consecrate yourselves to day to the 
 Lord, that he may bestow a blessing upon you,</I> thereby intimating to 
 them that they now stood fair for preferment and that, if they would 
 but signalize themselves upon this occasion, it would be construed into 
 such a consecration of themselves to God, and to his service, as would 
 put upon their tribe a perpetual honour. Those that consecrate 
 themselves to the Lord he will set apart for himself. Those that do the 
 duty shall have the dignity; and, if we do signal services for God, he 
 will bestow especial blessings upon us. There was a blessing designed
 for the tribe of Levi; now says Moses, "<I>Consecrate yourselves to the 
 Lord,</I> that you may qualify yourselves to receive the blessing." The 
 Levites were to assist in the offering of sacrifice to God; and now 
 they must begin with the offering of these sacrifices to the honour of 
 divine justice. Those that are to minister about holy things must be 
 not only sincere and serious, but warm and zealous, bold and 
 courageous, for God and godliness. Thus all Christians, but especially 
 ministers, must <I>forsake father and mother,</I> and prefer the 
 service of Christ and his interest far before their nearest and dearest 
 relations; for if we love our relations better than Christ we are not 
 <I>worthy of him.</I> See how this zeal of the Levites is applauded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) On whom vengeance is taken: <I>There fell of the people that day 
 about 3000 men,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Probably these were but few, in comparison with the many that were
 guilty; but these were the men that headed the rebellion, and were 
 therefore picked out, to be made examples of, for terror to all others. 
 Those that in the morning were shouting and dancing before night were 
 dying in their own blood; such a sudden change do the judgments of God 
 sometimes make with sinners that are secure and jovial in their sin, as 
 with Belshazzar by the hand-writing upon the wall. This is written for 
 warning to us.

 Moses, having executed justice upon the principal offenders, is here 
 dealing both with the people and with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With the people, to bring them to repentance,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When some were slain, lest the rest should imagine that, because 
 they were exempt from the capital punishment, they were therefore 
 looked upon as free from guilt, Moses here tells the survivors, <I>You 
 have sinned a great sin,</I> and therefore, though you have escaped 
 this time, <I>except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</I> 
 That they might not think lightly of the sin itself, he calls it <I>a 
 great sin;</I> and that they might not think themselves innocent, 
 because perhaps they were not all so deeply guilty as some of those 
 that were put to death, he tells them all, <I>You have sinned a great 
 sin.</I> The work of ministers is to show people their sins, and the 
 greatness of their sins. "<I>You have sinned,</I> and therefore you are 
 undone if your sins be not pardoned, for ever undone without a Saviour. 
 It is a great sin, and therefore calls for great sorrow, for it puts 
 you in great danger." To affect them with the greatness of their sin he 
 intimates to them what a difficult thing it would be to make up the 
 quarrel which God had with them for it. 

 (1.) It would not be done, unless he himself <I>went up unto the 
 Lord</I> on purpose, and gave as long and as solemn attendance as he 
 had done for the receiving of the law. And yet, 

 (2.) Even so it was but a peradventure that he should make atonement
 for them; the case was extremely hazardous. This should convince us of 
 the great evil there is in sin, that he who undertook to make atonement 
 found it no easy thing to do it; he must <I>go up to the Lord</I> with 
 his own blood to <I>make atonement.</I> The malignity of sin appears in 
 the price of pardons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet it was some encouragement to the people (when they were told 
 that they had <I>sinned a great sin</I>) to hear that Moses, who had so 
 great an interest in heaven and so true an affection for them, would 
 <I>go up unto the Lord to make atonement</I> for them. Consolation 
 should go along with conviction: first wound, and then heal; first show 
 people the greatness of their sin, and then make known to them the 
 atonement, and give them hopes of mercy. <I>Moses will go up unto the 
 Lord,</I> though it be but a <I>peradventure</I> that he should make 
 atonement. Christ, the great Mediator, went upon greater certainty than 
 this, for he had lain in the bosom of the Father, and perfectly knew 
 all his counsels. But to us poor supplicants it is encouragement enough 
 in prayer for particular mercies that <I>peradventure</I> we may obtain 
 them, though we have not an absolute promise. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:3">Zeph. ii. 3</A>,

 <I>It may be, you shall be hid.</I> In our prayers for others, we
 should be humbly earnest with God, though it is but a <I>peradventure 
 that God will give them repentance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25">2 Tim. ii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He intercedes with God for mercy. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How pathetic his address was. <I>Moses returned unto the Lord,</I> 
 not to receive further instructions about the tabernacle: there were no 
 more conferences now about that matter. Thus men's sins and follies 
 make work for their friends and ministers, unpleasant work, many times, 
 and give great interruptions to that work which they delight in. Moses 
 in this address expresses, 

 (1.) His great detestation of the people's sin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 He speaks as one overwhelmed with the horror of it: <I>Oh! this people
 have sinned a great sin.</I> God had first told him of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and now he tells God of it, by way of lamentation. He does not call
 them God's people, he knew they were unworthy to be called so; but this 
 people, this treacherous ungrateful people, they have made for 
 themselves gods of gold. It is a great sin indeed to make gold our god, 
 as those do that make it their hope, and set their heart on it. He does 
 not go about to excuse or extenuate the sin; but what he had said to 
 them by way of conviction he says to God by way of confession: <I>They 
 have sinned a great sin;</I> he came not to make apologies, but to make 
 atonement. "Lord, pardon the sin, <I>for it is great,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:11">Ps. xxv. 11</A>.

 (2.) His great desire of the people's welfare 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Yet now</I> it is not too great a sin for infinite mercy to pardon,
 and therefore <I>if thou wilt forgive their sin.</I> What then Moses?
 It is an abrupt expression, "<I>If thou wilt,</I> I desire no more; 
 <I>if thou wilt,</I> thou wilt be praised, I shall be pleased, and 
 abundantly recompensed for my intercession." It is an expression like 
 that of the dresser of the vineyard

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:9">Luke xiii. 9</A>),

 <I>If it bear fruit;</I> or, <I>If thou wilt forgive,</I> is as much
 as, "O that thou wouldest forgive!" as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:42">Luke xix. 42</A>,

 <I>If thou hadst known</I> is, <I>O that thou hadst known.</I> "But
 <I>if not,</I> if the decree has gone forth, and there is no remedy, 
 but they must be ruined; if this punishment which has already been 
 inflicted on many is not sufficient 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:6">2 Cor. ii. 6</A>),

 but they must all be cut off, <I>blot me, I pray thee, out of the book
 which thou hast written;</I>" that is, "If they must be cut off, let me 
 be cut off with them, and cut short of Canaan; if all Israel must 
 perish, I am content to perish with them; let not the land of promise 
 be mine by survivorship." This expression may be illustrated from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:9">Ezek. xiii. 9</A>,

 where this is threatened against the false prophets, <I>They shall not
 be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they 
 enter into the land of Israel.</I> God had told Moses that, if he would 
 not interpose he would make of him a <I>great nation,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 "No," says Moses, "I am so far from desiring to see my name and family
 built up on the ruins of Israel, that I will choose rather to sink with 
 them. If I cannot prevent their destruction, let me not see it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:15">Num. xi. 15</A>);

 let me not be <I>written among the living</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:3">Isa. iv. 3</A>),

 nor among those that are marked for preservation; even let me die in
 the last ditch." Thus he expresses his tender affection for the people, 
 and is a type of the good Shepherd, that <I>lays down his life for the 
 sheep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11">John x. 11</A>),

 who was to be <I>cut off from the land of the living for the
 transgression of my people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:8,Da+9:26">Isa. liii. 8; Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 He is also an example of public-spiritedness to all, especially to
 those in public stations. All private interests must be made 
 subordinate to the good and welfare of communities. It is no great 
 matter what becomes of us and our families in this world, so that it go 
 well with the church of God, and there be peace upon Israel. Moses
 thus importunes for a pardon, and wrestles with God, not prescribing to 
 him ("If thou wilt not forgive, thou art either unjust or unkind"); no, 
 he is far from that; but, "If not, let me die with the Israelites, and 
 the will of the Lord be done."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe how prevalent his address was. God would not take him at his 
 word; no, he will not blot any out of his book but those that by their 
 wilful disobedience have forfeited the honour of being enrolled in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 the soul that sins shall die, and not the innocent for the guilty. This
 was also an intimation of mercy to the people, that they should not all 
 be destroyed in a body, but those only that had a hand in the sin. Thus 
 Moses gets ground by degrees. God would not at first give him full 
 assurances of his being reconciled to them, lest, if the comfort of a 
 pardon were too easily obtained, they should be emboldened to do the 
 like again, and should not be made sensible enough of the evil of the 
 sin. Comforts are suspended that convictions may be the deeper 
 impressed: also God would hereby exercise the faith and zeal of Moses, 
 their great intercessor. Further, in answer to the address of Moses,

 (1.) God promises, notwithstanding this, to go on with his kind
 intention of giving them the land of Canaan, the land he had <I>spoken 
 to them of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Therefore he sends Moses back to them to lead them, though they were
 unworthy of him, and promises that his angel should go before them, 
 some created angel that was employed in the common services of the 
 kingdom of providence, which intimated that they were not to expect any 
 thing for the future to be done for them out of the common road of 
 providence, not any thing extraordinary. Moses afterwards obtained a 
 promise of God's special presence with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:14,17"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 14, 17</A>);

 but at present this was all he could prevail for.

 (2.) Yet he threatens to remember this sin against them when hereafter
 he should see cause to punish them for other sins: "<I>When I visit, I 
 will visit</I> for this among the rest. Next time I take the rod in
 hand, they shall have one stripe the more for this." The Jews have a 
 saying, grounded on this, that henceforward no judgment fell upon 
 Israel but there was in it an ounce of the powder of the golden calf. I 
 see no ground in scripture for the opinion some are of, that God would 
 not have burdened them with such a multitude of sacrifices and other 
 ceremonial institutions if they had not provoked him by worshipping the 
 golden calf. On the contrary, Stephen says that when they <I>made a 
 calf, and offered sacrifice to the idol, God turned, and gave them up 
 to worship the host of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:41,42">Acts vii. 41, 42</A>);

 so that the strange addictedness of that people to the sin of idolatry
 was a just judgment upon them for making and worshipping the golden 
 calf, and a judgment they were never quite freed from till the 
 captivity of Babylon. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23-25">Rom. i. 23-25</A>.

 Note, Many that are not immediately cut off in their sins are reserved
 for a further day of reckoning: vengeance is slow, but sure. For the 
 present, <I>the Lord plagued the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 probably by the pestilence, or some other infectious disease, which was
 a messenger of God's wrath, and an earnest of worse. Aaron made the 
 calf, and yet it is said the people made it, because they worshipped 
 it. <I>Deos qui rogat, ille facit--He who asks for gods makes them.</I> 
 Aaron was not plagued, but the people; for his was a sin of infirmity, 
 theirs a presumptuous sin, between which there is a great difference, 
 not always discernable to us, but evident to God, whose judgment 
 therefore, we are sure, is according to truth. Thus Moses prevailed for 
 a reprieve and a mitigation of the punishment, but could not wholly 
 turn away the wrath of God. This (some think) bespeaks the inability of 
 the law of Moses to reconcile men to God and to perfect our peace with 
 him, which was reserved for Christ to do, in whom alone it is that God 
 so pardons sin as to <I>remember it no more.</I></P>
