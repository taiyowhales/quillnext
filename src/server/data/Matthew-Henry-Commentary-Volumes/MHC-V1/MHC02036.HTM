 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
 man, in whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> put wisdom and understanding to know how to
 work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
 according to all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded.
 &nbsp; 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
 man, in whose heart the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had put wisdom, <I>even</I> every one
 whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
 &nbsp; 3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
 children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the
 sanctuary, to make it <I>withal.</I> And they brought yet unto him
 free offerings every morning.
 &nbsp; 4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
 sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
 &nbsp; 5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
 than enough for the service of the work, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 to make.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
 proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman
 make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the
 people were restrained from bringing.
 &nbsp; 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to
 make it, and too much.

 I. The workmen set in without delay. Then they wrought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 When God had qualified them for the work, then they applied themselves 
 to it.  Note, The talents we are entrusted with must not be laid up, 
 but laid out; not hid in a napkin, but traded with.  What have we all 
 our gifts for, but to do good with them? They began when Moses called 
 them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Even those whom God has qualified for, and inclined to, the service of
 the tabernacle, yet must wait for a regular call to it, either 
 extraordinary, as that of prophets and apostles, or ordinary, as that 
 of pastors and teachers. And observe who they were that Moses called: 
 Those <I>in whose heart God had put wisdom</I> for this purpose, beyond 
 their natural capacity, and <I>whose heart stirred them up to come to 
 the work</I> in good earnest. Note, Those are to be called to the 
 building of the gospel tabernacle whom God has by his grace made in 
 some measure fit for the work and free to engage in it.  Ability and 
 willingness (with resolution) are the two things to be regarded in the 
 call of ministers. Has God given them not only knowledge, but wisdom?  
 (for those that would win souls must be wise, and have their hearts 
 stirred up to come to the work, and not to the honour only; to do it, 
 and not to talk of it only), let them come to it with full purpose of 
 heart to go through with it. The materials which the people had 
 contributed were delivered by Moses to the workmen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They could not create a tabernacle, that is, make it out of nothing,
 nor work, unless they had something to work upon; the people therefore 
 brought the materials and Moses put them into their hands.  Precious 
 souls are the materials of the gospel tabernacle; they are <I>built up 
 a spiritual house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 To this end they are to offer themselves a free-will offering to the
 Lord, for his service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>),

 and they are then committed to the care of his ministers, as builders,
 to be framed and wrought upon by their edification and increase in 
 holiness, till they all come, like the curtains of the tabernacle, 
 <I>in the unity of the faith, to be a holy temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21,22,4:12,13">Eph. ii. 21, 22; iv. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The contributions restrained. The people continued to bring <I>free 
 offerings every morning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, We should always make it our morning's work to bring our 
 offerings unto the Lord; even the spiritual offerings of prayer and 
 praise, and a broken heart surrendered entirely to God. This is that 
 which the duty of every day requires. God's compassions are new every 
 morning, and so must our duty to him be.  Probably there were some that 
 were backward at first to bring their offering, but their neighbours' 
 forwardness stirred them up and shamed them. The zeal of some provoked 
 many. There are those who will be content to follow who yet do not care 
 for leading in a good work. It is best to be forward, but better late 
 than never. Or perhaps some who had offered at first, having pleasure 
 in reflecting upon it, offered more; so far were they from grudging 
 what they had contributed, that they doubled their contribution. Thus, 
 in charity, <I>give a portion to seven, and also to eight;</I> having 
 given much, give more. Now observe,

 1. The honesty of the workmen. When they had cut out their work, and 
 found how their stuff held out, and that the people were still forward 
 to bring in more, they went in a body to Moses to tell him that there 
 needed no more contributions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Had they sought their own things, they had now a fair opportunity of 
 enriching themselves by the people's gifts; for they might have made up 
 their work, and converted the overplus to their own use, as perquisites 
 of their place.  But they were men of integrity, that scorned to do so 
 mean a thing as to sponge upon the people, and enrich themselves with 
 that which was offered to the Lord. Those are the greatest cheats that 
 cheat the public. If to murder many is worse than to murder one, by the 
 same rule to defraud communities, and to rob the church or state, is a 
 much greater crime than to pick the pocket of a single person. But 
 these workmen were not only ready to account for all they received, but 
 were not willing to receive more than they had occasion for, lest they 
 should come either into the temptation or under the suspicion of taking 
 it to themselves.  These were men that knew when they had enough.

 2. The liberality of the people. Though they saw what an abundance was 
 contributed, yet they continued to offer, till they were forbidden by 
 proclamation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 A rare instance! Most need a spur to quicken their charity; few need a 
 bridle to check it, yet these did. Had Moses aimed to enrich himself, 
 he might have suffered them still to bring in their offerings; and when 
 the work was finished might have taken the remainder to himself: but he 
 also preferred the public before his own private interest, and was 
 therein a good example to all in public trusts. It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:5"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>The people were restrained from bringing;</I> they looked upon it as
 a restraint upon them not to be allowed to do more for the tabernacle; 
 such was the zeal of those people, who gave <I>to their power, yea, and 
 beyond their power, praying</I> the collectors <I>with much entreaty to 
 receive the gift,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:3,4">2 Cor. viii. 3, 4</A>.

 These were the fruits of a first love; in these last-days charity has
 grown too cold for us to expect such things from it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work
 of the tabernacle made ten curtains <I>of</I> fine twined linen, and
 blue, and purple, and scarlet: <I>with</I> cherubims of cunning work
 made he them.
 &nbsp; 9 The length of one curtain <I>was</I> twenty and eight cubits, and
 the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains <I>were</I> all
 of one size.
 &nbsp; 10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and <I>the
 other</I> five curtains he coupled one unto another.
 &nbsp; 11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from
 the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
 side of <I>another</I> curtain, in the coupling of the second.
 &nbsp; 12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he
 in the edge of the curtain which <I>was</I> in the coupling of the
 second: the loops held one <I>curtain</I> to another.
 &nbsp; 13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains
 one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first work they set about was the framing of the house, which must 
 be done before the furniture of it was prepared. This house was not 
 made of timber or stone, but of curtains curiously embroidered and 
 coupled together. This served to typify the state of the church in this 
 world, the palace of God's kingdom among men. 

 1. Though it is upon the earth, yet its foundation is not in the earth, 
 as that of a house is; no, Christ's kingdom is not of this world, nor 
 founded in it. 

 2. It is mean and mutable, and in a militant state; shepherds dwelt in 
 tents, and God is the Shepherd of Israel; soldiers dwelt in tents, and 
 the Lord is a man of war, and his church marches through an enemy's 
 country, and must fight its way. The kings of the earth enclose 
 themselves in cedar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15">Jer. xxii. 15</A>),

 but the ark of God was lodged in curtains only.

 3. Yet there is a beauty in holiness; the curtains were embroidered, so 
 is the church adorned with the gifts and graces of the Spirit, that 
 <I>raiment of needle-work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:14">Ps. xlv. 14</A>.

 4. The several societies of believers are united in one, and, as here, 
 all <I>become one tabernacle; for there is one Lord, one faith, and one 
 baptism.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And he made curtains <I>of</I> goats' <I>hair</I> for the tent over
 the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
 &nbsp; 15 The length of one curtain <I>was</I> thirty cubits, and four
 cubits <I>was</I> the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains
 <I>were</I> of one size.
 &nbsp; 16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
 by themselves.
 &nbsp; 17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the
 curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of
 the curtain which coupleth the second.
 &nbsp; 18 And he made fifty taches <I>of</I> brass to couple the tent
 together, that it might be one.
 &nbsp; 19 And he made a covering for the tent <I>of</I> rams' skins dyed
 red, and a covering <I>of</I> badgers' skins above <I>that.</I>
 &nbsp; 20 And he made boards for the tabernacle <I>of</I> shittim wood,
 standing up.
 &nbsp; 21 The length of a board <I>was</I> ten cubits, and the breadth of a
 board one cubit and a half.
 &nbsp; 22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
 thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
 south side southward:
 &nbsp; 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
 two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets
 under another board for his two tenons.
 &nbsp; 25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, <I>which is</I> toward
 the north corner, he made twenty boards,
 &nbsp; 26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
 board, and two sockets under another board.
 &nbsp; 27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
 boards.
 &nbsp; 28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
 the two sides.
 &nbsp; 29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
 head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
 the corners.
 &nbsp; 30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets <I>were</I>
 sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
 &nbsp; 31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
 one side of the tabernacle,
 &nbsp; 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
 tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
 the sides westward.
 &nbsp; 33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
 the one end to the other.
 &nbsp; 34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings
 <I>of</I> gold <I>to be</I> places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
 gold.

 Here, 

 1. The shelter and special protection that the church is under are 
 signified by the curtains of hair-cloth, which were spread over the 
 tabernacle, and the covering of rams' skins and badgers' skins over 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:14-19"><I>v.</I> 14-19</A>.

 God has provided for his people a <I>shadow from the heat, and a covert 
 from storm and rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:6">Isa. iv. 6</A>.

 They are armed against all weathers; the sun and the moon shall not
 smite them: and they are protected from the storms of divine wrath, 
 that hail which will <I>sweep away the refuge of lies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17">Isa. xxviii. 17</A>.

 Those that dwell in God's house shall find, be the tempest ever so
 violent, or the dropping ever so continual, it does not rain in.

 2. The strength and stability of the church, though it is but a 
 tabernacle, are signified by the boards and bars with which the 
 curtains were borne up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:20-34"><I>v.</I> 20-34</A>.

 The boards were coupled together and joined by the bars which shot 
 through them; for the union of the church, and the hearty agreement of 
 those that are its stays and supporters, contribute abundantly to its 
 strength and establishment.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>35 And he made a vail <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
 fine twined linen: <I>with</I> cherubims made he it of cunning work.
 &nbsp; 36 And he made thereunto four pillars <I>of</I> shittim <I>wood,</I> and
 overlaid them with gold: their hooks <I>were of</I> gold; and he cast
 for them four sockets of silver.
 &nbsp; 37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door <I>of</I> blue,
 and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;
 &nbsp; 38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
 their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
 sockets <I>were of</I> brass.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the building of a house there is a great deal of work about the 
 doors and partitions. In the tabernacle these were answerable to the 
 rest of the fabric; there were curtains for doors, and veils for 
 partitions. 

 1. There was a veil made for a partition between the holy place, and 
 the most holy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 This signified the darkness and distance of that dispensation, compared 
 with the New Testament, which shows us the glory of God more clearly 
 and invites us to draw near to it; and the darkness and distance of our 
 present state, in comparison with heaven, where we shall be <I>ever 
 with the Lord</I> and <I>see him as he is.</I>

 2. There was a veil made for the door of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 At this door the people assembled, though forbidden to enter; for, 
 while we are in this present state, we must get as near to God as we 
 can.</P>
