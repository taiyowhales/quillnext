 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And this <I>is</I> the thing that thou shalt do unto them to
 hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
 young bullock, and two rams without blemish,
 &nbsp; 2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
 and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: <I>of</I> wheaten flour shalt
 thou make them.
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in
 the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
 &nbsp; 4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.
 &nbsp; 5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the
 coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the
 breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:
 &nbsp; 6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
 crown upon the mitre.
 &nbsp; 7 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour <I>it</I> upon
 his head, and anoint him.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.
 &nbsp; 9 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons,
 and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
 theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron
 and his sons.
 &nbsp; 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put
 their hands upon the head of the bullock.
 &nbsp; 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>by</I> the
 door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put
 <I>it</I> upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all
 the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
 &nbsp; 13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards,
 and the caul <I>that is</I> above the liver, and the two kidneys, and
 the fat that <I>is</I> upon them, and burn <I>them</I> upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
 shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it <I>is</I> a sin
 offering.
 &nbsp; 15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall
 put their hands upon the head of the ram.
 &nbsp; 16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
 and sprinkle <I>it</I> round about upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards
 of him, and his legs, and put <I>them</I> unto his pieces, and unto
 his head.
 &nbsp; 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it <I>is</I> a
 burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: it <I>is</I> a sweet savour, an offering
 made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
 shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
 &nbsp; 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
 <I>it</I> upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
 the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
 hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
 the blood upon the altar round about.
 &nbsp; 21 And thou shalt take of the blood that <I>is</I> upon the altar,
 and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle <I>it</I> upon Aaron, and upon
 his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his
 sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and
 his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
 &nbsp; 22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and
 the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul <I>above</I> the
 liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that <I>is</I> upon them, and
 the right shoulder; for it <I>is</I> a ram of consecration:
 &nbsp; 23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
 wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that <I>is</I> before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the
 hands of his sons; and shalt wave them <I>for</I> a wave offering
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn <I>them</I>
 upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: it <I>is</I> an offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
 consecration, and wave it <I>for</I> a wave offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 and it shall be thy part.
 &nbsp; 27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
 the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is
 heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, <I>even</I> of <I>that</I> which
 <I>is</I> for Aaron, and of <I>that</I> which is for his sons:
 &nbsp; 28 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
 from the children of Israel: for it <I>is</I> an heave offering: and
 it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the
 sacrifice of their peace offerings, <I>even</I> their heave offering
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
 to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
 &nbsp; 30 <I>And</I> that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
 seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
 congregation to minister in the holy <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
 his flesh in the holy place.
 &nbsp; 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and
 the bread that <I>is</I> in the basket, <I>by</I> the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
 made, to consecrate <I>and</I> to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
 not eat <I>thereof,</I> because they <I>are</I> holy.
 &nbsp; 34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
 bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
 remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it <I>is</I> holy.
 &nbsp; 35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons,
 according to all <I>things</I> which I have commanded thee: seven days
 shalt thou consecrate them.
 &nbsp; 36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock <I>for</I> a sin
 offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when
 thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
 sanctify it.
 &nbsp; 37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
 sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
 toucheth the altar shall be holy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The law concerning the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the 
 priest's office, which was to be done with a great deal of ceremony and 
 solemnity, that they themselves might be duly affected with the 
 greatness of the work to which they were called, and that the people 
 also might learn to magnify the office and none might dare to invade 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The ceremonies wherewith it was to be done were very fully and 
 particularly appointed, because nothing of this kind had been done 
 before, and because it was to be a statute for ever that the high 
 priest should be thus inaugurated. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The work to be done was the consecrating of the persons whom God 
 had chosen to be priests, by which they devoted and gave up themselves 
 to the service of God and God declared his acceptance of them; and the 
 people were made to know that they <I>glorified not themselves</I> to 
 be made priests, but were <I>called of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4,5">Heb. v. 4, 5</A>.

 They were thus distinguished from common men, sequestered from common
 services, and set apart for God and an immediate attendance on him. 
 Note, All that are to be employed for God are to be sanctified to him. 
 The person must first be accepted, and then the performance. The Hebrew 
 phrase for consecrating <I>is filling the hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt fill the hand of Aaron and his sons,</I> and the <I>ram 
 of consecration</I> is the <I>ram of fillings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:22,26"><I>v.</I> 22, 26</A>.

 The consecrating of them was the perfecting of them; Christ is said to 
 be <I>perfect</I> or <I>consecrated for evermore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:28">Heb. vii. 28</A>.

 Probably the phrase here is borrowed from the putting of the sacrifice 
 into their hand, to be waved before the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 But it intimates,
 
 [1.] That ministers have their hands full; they have no time to trifle, 
 so great, so copious, so constant is their work. 

 [2.] That they must have their hands filled. Of necessity <I>they must
 have something to offer,</I> and they cannot find it in themselves, it 
 must be given them from above. They cannot fill the people's hearts 
 unless God fill their hands; to him therefore they must go, and 
 <I>receive from his fulness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The person to do it was Moses, by God's appointment. Though he was 
 <I>ordained for men,</I> yet the people were not to consecrate him; 
 Moses the <I>servant of the Lord,</I> and his agent herein, must do it. 
 By God's special appointment he now did the priest's work, and 
 therefore that which was the priest's part of the sacrifice was here 
 ordered to be his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The place was at the <I>door of the tabernacle of meeting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God was pleased to dwell in the tabernacle, the people attending in the 
 courts, so that the door between the court and the tabernacle was the 
 fittest place for those to be consecrated in who were to mediate 
 between God and man, and to stand between both, and <I>lay their 
 hands</I> (as it were) <I>upon both.</I> They were consecrated at the 
 door, for they were to be door-keepers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It was done with many ceremonies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They were to be washed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 signifying that those must be clean who <I>bear the vessels of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:11">Isa. lii. 11</A>.

 Those that would <I>perfect holiness</I> must <I>cleanse themselves
 from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1,Isa+1:16-18">2 Cor. vii. 1; Isa. i. 16-18</A>.

 They were now washed all over; but afterwards, when they went in to 
 minister, they washed only their hands and feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:19"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 19</A>);
 
 for <I>he that is washed needs</I> no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10">John xiii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They were to be clothed with the holy garments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:5,6,8,9"><I>v.</I> 5, 6, 8, 9</A>),

 to signify that it was not sufficient for them to put away the 
 pollutions of sin, but they must put on the graces of the Spirit, be 
 <I>clothed with righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:9">Ps. cxxxii. 9</A>.

 They must be girded, as men prepared and strengthened for their work;
 and they must be robed and crowned, as men that counted their work and 
 office their true honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The high priest was to be anointed with the <I>holy anointing 
 oil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that the church might be filled and delighted with the sweet savour of 
 his administrations (for <I>ointment and perfume rejoice the 
 heart</I>), and in token of the pouring out of the Spirit upon him, to 
 qualify him for his work. Brotherly love is compared to this oil with 
 which Aaron was anointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:2">Ps. cxxxiii. 2</A>.

 The inferior priests are said to be anointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:30"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 30</A>),

 not on their heads, as the high priest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:10">Lev. xxi. 10</A>),

 the oil was only mingled with the blood that was sprinkled upon their
 garments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Sacrifices were to be offered for them. The covenant of 
 priesthood, as all other covenants, must be <I>made by 
 sacrifice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> There must be a sin-offering, to make atonement for them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:10-14"><I>v.</I> 10-14</A>.

 The law made those priests that had infirmity, and therefore they must 
 first offer for their own sin, before they could make atonement <I>for 
 the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:27,28">Heb. vii. 27, 28</A>.

 They were to put their hand on the head of their sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 confessing that they deserved to die for their own sin, and desiring 
 that the killing of the beast might expiate their guilt, and be 
 accepted as a vicarious satisfaction. It was used as other 
 sin-offerings were; only, whereas the flesh of other sin-offerings was 
 eaten by the priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:18">Lev. x. 18</A>),

 in token of the priest's taking away the sin of the people, this was
 appointed to be all burnt without the camp

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 to signify the imperfection of the legal dispensation (as the learned 
 bishop Patrick notes); for the sins of the priests themselves could not 
 be taken away by those sacrifices, but they must expect a better high 
 priest and a better sacrifice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> There must be a burnt-offering, a ram wholly burnt, to 
 the honour of God, in token of the dedication of themselves wholly to 
 God and to his service, as living sacrifices, kindled with the fire and 
 ascending in the flame of holy love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:15-18"><I>v.</I> 15-18</A>.

 The sin-offering must first be offered and then the burnt-offering; 
 for, till guilt be removed, no acceptable service can be performed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:7">Isa. vi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> There must be a peace-offering; it is called <I>the ram 
 of consecration,</I> because there was more in this peculiar to the 
 occasion than in the other two. In the burnt-offering God had the glory 
 of their priesthood, in this they had the comfort of it; and, in token 
 of a mutual covenant between God and them, 

 1. The blood of the sacrifice was divided between God and them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>);

 part of the blood was <I>sprinkled upon the altar round about,</I> and 
 part put upon them, upon their bodies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and upon their garments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus the benefit of the expiation made by the sacrifice was applied and 
 assured to them, and their whole selves from head to foot sanctified to 
 the service of God. The blood was put upon the extreme parts of the 
 body, to signify that it was all, as it were, enclosed and taken in for 
 God, the tip of the ear and the great toe not excepted. We reckon that 
 the blood and oil sprinkled upon garments spot and stain them; yet the 
 holy oil, and the blood of the sacrifice, sprinkled upon their 
 garments, must be looked upon as the greatest adorning imaginable to 
 them, for they signified the blood of Christ, and the graces of the 
 Spirit, which constitute and complete the beauty of holiness, and 
 recommend us to God; we read of robes <I>made white with the blood of 
 the Lamb.</I> 

 2. The <I>flesh of the sacrifice,</I> with the meat-offering annexed to 
 it, was likewise divided between God and them, that (to speak with 
 reverence) God and they might feast together, in token of friendship 
 and fellowship.

 (1.) Part of it was to be first waved before the Lord, and then burnt
 upon the altar; part of the <I>flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 part of the <I>bread,</I> for bread and flesh must go together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 these were first put into the hands of Aaron to be waved to and fro, in 
 token of their being offered to God (who, though unseen, yet compasses 
 us round on every side), and then they were to be burnt upon the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>),

 for the altar was to devour God's part of the sacrifice. Thus God
 admitted Aaron and his sons to be his servants, and wait at his table, 
 taking the mat of his altar from their hands. Here, in a parenthesis,
 as it were, comes in the law concerning the priests' part of the 
 peace-offerings afterwards, the breast and shoulder, which were now 
 divided; Moses had the breast, and the shoulder was burnt on the altar 
 with God's part, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 (2.) The other part, both of the flesh of the ram and of the bread, 
 Aaron and his sons were to eat at the door of the tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:31-33"><I>v.</I> 31-33</A>),

 to signify that he called them not only <I>servants</I> but 
 <I>friends,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">John xv. 15</A>.

 He <I>supped with them,</I> and <I>they with him.</I> Their eating of
 the things wherewith <I>the atonement was made</I> signified their 
 <I>receiving the atonement,</I> as the expression is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>),

 their thankful acceptance of the benefit of it, and their joyful
 communion with God thereupon, which was the true intent and meaning of 
 a feast upon a sacrifice. If any of it was left, it must be burnt, that 
 it might not be in any danger of putrefying, and to show that it was an 
 extraordinary peace-offering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The time that was to be spent in this consecration: <I>Seven days 
 shalt thou consecrate them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Though all the ceremonies were performed on the first day, yet, 

 (1.) They were not to look upon their consecration as completed till
 the seven days' end, which put a solemnity upon their admission, and a 
 distance between this and their former state, and obliged them to enter 
 upon their work with a pause, giving them time to consider the weight 
 and seriousness of it. This was to be observed in after-ages,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He that was to succeed Aaron in the high-priesthood must put on the 
 holy garments seven days together, in token of a deliberate and gradual 
 advance into his office, and that one sabbath might pass over him in 
 his consecration. 

 (2.) Every day of the seven, in this first consecration, a bullock was
 to be offered for a sin-offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 which was to intimate to them, 

 [1.] That it was of very great concern to them to get their sins
 pardoned, and that though atonement was made, and they had the comfort 
 of it, yet they must still keep up a penitent sense of sin and often 
 repeat the confession of it. 

 [2.] That those sacrifices which were thus offered day by day to make
 atonement could not make the <I>comers thereunto perfect,</I> for then 
 they would have ceased to be offered, as the apostle argues,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1,2">Heb. x. 1, 2</A>.

 They must therefore expect the <I>bringing in of a better hope.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This consecration of the priests was a <I>shadow of good things to 
 come.</I> 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus is the great high-priest of our profession, called
 of God to be so, consecrated for evermore, anointed with the Spirit 
 above his fellows (whence he is called <I>Messiah,</I> the 
 <I>Christ</I>), clothed with the holy garments, even with glory and 
 beauty, sanctified by his own blood, not that of bullocks and rams

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>),

 <I>made perfect,</I> or consecrated, <I>through sufferings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 Thus in him this was a perpetual statute,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (2.) All believers are spiritual priests, to offer spiritual sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>),

 washed in the blood of Christ, and so <I>made to our God priests,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6">Rev. i. 5, 6</A>.

 They also are clothed with the beauty of holiness, and have received
 the anointing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>.

 Their hands are filled with work, to which they must continually
 attend; and it is through Christ, the great sacrifice, that they are 
 dedicated to this service. His blood <I>sprinkled upon the conscience 
 purges it from dead works, that they may,</I> as priests, <I>serve the 
 living God.</I> The Spirit of God (as Ainsworth notes) is called the 
 <I>finger of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20">Luke xi. 20</A>,

 compared with
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:28">Matt. xii. 28</A>),

 and by him the merit of Christ is effectually applied to our souls, as
 here Moses with his finger was to put the blood upon Aaron. It is 
 likewise intimated that gospel ministers are to be solemnly set apart 
 to the work of the ministry with great deliberation and seriousness 
 both in the ordainers and in the ordained, as those that are to be 
 employed in a great work and entrusted with a great charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The consecration of the altar, which seems to have been coincident 
 with that of the priests, and the sin-offerings which were offered 
 every day for seven days together had reference to the altar as well as 
 the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 An <I>atonement</I> was <I>made for the altar.</I> Though that was not 
 a subject capable of sin, nor, having never yet been used, could it be 
 said to be polluted with the sins of the people, yet, since the fall, 
 there can be no sanctification to God but there must first be <I>an 
 atonement for sin,</I> which renders us both unworthy and unfit to be 
 employed for God. The altar was also <I>sanctified,</I> not only set 
 apart itself to a sacred use, but made so holy as to <I>sanctify the 
 gifts</I> that were offered upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:19">Matt. xxiii. 19</A>.

 Christ is our altar; for our sakes he sanctified himself, that we and
 our performances might be sanctified and recommended to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>38 Now this <I>is that</I> which thou shalt offer upon the altar;
 two lambs of the first year day by day continually.
 &nbsp; 39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
 lamb thou shalt offer at even:
 &nbsp; 40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
 fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
 hin of wine <I>for</I> a drink offering.
 &nbsp; 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
 thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
 according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an
 offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 42 <I>This shall be</I> a continual burnt offering throughout your
 generations <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.
 &nbsp; 43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and <I>the
 tabernacle</I> shall be sanctified by my glory.
 &nbsp; 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
 minister to me in the priest's office.
 &nbsp; 45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
 their God.
 &nbsp; 46 And they shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, that
 brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell
 among them: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this paragraph we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The daily service appointed. A lamb was to be offered upon the altar 
 every morning, and a lamb every evening, each with a meat-offering, 
 both made by fire, as a <I>continual burnt-offering throughout their 
 generations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:38-41"><I>v.</I> 38-41</A>.

 Whether there were any other sacrifices to be offered or not, these 
 were sure to be offered, at the public charge, for the benefit and 
 comfort of all Israel, to make atonement for their daily sins, and to 
 be an acknowledgement to God of their daily mercies. This was that
 which <I>the duty of every day required.</I> The taking away of this 
 daily sacrifice by Antiochus, for so many evenings and mornings, was 
 that great calamity of the church which was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:11">Dan. viii. 11</A>.

 Note,

 1. This typified the continual intercession which Christ ever lives to
 make, in virtue of his satisfaction, for the continual sanctification 
 of his church: though he offered himself <I>once for all,</I> yet that 
 one offering thus becomes a continual offering. 

 2. This teaches us to offer up to God the spiritual sacrifices of 
 prayer and praise every day, morning and evening, in humble 
 acknowledgement of our dependence upon him and our obligations to him. 
 Our daily devotions must be looked upon as the most needful of our 
 daily works and the most pleasant of our daily comforts. Whatever 
 business we have, this must never be omitted, either morning or 
 evening; prayer-time must be kept up as duly as meat-time. The daily 
 sacrifices were as the daily meals in God's house, and therefore they 
 were always attended with bread and wine.  Those starve their own souls 
 that keep not up a constant attendance on the throne of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Great and precious promises made of God's favour to Israel, and the 
 tokens of his special presence with them, while they thus kept up his 
 institutions among them. He speaks as one well pleased with the 
 appointment of the daily sacrifice; for, before he proceeds to the 
 other appointments that follow, he interposes these promises. It is 
 constancy in religion that brings in the comfort of it. He promises, 

 1. That he would keep up communion with them; that he would not only
 meet Moses, and speak to him, but that he would <I>meet the children of 
 Israel,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 to accept the daily sacrifices offered up on their behalf. Note, God 
 will not fail to give those the meeting who diligently and 
 conscientiously attend upon him in the ordinances of his own 
 appointment. 

 2. That he would own his own institutions, the tabernacle, the altar, 
 the priesthood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:43,44"><I>v.</I> 43, 44</A>);

 he would take possession of that which was consecrated to him. Note, 
 What is sanctified to the glory of God shall be sanctified by his 
 glory. If we do our part, God will do his, and will mark and fit that
 for himself which is in sincerity given up to him. 

 3. That he would reside among them as God in covenant with them, and 
 would give them sure and comfortable tokens of his peculiar favour to 
 them, and his special presence with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>):

 <I>I will dwell among the children of Israel.</I> Note, Where God sets 
 up the tabernacle of his ordinances he will himself dwell. <I>Lo, I am 
 with you always,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 Those that abide in God's house shall have God to abide with them. <I>I
 will be their God, and they shall know</I> that I am so. Note, Those 
 are truly happy that have a covenant-interest in God as theirs and the 
 comfortable evidence of that interest. If we have this, we have enough,
 and need no more to make us happy.</P>
