 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
 son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
 families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these <I>are</I> the names
 of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and
 Tirzah.
 &nbsp; 2 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
 and before the princes and all the congregation, <I>by</I> the door of
 the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
 company of them that gathered themselves together against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no
 sons.
 &nbsp; 4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
 family, because he hath no son? Give unto us <I>therefore</I> a
 possession among the brethren of our father.
 &nbsp; 5 And Moses brought their cause before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
 give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
 brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to
 pass unto them.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If
 a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
 to pass unto his daughter.
 &nbsp; 9 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his
 inheritance unto his brethren.
 &nbsp; 10 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his
 inheritance unto his father's brethren.
 &nbsp; 11 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
 inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family,
 and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of
 Israel a statute of judgment, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mention is made of the case of these daughters of Zelophehad in the 
 chapter before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 It should seem, by the particular notice taken of it, that it was a 
 singular case, and that the like did not at this time occur in all 
 Israel, that the head of a family had no sons, but daughters only. 
 Their case is again debated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:1-13"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi.</A>)

 upon another article of it; and, according to the judgments given in
 their case, we find them put in possession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+17:3,4">Josh. xvii. 3, 4</A>.

 One would suppose that their personal character was such as added
 weight to their case, and caused it to be so often taken notice of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Their case stated by themselves, and their petition upon it 
 presented to the highest court of judicature, which consisted of Moses 
 as king, the princes as lords, and the congregation, or elders of the 
 people who were chose their representatives, as the commons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This august assembly sat near the <I>door of the tabernacle,</I> that 
 in difficult cases they might consult the oracle. To them these young 
 ladies made their application; for it is the duty of magistrates to 
 <I>defend the fatherless,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3">Ps. lxxxii. 3</A>.

 We find not that the had any advocate to speak for them, but they
 managed their own cause ingeniously enough, which they could do the 
 better because it was plain and honest, and spoke for itself. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is they petition for: That they might have a possession in 
 the land of <I>Canaan, among the brethren of their father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 What God had said to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:53"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 53</A>)

 he had faithfully made known to the people, that the land of Canaan was
 to be divided among those that were now numbered; these daughters knew 
 that they were not numbered, and therefore by this rule must expect no 
 inheritance, and the family of their father must be looked upon as 
 extinct, and written childless, though he had all these daughters: this 
 they thought hard, and therefore prayed to be admitted heirs to their 
 father, and to have an inheritance in his right. If they had had a 
 brother, they would not have applied to Moses (as one did to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:13">Luke xii. 13</A>)

 for an order to inherit with him. But, having no brother, they beg for
 a possession.  Herein they discovered,

 (1.) A strong faith in the power and promise of God concerning the 
 giving of the land of Canaan to Israel. Though it was yet unconquered, 
 untouched, and in the full possession of the natives, yet they petition 
 for their share in it as if it were all their own already. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:6,7">Ps. lx. 6, 7</A>,

 <I>God has spoken in his holiness,</I> and the <I>Gilead is mine,
 Manasseh is mane.</I>

 (2.) An earnest desire of a place and name in the land of promise, 
 which was a type of heaven; and if they had, as some think, an eye to 
 that, and by this claim laid hold on eternal life, they were five wise 
 virgins indeed; and their example should quicken us with all possible 
 diligence to make sure our title to the heavenly inheritance, in the 
 disposal of which, by the covenant of grace, no difference is made 
 between male and female, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.

 (3.) A true respect and honour for their father, whose name was dear 
 and precious to them now that he was gone, and they were therefore 
 solicitous that it should not be <I>done away from among his 
 family.</I> There is a debt which children owe to the memory of their 
 parents, required by the fifth commandment: <I>Honour thy father and 
 mother.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What their plea is: That their father did not die under any 
 attainder which might be thought to have corrupted his blood and 
 forfeited his estate, but he <I>died in his own sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not engaged in any mutiny or rebellion against Moses, particularly not 
 in that of Korah and his company, nor in any way concerned in the sins 
 of others, but chargeable only with the common iniquities of mankind, 
 for which to his own Master he was to stand or fall, but laid not 
 himself open to any judicial process before Moses and the princes. He 
 was never convicted of any thing that might be a bar to his children's 
 claim. It is a comfort to parents, when they come to die, if, though 
 they smart themselves for their own sin, yet they are not conscious to 
 themselves of any of those iniquities which God visits upon the 
 children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their case determined by the divine oracle. Moses did not presume 
 to give judgment himself, because, though their pretensions seemed just 
 and reasonable, yet his express orders were to divide the land among 
 those that were numbered, who were the males only; he therefore 
 <I>brings their cause before the Lord,</I> and waits for his decision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and God himself gives the judgment upon it. He takes cognizance of the 
 affairs, not only of nations, but of private families, and orders them 
 in judgment, according to the counsel of his own will.

 1.  The petition is granted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They speak right, give them a possession.</I> Those that seek an 
 inheritance in the land of promise shall have what they seek, and other 
 things shall be added to them.  These are claims which God will 
 countenance and crown.

 2. The point is settled for all future occasions. These daughters of
 Zelophehad consulted, not only their own comfort and the credit of 
 their family, but the honour and happiness of their sex likewise; for 
 on this particular occasion a general law was made that, in case a man 
 had no son, his estate should go to his daughters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 not to the eldest, as the eldest son, but to them all in copartnership, 
 share and share alike. Those that in such a case deprive their 
 daughters of their right, purely to keep up the name of their family, 
 unless a valuable consideration be allowed them, may make the entail of 
 their lands surer than the entail of a blessing with them. Further 
 directions are given for the disposal of inheritances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 "If a man have no issue at all, his estate shall go to his brethren; if 
 no brethren, then to his father's brethren; and, if there be no such, 
 then to his next kinsman." With this the rules of our law exactly 
 agree: and though the Jewish doctors here will have it understood that 
 if a man have no children his estate shall go to his father, if living, 
 before his brethren, yet there is nothing of that in the law, and our 
 common law has an express rule against it, That an estate cannot ascend 
 lineally; so that if a person purchase lands in fee-simple, and die 
 without issue in the life-time of his father, his father cannot be his 
 heir. See how God makes heirs, and in his disposal we must 
 acquiesce.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
 Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 13 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
 thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
 &nbsp; 14 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
 in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
 before their eyes: that <I>is</I> the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
 the wilderness of Zin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. God tells Moses of his fault, his speaking unadvisedly with his lips 
 at the waters of strife, where he did not express, so carefully as he 
 ought to have done, a regard to the honour both of God and Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Though Moses was a servant of the Lord, a faithful servant, yet once he 
 <I>rebelled against God's commandment,</I> and failed in his duty; and 
 though a very honourable servant, and highly favoured, yet he shall 
 hear of his miscarriage, and all the world shall hear of it too, again 
 and again; for God will show his displeasure against sin, even in those 
 that are nearest and dearest to him. Those that are <I>in reputation 
 for wisdom and honour</I> have need to be constantly careful of their 
 words and ways, lest at any time they say or do that which may be a 
 diminution to their comfort, or to their credit, or both, a great while 
 after.

 2. He tells Moses of his death.  His death was the punishment of his
 sin, and yet notice is given him of it in such a manner as might best 
 serve to sweeten and mollify the sentence, and reconcile him to it.

 (1.) Moses must die, but he shall first have the satisfaction of seeing 
 the land of promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 God did not intend with this sight of Canaan to tantalize him, or 
 upbraid him with his folly in doing that which cut him short of it, nor 
 had it any impression of that kind upon him, but God appointed it and 
 Moses accepted it as a favour, his sight (we have reason to think) 
 being wonderfully strengthened and enlarged to take such a full and 
 distinct view of it as did abundantly gratify his innocent curiosity. 
 This sight of Canaan signified his believing prospect of the better 
 country, that is, the heavenly, which is very comfortable to dying 
 saints.

 (2.) Moses must die, but death does not <I>cut him off;</I> it only 
 gathers him to his people, brings him to rest with the holy patriarchs 
 that had gone before him. Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, were <I>his 
 people,</I> the people of his choice and love, and to them death 
 gathered him.

 (3.) Moses must die, but only as Aaron died before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And Moses had seen how easily and cheerfully Aaron had put off the 
 priesthood first and then the body; let not Moses therefore be afraid 
 of dying; it was but to be <I>gathered to his people,</I> as Aaron was 
 gathered.  Thus the death of our near and dear relations should be 
 improved by us,

 [1.] As an engagement to us to think often of dying. We are not better 
 than our fathers or brethren; if they are gone, we are going; if they 
 are gathered already, we must be gathered very shortly.  

 [2.] As an encouragement to us to think of death without terror, and
 even to please ourselves with the thoughts of it. It is but to die as 
 such and such died, if we live as they lived; and their <I>end was 
 peace, they finished their course with joy;</I> why then should we fear 
 any evil in that melancholy valley?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Moses spake unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 16 Let the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
 over the congregation,
 &nbsp; 17 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before
 them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in;
 that the congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be not as sheep which have no
 shepherd.
 &nbsp; 18 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of
 Nun, a man in whom <I>is</I> the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
 &nbsp; 19 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
 congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
 &nbsp; 20 And thou shalt put <I>some</I> of thine honour upon him, that all
 the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
 &nbsp; 21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
 <I>counsel</I> for him after the judgment of Urim before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: at
 his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in,
 <I>both</I> he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 22 And Moses did as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded him: and he took Joshua,
 and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
 congregation:
 &nbsp; 23 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded by the hand of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Moses prays for a successor. When God had told him that he must die, 
 though it appears elsewhere that he solicited for a reprieve for 
 himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:24,25">Deut. iii. 24, 25</A>),

 yet, when this could not be obtained, he begged earnestly that the work
 of God might be carried on, though he might not have the honour of 
 finishing it. Envious spirits do not love their successors, but Moses 
 was not one of these. We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers 
 and in our endeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may 
 flourish, and the interests of God's kingdom among men may be 
 maintained and advanced, when we are in our graves. In this prayer 
 Moses expresses,

 1. A tender concern for the people of Israel: <I>That the congregation 
 of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</I> Our Saviour 
 uses this comparison in his compassions for the people when they wanted 
 good ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36">Matt. ix. 36</A>.

 Magistrates and ministers are the shepherds of a people; if these be
 wanting, or be not as they should be, people are apt to wander and be 
 scattered abroad, are exposed to enemies, and in danger of wanting food 
 and of hurting one another, <I>as sheep having no shepherd.</I>

 2. A believing dependence upon God, as the <I>God of the spirits of all
 flesh.</I> He is both the former and the searcher of spirits, and 
 therefore can either find men fit or make them fit to serve his 
 purposes, for the good of his church. Moses prays to God, not to send 
 an angel, but to <I>set a man over the congregation,</I> that is, to 
 nominate and appoint one whom he would qualify and own as ruler of his 
 people Israel. Before God gave this blessing to Israel, he stirred up 
 Moses to pray for it: thus Christ, before he sent forth his apostles, 
 called to those about him <I>to pray the Lord of the harvest that he 
 would send forth labourers into his harvest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:38">Matt. ix. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God, in answer to his prayer, appoints him a successor, even 
 Joshua, who had long since signalized himself by his courage in 
 fighting Amalek, his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith 
 and sincerity in witnessing against the report of the evil spies; this 
 is the man whom God pitches upon to succeed Moses: <I>A man in whom is 
 the Spirit, the Spirit of grace</I> (he is a good man, fearing God and 
 hating covetousness, and acting from principle), the <I>spirit of 
 government</I> (he is fit to do the work and discharge the trusts of 
 his place), a spirit of conduct and courage; and he had also the 
 <I>spirit of prophecy,</I> for the Lord often <I>spoke unto him,</I> 
 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:1,6:2,7:10">Josh. iv. 1; vi. 2; vii. 10</A>.
 
 Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God directs Moses how to secure the succession to Joshua. 

 (1.) He must ordain him: <I>Lay thy hand upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was done in token of Moses' transferring the government to him, as 
 the laying of hands on the sacrifice put the offering in the place and 
 stead of the offerer; also in token of God's conferring the blessing of 
 the Spirit upon him, which Moses obtained by prayer. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:9">Deut. xxxiv. 9</A>),

 <I>Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his
 hands on him.</I> This rite of imposing hands we find used in the New 
 Testament in the setting apart of gospel ministers, denoting a solemn 
 designation of them to the office and an earnest desire that God would 
 qualify them for it and own them in it. It is the offering of them to 
 Christ and his church for living sacrifices.

 (2.) He must present him to Eleazar and the people, set him before 
 them, that they might know him to be designed of God for this great 
 trust and consent to that designation.

 (3.) He must <I>give him a charge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He must be charged with the people of Israel, who were delivered into 
 his hand as sheep into the hand of a shepherd, and for whom he must be 
 accountable.  He must be strictly charged to do his duty to them; 
 though they were under his command, he was under God's command, and 
 from him must receive charge.  The highest must know that there is a 
 higher than they.  This charge must be given him <I>in their sight,</I> 
 that it might be the more affecting to Joshua, and that the people, 
 seeing the work and care of their prince, might be the more engaged to 
 assist and encourage him.

 (4.) He must <I>put some of his honour upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Joshua at the most had but some of the honour of Moses, and in many
 instances came short of him; but this seems to be meant of his taking 
 him now, while he lived, into partnership with him in the government 
 and admitting him to act with authority as his assistant. It is an 
 honour to be employed for God and his church; some of this honour must 
 be put upon Joshua, that the people, being used to obey him while Moses 
 lived, might the more cheerfully do it afterwards.

 (5.) He must appoint Eleazar the high priest, with this breast-plate of 
 judgment, to be his privy-council 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>He shall stand before Eleazar,</I> by him to consult the oracle, 
 ready to receive and observe all the instructions that should be given 
 him by it. This was a direction to Joshua. Though he was full of the 
 Spirit, and had all this honour put upon him, yet he must do nothing 
 without asking counsel of God, not leaning to his own understanding. It 
 was also a great encouragement to him. To govern Israel, and to conquer 
 Canaan, were two hard tasks, but God assures him that in both he should 
 be under a divine conduct; and in every difficult case God would advise 
 him to that which should be for the best. Moses had recourse to the 
 oracle of God himself, but Joshua and the succeeding judges must use 
 the ministry of the high priest, and consult the judgment of urim, 
 which, the Jews say, might not be enquired of but by the king or the 
 head of the sanhedrim, or by the agent or representative of the people, 
 for them, and in their name.  Thus the government of Israel was now 
 purely divine, for both the designation and direction of their princes 
 were entirely so. <I>At the word of the priest,</I> according to the 
 <I>judgment of urim,</I> Joshua and all Israel must go out and come in; 
 and no doubt God, who thus guided, would preserve both their going out 
 and their coming in.  Those are safe, and may be easy, that follow God, 
 and in all their ways acknowledge him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses does according to these directions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 He cheerfully ordained Joshua,

 (1.) Though it was a present lessening to himself, and amounted almost 
 to a resignation of the government. He was very willing that the people 
 should look off from him, and gaze on the rising sun.

 (2.) Though it might appear a perpetual slur upon his family. It would
 not have been so much his praise if he had thus resigned his honour to 
 a son of his own; but with his own hands first to ordain Eleazar high 
 priest, and then Joshua, one of another tribe, chief ruler, while his
 own children had no preferment at all, but were left in the rank of 
 common Levites, this was such an instance of self-denial and submission 
 to the will of God as was more his glory than the highest advancement 
 of his family could have been; for it confirms his character as the 
 meekest man upon earth, and faithful to him that appointed him in all 
 his house. This (says the excellent bishop Patrick) shows him to have 
 had a principle which raised him above all other lawgivers, who always 
 took care to establish their families in some share of that greatness 
 which they themselves possessed; but hereby it appeared that Moses 
 acted not from himself, because he acted not for himself.</P>
