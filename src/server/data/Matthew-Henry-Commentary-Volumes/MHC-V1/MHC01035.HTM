 In this chapter we have three communions and three funerals. 
 
 I. Three communions between God and Jacob. 
 
 1. God ordered 
 Jacob to Beth-el; and, in obedience to that order, he purged his
 house of idols, and prepared for that journey,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 2. Jacob built an altar at Beth-el, to the honour of God that had 
 appeared to him, and in performance of his vow,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.
 
 3. God appeared to him again, and confirmed the change of his 
 name and covenant with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>),
 of which appearance 
 Jacob made a grateful acknowledgment,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.
 
 II. Three funerals. 
 
 1. Deborah's,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:8">ver. 8</A>.
 
 2. Rachel's, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.
 
 3. Isaac's, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:27-29">ver. 27-29</A>.
 Here is also Reuben's incest
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:22">ver. 22</A>),
 and an account of Jacob's sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:23-26">ver. 23-26</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, 
 go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: 
 and make there an altar unto God, 
 that appeared unto thee when thou 
 fleddest from the face of Esau thy 
 brother.
 &nbsp; 2 Then Jacob said unto his 
 household, and to all that <I>were</I> with 
 
 <A NAME="Page205"> </A>

 him, Put away the strange gods that 
 <I>are</I> among you, and be
 clean, and change your garments:
 &nbsp; 3 And let us 
 arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I 
 will make there an altar unto God, 
 who answered me in the day of my 
 distress, and was with me in the way 
 which I went.
 &nbsp; 4 And they gave unto 
 Jacob all the strange gods which <I>were</I> 
 in their hand, and <I>all their</I> earrings 
 which <I>were</I> in their ears; and Jacob 
 hid them under the oak which <I>was</I> by 
 Shechem.
 &nbsp; 5 And they journeyed: and 
 the terror of God was upon the cities
 that <I>were</I> round about them, and they 
 did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. God reminds Jacob of his vow at 
 Beth-el, and sends him thither to perform it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Jacob had said in the day of his distress, 
 <I>If I come again in peace, this stone shall 
 be God's house,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:22"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 22</A>.
 God had performed 
 his part of the bargain, and had given 
 Jacob more than bread to eat and raiment to 
 put on--he had got an estate, and had become 
 two bands; but, it should seem, he had forgotten 
 his vow, or at least had too long deferred 
 the performance of it. Seven or eight 
 years it was now since he came to Canaan; 
 he had purchased ground there, and had built 
 an altar in remembrance of God's last appearance 
 to him when he called him <I>Israel</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:19,20"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 19, 20</A>);
 but still Beth-el is forgotten. 
 Note, Time is apt to wear out the 
 sense of mercies and the impressions made 
 upon us by them; it should not be so, but 
 so it is. God had exercised Jacob with a 
 very sore affliction in his family
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv.</A>),
 to see if this would bring his vow to his 
 remembrance, and put him upon the performance 
 of it, but it had not this effect; 
 therefore God comes himself and puts him 
 in mind of it: <I>Arise, go to Beth-el.</I> Note, 
 
 1. As many as God loves he will remind of neglected 
 duties, one way or other, by conscience 
 or by providences. 
 
 2. When we have 
 vowed a vow to God, it is best not to defer
 the payment of it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:4">Eccles. v. 4</A>),
 yet better late than never. God bade him go to Beth-el
 and dwell there, that is, not only go himself,
 but take his family with him, that they might
 join with him in his devotions. Note, In
 Beth-el, the house of God, we should desire
 to dwell,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.
 That should be our
 home, not our inn. God reminds him not
 expressly of his vow, but of the occasion of
 it: <I>When thou fleddest from the face of Esau.</I>
 Note, The remembrance of former afflictions
 should bring to mind the workings of our
 souls under them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13,14">Ps. lxvi. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jacob commands his household to prepare 
 for this solemnity; not only for the 
 journey and remove, but for the religious 
 services that were to be performed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 Note, 1. Before solemn ordinances, there 
 must be solemn preparation. <I>Wash you, 
 make you clean,</I> and then <I>come, and let us 
 reason together,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16-18">Isa. i. 16-18</A>.

 2. Masters 
 of families should use their authority for the 
 promoting of religion in their families. Not 
 only we, but our houses also, should serve 
 the Lord,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15">Josh. xxiv. 15</A>.
 Observe the commands 
 he gives his household, like Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 19</A>.
 
 (1.) They must <I>put away the 
 strange gods.</I> Strange gods in Jacob's family! 
 Strange things indeed! Could such 
 a family, that was taught the good knowledge 
 of the Lord, admit them? Could such a 
 master, to whom God had appeared twice, 
 and oftener, connive at them? Doubtless this 
 was his infirmity. Note, Those that are good 
 themselves cannot always have those about 
 them so good as they should be. In those 
 families where there is a face of religion, and 
 an altar to God, yet many times there is much 
 amiss, and more strange gods than one would 
 suspect. In Jacob's family, Rachel had her 
 <I>teraphim,</I> which, it is to be feared, she 
 secretly made some superstitious use of. The 
 captives of Shechem brought their gods along 
 with them, and perhaps Jacob's sons took 
 some with the plunder. However they came 
 by them, now they must <I>put them away.</I> 
 
 (2.) They must be clean, and <I>change their garments;</I> 
 they must observe a due decorum, 
 and make the best appearance they could. 
 Simeon and Levi had their hands full of 
 blood, it concerned them particularly to wash, 
 and to put off their garments that were so 
 stained. These were but ceremonies, signifying 
 the purification and change of the heart. 
 What are clean clothes, and new clothes, 
 without a clean heart, and a new heart? Dr. 
 Lightfoot, by their <I>being clean,</I> or <I>washing</I> 
 themselves, understands Jacob's admission 
 of the proselytes of Shechem and Syria into 
 his religion by baptism, because circumcision 
 had become odious. 
 
 3. They must go with 
 him to Beth-el,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Note, Masters of families, 
 when they go up to the house of God, 
 should bring their families with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His family surrendered all they had 
 that was idolatrous or superstitious,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 Perhaps, if Jacob had called for them sooner, 
 they would sooner have parted with them, 
 being convicted by their own consciences of 
 the vanity of them. Note, Sometimes attempts 
 for reformation succeed better than 
 one could have expected, and people are not 
 so obstinate against them as we feared. Jacob's 
 servants, and even the retainers of his 
 family, gave him all the strange gods, and 
 the ear-rings they wore, either as charms or 
 to the honour of their gods; they parted with 
 all. Note, Reformation is not sincere if it 
 be not universal. We hope they parted with 
 them cheerfully, and without reluctance, as 
 Ephraim did, when he said, <I>What have I to 
 do any more with idols?</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>),
 or that 
 people that said to their idols, <I>Get you hence,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22">Isa. xxx. 22</A>.
 Jacob took care to bury their 
 
 <A NAME="Page206"> </A>

 images, we may suppose in some place unknown 
 to them, that they might not afterwards 
 find them and return to them. Note, 
 We must be wholly separated from our sins, 
 as we are from those that are dead and buried 
 out of our sight, cast them <I>to the moles and 
 the bats,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20">Isa. ii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He removes without molestation from Shechem to Bethel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 <I>The terror of God 
 was upon the cities.</I> Though the Canaanites 
 were much exasperated against the sons of 
 Jacob for their barbarous usage of the Shechemites, 
 yet they were so restrained by a 
 divine power that they could not take this 
 fair opportunity, which now offered itself, 
 when they were upon their march, to avenge 
 their neighbours' quarrel. Note, The way 
 of duty is the way of safety. While there 
 was sin in Jacob's house, he was afraid of his 
 neighbours; but now that the strange gods 
 were put away, and they were all going together 
 to Bethel, his neighbours were afraid 
 of him. When we are about God's work, we 
 are under special protection. God is with us, 
 while we are with him; and, if he be for us, 
 who can be against us? See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:24">Exod. xxxiv. 24</A>,
 <I>No man shall desire thy land, when thou goest 
 up to appear before the Lord.</I> God governs 
 the world more by secret terrors on men's 
 minds than we are aware of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 So Jacob came to Luz, which <I>is</I> 
 in the land of Canaan, that <I>is,</I> Beth-el, 
 he and all the people that <I>were</I> with 
 him.
 &nbsp; 7 And he built there an altar, 
 and called the place El-Beth-el: because 
 there God appeared unto him, 
 when he fled from the face of his brother.
 &nbsp; 8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse 
 died, and she was buried beneath
 Beth-el under an oak: and the name 
 of it was called Allon-bachuth.
 &nbsp; 9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, 
 when he came out of Padan-aram, and 
 blessed him.
 &nbsp; 10 And God said unto 
 him, Thy name <I>is</I> Jacob: thy name 
 shall not be called any more Jacob, 
 but Israel shall be thy name: and he 
 called his name Israel.
 &nbsp; 11 And God 
 said unto him, I <I>am</I> God Almighty: 
 be fruitful and multiply; a nation and 
 a company of nations shall be of thee, 
 and kings shall come out of thy loins;
 &nbsp; 12 And the land which I gave Abraham 
 and Isaac, to thee I will give it, 
 and to thy seed after thee will I give 
 the land.
 &nbsp; 13 And God went up from 
 him in the place where he talked with
 him.
 &nbsp; 14 And Jacob set up a pillar 
 in the place where he talked with him, 
 <I>even</I> a pillar of stone: and he poured 
 a drink offering thereon, and he poured 
 oil thereon.
 &nbsp; 15 And Jacob called the 
 name of the place where God spake 
 with him, Beth-el.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jacob and his retinue having safely arrived 
 at Beth-el, we are here told what passed there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There he built an altar
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 and no 
 doubt offered sacrifice upon it, perhaps the 
 tenth of his cattle, according to his vow, <I>I 
 will give the tenth unto thee.</I> With these sacrifices 
 he joined praises for former mercies, 
 particularly that which the sight of the place 
 brought afresh to his remembrance; and he 
 added prayers for the continuance of God's 
 favour to him and his family. And he called 
 the place (that is, <I>the altar</I>) <I>El-beth-el, the 
 God of Bethel.</I> As, when he made a thankful 
 acknowledgment of the honour God had 
 lately done him in calling him <I>Israel,</I> he worshipped 
 God by the name of <I>El-elohe Israel;</I> 
 so, now that he was making a grateful recognition 
 of God's former favour to him at 
 Bethel, he worships God by the name of <I>El-beth-el, 
 the God of Beth-el,</I> because there God 
 appeared to him. Note, The comfort which 
 the saints have in holy ordinances is not so 
 much from <I>Bethel, the house of God,</I> as from 
 <I>El-beth-el, the God of the house.</I> The ordinances 
 are but empty things if we do not meet 
 with God in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There he buried Deborah, Rebekah's 
 nurse,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 We have reason to think that 
 Jacob, after he came to Canaan, while his 
 family dwelt near Shechem, went himself (it 
 is likely, often) to visit his father Isaac at 
 Hebron. Rebekah probably was dead, but 
 her old nurse (of whom mention is made
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:59"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 59</A>)
 survived her, and Jacob took 
 her to his family, to be a companion to his 
 wives, her country-women, and an instructor 
 to his children; while they were at Bethel, 
 she died, and died lamented, so much lamented 
 that the oak under which she was 
 buried was called <I>Allon-bachuth, the oak of 
 weeping.</I> Note, 1. Old servants in a family, 
 that have in their time been faithful and useful, 
 ought to be respected. Honour was 
 done to this nurse, at her death, by Jacob's 
 family, though she was not related to them, 
 and though she was aged. Former services, 
 in such a case, must be remembered. 
 
 2. We 
 do not know where death may meet us; perhaps 
 at Beth-el, the house of God. Therefore 
 let us be always ready. 
 
 3. Family-afflictions 
 may come even when family-reformation 
 and religion are on foot. Therefore 
 rejoice with trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There God appeared to him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 to own his altar, to answer to the name by which 
 he had called him, <I>The God of Beth-el</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 and to comfort him under his affliction,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Note, God will appear to those in a way of
 grace that attend on him in a way of duty.
 Here,

 1. He confirmed the change of his
 name,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 It was done before by the 
 angel that wrestled with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:28"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 28</A>),
 and here it was ratified by the divine Majesty, 
 or <I>Shechinah,</I> that appeared to him. There 
 it was to encourage him against the fear of 
 Esau, here against the fear of the Canaanites. 
 Who can be too hard for Israel, a prince with 
 God? It is below those who are thus dignified 
 to droop and despond. 
 
 2. He renewed 
 and ratified the covenant with him, by the 
 name <I>El-shaddai. I am God Almighty, God 
 all-sufficient</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 able to make good the 
 promise in due time, and to support thee and 
 provide for thee in the mean time. Two 
 things are promised him which we have met 
 with often before:--
 
 (1.) That he should be 
 the father of a great nation, great in number--<I>a 
 company of nations shall be of thee</I> (every 
 tribe of Israel was a nation, and all the 
 twelve a company of nations), great in honour 
 and power--<I>kings shall come out of thy loins.</I> 
 
 (2.) That he should be the master of a good 
 land
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 described by the grantees, Abraham 
 and Isaac, to whom it was promised, 
 not by the occupants, the Canaanites in whose 
 possession it now was. The land that was 
 given to Abraham and Isaac is here entailed 
 on Jacob and his seed. He shall not have 
 children without an estate, which is often the 
 case of the poor, nor an estate without children, 
 which is often the grief of the rich; but 
 both. These two promises had a spiritual 
 signification, of which we may suppose Jacob 
 himself had some notion, though not so clear 
 and distinct as we now have; for, without doubt, 
 Christ is the promised seed, and heaven is the 
 promised land; the former is the foundation, 
 and the latter the top-stone, of all God's 
 favours. 
 
 3. He then went up from him, or 
 <I>from over him,</I> in some visible display of glory, 
 which had hovered over him while he talked 
 with him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Note, The sweetest communions 
 the saints have with God in this 
 world are short and transient, and soon have 
 an end. Our vision of God in heaven will 
 be everlasting; there we shall be ever with 
 the Lord; it is not so here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. There Jacob erected a memorial of 
 this,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. He set up a pillar. When he 
 was going to Padan-aram, he set up for a pillar 
 that stone on which he had laid his head. 
 This was agreeable enough to his low condition 
 and his hasty flight; but now he took 
 time to erect one more stately, more distinguishable 
 and durable, probably placing that 
 stone in it. In token of his intending it for 
 a sacred memorial of his communion with 
 God, he poured oil and the other ingredients 
 of a drink-offering upon it. His vow was, 
 <I>This stone shall be God's house,</I> that is, shall 
 be set up for his honour, as houses to the 
 praise of their builders; and here he performs
 it, transferring it to God by anointing 
 it. 
 
 2. He confirmed the name he had formerly 
 given to the place 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 <I>Beth-el, the 
 house of God.</I> Yet this very place afterwards 
 lost the honour of its name, and became 
 <I>Beth-aven, a house of iniquity;</I> for here it 
 was that Jeroboam set up one of his calves. 
 It is impossible for the best man to entail 
 upon a place so much as the profession and 
 form of religion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And they journeyed from Beth-el; 
 and there was but a little way to 
 come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, 
 and she had hard labour.
 &nbsp; 17 And it came to pass, when she was in 
 hard labour, that the midwife said 
 unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have 
 this son also.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass, 
 as her soul was in departing, (for she
 died) that she called his name Ben-oni: 
 but his father called him Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 19 And Rachel died, and was buried 
 in the way to Ephrath, which <I>is</I> Beth-lehem.
 &nbsp; 20 And Jacob set a pillar 
 upon her grave: that <I>is</I> the pillar of 
 Rachel's grave unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of the death of 
 Rachel, the beloved wife of Jacob. 
 
 1. She 
 fell in travail by the way, not able to reach to 
 Bethlehem, the next town, though they were 
 near it; so suddenly does pain sometimes 
 come upon a woman in travail, which she 
 cannot escape, or put off. We may suppose 
 Jacob had soon a tent up, convenient enough 
 for her reception. 
 
 2. Her pains were violent. 
 She had hard labour, harder than usual: this 
 was the effect of sin,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16</A>.
 Note, Human 
 life begins with sorrow, and the roses of 
 its joy are surrounded with thorns. 
 
 3. The midwife encouraged her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 No doubt she 
 had her midwife with her, ready at hand, yet 
 that would not secure her. Rachel had said, 
 when she bore Joseph, <I>God shall add another 
 son,</I> which now the midwife remembers, and 
 tells her her words were made good. Yet 
 this did not avail to keep up her spirits; unless 
 God command away fear, no one else 
 can. He only says as one having authority, 
 <I>Fear not.</I> We are apt, in extreme perils, to 
 comfort ourselves and our friends with the 
 hopes of a temporal deliverance, in which we 
 may be disappointed; we had better found 
 our comforts on that which cannot fail us, 
 the hope of eternal life. 
 
 4. Her travail was 
 to the life of the child, but to her own death. 
 Note, Though the pains and perils of childbearing 
 were introduced by sin, yet they 
 have sometimes been fatal to very holy 
 women, who, though not saved in childbearing, 
 are saved through it with an everlasting 
 salvation. Rachel had passionately 
 said, <I>Give me children, or else I die;</I> and now 
 that she had children (for this was her second) 
 she died. Her dying is here called <I>the 
 departing of her soul.</I> Note, The death of 
 the body is but the departure of the soul to 
 the world of spirits. 
 
 5. Her dying lips called 
 her new-born son <I>Ben-oni, The son of my sorrow.</I> 
 And many a son, not born in such 
 hard labour, yet proves the son of his 
 
 <A NAME="Page208"> </A>

 parent's sorrow, and the heaviness of her that 
 bore him. Children are enough the sorrow 
 of their poor mothers in the breeding, bearing, 
 and nursing of them; they should therefore, 
 when they grow up, study to be their 
 joy, and so, if possible, to make them some 
 amends. But Jacob, because he would not 
 renew the sorrowful remembrance of the 
 mother's death every time he called his son 
 by his name, changed his name, and called 
 him <I>Benjamin, The son of my right hand;</I> 
 that is, "very dear to me, set on my right 
 hand for a blessing, the support of my age, 
 like the staff in my right hand." 
 
 6. Jacob 
 buried her near the place where she died. 
 As she died in child-bed, it was convenient 
 to bury her quickly; and therefore he did 
 not bring her to the burying-place of his family. 
 If the soul be at rest after death, it 
 matters little where the body lies. In the 
 place where the tree falls, there let it be. 
 No mention is made of the mourning that 
 was at her death, because that might easily 
 be taken for granted. Jacob, no doubt, was 
 a true mourner. Note, Great afflictions 
 sometimes befal us immediately after great 
 comforts. Lest Jacob should be lifted up 
 with the visions of the Almighty with which 
 he was honoured, this was sent as a thorn in 
 the flesh to humble him. Those that enjoy 
 the favours peculiar to the children of God 
 must yet expect the troubles that are common 
 to the children of men. Deborah, who, 
 had she lived, would have been a comfort to 
 Rachel in her extremity, died but a little before. 
 Note, When death comes into a family, 
 it often strikes double. God by it speaks 
 once, yea, twice. The Jewish writers 
 say, "The death of Deborah and Rachel was 
 to expiate the murder of the Shechemites, 
 occasioned by Dinah, a daughter of the family." 
 
 7. Jacob set up a pillar upon her 
 grave, so that it was known, long after, to be 
 Rachel's sepulchre
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:2">1 Sam. x. 2</A>),
 and Providence 
 so ordered it that this place afterwards 
 fell in the lot of Benjamin. Jacob 
 set up a pillar in remembrance of his joys
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 and here he sets up one in remembrance 
 of his sorrows; for, as it may be of 
 use to ourselves to keep both in mind, so it 
 may be of use to others to transmit the memorials 
 of both: the church, long afterwards, 
 owned that what God said to Jacob at Bethel, 
 both by his word and by his rod, he intended 
 for their instruction 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hos. xii. 4</A>),
 <I>There he spoke with us.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And Israel journeyed, and spread 
 his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
 &nbsp; 22 And it came to pass, when Israel 
 dwelt in that land, that Reuben went 
 and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: 
 and Israel heard <I>it.</I> Now the 
 sons of Jacob were twelve:
 &nbsp; 23 The 
 sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, 
 and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, 
 and Issachar, and Zebulun:
 &nbsp; 24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
 &nbsp; 25 And the sons of Bilhah, 
 Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
 &nbsp; 26 And the sons of Zilpah, 
 Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher:
 these <I>are</I> the sons of Jacob, which 
 were born to him in Padan-aram.
 &nbsp; 27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his 
 father unto Mamre, unto the city of 
 Arbah, which <I>is</I> Hebron, where Abraham 
 and Isaac sojourned.
 &nbsp; 28 And 
 the days of Isaac were an hundred and 
 fourscore years.
 &nbsp; 29 And Isaac gave 
 up the ghost, and died, and was gathered 
 unto his people, <I>being</I> old and 
 full of days: and his sons Esau and 
 Jacob buried him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Jacob's removal,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 He also, 
 as his fathers, sojourned in the land of promise 
 as in a strange country, and was not 
 long in a place. Immediately after the story 
 of Rachel's death he is here called <I>Israel</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>),
 and not often so afterwards: the 
 Jews say, "The historian does him this honour 
 here because he bore that affliction with 
 such admirable patience and submission to 
 Providence." Note, Those are Israels indeed,
 princes with God, that support the government 
 of their own passions. He that 
 has this rule over his own spirit is better than 
 the mighty. Israel, a prince with God, yet 
 dwells in tents; the city is reserved for him 
 in the other world. 
 
 2. The sin of Reuben. 
 A piece of abominable wickedness it was that 
 he was guilty of 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 that very sin which 
 the apostle says 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor v. 1</A>)
 is not so much 
 as named among the Gentiles, <I>that one should 
 have his father's wife.</I> It is said to have been 
 <I>when Israel dwelt in that land;</I> as if he were 
 then absent from his family, which might be 
 the unhappy occasion of these disorders. 
 Though perhaps Bilhah was the greater criminal, 
 and it is probable was abandoned by 
 Jacob for it, yet Reuben's crime was so provoking 
 that, for it, he lost his birthright and 
 blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:4"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 4</A>.
 The first-born is not 
 always the best, nor the most promising. 
 This was Reuben's sin, but it was Jacob's 
 affliction; and what a sore affliction it was is 
 intimated in a little compass, <I>and Israel heard 
 it.</I> No more is said--that is enough; he 
 heard it with the utmost grief and shame, 
 horror and displeasure. Reuben thought to 
 conceal it, that his father should never hear 
 of it; but those that promise themselves secresy 
 in sin are generally disappointed; a 
 bird of the air carries the voice. 3. A complete 
 list of the sons of Jacob, now that Benjamin 
 the youngest was born. This is the 
 first time we have the names of these heads 
 of the twelve tribes together; afterwards we 
 find them very often spoken of and 
 
 <A NAME="Page209"> </A>

 enumerated, even to the end of the Bible, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:4,21:12">Rev. vii. 4; xxi. 12</A>.

 4. The visit which Jacob made 
 to his father Isaac at Hebron. We may suppose 
 he had visited him before since his return, 
 for he <I>sorely longed after his father's 
 house;</I> but never, till now, brought his family 
 to settle with him, or near him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 Probably he did this now upon the death of 
 Rebekah, by which Isaac was left solitary, 
 and not disposed to marry again. 
 
 5. The 
 age and death of Isaac are here recorded, 
 though it appears, by computation, that 
 he died not till many years after Joseph was sold 
 into Egypt, and much about the time that 
 he was preferred there. Isaac, a mild quiet 
 man, lived the longest of all the patriarchs,
 for he was 180 years old; Abraham was but 
 175. Isaac lived about forty years after he 
 had made his will,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:22"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2</A>.
 We shall not 
 die an hour the sooner, but abundantly the 
 better, for our timely setting our heart and 
 house in order. Particular notice is taken of 
 the amicable agreement of Esau and Jacob, 
 in solemnizing their father's funeral
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 to show how wonderfully God had changed 
 Esau's mind since he vowed his brother's 
 murder immediately after his father's death,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:41"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 41</A>.
 Note, God has many ways of 
 preventing bad men from doing the mischief 
 they intended; he can either tie their hands 
 or turn their hearts.</P>
