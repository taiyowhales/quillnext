 The laws which Moses had hitherto been repeating and urging mostly 
 concerned the acts of religion and devotion towards God; but here he 
 comes more fully to press the duties of righteousness between man and 
 man. This chapter relates, 

 I. To the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. To the eighth commandment, "Thou shalt not steal,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:14">ver. 14</A>.

 III. To the ninth commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:15-21">ver. 15</A>, &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
 dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
 &nbsp; 2 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
 land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee to possess it.
 &nbsp; 3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
 land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three
 parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
 &nbsp; 4 And this <I>is</I> the case of the slayer, which shall flee
 thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour
 ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
 &nbsp; 5 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
 wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the
 tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his
 neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities,
 and live:
 &nbsp; 6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
 heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay
 him; whereas he <I>was</I> not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated
 him not in time past.
 &nbsp; 7 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
 cities for thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And if the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
 unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to
 give unto thy fathers;
 &nbsp; 9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
 command thee this day, to love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and to walk ever
 in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,
 beside these three:
 &nbsp; 10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thy God giveth thee <I>for</I> an inheritance, and <I>so</I> blood be upon
 thee.
 &nbsp; 11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
 and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and
 fleeth into one of these cities:
 &nbsp; 12 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
 and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
 may die.
 &nbsp; 13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away <I>the
 guilt of</I> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
 thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was one of the precepts given to the sons of Noah that <I>whoso 
 sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed,</I> that is, by 
 the avenger of blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>.

 Now here we have the law settled between blood and blood, between the
 blood of the murdered and the blood of the murderer, and effectual 
 provision made,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the cities of refuge should be a protection to him that slew 
 another casually, so that he should not die for that as a crime which 
 was not his voluntary act, but only his unhappiness. The appointment of 
 these cities of refuge we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:13">Exod. xxi. 13</A>),

 and the law laid down concerning them at large, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:10-15">Num. xxxv. 10</A>,

 &c. It is here repeated, and direction is given concerning three
 things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The appointing of three cities in Canaan for this purpose. Moses had 
 already appointed three on that side Jordan which he saw the conquest 
 of; and now he bids them, when they should be settled in the other part 
 of the country, to appoint three more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:1-3,7"><I>v.</I> 1-3, 7</A>.

 The country was to be divided into three districts, as near by as might
 be equal, and a city of refuge in the centre of each so that every 
 corner of the land might have one within reach. Thus Christ is not a 
 refuge at a distance, which we must ascend to heaven or go down to the 
 deep for, but the word is nigh us, and Christ in the word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:8">Rom. x. 8</A>.
 
 The gospel brings salvation <I>to our door,</I> and there it knocks for
 admission. To make the flight of the delinquent the more easy, the way 
 must be prepared that led to the city of refuge. Probably they had 
 causeways or street-ways leading to those cities, and the Jews say that 
 the magistrates of Israel, upon one certain day in the year, sent out 
 messengers to see that those roads were in good repair, and they were 
 to remove stumbling-blocks, mend bridges that were broken, and, where 
 two ways met, they were to set up a Mercurial post, with a finger to 
 point the right way, on which was engraven in great letters, <I>Miklat, 
 Miklat--Refuge, Refuge.</I> In allusion to this, gospel ministers are 
 to show people the way to Christ, and to assist and direct them in 
 flying by faith to him for refuge. They must be ready to remove their 
 prejudices, and help them over their difficulties. And, blessed be God, 
 <I>the way of holiness,</I> to all that seek it faithfully, is a 
 highway so plain that <I>the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err 
 therein.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The use to be made of these cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 (1.) It is supposed that it might so happen that a man might be the
 death of his neighbour without any design upon him either from a sudden 
 passion or malice prepense, but purely by accident, as by the flying 
 off of an axe-head, which is the instance here given, with which every 
 case of this kind was to be compared, and by it adjudged. See how human 
 life lies exposed daily, and what deaths we are often in, and what need 
 therefore we have to be always ready, our souls being continually in 
 our hands. How are the sons of men <I>snared in an evil time, when it 
 falls suddenly upon them!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>.

 An evil time indeed it is when this happens not only to the slain but
 to the slayer.

 (2.) It is supposed that the relations of the person slain would be 
 forward to avenge the blood, in affection to their friend and in zeal 
 for public justice. Though the law did not allow the avenging of any 
 other affront or injury with death, yet the avenger of blood, the blood 
 of a relation, shall have great allowances made for the heat of his 
 heart upon such a provocation as that, and his killing only, should not 
 be accounted murder if he did it before he got to the city of refuge, 
 though it is owned he was not worthy of death.  Thus would God possess 
 people with a great horror and dread of the sin of murder: if mere 
 chance-medley did thus expose a man, surely he that wilfully does 
 violence to the blood of any person, whether from an old grudge or upon 
 a sudden provocation, must flee to the pit, and <I>let no man stay 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:17">Prov. xxviii. 17</A>);

 yet the New Testament represents the sin of murder as more heinous and
 more dangerous than even this law does. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1 John iii. 15</A>,

 <I>You know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</I>

 (3.) It is provided that, if an avenger of blood should be so 
 unreasonable as to demand satisfaction for blood shed by accident only, 
 then the city of refuge should protect the slayer. Sins of ignorance 
 indeed do expose us to the wrath of God, but there is relief provided, 
 if by faith and repentance we make use of it. Paul that had been a 
 persecutor obtained mercy, because he did it ignorantly; and Christ 
 prayed for his crucifiers, <I>Father, forgive them, for they know not 
 what they do.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The appointing of three cities more for this use in case God should 
 hereafter enlarge their territories and the dominion of their religion, 
 that all those places which came under the government of the law of 
 Moses in other instances might enjoy the benefit of that law in this 
 instance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.
 
 Here is,

 (1.) An intimation of God's gracious intention to enlarge their coast, 
 as he had promised to their fathers, if they did not by their 
 disobedience forfeit the promise, the condition of which is here 
 carefully repeated, that, if it were not performed, the reproach might 
 lie upon them, and not on God. He promised to give it, <I>if thou shalt 
 keep all these commandments;</I> not otherwise.

 (2.) A direction to them to appoint three cities more in their new 
 conquests, which, the number intimates, should be as large as their 
 first conquests were; wherever the border of Israel went this privilege 
 must attend it, that <I>innocent blood be not shed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Though God is the saviour and preserver of all men, and has a tender
 regard to all lives, yet the blood of Israelites is in a particular 
 manner precious to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 The learned Ainsworth observes that the Jewish writers themselves own
 that, the condition not being performed, the promise of the enlarging 
 of their coast was never fulfilled; so that there was no occasion for 
 ever adding these three cities of refuge; yet the holy blessed God (say 
 they) <I>did not command it in vain, for in the days of Messiah the 
 prince</I> three other cities shall be added to these six: they expect 
 it to be fulfilled in the letter, but we know that in Christ it has its 
 spiritual accomplishment, for the borders of the gospel Israel are 
 enlarged according to the promise, and in Christ, <I>the Lord our 
 righteousness,</I> refuge is provided for those that by faith flee to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is provided that the cities of refuge should be no sanctuary or 
 shelter to a wilful murderer, but even thence he should be fetched, and 
 delivered to the avenger of blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.

 1. This shows that wilful murder must never be protected by the civil
 magistrate; he bears the sword of justice in vain if he suffers those 
 to escape the edge of it that lie under the guilt of blood, which he by 
 office is the avenger of. During the dominion of the papacy in our own 
 land, before the Reformation, there were some churches and religious 
 houses (as they called them) that were made sanctuaries for the 
 protection of all sorts of criminals that fled to them, wilful 
 murderers not excepted, so that (as Stamford says, in his <I>Pleas of 
 the Crown, lib.</I> II.  <I>c.</I> xxxviii.) the government follows not
 Moses but Romulus, and it was not till about the latter end of Henry 
 VIII's time that this privilege of sanctuary for wilful murder was 
 taken away, when in that, as in other cases, the word of God came to be 
 regarded more than the dictates of the see of Rome. And some have 
 thought it would be a completing of that instance of reformation if the 
 benefit of clergy were taken away for man-slaughter, that is, the 
 killing of a man upon a small provocation, since this law allowed 
 refuge only in case of that which our law calls chance-medley. 

 2. It may be alluded to to show that in Jesus Christ there is no refuge
 for presumptuous sinners, that <I>go on still in their trespasses.</I> 
 If we thus <I>sin wilfully,</I> sin and go on in it, there <I>remains 
 no sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:26">Heb. x. 26</A>.

 Those that flee to Christ from their sins shall be safe in him, but not
 those that expect to be sheltered by him in their sins. Salvation 
 itself cannot save such: divine justice will fetch them even from the 
 city of refuge, the protection of which they are not entitled to.</P>

 &nbsp; 15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any
 iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the
 mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall
 the matter be established.
 &nbsp; 16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify

 stand before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, before the priests and the judges, which

 unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
 &nbsp; 20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a statute for the preventing of frauds and perjuries; for the 
 divine law takes care of men's rights and properties, and has made a 
 hedge about them. Such a friend is it to human society and men's civil 
 interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A law against frauds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. Here is an implicit direction given to the first planters of Canaan
 to fix land-marks, according to the distribution of the land to the 
 several tribes and families by lot.  Note, It is the will of God that 
 every one should know his own, and that all good means should be used 
 to prevent encroachments and the doing and suffering of wrong. When 
 right is settled, care must be taken that it be not afterwards 
 unsettled, and that, if possible, no occasion of dispute may arise. 

 2.  An express law to posterity not to remove those land-marks which
 were thus fixed at first, by which a man secretly got that to himself 
 which was his neighbour's. This, without doubt, is a moral precept, and 
 still binding, and to us it forbids,

 (1.) The invading of any man's right, and taking to ourselves that
 which is not our own, by any fraudulent arts or practices, as by 
 forging, concealing, destroying, or altering deeds and writings (which 
 are our land-marks, to which appeals are made), or by shifting hedges, 
 meer-stones, and boundaries. Though the land-marks were set by the hand 
 of man, yet he was a thief and a robber by the law of God that removed 
 them. Let every man be content with his own lot, and just to his 
 neighbours, and then we shall have no land-marks removed. 

 (2.) It forbids the sowing of discord among neighbours, and doing any 
 thing to occasion strife and law-suits, which is done (and it is very 
 ill done) by confounding those things which should determine disputes 
 and decide controversies. And,

 (3.) It forbids breaking in upon the settled order and constitution of 
 civil government, and the altering of ancient usages without just 
 cause. This law supports the honour of prescriptions. <I>Consuetudo 
 facit jus--Custom is to be held as law.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law against perjuries, which enacts two things:--

 1. That a single witness should never be admitted to give evidence in a
 criminal cause, so as that sentence should be passed upon his 
 testimony, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 This law we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:30">Num. xxxv. 30</A>,

 and in this book,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:6"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 6</A>.

 This was enacted in favour to the prisoner, whose life and honour
 should not lie at the mercy of a particular person that had a pique 
 against him, and for caution to the accuser not to say that which he 
 could not corroborate by the testimony of another. It is a just shame 
 which this law puts upon mankind as false and not to be trusted; every 
 man is by it suspected: and it is the honour of God's grace that the 
 record he has given concerning his Son is confirmed both in heaven and 
 in earth by <I>three witnesses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7">1 John v. 7</A>.

 <I>Let God be true and every man a liar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:4">Rom. iii. 4</A>.

 2. That a false witness should incur the same punishment which was to
 have been inflicted upon the person he accused.  <I>If two, or 
 three,</I> or many witnesses, concurred in a false testimony, they were 
 all liable to be prosecuted upon this law.

 (2.) The person wronged or brought into peril by the false testimony is
 supposed to be the appellant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And yet if the person were put to death upon the evidence, and
 afterwards it appeared to be false, any other person, or the judges 
 themselves, <I>ex officio--by virtue of their office,</I> might call 
 the false witness to account.

 (3.) Causes of this kind, having more than ordinary difficulty in them,
 were to be brought before the supreme court, <I>The priests and 
 judges,</I> who are said to be <I>before the Lord,</I> because, as 
 other judges sat in the gates of their cities, so these at the gate of 
 the sanctuary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:12"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 12</A>.

 (4.) There must be great care in the trial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 A diligent inquisition must be made into the characters of the persons,
 and all the circumstances of the case, which must be compared, that the 
 truth might be found out, which, where it is thus faithfully and 
 impartially enquired into, Providence, it may be hoped, will 
 particularly advance the discovery of.

 (5.) If it appeared that a man had knowingly and maliciously borne
 false witness against his neighbour, though the mischief he designed 
 him thereby was not effected, he must undergo the same penalty which 
 his evidence would have brought his neighbour under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>Nec lex est justior ulla--Nor could any law be more just.</I> If the
 crime he accused his neighbour of was to be punished with death, the 
 false witness must be put to death; if with stripes, he must be beaten; 
 if with a pecuniary mulct, he was to be fined the sum. And because to 
 those who considered not the heinousness of the crime, and the 
 necessity of making this provision against it, it might seem hard to 
 punish a man so severely for a few words' speaking, especially when no 
 mischief did actually follow, it is added: <I>Thy eye shall not 
 pity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 No man needs to be more merciful than God. The benefit that will accrue
 to the public from this severity will abundantly recompense it: 
 <I>Those that remain shall hear and fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Such exemplary punishments will be warnings to others not to attempt
 any such mischief, when they see how he that <I>made the pit and digged 
 it has fallen into the ditch which he made.</I></P>
