 This chapter is concerning the lamps or lights of the sanctuary. 

 I. The burning lamps in the candlestick, which the priests were charged
 to tend,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The living lamps (if I may so call them), The
 Levites, who as ministers were burning and shining lights. The 
 ordination of the priests we had an account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:1-36">Lev. viii</A>.

 Here we have an
 account of the ordination of the Levites, the inferior clergy. 

 1. How they were purified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 2. How they were parted with by the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:9-10">
 ver. 9, 10</A>. 

 3. How they were presented to God in lieu of the firstborn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>.

 4. How they were consigned to Aaron and his sons, to be ministers to
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:19">ver. 19</A>.

 5. How all these orders were duly executed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 And, lastly, the age appointed for their ministration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:23-26">ver. 23</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the
 lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
 candlestick.
 &nbsp; 3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
 the candlestick, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 4 And this work of the candlestick <I>was of</I> beaten gold, unto
 the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, <I>was</I> beaten work:
 according unto the pattern which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had showed Moses, so he
 made the candlestick.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions were given long before this for the making of the golden 
 candlestick 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:31">Exod. xxv. 31</A>),

 and it was made according to the pattern shown to Moses in the mount,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:17">Exod. xxxviii. 17</A>.

 But now it was that the lamps were first ordered to be lighted, when
 other things began to be used. Observe,

 1. Who must light the lamps; Aaron himself, he <I>lighted the 
 lamps,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 As the people's representative to God, he thus did the office of a 
 servant in God's house, lighting his Master's candle; as the 
 representative of God to the people, he thus gave them the intimations 
 of God's will and favour, thus expressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:28">Ps. xviii. 28</A>),

 <I>Thou wilt light my candle;</I> and thus Aaron himself was now lately
 directed to bless the people, <I>The Lord make his face to shine upon 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:25"><I>ch.</I> vi. 25</A>.

 The commandment is a <I>lamp,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:23">Prov. vi. 23</A>.

 The scripture is <I>a light shining in a dark place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 And a dark place indeed even the church would be without it, as the
 tabernacle (which had no window in it) without the lamps. Now the work
 of ministers is to light these lamps, by expounding and applying the 
 word of God. The priest lighted the middle lamp from the fire of the 
 altar, and the rest of the lamps he lighted one from another, which 
 (says Mr. Ainsworth) signifies that the fountain of all light and 
 knowledge is in Christ, who has the <I>seven spirits of God</I> figured 
 by the <I>seven lamps of fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Rev. iv. 5</A>),

 but that in the expounding of scripture one passage must borrow light
 from another. He also supposes that, <I>seven</I> being a number of 
 perfection, by the seven branches of the candlestick is shown the full 
 perfection of the scriptures, which are able to make us wise to 
 salvation.

 2. To what end the lamps were lighted, that they might give light
 <I>over against the candlestick,</I> that is, to that part of the 
 tabernacle where the table stood, with the show-bread upon it, over 
 against the candlestick. They were not lighted like tapers in an urn,
 to burn to themselves, but to give light to the other side of the 
 tabernacle, for therefore candles are lighted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:15">Matt. v. 15</A>.

 Note, The lights of the world, the lights of the church, must shine as
 lights. Therefore we have light, that we may give light.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 6 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
 cleanse them.
 &nbsp; 7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
 water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh,
 and let them wash their clothes, and <I>so</I> make themselves clean.
 &nbsp; 8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
 <I>even</I> fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
 shalt thou take for a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
 congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
 children of Israel together:
 &nbsp; 10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and the
 children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:
 &nbsp; 11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> an
 offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
 service of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
 bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one <I>for</I> a sin offering, and
 the other <I>for</I> a burnt offering, unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to make an
 atonement for the Levites.
 &nbsp; 13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
 sons, and offer them <I>for</I> an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
 of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.
 &nbsp; 15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
 the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them,
 and offer them <I>for</I> an offering.
 &nbsp; 16 For they <I>are</I> wholly given unto me from among the children
 of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, <I>even instead of</I>
 the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
 unto me.
 &nbsp; 17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel <I>are</I> mine,
 <I>both</I> man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in
 the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
 &nbsp; 18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
 children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 19 And I have given the Levites <I>as</I> a gift to Aaron and to his
 sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the
 children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to
 make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no
 plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel
 come nigh unto the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the
 children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the
 children of Israel unto them.
 &nbsp; 21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their
 clothes; and Aaron offered them <I>as</I> an offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.
 &nbsp; 22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in
 the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
 sons: as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so
 did they unto them.
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 24 This <I>is it</I> that <I>belongeth</I> unto the Levites: from twenty
 and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
 service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
 &nbsp; 25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting
 upon the service <I>thereof,</I> and shall serve no more:
 &nbsp; 26 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
 the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
 Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read before of the separating of the Levites from among the children 
 of Israel when they were numbered, and the numbering of them by 
 themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:6,15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 6, 15</A>),

 that they might be employed in the service of the tabernacle. Now here
 we have directions given for their solemn ordination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and the performance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but
 were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were 
 distinguished from their neighbours, but they must be solemnly devoted 
 to God. Note, All that are employed for God must be dedicated to him, 
 according as the degree of employment is. Christian musts be baptized,
 ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, 
 and then our services. Observe in what method this was done:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Levites must be cleansed, and were so. The rites and ceremonies 
 of their cleansing were to be performed, 

 1. By themselves. They must <I>wash their clothes,</I> and not only 
 bathe, but <I>shave all their flesh,</I> as the leper was to do when he 
 was cleansed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:8">Lev. xiv. 8</A>.

 They must <I>cause a razor to pass over all their flesh,</I> to clear
 themselves from that defilement which would not wash off. Jacob, whom 
 God loved, was a smooth man; it was Esau that was hairy. The great 
 pains they were to take with themselves to make themselves clean 
 teaches all Christians, and ministers particularly, by repentance and 
 mortification, to <I>cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh 
 and spirit,</I> that they may <I>perfect holiness.</I> Those must be 
 clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.

 2. By Moses. He must <I>sprinkle the water of purifying upon them,</I>
 which was prepared by divine direction. This signified the application 
 of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, to purify us from an evil 
 conscience, that we may be fit to serve the living God. It is our duty 
 to cleanse ourselves, and God's promise that he will cleanse us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Levites, being thus prepared, must be brought before the Lord 
 in a solemn assembly of all Israel, and the <I>children of Israel</I> 
 must <I>put their hands upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 so transferring their interest in them and in their service (to which, 
 as a part, the whole body of the people was entitled) to God and to his 
 sanctuary. They presented them to God <I>as living sacrifices, holy and 
 acceptable,</I> to perform a <I>reasonable service;</I> and therefore, 
 as the offerers in all other cases did, <I>they laid their hands upon 
 them,</I> desiring that their service might be accepted in lieu of the 
 attendance of the whole congregation, particularly the first-born, 
 which they acknowledge God might have insisted on. This will not serve 
 to prove a power in the people to ordain ministers; for this imposition 
 of hands by the children of Israel upon the Levites did not make them 
 ministers of the sanctuary, but only signified the people's parting 
 with that tribe out of their militia, and civil incorporations, in 
 order to their being made ministers by Aaron, who was to offer them 
 before the Lord. All the congregation of the children of Israel could
 not lay hands on them, but it is probable that the rulers and elders 
 did it as the representative body of the people. Some think that the 
 first-born did it because in their stead the Levites were consecrated 
 to God. Whatever God calls for from us to serve his own glory by, we 
 must cheerfully resign it, lay our hands upon it, not to detain it but 
 to surrender it, and let it go to him that is entitled to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Sacrifices were to be offered for them, a sin-offering first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and then a burnt-offering, to make an <I>atonement for the Levites,</I> 
 who, as the parties concerned, were to lay their hands upon the head of 
 the sacrifices. See here,

 1. That we are all utterly unworthy and unfit to be admitted into and
 employed in the service of God, till atonement be made for sin, and 
 thereby our peace made with God. That interposing cloud must be 
 scattered before there can be any comfortable communion settled between 
 God and our souls. 

 2. That it is by sacrifice, by Christ the great sacrifice, that we are
 reconciled to God, and made fit to be offered to him. It is by him that 
 Christians are sanctified to the work of their Christianity, and 
 ministers to the work of their ministry. The learned bishop Patrick's 
 notion of the sacrifice offered by the Levites is that the Levites were 
 themselves considered as an expiatory sacrifice, for they were given to 
 <I>make atonement for the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and yet not being devoted to death, any more than the first-born were, 
 these two sacrifices were substituted in their stead, upon which 
 therefore they were to lay their hands, that the sin which the children 
 of Israel laid upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 might be transferred to these beasts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Levites themselves were <I>offered before the Lord</I> for an 
 <I>offering of the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Aaron gave them up to God, as being first given up by themselves, and 
 by the children of Israel. The original word signifies a 
 <I>wave-offering,</I> not that they were actually waved, but they were 
 presented to God as the God of heaven, and the Lord of the whole earth, 
 as the wave-offerings were. And in calling them wave-offerings it was
 intimated to them that they must continually lift up themselves towards 
 God in his service, lift up their eyes, lift up their hearts, and must 
 move to and fro with readiness in the business of their profession. 
 They were not ordained to be idle, but to be active and stirring.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God here declares his acceptance of them: <I>The Levites shall be 
 mine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 God took them instead of the first-born
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>),

 of which before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:4"><I>ch.</I> iii. 41</A>.

 Note, What is in sincerity offered to God shall be graciously owned and
 accepted by him. And his ministers who have obtained mercy of him to be 
 faithful have particular marks of favour and honour put upon them: 
 <I>they shall be mine,</I> and then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 they shall <I>go in to do the service of the tabernacle.</I> God takes 
 them for his own, that they may serve him. All that expect to share in
 the privileges of the tabernacle must resolve to do the service of the 
 tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his 
 necessary servants (he needs not the service of any of them), so, on 
 the other hand, none are taken merely as honorary servants, to do 
 nothing. All whom God owns he employs; angels themselves have their 
 services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They are then given as a gift to Aaron and his sons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 yet so as that the benefit accrued to the children of Israel.

 1. The Levites must act under the priests as attendants on them, and
 assistants to them, in the service of the sanctuary. Aaron offers them
 to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and then God gives them back to Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, Whatever we give up to God, he will give back to us unspeakably 
 to our advantage. Our hearts, our children, our estates, are never
 more ours, more truly, more comfortably ours, than when we have offered 
 them up to God.

 2. They must act for the people. They were taken to <I>do the service
 of the children of Israel,</I> that is, not only to do the service 
 which they should do, but to serve their interests, and do that which 
 would really redound to the honour, safety, and prosperity of the whole 
 nation. Note, Those that faithfully perform the service of God do one 
 of the best services that can be done to the public; God's ministers, 
 while they keep within the sphere of their office and conscientiously 
 discharge the duty of it, must be looked upon as some of the most 
 useful servants of their country. The children of Israel can as ill 
 spare the tribe of Levi as any of their tribes. But what is the
 service they do the children of Israel? It follows, it is to <I>make an 
 atonement for them, that there be no plague among them.</I> It was the 
 priests' work to make atonement by sacrifice, but the Levites made 
 atonement by attendance, and preserved the peace with heaven which was 
 made by sacrifice. If the service of the priests in the tabernacle had 
 been left to all the first-born of Israel promiscuously, it would have 
 been either neglected or done unskillfully and irreverently, being done 
 by those that were not so closely tied to it, nor so diligently trained 
 to it, nor so constantly used to it, as the Levites were; and this 
 would bring <I>a plague among the children of Israel</I>--meaning, 
 perhaps, the death of the first-born themselves, which was the last and 
 greatest of the plagues of Egypt. To prevent this, and to preserve the 
 atonement, the Levites were appointed to do this service, who should be 
 bred up to it under their parents from their infancy, and therefore 
 would be well versed in it; and so the children of Israel, that is, the 
 first-born, should not need to come nigh to the sanctuary; or, when any 
 Israelites had occasion, the Levites would be ready to instruct them, 
 and introduce them, and so prevent any fatal miscarriage or mistake.
 Note, It is a very great kindness to the church that ministers are 
 appointed to go before the people in the things of God, as guides, 
 overseers, and rulers, in religious worship, and to make that their 
 business. When Christ ascended on high, he <I>gave these gifts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8,11,12">Eph. iv. 8, 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The time of their ministration is fixed.

 1. They were to enter upon the service at twenty-five years old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They were not charged with the carrying of the tabernacle and the 
 utensils of it till they were thirty years old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3</A>.

 But they were entered to be otherwise serviceable at twenty-five years
 old, a very good age for ministers to begin their public work at. The 
 work then required that strength of body and the work now requires that 
 maturity of judgment and steadiness of behaviour which men rarely 
 arrive at till about that age; and novices are in danger of being 
 lifted up with pride.

 2. They were to have a writ of ease at fifty years old; then they were
 to return from the warfare, as the phrase is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 not cashiered with disgrace, but preferred rather to the rest which 
 their age required, to be loaded with the honours of their office, as 
 hitherto they had been with the burdens of it. They shall <I>minister 
 with their brethren in the tabernacle,</I> to direct the junior 
 Levites, and set them in; and they shall <I>keep the charge,</I> as 
 guards upon the avenues of the tabernacle, to see that no stranger 
 intruded, nor any person in his uncleanness, but they shall not be put 
 upon any service which may be a fatigue to them. If God's grace provide 
 that men shall have ability according to their work, man's prudence 
 should take care that men have work only according to their ability.
 The aged are most fit for trusts, and to keep the charge; the younger 
 are most fit for work, and to do the service. Those that have <I>used 
 the office of a servant well purchase to themselves a good degree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:13">1 Tim. iii. 13</A>.

 Yet indeed gifts are not tied to ages
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:9">Job xxxii. 9</A>),

 but <I>all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit.</I> Thus
 was the affair of the Levites settled.</P>
