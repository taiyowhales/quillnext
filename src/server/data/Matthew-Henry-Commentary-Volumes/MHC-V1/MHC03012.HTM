 After the laws concerning clean and unclean food come the laws 
 concerning clean and unclean persons; and the first is in this chapter 
 concerning the ceremonial uncleanness of women in child-birth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:1-5">
 ver. 1-5</A>.

 And concerning their purification from that uncleanness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:6-8">ver. 6</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
 conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean
 seven days; according to the days of the separation for her
 infirmity shall she be unclean.
 &nbsp; 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
 circumcised.
 &nbsp; 4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
 three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
 come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
 fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
 weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood
 of her purifying threescore and six days.

 The law here pronounces women lying-in ceremonially unclean. The Jews 
 say, "The law extended even to an abortion, if the child was so formed 
 as that the sex was distinguishable." 

 1. There was some time of strict separation immediately after the
 birth, which continued seven days for a son and fourteen for a 
 daughter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:2,5"><I>v.</I> 2, 5</A>.

 During these days she was separated from her husband and friends, and
 those that necessarily attended her were ceremonially unclean, which
 was one reason why the males were not circumcised till the eighth day,
 because they participated in the mother's pollution during the days of
 her separation. 

 2. There was also a longer time appointed for their purifying; 
 thirty-three days more (forty in all) if the birth were a male, and 
 double that time if a female,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 During this time they
 were only separated from the sanctuary and forbidden to eat of the 
 passover, or peace-offerings, or, if a priest's wife, to eat of any 
 thing that was holy to the Lord. Why the time of both those was double 
 for a female to what it was for a male I can assign no reason but the 
 will of the Law-maker; in Christ Jesus no difference is made of male 
 and female, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28,Col+3:11">Gal. iii. 28; Col. iii. 11</A>.

 But this ceremonial uncleanness which the law laid women in child-bed
 under was to signify the pollution of sin which we are all conceived 
 and born in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:5">Ps. li. 5</A>.

 For, if the root be impure, so is the branch, <I>Who can bring a clean
 thing out of an unclean?</I> If sin had not entered, nothing but purity 
 and honour had attended all the productions of that great blessing, 
 <I>Be fruitful and multiply;</I> but now that the nature of man is 
 degenerated the propagation of that nature is laid under these marks of 
 disgrace, because of the sin and corruption that are propagated with 
 it, and in remembrance of the curse upon the woman that was first in 
 the transgression. That <I>in sorrow</I> (to which it is here further 
 added <I>in shame</I>) she should <I>bring forth children.</I> And the 
 exclusion of the woman for so many days from the sanctuary, and all 
 participation of the holy things, signified that our original 
 corruption (that sinning sin which we brought into the world with us) 
 would have excluded us for ever from the enjoyment of God and his 
 favours if he had not graciously provided for our purifying.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
 or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
 burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin
 offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
 unto the priest:
 &nbsp; 7 Who shall offer it before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and make an atonement for
 her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This
 <I>is</I> the law for her that hath born a male or a female.
 &nbsp; 8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
 two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
 offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall
 make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

 A woman that had lain in, when the time set for her return to the 
 sanctuary had come, was not to attend there empty, but must bring her 
 offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. A <I>burnt-offering;</I> a lamb if she was able, if poor, a pigeon.
 This she was to offer in thankfulness to God for his mercy to her, in 
 bringing her safely through the pains of child-bearing and all the 
 perils of child-bed, and in desire and hopes of God's further favour 
 both to her and to the child. When a child is born there is joy and 
 there is hope, and therefore it was proper to bring this offering, 
 which was of a general nature; for what we rejoice in we must give 
 thanks for, and what we are in hopes of we must pray for. But, besides 
 this, 

 2. She must offer a <I>sin-offering,</I> which must be the same for 
 poor and rich, a turtle-dove or a young pigeon; for, whatever 
 difference there may be between rich and poor in the sacrifices of 
 acknowledgment, that of atonement is the same for both.  This 
 sin-offering was intended either,

 (1.) To complete her purification from that ceremonial uncleanness 
 which, though it was not in itself sinful, yet was typical of moral 
 pollution; or, 

 (2.) To make atonement for that which was really sin, either an
 inordinate desire of the blessing of children or discontent or 
 impatience under the pains of child-bearing. It is only by Christ, the 
 great sin-offering, that the corruption of our nature is done away, and 
 to that it is owing that we are not for ever excluded by it from the 
 sanctuary, and from eating of the holy things. According to this law, 
 we find that the mother of our blessed Lord, though he was not 
 conceived in sin as others, yet <I>accomplished the days of 
 purification,</I> and then presented her son to the Lord, being a 
 first-born, and brought her own offering, <I>a pair of 
 turtle-doves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:22-24">Luke ii. 22-24</A>.

 So poor were Christ's parents that they were not able to bring a lamb
 for a burnt-offering; and so early was Christ <I>made under the law, to 
 redeem those that were under it.</I> The morality of this law obliges 
 those women that have received mercy from God in child-bearing with all 
 thankfulness to own God's goodness to them, acknowledging themselves 
 unworthy of it, and (which is the best purification of women that have 
 been saved in child-bearing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:15">1 Tim. ii. 15</A>)

 to <I>continue in faith, and charity, and holiness, with sobriety;</I>
 for this shall please the Lord better than the turtle-doves or the 
 young pigeons.</P>
