 The eighth and ninth of the plagues of Egypt, that of locusts and that
 of darkness, are recorded in this chapter.

 I. Concerning the plague of locusts,

 1. God instructs Moses in the meaning of these amazing dispensations of
 his providence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. He threatens the locusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 3. Pharaoh, at the persuasion of his servants, is willing to treat
 again with Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>),

 but they cannot agree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 4. The locusts come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 5. Pharaoh cries Peccavi--I have offended 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 whereupon Moses prays for the removal of the plague, and it is done;
 but Pharaoh's heart is still hardened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 II. Concerning the plague of darkness,
 
 1. It is inflicted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.
 
 2. Pharaoh again treats with Moses about a surrender, but the treaty
 breaks off in a heat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:26-29">ver. 26</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
 hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might
 show these my signs before him:
 &nbsp; 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
 son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
 which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I <I>am</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse
 to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may
 serve me.
 &nbsp; 4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
 will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
 &nbsp; 5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot
 be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
 which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
 shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
 &nbsp; 6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
 servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy
 fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that
 they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself,
 and went out from Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
 be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
 said unto them, Go, serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God: <I>but</I> who <I>are</I> they
 that shall go?
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
 with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
 our herds will we go; for we <I>must hold</I> a feast unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 And he said unto them, Let the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be so with you, as I
 will let you go, and your little ones: look <I>to it;</I> for evil
 <I>is</I> before you.
 &nbsp; 11 Not so: go now ye <I>that are</I> men, and serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for
 that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
 presence.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Moses is instructed. We may well suppose that he, for his part, was 
 much astonished both at Pharaoh's obstinacy and at God's severity, and 
 could not but be compassionately concerned for the desolations of 
 Egypt, and at a loss to conceive what this contest would come to at 
 last. Now here God tells him what he designed, not only Israel's 
 release, but the magnifying of his own name: <I>That thou mayest 
 tell</I> in thy writings, which shall continue to the world's end, 
 <I>what I have wrought in Egypt,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 The ten plagues of Egypt must be inflicted, that they may be recorded 
 for the generations to come as undeniable proofs, 

 1. Of God's overruling power in the kingdom of nature, his dominion 
 over all the creatures, and his authority to use them either as 
 servants to his justice or sufferers by it, according to the counsel of 
 his will. 

 2. Of God's victorious power over the kingdom of Satan, to restrain the 
 malice and chastise the insolence of his and his church's enemies.
 These plagues are standing monuments of the greatness of God, the 
 happiness of the church, and the sinfulness of sin, and standing 
 monitors to the children of men in all ages not to <I>provoke the Lord 
 to jealousy</I> nor to <I>strive with their Maker.</I> The benefit of 
 these instructions to the world sufficiently balances the expense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pharaoh is reproved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thus saith the Lord God of the</I> poor, despised, persecuted, 
 Hebrews, <I>How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me?</I> 
 Note, It is justly expected from the greatest of men that they humble 
 themselves before the great God, and it is at their peril if they 
 refuse to do it. This has more than once been God's quarrel with 
 princes. Belshazzar did not humble his heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:22">Dan. v. 22</A>.

 Zedekiah humbled not himself before Jeremiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12">2 Chron. xxxvi. 12</A>.

 Those that will not humble themselves God will humble. Pharaoh had
 sometimes pretended to humble himself, but no account was made of it, 
 because he was neither sincere nor constant in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The plague of locusts is threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 The hail had broken down the fruits of the earth, but these locusts 
 should come and devour them: and not only so, but they should fill 
 their houses, whereas the former inroads of these insects had been 
 confined to their lands. This should be much worse than all the 
 calamities of that king which had ever been known. Moses, when he had 
 delivered his message, not expecting any better answer than he had 
 formerly, <I>turned himself and went out from</I> Pharaoh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Thus Christ appointed his disciples to depart from those who would not 
 receive them, and to <I>shake off the dust of their feet for a 
 testimony against them;</I> and ruin is not far off from those who are 
 thus justly abandoned by the Lord's messengers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27">1 Sam. xv. 27</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Pharaoh's attendants, his ministers of state, or privy-counsellors, 
 interpose, to persuade him to come to some terms with Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They, as in duty bound, represent to him the deplorable condition of 
 the kingdom (<I>Egypt is destroyed</I>), and advise him by all means to
 release his prisoners (<I>Let the men go</I>); for Moses, they found,
 would be a snare to them till it was done, and it were better to 
 consent at first than to be compelled at last. The Israelites had 
 become a burdensome stone to the Egyptians, and now, at length, the 
 princes of Egypt were willing to be rid of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.

 Note, It is a thing to be regretted (and prevented, if possible) that a
 whole nation should be ruined for the pride and obstinacy of its 
 princes, <I>Salus populi suprema lex--To consult the welfare of the 
 people is the first of laws.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A new treaty is, hereupon, set on foot between Pharaoh and Moses, in
 which Pharaoh consents for the Israelites to go into the wilderness to 
 do sacrifice; but the matter in dispute was who should go, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. Moses insists that they should take their whole families, and all 
 their effects, along with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, Those that serve God must serve him with all they have. Moses 
 pleads, "We must hold a feast, therefore we must have our families to 
 feast with, and our flocks and herds to feast upon, to the honour of 
 God." 

 2. Pharaoh will by no means grant this: he will allow the men to go, 
 pretending that this was all they desired, though this matter was never 
 yet mentioned in any of the former treaties; but, for the <I>little 
 ones,</I> he resolves to keep them as hostages, to oblige them to 
 return,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 In a great passion he curses them, and threatens that, if they offer to 
 remove their little ones, they will do it at their peril. Note, Satan 
 does all he can to hinder those that serve God themselves from bringing 
 their children in to serve him. He is a sworn enemy to early piety, 
 knowing how destructive it is to the interests of his kingdom; whatever 
 would hinder us from engaging our children to the utmost in God's 
 service, we have reason to suspect the hand of Satan in it. 

 3. The treaty, hereupon, breaks off abruptly; those that before went 
 out from Pharaoh's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 were now driven out. Those will quickly hear their doom that cannot 
 bear to hear their duty. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.

 <I>Quos Deus destruet eos dementat--Whom God intends to destroy he
 delivers up to infatuation.</I> Never was man so infatuated to his own 
 ruin as Pharaoh was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over
 the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
 land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, <I>even</I> all that
 the hail hath left.
 &nbsp; 13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
 all <I>that</I> night; <I>and</I> when it was morning, the east wind
 brought the locusts.
 &nbsp; 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and
 rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous <I>were they;</I>
 before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after
 them shall be such.
 &nbsp; 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the
 land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and
 all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
 remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the
 field, through all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he
 said, I have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and against you.
 &nbsp; 17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once,
 and intreat the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, that he may take away from me this
 death only.
 &nbsp; 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> turned a mighty strong west wind, which took
 away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
 not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 20 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
 let the children of Israel go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The invasion of the land by the locusts--<I>God's great army,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:11">Joel ii. 11</A>.

 God bids <I>Moses stretch out his hand</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 to beckon them, as it were (for they came at a call), and he
 <I>stretched forth his rod,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:22,23"><I>ch.</I> ix. 22, 23</A>.

 Moses ascribes it to the stretching out, not of his own hand, but the
 <I>rod of God,</I> the instituted sign of God's presence with him. The 
 locusts obey the summons, and fly upon the wings of the wind, the east 
 wind, and <I>caterpillars without number,</I> as we are told,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:34,35">Ps. cv. 34, 35</A>.

 A formidable army of horse and foot might more easily have been
 resisted than this host of insects. Who then is able to stand before 
 the great God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The desolations they made in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 They <I>covered the face of the earth,</I> and <I>ate up the fruit</I> 
 of it. The earth God has <I>given to the children of men;</I> yet, when 
 God pleases, he can disturb their possession and send locusts and 
 caterpillars to force them out. Herbs grow <I>for the service of 
 man;</I> yet, when God pleases, those contemptible insects shall not 
 only be fellow-commoners with him, but shall plunder him, and eat the 
 bread out of his mouth. Let our labour be, not for the habitation and
 meat which thus lie exposed, but for those which <I>endure to eternal 
 life,</I> which cannot be thus invaded, nor thus corrupted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Pharaoh's admission, hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 He had driven Moses and Aaron from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 telling them (it is likely) he would have no more to do with them. But 
 now he calls for them again in all haste, and makes court to them with 
 as much respect as before he had dismissed them with disdain. Note, The 
 day will come when those who set at nought their counsellors, and 
 despise all their reproofs, will be glad to make an interest in them 
 and engage them to intercede on their behalf. The foolish virgins court 
 the wise to <I>give them of their oil;</I> and see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:6">Ps. cxli. 6</A>.

 1. Pharaoh confesses his fault: <I>I have sinned against the Lord your
 God, and against you.</I> He now sees his own folly in the slights and 
 affronts he had put on God and his ambassadors, and <I>seems</I> at 
 least, to repent of it. When God convinces men of sin, and humbles them 
 for it, their contempt of God's ministers, and the word of the Lord in 
 their mouths, will certainly come into the account, and lie heavily 
 upon their consciences. Some think that when Pharaoh said, "The L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>your</I> God," he did in effect say, "The 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall not be <I>my</I> God." Many 
 treat with God as a potent enemy, whom they are willing not to be at 
 war with, but care not for treating with him as their rightful prince, 
 to whom they are willing to submit with loyal affection. True penitents 
 lament sin as committed against God, even their own God, to whom they 
 stand obliged. 

 2. He begs pardon, not of God, as penitents ought, but of Moses, which 
 was more excusable in him, because, by a special commission, Moses was 
 made a <I>god to Pharaoh,</I> and <I>whosesoever sins he remitted</I> 
 they were forgiven; when he prays, <I>Forgive this once,</I> he, in 
 effect, promises not to offend in like manner any more, yet seems loth 
 to express that promise, nor does he say any thing particularly of 
 letting the people go. Note, Counterfeit repentance commonly cheats men 
 with general promises and is loth to covenant against particular sins. 
 
 3. He entreats Moses and Aaron to pray for him. There are those who, in
 distress, implore the help of other persons' prayers, but have no mind 
 to pray for themselves, showing thereby that they have no true love to 
 God, nor any delight in communion with him. Pharaoh desires their 
 prayers <I>that this death</I> only might be taken away, not <I>this 
 sin:</I> he deprecates the plague of locusts, not the plague of a hard 
 heart, which yet was much the more dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The removal of the judgment, upon the prayer of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 This was, 

 1. As great an instance of the power of God as the judgment itself. An 
 east wind brought the locusts, and now a west wind carried them off. 
 Note, Whatever point of the compass the wind is in, it is fulfilling 
 God's word, and turns about by his counsel. The <I>wind bloweth where 
 it listeth,</I> as it respects any control of ours; not so as it 
 respects the control of God: he <I>directeth it under the whole 
 heaven.</I> 

 2. It was as great a proof of the authority of Moses, and as firm a 
 ratification of his commission and his interest in that God who both 
 <I>makes peace</I> and <I>creates evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7">Isa. xlv. 7</A>.

 Nay, hereby he not only commanded the respect, but recommended himself 
 to the good affections of the Egyptians, inasmuch as, while the 
 judgment came in obedience to his summons, the removal of it was in 
 answer to his prayers. He never desired the woeful day, though he 
 threatened it. His commission indeed ran against Egypt, but his 
 intercession was for it, which was a good reason why they should love 
 him, though they feared him. 

 3. It was also as strong an argument for their repentance as the 
 judgment itself; for by this it appeared that God is ready to forgive, 
 and swift to show mercy. If he turn away a particular judgment, as he 
 did often from Pharaoh, or defer it, as in Ahab's case, upon the 
 profession of repentance and the outward tokens of humiliation, what 
 will he do if we be sincere, and how welcome will true penitents be to 
 him! O that this goodness of God might lead us to repentance!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Pharaoh's return to his impious resolution again not to let the 
 people go 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 through the righteous hand of God upon him, hardening his heart, and 
 confirming him in his obstinacy. Note, Those that have often baffled 
 their convictions, and stood it out against them, forfeit the benefit 
 of them, and are justly given up to those lusts of their own hearts 
 which (how strong soever their convictions) prove too strong for 
 them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
 heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even
 darkness <I>which</I> may be felt.
 &nbsp; 22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
 was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
 &nbsp; 23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place
 for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
 dwellings.
 &nbsp; 24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
 little ones also go with you.
 &nbsp; 25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
 offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 &nbsp; 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
 left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God;
 and we know not with what we must serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, until we come
 thither.
 &nbsp; 27 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
 them go.
 &nbsp; 28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
 thyself, see my face no more; for in <I>that</I> day thou seest my
 face thou shalt die.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
 again no more.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The plague of darkness brought upon Egypt, and a most dreadful 
 plague it was, and therefore is put first of the ten in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:28">Ps. cv. 28</A>,

 though it was one of the last; and in the destruction of the spiritual
 Egypt it is produced by the fifth vial, which is poured out upon the 
 <I>seat of the beast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:10">Rev. xvi. 10</A>.

 <I>His kingdom was full of darkness.</I> Observe particularly
 concerning this plague, 

 1. That it was a total darkness. We have reason to think, not only that 
 the lights of heaven were clouded, but that all their fires and candles 
 were put out by the damps or clammy vapours which were the cause of 
 this darkness; for it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 They <I>saw not one another.</I> It is threatened to the wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5,6">Job xviii. 5, 6</A>)

 that the <I>spark of his fire shall not shine</I> (even <I>the sparks
 of his own kindling,</I> as they are called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>),

 and that the <I>light shall be dark in his tabernacle.</I> Hell is
 <I>utter darkness.</I> The light of <I>a candle shall shine no more at 
 all in thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:23">Rev. xviii. 23</A>.

 2. That it was darkness which <I>might be felt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 felt in its <I>causes</I> by their fingers' ends (so thick were the 
 fogs), felt in its <I>effects,</I> some think, by their eyes, which 
 were pricked with pain, and made the more sore by their rubbing them. 
 Great pain is spoken of as the effect of that darkness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:10">Rev. xvi. 10</A>,

 which alludes to this. 

 3. No doubt it astonished and terrified them. The cloud of locusts,
 which had <I>darkened the land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 was nothing to this. The tradition of the Jews is that in this darkness 
 they were terrified by the apparitions of evil spirits, or rather by 
 dreadful sounds and murmurs which they made, or (which is no less 
 frightful) by the horrors of their own consciences; and this is the 
 plague which some think is intended (for, otherwise, it is not 
 mentioned at all there) 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:49">Ps. lxxviii. 49</A>,

 <I>He poured upon them the fierceness of his anger, by sending evil
 angels among them;</I> for to those to whom the devil has been a 
 deceiver he will, at length, be a terror. 

 4. It continued three days, <I>six nights</I> (says bishop Hall) <I>in 
 one;</I> so long they were imprisoned by those chains of darkness, and 
 the most lightsome palaces were perfect dungeons. No <I>man rose from 
 his place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They were all confined to their houses; and such a terror seized them 
 that few of them had the courage to go from the chair to the bed, or 
 from the bed to the chair. Thus were they <I>silent in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9">1 Sam. ii. 9</A>.

 Now Pharaoh had time to consider, if he would have improved it.
 Spiritual darkness is spiritual bondage; while Satan blinds men's eyes 
 that they see not, he binds their hands and feet that they work not for
 God, nor move towards heaven. They <I>sit in darkness.</I> 

 5. It was a righteous thing with God thus to punish them. Pharaoh and 
 his people had rebelled against the light of God's word, which Moses 
 spoke to them; justly therefore are they punished with darkness, for 
 they loved it and chose it rather. The blindness of their minds brings
 upon them this darkness of the air. Never was mind so blinded as
 Pharaoh's, never was air so darkened as Egypt's. The Egyptians by their 
 cruelty would have extinguished the lamp of Israel, and quenched their 
 coal; justly therefore does God put out their lights. Compare it with 
 the punishment of the Sodomites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:11">Gen. xix. 11</A>.

 Let us dread the consequences of sin; if three days' darkness was so
 dreadful, what will everlasting darkness be? 

 6. The children of Israel, at the same time, had <I>light in their 
 dwellings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 not only in the land of Goshen, where most of them dwelt, but in the 
 habitations of those who were dispersed among the Egyptians: for that 
 some of them were thus dispersed appears from the distinction 
 afterwards appointed to be put on their door-posts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:7"><I>ch.</I> xii. 7</A>.

 This is an instance, 

 (1.) Of the power of God above the ordinary power of nature. We must
 not think that we share in common mercies as a matter of course, and 
 therefore that we owe no thanks to God for them; he could distinguish, 
 and withhold that from us which he grants to other. He does indeed
 ordinarily make his sun to shine on the just and unjust; but he could 
 make a difference, and we must own ourselves indebted to his mercy that 
 he does not. 

 (2.) Of the particular favour he bears to his people: they <I>walk in
 the light</I> when others <I>wander</I> endlessly <I>in thick 
 darkness;</I> wherever there is an Israelite indeed, though in this 
 dark world, there is light, there is a <I>child of light,</I> one for 
 whom <I>light is sown,</I> and whom the <I>day-spring from on high 
 visits.</I> When God made this difference between the Israelites and 
 the Egyptians, who would not have preferred the poorest cottage of an 
 Israelite to the finest palace of an Egyptian? There is still a real 
 difference, though not so discernible a one, between the house of the 
 wicked, which is under a curse, and the habitation of the just, which 
 is blessed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33">Prov. iii. 33</A>.

 We should believe in that difference, and govern ourselves accordingly.
 Upon

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:28">Ps. cv. 28</A>,

 <I>He sent darkness and made it dark, and they rebelled not against his
 word,</I> some ground a conjecture that, during these three days of 
 darkness, the Israelites were circumcised, in order to their 
 celebrating the passover which was now approaching, and that the 
 command which authorized this was the word against which they rebelled 
 not; for their circumcision, when they entered Canaan, is spoken of as 
 a second general circumcision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Josh+5:2">Josh. v. 2</A>.

 During these three days of darkness to the Egyptians, if God had so
 pleased, the Israelites, by the light which they had, might have made 
 their escape, and without asking leave of Pharaoh; but God would bring 
 them out <I>with a high hand,</I> and not by stealth, nor in haste,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:12">Isa. lii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the impression made upon Pharaoh by this plague, much like 
 that of the foregoing plagues. 

 1. It awakened him so far that he renewed the treaty with Moses and 
 Aaron, and now, at length, consented that they should take their little 
 ones with them, only he would have their cattle left in pawn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 It is common for sinners thus to bargain with God Almighty. Some sins 
 they will leave, but not all; they will leave their sins for a time, 
 but they will not bid them a final farewell; they will allow him some 
 share in their hearts, but the world and the flesh must share with him: 
 thus they mock God, but they deceive themselves. Moses resolves not to 
 abate in his terms: <I>Our cattle shall go with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Note, The terms of reconciliation are so fixed that though men dispute 
 them ever so long they cannot possibly alter them, nor bring them 
 lower. We must come up to the demands of God's will, for we cannot 
 expect he should condescend to the provisos of our lusts. God's 
 messengers must always be bound up by that rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19">Jer. xv. 19</A>),

 <I>Let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</I> Moses
 gives a very good reason why they must take their cattle with them; 
 they must go to do sacrifice, and therefore they must take wherewithal. 
 What numbers and kinds of sacrifices would be required they did not yet 
 know, and therefore they must take all they had. Note, With ourselves, 
 and our children, we must devote all our worldly possessions to the 
 service of God, because we know not what use God will make of what we 
 have, nor in what way we may be called upon to honour God with it. 

 2. Yet it exasperated him so far that, when he might not make his own
 terms, he broke off the conference abruptly, and took up a resolution 
 to treat no more. Wrath now came upon him to the utmost, and he became 
 outrageous beyond all bounds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Moses is dismissed in anger, forbidden the court upon pain of death,
 forbidden so much as to meet Pharaoh any more, as he had been used to
 do, by the river's side: <I>In that day thou seest my face, thou shalt
 die.</I> Prodigious madness! Had he not found that Moses could plague
 him without seeing his face? Or had he forgotten how often he had sent
 for Moses as his physician to heal him and ease him of his plagues? and
 must he now be bidden to come near him no more? Impotent malice! To
 threaten him with death who was armed with such a power, and at whose
 mercy he had so often laid himself. What will not hardness of heart and
 contempt of God's word and commandments bring men to? Moses takes him
 at his word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>I will see thy face no more,</I> that is, "after this time;" for 
 this conference did not break off till 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:8"><I>ch.</I> xi. 8</A>,

 when Moses went out <I>in a great anger,</I> and told Pharaoh how soon
 he would change his mind, and his proud spirit would come down, which 
 was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:31"><I>ch.</I> xii. 31</A>),

 when Pharaoh became a humble supplicant to Moses to depart. So that,
 after this interview, Moses came no more, till he was sent for. Note,
 When men drive God's word from them he justly permits their delusions, 
 and answers them according to the multitude of their idols. When the
 Gadarenes desired Christ to depart, he presently left them.</P>
