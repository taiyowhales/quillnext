 Orders being given for the fitting up of the place of worship, in this 
 and the following chapter care is taken about the priests that were to 
 minister in this holy place, as the menial servants of the God of 
 Israel. He hired servants, as a token of his purpose to reside among 
 them. In this chapter, 

 I. He pitches upon the persons who should be his servants,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He appoints their livery; their work was holy, and so must their
 garments be, and unanswerable to the glory of the house which was now 
 to be erected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>. 

 1. He appoints the garments of his head-servant, the high priest, which
 were very rich. 
 
 (1.) An ephod and girdle,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:6-14">ver. 6-14</A>. 

 (2.) A breast-plate of judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:15-29">ver. 15-29</A>), 

 in which must be put the urim and thummim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:30">ver. 30</A>. 
 
 (3.) The robe of the ephod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>.
 
 (4.) The mitre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:36-39">ver. 36-39</A>.
 
 2. The garments of the inferior priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:40-43">ver. 40-43</A>.

 And these also were shadows of good things to come.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
 him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto
 me in the priest's office, <I>even</I> Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
 and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.
 &nbsp; 2 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
 glory and for beauty.
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt speak unto all <I>that are</I> wise hearted, whom I
 have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's
 garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the
 priest's office.
 &nbsp; 4 And these <I>are</I> the garments which they shall make; a
 breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
 mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron
 thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the
 priest's office.
 &nbsp; 5 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
 and fine linen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The priests nominated: <I>Aaron and his sons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Hitherto every master of a family was priest to his own family, and 
 offered, as he saw cause, upon altars of earth; but now that the 
 families of Israel began to be incorporated into a nation, and a 
 <I>tabernacle of the congregation</I> was to be erected, as a visible 
 centre of their unity, it was requisite there should be a public 
 priesthood instituted. Moses, who had hitherto officiated, and is 
 therefore reckoned among the <I>priests of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:6">Ps. xcix. 6</A>),

 had enough to do as their prophet to consult the oracle for them, and 
 as their prince to judge among them; nor was he desirous to engross all 
 the honours to himself, or to entail that of the priesthood, which 
 alone was hereditary, upon his own family, but was very well pleased to 
 see his brother Aaron invested in this office, and his sons after him, 
 while (how great soever he was) his sons after him would be but common 
 Levites. It is an instance of the humility of that great man, and an 
 evidence of his sincere regard for the glory of God, that he had so 
 little regard to the preferment of his own family. Aaron, who had 
 humbly served as a prophet to his younger brother Moses, and did not 
 decline the office 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1"><I>ch.</I> vii. 1</A>),

 is now advanced to be a priest, a high priest to God; for he will exalt
 those that abase themselves. Nor could any man have <I>taken this
 honour to himself,</I> but he that was <I>called of God to it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4">Heb. v. 4</A>.

 God had said of Israel in general that they should be to him a
 <I>kingdom of priests,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6"><I>ch.</I> xix. 6</A>.

 But because it was requisite that those who ministered at the altar
 should give themselves wholly to the service, and because that which is 
 every body's work will soon come to be nobody's work, God here chose 
 from among them one to be a family of priests, the father and his four 
 sons; and from Aaron's loins descended all the priests of the Jewish 
 church, of whom we read so often, both in the Old Testament and in the 
 New. A blessed thing it is when real holiness goes, as the ceremonial 
 holiness did, by succession in a family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The priests' garments appointed, <I>for glory and beauty,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Some of the richest materials were to be provided 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and the best artists employed in the making of them, whose skill God, 
 by a <I>special gift</I> for this purpose, would improve to a very high 
 degree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, Eminence, even in common arts, is a gift of God, it comes from 
 him, and, as there is occasion, it ought to be used for him. He that
 teaches the husbandman discretion teaches the tradesman also; both 
 therefore ought to honour God with their gain. Human learning ought 
 particularly to be consecrated to the service of the priesthood, and 
 employed for the adorning of those that minister about holy things.
 The garments appointed were, 

 1. Four, which both the high priest and the inferior priests wore, 
 namely, the linen breeches, the linen coat, the linen girdle which 
 fastened it to them, and the bonnet or turban; that which the high 
 priest wore is called <I>a mitre.</I> 

 2. Four more, which were peculiar to the high priest, namely, the 
 ephod, with the curious girdle of it, the breast-plate of judgment, the 
 long robe with the bells and pomegranates at the bottom of it, and the 
 golden plate on his forehead. These glorious garments were appointed,

 (1.) That the priests themselves might be reminded of the dignity of
 their office, and might behave themselves with due decorum. 

 (2.) That the people might thereby be possessed with a holy reverence
 of that God whose ministers appeared in such grandeur. 

 (3.) That the priests might be types of Christ, who should offer
 himself without spot to God, and of all Christians, who have the beauty 
 of holiness put upon them, in which they are consecrated to God. Our 
 adorning, now under the gospel, both that of ministers and Christians, 
 is not to be of gold, and pearl, and costly array, but the <I>garments 
 of salvation, and the robe of righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10,Ps+132:9,16">Isa. lxi. 10; Ps. cxxxii. 9, 16</A>.

 As the filthy garments wherewith Joshua the high priest was clothed
 signified the iniquity which cleaved to his priesthood, from which care 
 was taken that it should be purged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:3,4">Zech. iii. 3, 4</A>),

 so those <I>holy garments</I> signified the perfect purity that there
 is in the priesthood of Christ; he is holy, harmless, and 
 undefiled.</P>

 purple, <I>of</I> scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.
 &nbsp; 7 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the
 two edges thereof; and <I>so</I> it shall be joined together.
 &nbsp; 8 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which <I>is</I> upon it,
 shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; <I>even of</I>
 gold, <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
 &nbsp; 9 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
 names of the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 10 Six of their names on one stone, and <I>the other</I> six names
 of the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.
 &nbsp; 11 With the work of an engraver in stone, <I>like</I> the engravings
 of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
 the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches
 of gold.
 &nbsp; 12 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
 ephod <I>for</I> stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
 Aaron shall bear their names before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> upon his two
 shoulders for a memorial.
 &nbsp; 13 And thou shalt make ouches <I>of</I> gold;
 &nbsp; 14 And two chains <I>of</I> pure gold at the ends; <I>of</I> wreathen
 work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
 ouches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions are here given concerning the ephod, which was the outmost 
 garment of the high priest. <I>Linen</I> ephods were worn by the 
 inferior priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:18">1 Sam. xxii. 18</A>.

 Samuel wore one when he was a child 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:18">1 Sam. ii. 18</A>),

 and David when he danced before the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:14">2 Sam. vi. 14</A>);

 but this which the high priest only wore was called a <I>golden
 ephod,</I> because there was a great deal of gold woven into it. It was 
 a short coat without sleeves, buttoned closely to him, with a curious 
 girdle of the same stuff

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>);

 the shoulder-pieces were buttoned together with two precious stones set 
 in gold, one on each shoulder, on which were engraven the names of the 
 <I>children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:9-12"><I>v.</I> 9-12</A>.

 In allusion to this, 

 1. Christ our high priest appeared to John <I>girt about the breast 
 with a golden girdle,</I> such as was the curious girdle of the ephod,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:13">Rev. i. 13</A>.

 Righteousness is the girdle of his loins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:6">Isa. xi. 6</A>),

 and should be of ours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:14">Eph. vi. 14</A>.

 He is girt with strength for the work of our salvation, and is ready
 for it. 

 2. The government is said to be <I>upon his shoulders</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>),

 as Aaron had the names of all Israel upon his shoulders in precious
 stone. He presents to himself and to his Father <I>a glorious 
 church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27">Eph. v. 27</A>.

 He has power to support them, interest to recommend them, and it is in
 him that they are remembered with honour and favour. He bears them 
 before the Lord <I>for a memorial</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 in token of his <I>appearing before God</I> as the representative of 
 all Israel and an advocate for them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
 work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; <I>of</I> gold,
 <I>of</I> blue, and <I>of</I> purple, and <I>of</I> scarlet, and <I>of</I> fine
 twined linen, shalt thou make it.
 &nbsp; 16 Foursquare it shall be <I>being</I> doubled; a span <I>shall be</I>
 the length thereof, and a span <I>shall be</I> the breadth thereof.
 &nbsp; 17 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, <I>even</I> four
 rows of stones: <I>the first</I> row <I>shall be</I> a sardius, a topaz,
 and a carbuncle: <I>this shall be</I> the first row.
 &nbsp; 18 And the second row <I>shall be</I> an emerald, a sapphire, and a
 diamond.
 &nbsp; 19 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
 &nbsp; 20 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
 shall be set in gold in their inclosings.
 &nbsp; 21 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
 Israel, twelve, according to their names, <I>like</I> the engravings
 of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to
 the twelve tribes.
 &nbsp; 22 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends
 <I>of</I> wreathen work <I>of</I> pure gold.
 &nbsp; 23 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
 and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
 &nbsp; 24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen <I>chains</I> of gold in the
 two rings <I>which are</I> on the ends of the breastplate.
 &nbsp; 25 And <I>the other</I> two ends of the two wreathen <I>chains</I> thou
 shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put <I>them</I> on the
 shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.
 &nbsp; 26 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put
 them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
 which <I>is</I> in the side of the ephod inward.
 &nbsp; 27 And two <I>other</I> rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
 them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
 forepart thereof, over against the <I>other</I> coupling thereof,
 above the curious girdle of the ephod.
 &nbsp; 28 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof
 unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that <I>it</I> may be
 above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate
 be not loosed from the ephod.
 &nbsp; 29 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
 the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto
 the holy <I>place,</I> for a memorial before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> continually.
 &nbsp; 30 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim
 and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
 goeth in before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
 the children of Israel upon his heart before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 continually.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The most considerable of the ornaments of the high priest was this 
 breast-plate, a rich piece of cloth, curiously wrought with gold and 
 purple, &c., two spans long and a span broad, so that, being doubled, 
 it was a span square, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was fastened to the ephod with wreathen chains of gold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:13,14,22"><I>v.</I> 13, 14, 22</A>,

 &c.) both at top and bottom, so that <I>the breast-plate might not be 
 loosed from the ephod,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The ephod was the garment of service; the breast-plate of judgment was 
 an emblem of honour: these two must by no means be separated. If any 
 man will <I>minister unto the Lord,</I> and <I>do his will,</I> he 
 shall <I>know his doctrine.</I> In this breast-plate,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tribes of Israel were recommended to God's favour in twelve 
 precious stones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:17-21,29"><I>v.</I> 17-21, 29</A>.

 Some question whether Levi had a precious stone with his name or no. If 
 not, Ephraim and Manasseh were reckoned distinct, as Jacob had said 
 they should be, and the high priest himself, being head of the tribe of 
 Levi, sufficiently represented that tribe. If there was a stone for 
 Levi, as is intimated by this, that they were <I>engraven according to 
 their birth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 Ephraim and Manasseh were one in Joseph. Aaron was to bear their names 
 for a <I>memorial before the Lord continually,</I> being <I>ordained 
 for men,</I> to represent them in things pertaining to God, herein 
 typifying our great high priest, who always appears in the presence of 
 God for us. 

 1. Though the people were forbidden to come near, and obliged to keep 
 their distance, yet by the high priest, who had their names on his 
 breast-plate, they entered into the holiest; so believers, even while 
 they are here on this earth, not only <I>enter into the holiest,</I> 
 but by faith are made to <I>sit with Christ in heavenly places,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:6">Eph. ii. 6</A>.

 2. The name of each tribe was engraven in a precious stone, to signify
 how precious, in God's sight, believers are, and how honourable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.

 They shall be his in the day he <I>makes up his jewels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:17">Mal. iii. 17</A>.

 How small and poor soever the tribe was, it was a precious stone in the 
 breast-plate of the high priest; thus are all the saints dear to 
 Christ, and his delight is in them as the excellent ones of the earth, 
 however men may esteem them as <I>earthen pitchers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:2">Lam. iv. 2</A>.

 3. The high priest had the names of the tribes both on his shoulders and
 on his breast, intimating both the power and the love with which our 
 Lord Jesus intercedes for those that are his. He not only bears them
 up <I>upon his heart,</I> as the expression here is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 <I>carries them in his bosom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>),

 with the most tender affection. How near should Christ's name be to our
 hearts, since he is pleased to lay our names so near his! and what a 
 comfort it is to us, in all our addresses to God, that the great high 
 priest of our profession has the names of all his Israel upon his 
 breast before the Lord <I>for a memorial,</I> presenting them to God as 
 the people of his choice, who were to be made <I>accepted in the 
 beloved!</I> Let not any good Christians fear that God has forgotten 
 them, nor question his being mindful of them upon all occasions, when 
 they are not only engraven upon the <I>palms of his hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:16">Isa. xlix. 16</A>),

 but engraven upon the heart of the great intercessor. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6">Cant. viii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The urim and thummim, by which the will of God was made known in 
 doubtful cases, were put in this breast-plate, which is therefore 
 called the <I>breast-plate of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>Urim</I> and <I>thummim</I> signify <I>light</I> and 
 <I>integrity;</I> many conjectures there are among the learned what 
 they were; we have no reason to think they were any thing that Moses 
 was to make more than what was before ordered, so that either God made 
 them himself, and gave them to Moses, for him to put into the 
 breast-plate, when other things were prepared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:8">Lev. viii. 8</A>),

 or no more is meant than a declaration of the further use of what was
 already ordered to be made. I think the words may be read thus, <I>And 
 thou shalt give,</I> or <I>add,</I> or <I>deliver, to the breast-plate 
 of judgment, the illuminations and perfections, and they shall be upon 
 the heart of Aaron;</I> that is, "He shall be endued with a power of 
 knowing and making known the mind of God in all difficult doubtful 
 cases, relating either to the civil or ecclesiastical state of the 
 nation." Their government was a theocracy: God was their King, the high 
 priest was, under God, their ruler, the urim and thummim were his 
 cabinet-council; probably Moses wrote upon the breast-plate, or wove 
 into it, these words, <I>Urim</I> and <I>Thummim,</I> to signify that 
 the high priest, having on him this breast-plate, and asking counsel of 
 God in any emergency relating to the public, should be directed to take 
 those measures, and give that advice, which God would own. If he was 
 standing before the ark (but without the veil) probably he received 
 instructions from off the mercy-seat, as Moses did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:22"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 22</A>);

 thus, it should seem, Phinehas did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:27,28">Judg. xx. 27, 28</A>.

 If he was at a distance from the ark, as Abiathar was when he enquired
 of the Lord for David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:6">1 Sam. xxiii. 6</A>,

 &c.), then the answer was given either by a voice from heaven or rather
 by an impulse upon the mind of the high priest, which last is perhaps 
 intimated in that expression, <I>He shall bear the judgment of the 
 children of Israel upon his heart.</I> This oracle was of great use to 
 Israel; Joshua consulted it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21">Num. xxvii. 21</A>),

 and, it is likely, the judges after him. It was lost in the captivity,
 and never regained after, though, it should seem, it was expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:63">Ezra ii. 63</A>.

 But it was a shadow of good things to come, and the substance is
 Christ. He is our oracle; by him God in these last days makes known 
 himself and his mind to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2,Joh+1:18">Heb. i. 2; John i. 18</A>.

 Divine revelation centres in him, and comes to us through him; he is
 the light, the true light, the faithful witness, the truth itself, and 
 from him we receive the Spirit of truth, who leads into all truth. The 
 joining of the breast-plate to the ephod denotes that his prophetical 
 office was founded in his priesthood; and it was by the merit of his 
 death that he purchased this honour for himself and this favour for us.
 It was the <I>Lamb that had been slain</I> that was worthy to <I>take 
 the book</I> and to <I>open the seals,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. Direction given concerning <I>the robe of the ephod,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:31-35"><I>v.</I> 31-35</A>.

 This was next under the ephod, and reached down to the knees, was 
 without sleeves, and was put on over their head, having holes on the 
 sides to put the arms through, or, as Maimonides describes it, was not 
 sewed together on the sides at all. The hole on the top, through which 
 the head was put, was carefully bound about, that it might not tear in 
 the putting on. In religious worship, care must be taken to prevent 
 every thing that may distract the minds of the worshippers, or render 
 the service despicable. Round the skirts of the robe were hung golden 
 bells, and the representations of pomegranates made of yarn of divers 
 colours. The pomegranates added to the beauty of the robe, and the 
 sound of the bells gave notice to the people in the outer court when he 
 went into the holy place to burn incense, that they might then apply 
 themselves to their devotions at the same time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:10">Luke i. 10</A>),

 in token of their concurrence with him in his offering, and their hopes
 of the ascent of their prayers to God in virtue of the incense he 
 offered. Aaron must come near to minister in the garments that were
 appointed him, <I>that he die not.</I> It is at his peril if he attend 
 otherwise than according to the institution. This intimates that we 
 must serve the Lord <I>with fear</I> and holy <I>trembling,</I> as 
 those that know we deserve to die, and are in danger of making some 
 fatal mistake. Some make the bells of the holy robe to typify the sound 
 of the gospel of Christ in the world, giving notice of his entrance 
 within the veil for us. <I>Blessed are those that hear this joyful 
 sound,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15">Ps. lxxxix. 15</A>.

 The adding of the pomegranates, which are a fragrant fruit, denotes the 
 sweet savour of the gospel, as well as the joyful sound of it, for it 
 is a <I>savour of life unto life.</I> The church is called an 
 <I>orchard of pomegranates.</I> 

 2. Concerning the golden plate fixed upon Aaron's forehead, on which 
 must be engraven, <I>Holiness to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>),

 or <I>The holiness of Jehovah.</I> Aaron must hereby be reminded that 
 God is holy, and that his priests must be holy. <I>Holiness becomes
 his house</I> and household. The high priest must be sequestered from 
 all pollution, and consecrated to God and to his service and honour, 
 and so must all his ministrations be. All that attend in God's house 
 must have <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> engraven upon their foreheads, 
 that is, they must be holy, devoted to the Lord, and designing his 
 glory in all they do. This must appear in their forehead, in an open 
 profession of their relation to God, as those that are not ashamed to 
 own it, and in a conversation in the world answerable to it. It must 
 likewise be engraven like the engravings of a signet, so deep, so 
 durable, not painted to be washed off, but sincere and lasting; such 
 must our <I>holiness to the Lord</I> be. Aaron must have this upon his 
 forehead, that he may <I>bear the iniquity of the holy things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and that <I>they may be accepted before the Lord.</I> Herein he was a 
 type of Christ, the great Mediator between God and man, through whom it 
 is that we have to do with God. 

 (1.) Through him what is amiss in our services is pardoned. The divine
 law is strict; in many things we come short of our duty, so that we 
 cannot but be conscious to ourselves of much iniquity cleaving even to 
 our holy things; when we would do good evil is present; even this would 
 be our ruin if God should enter into judgment with us. But Christ, our 
 high priest, bears this iniquity, bears it for us so as to bear it from 
 us, and through him it is forgiven to us and not laid to our charge.

 (2.) Through him what is good is accepted; our persons, our
 performances, are pleasing to God upon the account of Christ's 
 intercession, and not otherwise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 His being <I>holiness to the Lord</I> recommends all those to the
 divine favour that are interested in his righteousness, and clothed 
 with his Spirit; and therefore he has said it was for our sakes that he 
 <I>sanctified himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>.

 Having <I>such a high priest,</I> we come <I>boldly to the throne of
 grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:14-16">Heb. iv. 14-16</A>.

 3. The rest of the garments are but named

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 because there was nothing extraordinary in them. The embroidered coat 
 of fine linen was the innermost of the priestly garments; it reached to 
 the feet, and the sleeves to the wrists, and was bound to the body with 
 a girdle or sash of needle-work. The mitre, or diadem, was of linen,
 such as kings anciently wore in the east, typifying the kingly office 
 of Christ. He is a <I>priest upon a throne</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>),

 a priest with a crown. These two God has joined, and we must not think
 to separate them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>40 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
 make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for
 glory and for beauty.
 &nbsp; 41 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
 with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
 sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
 office.
 &nbsp; 42 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
 nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:
 &nbsp; 43 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
 come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
 come near unto the altar to minister in the holy <I>place;</I> that
 they bear not iniquity, and die: <I>it shall be</I> a statute for ever
 unto him and his seed after him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,

 1. Particular orders about the vestments of the inferior priests. They
 were to have coats, and girdles, and bonnets, of the same materials
 with those of the high priest; but there was a difference in shape
 between their bonnets and his mitre. Theirs, as his, were to be <I>for 
 glory and beauty</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 that they might look great in their ministration: yet all this glory 
 was nothing compared with the glory of grace, this beauty nothing to 
 the beauty of holiness, of which these holy garments were typical. They 
 are particularly ordered, in their ministration, to wear <I>linen 
 breeches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 This teaches us modesty and decency of garb and gesture at all times, 
 especially in public worship, in which a veil is becoming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:5,6,10">1 Cor. xi. 5, 6, 10</A>.

 It also intimates what need our souls have of a covering, when we come
 before God, that the <I>shame of their nakedness may not appear.</I> 

 2. A general rule concerning the garments both of the high priest and
 of the inferior priests, that they were to be put upon them, at first, 
 when they were consecrated, in token of their being invested in the 
 office

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and then they were to wear them in all their ministrations, but not at 
 other times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 and this at their peril, lest they <I>bear iniquity and die.</I> Those 
 who are guilty of omissions in duty, as well as omissions of duty, 
 shall <I>bear their iniquity.</I> If the priests perform the instituted 
 service, and do not do it in the appointed garments, it is (say the 
 Jewish doctors) as if a stranger did it, and the <I>stranger that comes 
 nigh shall be put to death.</I> Nor will God connive at the 
 presumptions and irreverences even of those whom he causes to draw most 
 near to him; if Aaron himself put a slight upon the divine institution, 
 he shall bear iniquity, and die. To us these garments typify, 

 (1.) The righteousness of Christ; if we appear not before God in this,
 we shall <I>bear iniquity and die.</I> What have we to do at the 
 wedding-feast without a wedding-garment, or at God's altar without the 
 array of his priests?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12,13">Matt. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 (2.) <I>The armour of God</I> prescribed 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:13">Eph. vi. 13</A>.

 If we venture without that armour, our spiritual enemies will be the
 death of our souls, and we shall bear the iniquity, our blood will be 
 upon our own heads. Blessed is he therefore that watcheth, and keepeth
 his garments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:15">Rev. xvi. 15</A>.

 3. This is said to be a <I>statute for ever,</I> that is, it is to
 continue as long as the priesthood continues. But it is to have its 
 perpetuity in the substance of which these things were the shadows.</P>
