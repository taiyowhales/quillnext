 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter gives us an account of Judah and his family, and such 
 an account it is that one would wonder that, of all Jacob's sons, 
 our Lord should spring out of Judah, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb. vii. 14</A>.
 If we 
 were to form a character of him by this story, we should not say,
 "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise,"
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:8"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 8</A>.
 But God will show that his choice is of grace and not of 
 merit, and that Christ came into the world to save sinners, even 
 the chief, and is not ashamed, upon their repentance, to be allied 
 to them, also that the worth and worthiness of Jesus Christ 
 are personal, of himself, and not derived from his ancestors. 
 Humbling himself to be "made in the likeness of sinful flesh," 
 he was pleased to descend from some that were infamous. How 
 little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, 
 to boast, as they did, that they were not born of fornication!
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:41">John viii. 41</A>.
 We have, in this chapter, 
 
 I. Judah's marriage 
 and issue, and the untimely death of his two eldest sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.
 
 II. Judah's incest with his daughter-in-law Tamar, 
 without his knowing it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:12-23">ver. 12-23</A>.
 
 III. His confusion, when it 
 was discovered,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:24-26">ver. 24-26</A>.
 
 IV. The birth of his twin sons, in 
 whom his family was built up,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:27-30">ver. 27</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass at that time, 
 that Judah went down from his 
 brethren, and turned in to a certain 
 Adullamite, whose name <I>was</I> Hirah.
 &nbsp; 2 And Judah saw there a daughter of 
 a certain Canaanite, whose name <I>was</I> 
 Shuah; and he took her, and went in 
 unto her.
 &nbsp; 3 And she conceived, and 
 bare a son; and he called his name 
 Er.
 &nbsp; 4 And she conceived again, and 
 bare a son; and she called his name 
 Onan.
 &nbsp; 5 And she yet again conceived, 
 and bare a son; and called his name 
 Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when 
 she bare him.
 &nbsp; 6 And Judah took a 
 wife for Er his firstborn, whose name 
 <I>was</I> Tamar.
 &nbsp; 7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, 
 was wicked in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> slew him.
 &nbsp; 8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in 
 unto thy brother's wife, and marry 
 her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
 &nbsp; 9 And Onan knew that the seed should 
 not be his; and it came to pass, when 
 he went in unto his brother's wife, 
 that he spilled <I>it</I> on the ground, lest 
 that he should give seed to his brother.
 &nbsp; 10 And the thing which he did 
 displeased the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: wherefore he
 slew him also.
 &nbsp; 11 Then said Judah 
 to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain 
 a widow at thy father's house, till 
 Shelah my son be grown: for he said,
 Lest peradventure he die also, as his 
 brethren <I>did.</I> And Tamar went and 
 dwelt in her father's house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Judah's foolish friendship with 
 a Canaanite-man. He went down from his 
 brethren, and withdrew for a time from their 
 society and his father's family, and got to be 
 intimately acquainted with one Hirah, an 
 Adullamite,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 It is computed that he 
 was now not much above fifteen or sixteen 
 years of age, an easy prey to the tempter. 
 Note, When young people that have been 
 well educated begin to change their company, 
 they will soon change their manners, and 
 lose their good education. Those that go
 down from their brethren, that despise and 
 forsake the society of the seed of Israel, and 
 pick up Canaanites for their companions, are 
 going down the hill apace. It is of great 
 consequence to young people to choose proper 
 associates; for these they will imitate, 
 study to recommend themselves to, and, by 
 their opinion of them, value themselves: an 
 error in this choice is often fatal. 
 
 2. His 
 foolish marriage with a Canaanite-woman, a 
 match made, not by his father, who, it 
 should seem, was not consulted, but by his 
 new friend Hirah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Many have been 
 drawn into marriages scandalous and pernicious 
 to themselves and their families by 
 keeping bad company, and growing familiar 
 with bad people: one wicked league entangles 
 men in another. Let young people be 
 admonished by this to take their good parents 
 for their best friends, and to be advised by 
 them, and not by flatterers, who wheedle 
 them, to make a prey of them. 
 
 3. His children 
 by this Canaanite, and his disposal of 
 them. Three sons he had by her, Er, Onan, 
 and Shelah. It is probable that she embraced 
 the worship of the God of Israel, at least in 
 profession, but, for aught that appears, there 
 was little of the fear of God in the family. 
 Judah married too young, and very rashly; 
 he also married his sons too young, when 
 they had neither wit nor grace to govern 
 themselves, and the consequences were very 
 bad. 
 
 (1.) His first-born, <I>Er,</I> was notoriously 
 wicked; he was so <I>in the sight of the Lord,</I> 
 that is, in defiance of God and his law; or, 
 if perhaps he was not wicked in the sight of
 the world, he was so in the sight of God, to
 whom all men's wickedness is open; and
 what came of it? Why, God cut him off
 presently
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 <I>The Lord slew him.</I> Note, 
 Sometimes God makes quick work with sinners, 
 and takes them away in his wrath, 
 when they are but just setting out in a wicked 
 course of life. 
 
 (2.) The next son, <I>Onan,</I> was, 
 according to the ancient usage, married to the 

 <A NAME="Page218"> </A>

 widow, to preserve the name of his deceased 
 brother that died childless. Though God 
 had taken away his life for his wickedness, 
 yet they were solicitous to preserve his memory; 
 and their disappointment therein, 
 through Onan's sin, was a further punishment 
 of his wickedness. The custom of 
 marrying the brother's widow was afterwards 
 made one of the laws of Moses, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5">Deut. xxv. 5</A>.
 Onan, though he consented to marry the 
 widow, yet, to the great abuse of his own 
 body, of the wife that he had married, and of 
 the memory of his brother that was gone, he 
 refused to raise up seed unto his brother, as 
 he was in duty bound. This was so much the 
 worse because the Messiah was to descend 
 from Judah, and, had he not been guilty of 
 this wickedness, he might have had the 
 honour of being one of his ancestors. Note, 
 Those sins that dishonour the body and defile 
 it are very displeasing to God and evidences 
 of vile affections. 
 
 (3.) <I>Shelah,</I> the third son, 
 was reserved for the widow
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 yet with 
 a design that he should not marry so young 
 as his brothers had done, <I>lest he die also.</I> 
 Some think that Judah never intended to 
 marry Shelah to Tamar, but unjustly suspected 
 her to have been the death of her two 
 former husbands (whereas it was their own 
 wickedness that slew them), and then sent her 
 to her father's house, with a charge to remain 
 a widow. If so, it was an inexcusable piece 
 of prevarication that he was guilty of. However, 
 Tamar acquiesced for the present, 
 and waited the issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And in process of time the daughter 
 of Shuah Judah's wife died; and 
 Judah was comforted, and went up 
 unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, 
 he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
 &nbsp; 13 And it was told Tamar, 
 saying, Behold thy father in law goeth 
 up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
 &nbsp; 14 And she put her widow's garments off 
 from her, and covered her with a veil, 
 and wrapped herself, and sat in an 
 open place, which <I>is</I> by the way to 
 Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
 grown, and she was not given unto 
 him to wife.
 &nbsp; 15 When Judah saw 
 her, he thought her <I>to be</I> an harlot;
 because she had covered her face.
 &nbsp; 16 And he turned unto her by the way, 
 and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me 
 come in unto thee; (for he knew not 
 that she <I>was</I> his daughter in law.) 
 And she said, What wilt thou give 
 me, that thou mayest come in unto 
 me?
 &nbsp; 17 And he said, I will send <I>thee</I> 
 a kid from the flock. And she said, 
 Wilt thou give <I>me</I> a pledge, till thou 
 send <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 18 And he said, What pledge 
 shall I give thee? And she said, Thy 
 signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff 
 that <I>is</I> in thine hand. And he gave 
 <I>it</I> her, and came in unto her, and she
 conceived by him.
 &nbsp; 19 And she arose, 
 and went away, and laid by her veil 
 from her, and put on the garments of 
 her widowhood.
 &nbsp; 20 And Judah sent 
 the kid by the hand of his friend the
 Adullamite, to receive <I>his</I> pledge from 
 the woman's hand: but he found her 
 not.
 &nbsp; 21 Then he asked the men of 
 that place, saying, Where <I>is</I> the harlot, 
 that <I>was</I> openly by the way side? 
 And they said, There was no harlot 
 in this <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 22 And he returned to 
 Judah, and said, I cannot find her, 
 and also the men of the place said, 
 <I>that</I> there was no harlot in this <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 23 And Judah said, Let her take <I>it</I> to 
 her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent 
 this kid, and thou hast not found her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very ill-favoured story that is here 
 told concerning Judah; one would not have 
 expected such folly in Israel. Judah had 
 buried his wife; and widowers have need to 
 stand upon their guard with the utmost caution 
 and resolution against all fleshly lusts. 
 He was unjust to his daughter-in-law, either 
 through negligence or design, in not giving 
 her his surviving son, and this exposed her 
 to temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tamar wickedly prostituted herself as 
 a harlot to Judah, that, if the son might not, 
 the father might raise up seed to the deceased. 
 Some excuse this by suggesting 
 that, though she was a Canaanite, yet she 
 had embraced the true religion, and believed 
 the promise made to Abraham and his seed, 
 particularly that of the Messiah, who was to 
 descend from the loins of Judah, and that 
 she was therefore thus earnestly desirous to 
 have a child by one of that family that she 
 might have the honour, or at least stand fair 
 for the honour, of being the mother of the 
 Messiah. And, if this was indeed her desire, 
 it had its success; she is one of the 
 four women particularly named in the genealogy 
 of Christ,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:3">Matt. i. 3</A>.
 Her sinful practice 
 was pardoned, and her good intention 
 was accepted, which magnifies the grace of 
 God, but can by no means be admitted to 
 justify or encourage the like. Bishop Patrick 
 thinks it probable that she hoped Shelah, 
 who was by right her husband, might 
 have come along with his father, and that he 
 might have been allured to her embraces. 
 There was a great deal of plot and contrivance 
 in Tamar's sin. 
 
 1. She took an 
 opportunity for it, when Judah had a time of 

 <A NAME="Page219"> </A>

 mirth and feasting with his sheep-shearers. 
 Note, Time of jollity often prove times of 
 temptation, particularly to the sin of uncleanness; 
 when men are fed to the full, the 
 reins are apt to be let loose. 
 
 2. She exposed 
 herself as a harlot <I>in an open place,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 Those that are, and would be, chaste, must 
 be <I>keepers at home,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:5">Tit. ii. 5</A>.
 It should 
 seem, it was the custom of harlots, in those 
 times, to cover their faces, that, though they 
 were not ashamed, yet they might seem to 
 be so. The sin of uncleanness did not then 
 go so barefaced as it does now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judah was taken in the snare, and 
 though it was ignorantly that he was guilty 
 of incest with his daughter-in-law (not knowing 
 who she was), yet he was willfully guilty 
 of fornication: whoever she was, he knew 
 she was not his wife, and therefore not to be 
 touched. Nor was his sin capable, in the 
 least, of such a charitable excuse as some 
 make for Tamar, that though the action was 
 bad the intention possibly might be good. Observe, 
 
 1. Judah's sin began in the eye
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 <I>He saw her.</I> Note, Those have eyes, and 
 hearts too, full of adultery (as it is 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>),
 that catch at every bait that presents 
 itself to them and are as tinder to every 
 spark. We have need to make a covenant 
 with our eyes, and to turn them from beholding 
 vanity, lest the eye infect the heart. 
 
 2. It added to the scandal that the hire of a 
 harlot (than which nothing is more infamous) 
 was demanded, offered, and accepted--<I>a kid 
 from the flock,</I> a goodly price at which her 
 chastity and honour were valued! Nay, had 
 the consideration been thousands of rams, 
 and ten thousand rivers of oil, it had not 
 been a valuable consideration. The favour 
 of God, the purity of the soul, the peace of 
 conscience, and the hope of heaven, are too 
 precious to be exposed to sale at any such 
 rates; the Topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal 
 them: what are those profited that lose their 
 souls to gain the world? 
 
 3. It turned to the 
 reproach of Judah that he left his jewels in 
 pawn for a kid. Note, Fleshly lusts are not 
 only brutish, but sottish, and ruining to 
 men's secular interests. It is plain that 
 whoredom, as well as wine, and new wine, 
 takes away the heart first, else it would never 
 take away the signet and the bracelets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He lost his jewels by the bargain; he 
 sent the kid, according to this promise, to 
 redeem his pawn, but the supposed harlot 
 could not be found. He sent it by his friend 
 (who was indeed his <I>back-friend,</I> because he 
 was aiding and abetting in his evil deeds) the 
 Adullamite, who came back without the 
 pledge. It is a good account (if it be but 
 true) of any place which they here gave, 
 <I>there is no harlot in this place;</I> for such sinners 
 are the scandals and plagues of any 
 place. Judah sits down content to lose his 
 signet and his bracelets, and forbids his 
 friend to make any further enquiry after 
 them, giving this reason, <I>lest we be shamed,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 Either, 
 
 1. Lest his sin should come 
 to be known publicly, and be talked of. Fornication 
 and uncleanness have ever been 
 looked upon as scandalous things and the 
 reproach and shame of those that are convicted 
 of them. Nothing will make those 
 blush that are not ashamed of these. 
 
 2. Lest he should be laughed at as a fool for 
 trusting a strumpet with his signet and his 
 bracelets. He expresses no concern about 
 the sin, to get that pardoned, only about the 
 shame, to prevent that. Note, There are 
 many who are more solicitous to preserve 
 their reputation with men than to secure the 
 favour of God and a good conscience; <I>lest 
 we be shamed</I> goes further with them than 
 <I>lest we be damned.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And it came to pass about three 
 months after, that it was told Judah, 
 saying, Tamar thy daughter in law 
 hath played the harlot; and also, behold, 
 she <I>is</I> with child by whoredom. 
 And Judah said, Bring her forth, and 
 let her be burnt.
 &nbsp; 25 When she <I>was</I> 
 brought forth, she sent to her father 
 in law, saying, By the man, whose 
 these <I>are, am</I> I with child: and she
 said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <I>are</I> 
 these, the signet, and bracelets, and 
 staff.
 &nbsp; 26 And Judah acknowledged 
 <I>them,</I> and said, She hath been more
 righteous than I; because that I gave 
 her not to Shelah my son. And he 
 knew her again no more.
 &nbsp; 27 And it 
 came to pass in the time of her travail, 
 that, behold, twins <I>were</I> in her womb.
 &nbsp; 28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, 
 that <I>the one</I> put out <I>his</I> hand: 
 and the midwife took and bound upon 
 his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This 
 came out first.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass, 
 as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
 his brother came out: and she said, 
 How hast thou broken forth? <I>this</I> 
 breach <I>be</I> upon thee: therefore his 
 name was called Pharez.
 &nbsp; 30 And 
 afterward came out his brother, that 
 had the scarlet thread upon his hand: 
 and his name was called Zarah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Judah's rigour against Tamar, 
 when he heard she was an adulteress. She 
 was, in the eye of the law, Shelah's wife, and 
 therefore her being with child by another was 
 looked upon as an injury and reproach to 
 Judah's family: <I>Bring her forth therefore,</I> 
 says Judah, the master of the family, and 
 <I>let her be burnt;</I> not burnt to death, but 
 burnt in the cheek or forehead, stigmatized 
 for a harlot. This seems probable,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 <A NAME="Page220"> </A>

 Note, it is a common thing for men to be 
 severe against those very sins in others in 
 which yet they allow themselves; and so, in 
 judging others, they condemn themselves,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1,14:22">Rom. ii. 1; xiv. 22</A>.
 If he designed that she 
 should be burnt to death, perhaps, under 
 pretence of zeal against the sin, he was contriving 
 how to get rid of his daughter-in-law, 
 being loath to marry Shelah to her. 
 Note, It is a common thing, but a very bad 
 thing, to cover malice against men's persons 
 with a show of zeal against their vices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judah's shame, when it was made to 
 appear that he was the adulterer. She produced 
 <I>the ring and the bracelets</I> in court, 
 which justified the fathering of the child 
 upon Judah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 Note, The wickedness 
 that has been most secretly committed, 
 and most industriously concealed, yet sometimes 
 is strangely brought to light, to the 
 shame and confusion of those who have said, 
 <I>No eye sees.</I> A bird of the air may carry the 
 voice; however, there is a destroying day 
 coming, when all will be laid open. Some 
 of the Jewish writers observe that as Judah 
 had said to his father, <I>See, is this thy son's 
 coat?</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:32"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 32</A>)
 so it was now said to 
 him, "See, are these thy signet and bracelets?" 
 Judah, being convicted by his own 
 conscience, 
 
 1. Confesses his sin: <I>She has 
 been more righteous than I.</I> He owns that a 
 perpetual mark of infamy should be fastened 
 rather upon him, who had been so much accessory 
 to it. Note, Those offenders ought 
 to be treated with the greatest tenderness 
 to whom we have any way given occasion of 
 offending. If servants purloin, and their 
 masters, by withholding from them what is 
 due, tempt them to it, they ought to forgive 
 them. 
 
 2. He never returned to it again: 
 <I>He knew her again no more.</I> Note, Those do 
 not truly repent of their sins that do not forsake 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The building up of Judah's family 
 hereby, notwithstanding, in the birth of 
 Pharez and Zarah, from whom descended 
 the most considerable families of the illustrious 
 tribe of Judah. It should seem, the 
 birth was hard to the mother, by which she 
 was corrected for her sin. The children 
 also, like Jacob and Esau, struggled for the 
 birthright, and Pharez obtained it, who is 
 ever named first, and from him Christ descended. 
 He had his name from his breaking 
 forth before his brother: <I>This breach be 
 upon thee,</I> which is applicable to those that 
 sow discord, and create distance, between 
 brethren. The Jews, as Zarah, bade fair for 
 the birthright, and were marked with a scarlet 
 thread, as those that came out first; but 
 the Gentiles, like Pharez, as a son of violence, 
 got the start of them, by that violence 
 which the kingdom of heaven suffers, and 
 attained to the righteousness of which the 
 Jews came short. Yet, when the fulness of 
 time is come, all Israel shall be saved. Both 
 these sons are named in the genealogy of 
 our Saviour 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:3">Matt. i. 3</A>),
 to perpetuate the 
 story, as an instance of the humiliation of 
 our Lord Jesus. Some observe that the 
 four eldest sons of Jacob fell under very foul 
 guilt, Reuben and Judah under the guilt of 
 incest, Simeon and Levi under that of murder; 
 yet they were patriarchs, and from Levi 
 descended the priests, from Judah the kings 
 and Messiah. Thus they became examples 
 of repentance, and monuments of pardoning 
 mercy.</P>
