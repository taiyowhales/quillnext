 In this chapter we have a law concerning vows, which had been mentioned 
 in the close of the foregoing chapter. 

 I. Here is a general rule laid down that all vows must be carefully
 performed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Some particular exceptions to this rule.

 1.  That the vows of daughters should not be binding unless allowed by
 the father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 Nor,

 2.  The vows of wives unless allowed by the husband, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:6-16">ver. 6</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
 children of Israel, saying, This <I>is</I> the thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath commanded.
 &nbsp; 2 If a man vow a vow unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, or swear an oath to bind
 his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
 according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This law was delivered to the heads of the tribes that they might 
 instruct those who were under their charge, explain the law to them, 
 give then necessary cautions, and call them to account, if there were 
 occasion, for the breach of their vows.  Perhaps the heads of the 
 tribes had, upon some emergency of this kind, consulted Moses, and 
 desired by him to know the mind of God, and here they are told it: 
 <I>This is the thing which the Lord has commanded</I> concerning vows, 
 and it is a command still in force.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The case supposed is that a person vows a vow unto the Lord, making 
 God a party to the promise, and designing his honour and glory in it. 
 The matter of the vow is supposed to be something lawful: no man can be 
 by his own promise bound to do that which he is already by the divine 
 precept prohibited from doing. Yet it is supposed to be something 
 which, in such and such measures and degrees, was not a necessary duty 
 antecedent to the vow. A person might vow to bring such and such 
 sacrifices at certain times, to give such and such a sum or such a 
 proportion in alms, to forbear such meats and drinks which the law 
 allowed, to fast and afflict the soul (which is specified 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 at other times besides the day of atonement. And many similar vows 
 might be made in an extraordinary heat of holy zeal, in humiliation for 
 some sin committed or for the prevention of sin, in the pursuit of some 
 mercy desired or in gratitude for some mercy received. It is of great 
 use to make such vows as these, provided they be made in sincerity with 
 due caution. Vows (say the Jewish doctors) are <I>the hedge of 
 separation,</I> that is, a fence to religion. He that vows is here said 
 to <I>bind his soul with a bond.</I> It is a vow to God, who is a 
 spirit, and to him the soul, with all its powers, must be bound. A 
 promise to man is a bond upon the estate, but a promise to God is a 
 bond upon the soul. Our sacramental vows, by which we are bound to no 
 more than what was before our duty, and which neither father nor 
 husband can disannul, are bonds upon the soul, and by them we must feel 
 ourselves bound out from all sin and bound up to the whole will of God.  
 Our occasional vows concerning that which before was <I>in our own 
 power</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:4">Acts v. 4</A>),

 when they are made, are bonds upon the soul likewise.

 2. The command given is that these vows be conscientiously performed:
 <I>He shall not break his word,</I> though afterwards he may change his 
 mind, but he shall do according to what he has said.  <I>Margin, He 
 shall not profane his word.</I> Vowing is an ordinance of God; if we 
 vow in hypocrisy we profane that ordinance: it is plainly determined, 
 <I>Better not vow than vow and not pay,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:5">Eccl. v. 5</A>.

 <I>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I> His promises to us are
 <I>yea and amen,</I> let not ours to him be <I>yea and nay.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and bind herself by
 a bond, <I>being</I> in her father's house in her youth;
 &nbsp; 4 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
 bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then
 all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound
 her soul shall stand.
 &nbsp; 5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth;
 not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
 soul, shall stand: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall forgive her, because her
 father disallowed her.
 &nbsp; 6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
 ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
 &nbsp; 7 And her husband heard <I>it,</I> and held his peace at her in the
 day that he heard <I>it:</I> then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
 wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
 &nbsp; 8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard
 <I>it;</I> then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which
 she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
 effect: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall forgive her.
 &nbsp; 9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
 wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
 &nbsp; 10 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul
 by a bond with an oath;
 &nbsp; 11 And her husband heard <I>it,</I> and held his peace at her, <I>and</I>
 disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond
 wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
 &nbsp; 12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
 heard <I>them; then</I> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
 concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
 not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 forgive her.
 &nbsp; 13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
 husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
 &nbsp; 14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
 to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
 which <I>are</I> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
 peace at her in the day that he heard <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
 heard <I>them;</I> then he shall bear her iniquity.
 &nbsp; 16 These <I>are</I> the statutes, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses,
 between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter,
 <I>being yet</I> in her youth in her father's house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here taken for granted that all such persons as are <I>sui 
 juris--at their own disposal,</I> and are likewise of sound
 understanding and memory, are bound to perform whatever they vow that 
 is lawful and possible; but, if the person vowing be under the dominion 
 and at the disposal of another, the case is different. Two cases much 
 alike are here put and determined:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case of a daughter in her father's house: and some think, 
 probably enough, that it extends to a son likewise, while he is at home 
 with his father, and under tutors and governors. Whether the exception 
 may thus be stretched I cannot say. <I>Non est distinguendum, ubi lex 
 non distinguit--We are not allowed to make distinctions which the law
 does not.</I> The rule is general, If a man vow, he must pay. But for a 
 daughter it is express: her vow is nugatory or in suspense till her 
 father knows it, and (it is supposed) knows it from her; for, when it 
 comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to ratify or nullify 
 it. But in favour of the vow, 

 1. Even his silence shall suffice to ratify it: If he <I>hold his
 peace, her vows shall stand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:4"><I>v.</I>  4</A>.

 <I>Qui tacet, consentire videtur--Silence gives consent.</I> Hereby he 
 allows his daughter the liberty she has assumed, and, as long as he 
 says nothing against her vow, she shall be bound by it. But,

 2. His protestation against it shall perfectly disannul it, because it
 is possible that such vow may by prejudicial to the affairs of the 
 family, break the father's measures, perplex the provision made for his 
 table if the vow related to meats, or lessen the provision made for his 
 children if the vow would be more expensive than his estate would bear; 
 however, it was certain that it was an infringement of his authority 
 over his child, and therefore, if he disallow it, she is discharged, 
 and <I>the Lord shall forgive her,</I> that is, she shall not be 
 charged with the guilt of violating her vow; she showed her good-will 
 in making the vow, and, if her intentions therein were sincere, she 
 shall be accounted better than sacrifice. This shows how great a 
 deference children owe to their parents, and how much they ought to 
 honour them and be obedient to them. It is for the interest of the 
 public that the paternal authority be supported; for, when children are 
 countenanced in their disobedience to their parents (as they were by 
 the tradition of the elders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5,6">Matt. xv. 5, 6</A>),

 they soon become in other things <I>children of Belial.</I> If this law
 be not to be extended to children's marrying without their parents' 
 consent so far as to put it in parents' power to annul the marriage and 
 dissolve the obligation (as some have thought it does), yet certainly 
 it proves the sinfulness of it, and obliges the children that have thus 
 done foolishly to repent and humble themselves before God and their 
 parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The case of a wife is much the same. As for a woman that is a widow 
 or divorced, she has neither father nor husband to control her, so 
 that, whatever vows she binds her soul with, they shall <I>stand 
 against her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 it is at her peril if she run back; but a wife, who has nothing that 
 she can strictly call her own, but with her husband's allowance, 
 cannot, without that, make any such vow.

 1. The law is plain in case of a wife that continues so long after the
 vow. If her husband allow her vow, though only by silence, it must 
 stand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 If he disallow it, since her obligation to that which she had vowed 
 arose purely from her own act, and not from any prior command of God, 
 her obligation to her husband shall take place of it, for to him she 
 ought to be in subjection <I>as unto the Lord;</I> and now it is so far 
 from being her duty to fulfil her vow that it would be her sin to 
 disobey her husband, whose consent perhaps she ought to have asked 
 before she made the vow; therefore she needs <I>forgiveness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 2. The law is the same in case of a wife that soon after becomes a 
 widow, or is put away. Though, if she return to her father's house, she 
 does not therefore so come again under his authority as that he has 
 power to disannul hew vows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 yet if the vow was made while she was in the house of her husband, and 
 her husband disallowed it, it was made void and of no effect for ever, 
 and she does not return under the law of her vow when she is loosed 
 from the law of her husband. This seems to be the distinct meaning of 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:10-14"><I>v.</I> 10-14</A>,
 
 which otherwise would be but a repetition of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 But it is added

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that, if the husband make void the vows of his wife, he shall <I>bear 
 her iniquity;</I> that is, if the thing she had vowed was really good, 
 for the honour of God and the prosperity of her own soul, and the 
 husband disallowed it out of covetousness, or humour, or to show his 
 authority, though she be discharged from the obligation of her vow, yet 
 he will have a great deal to answer for.  Now here it is very 
 observable how carefully the divine law consults the good order of 
 families, and preserves the power of superior relations, and the duty 
 and reverence of inferiors. It is fit that every man should <I>bear 
 rule in his own house,</I> and have his wife and children in subjection 
 with all gravity; and rather than this great rule should be broken, or 
 any encouragement given to inferior relations to break those bonds 
 asunder, God himself would quit his right, and release the obligations 
 even of a solemn vow; so much does religion strengthen the ties of all 
 relations, and secure the welfare of all societiesd, that in it the 
 <I>families of the earth are blessed.</I></P>
