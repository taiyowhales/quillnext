 The thousands of Israel, having been mustered in the former chapter, in 
 this are marshalled, and a regular disposition is made of their camp, 
 by a divine appointment. Here is, 
 
 I. A general order concerning it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Particular directions for the posting of each of the tribes, in
 four distinct squadrons, three tribes in each squadron. 

 1. In the van-guard on the east were posted Judah, Issachar, and
 Zebulun,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:3-9">ver. 3-9</A>.

 2. In the right wing, southward, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
 standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about
 the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the general appointment given both for their orderly encampment 
 where they rested and their orderly march when they moved. Some order, 
 it is possible, they had observed hitherto; they came out of Egypt in 
 rank and file 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:18">Exod. xiii. 18</A>), but now they were put into a better model.
 
 1. They all dwelt in tents, and when they marched carried all their
 tents along with them, for <I>they found no city to dwell in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:4">Ps. cvii. 4</A>.

 This represents to us our state in this world. It is a movable state
 (we are here to-day and gone to-morrow); and it is a military state: is 
 not our life a warfare? We do but pitch our tents in this world, and 
 have in it no continuing city. Let us, therefore, while we are pitching 
 in this world, be pressing through it.

 2. Those of a tribe were to pitch together, <I>every man by his own
 standard.</I> Note, It is the will of God that mutual love and 
 affection, converse and communion, should be kept up among relations. 
 Those that are of kin to each other should, as much as they can, be 
 acquainted with each other; and the bonds of nature should be improved 
 for the strengthening of the bonds of Christian communion. 

 3. Every one must know his place and keep in it; they were not allowed 
 to fix where they pleased, nor to remove when they pleased, but God 
 quarters them, with a charge to abide in their quarters. Note, It is 
 God that <I>appoints us the bounds of our habitation,</I> and to him we 
 must refer ourselves. <I>He shall choose our inheritance for us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4">Ps. xlvii. 4</A>),

 and in his choice we must acquiesce, and not love to
 flit, nor be <I>as the bird that wanders from her nest.</I> 

 4. Every tribe had its standard, flag, or ensign, and it should seem
 every family had some particular ensign of their father's house, which 
 was carried as with us the colours of each troop or company in a 
 regiment are. These were of use for the distinction of tribes and 
 families, and the gathering and keeping of them together, in allusion 
 to which the preaching of the gospel is said to <I>lift up an ensign, 
 to which the Gentiles shall seek,</I> and by which they shall pitch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10,12">Isa. xi. 10, 12</A>.

 Note, God is the God of order, and not of confusion. These standards
 made this mighty army seem more beautiful to its friends and more 
 formidable to its enemies. The church of Christ is said to be as 
 <I>terrible as an army with banners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:10">Cant. vi. 10</A>.

 It is uncertain how these standards were distinguished: some conjecture
 that the standard of each tribe was of the same colour with the 
 precious stone in which the name of that tribe was written in the high 
 priest's ephod, and that this was all the difference. Many of the 
 modern Jews think there was some coat of arms painted in each standard, 
 which had reference to the blessing of that tribe by Jacob. Judah bore 
 a lion, Dan a serpent, Naphtali a hind, Benjamin a wolf, &c. Some of 
 them say the four principal standards were, Judah a lion, Reuben a man, 
 Joseph an ox, and Dan an eagle, making the appearances in Ezekiel's 
 vision to allude it. Others say the name of each tribe was written in 
 its standard. Whatever it was, no doubt it gave a certain direction.

 5. They were to pitch about the tabernacle, which was to be in the
 midst of them, as the tent of pavilion of a general in the centre of an 
 army. They must encamp round the tabernacle,

 (1.) That it might be equally a comfort and joy to them all, as it was
 a token of God's gracious presence with them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:5">Ps. xlvi. 5</A>,

 <I>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.</I> Their camp
 had reason to be hearty, when thus they had God in the heart of them. 
 To have bread from heaven every day round about their camp, and fire 
 from heaven, with other tokens of God's favour, in the midst of their 
 camp, was abundantly sufficient to answer that question, <I>Is the Lord 
 among us, or is he not? Happy art thou, O Israel!</I> It is probable
 that the doors of all their tents were made to look towards the 
 tabernacle from all sides, for every Israelite should have his eyes 
 always towards the Lord; therefore they worshipped at the tent-door. 
 The tabernacle was in the midst of the camp, that it might be near to 
 them; for it is a very desirable thing to have the solemn 
 administrations of holy ordinances near us and within our reach.
 <I>The kingdom of God is among you.</I>

 (2.) That they might be a guard and defence upon the tabernacle and the
 Levites on every side. No invader could come near God's tabernacle 
 without first penetrating the thickest of their squadrons. Note, If God 
 undertake the protection of our comforts, we ought in our places to 
 undertake the protection of his institutions, and stand up in defence 
 of his honour, and interest, and ministers. 

 6. Yet they were to pitch afar off, in reverence to the sanctuary, that
 it might not seem crowded and thrust up among them, and that the common 
 business of the camp might be no annoyance to it. They were also taught 
 to keep their distance, lest too much familiarity should breed 
 contempt. It is supposed (from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:4">Joshua iii. 4</A>)

 that the distance between the nearest part of the camp and the
 tabernacle (or perhaps between them and the camp of the Levites, who 
 pitched near the tabernacle) was 2000 cubits, that is, 1000 yards, 
 little more than half a measured mile with us; but the outer parts of 
 the camp must needs be much further off. Some compute that the extent 
 of their camp could be no less than twelve miles square; for it was 
 like a movable city, with streets and lanes, in which perhaps the manna 
 fell, as well as on the outside of the camp, that they might have it at 
 their doors. In the Christian church we read of a throne (as in the 
 tabernacle there was a mercy-seat) which is called a <I>glorious high 
 throne from the beginning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12">Jer. xvii. 12</A>), 

 and that throne surrounded by spiritual Israelites, twenty-four elders,
 double to the number of the tribes, <I>clothed in white raiment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:4">Rev. iv. 4</A>),
 and the banner over them is <I>Love;</I> but we are not ordered, as
 they were, to pitch afar off; no, we are invited to draw near, and come 
 boldly. The saints of the Most High are said to be <I>round about 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:11">Ps. lxxvi. 11</A>.

 God by his grace keep us close to him!</P>

 &nbsp; 33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
 Israel; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 34 And the children of Israel did according to all that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
 they set forward, every one after their families, according to
 the house of their fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the particular distribution of the twelve tribes into four 
 squadrons, three tribes in a squadron, one of which was to lead the 
 other two. Observe, 

 1. God himself appointed them their place, to prevent strife and envy
 among them. Had they been left to determine precedency among 
 themselves, they would have been in danger of quarrelling with one 
 another (as the disciples who strove <I>which should be greatest</I>); 
 each would have had a pretence to be first, or at least not to be last. 
 Had it been left to Moses to determine, they would have quarrelled with 
 him, and charged him with partiality; therefore God does it, who is 
 himself the fountain and judge of honour, and in his appointment all 
 must acquiesce. If God in his providence advance others above us, and 
 abase us, we ought to be as well satisfied in his doing it in that way 
 as if he did it, as this was done here, by a voice out of the 
 tabernacle; and this consideration, that it appears to be the will of 
 God it should be so, should effectually silence all envies and 
 discontents. And as far as our place comes to be our choice our Saviour 
 has given us a rule in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:8">Luke xiv. 8</A>,

 <I>Sit not down in the highest room;</I> and another in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:27">Matt. xx. 27</A>,

 <I>He that will be chief, let him be your servant.</I> Those that are
 most humble and most serviceable are really most honourable.

 2. Every tribe had a captain, a prince, or commander-in-chief, whom God
 himself nominated, the same that had been appointed to number them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>.

 Our being all the children of one Adam is so far from justifying the
 levellers, and taking away the distinction of place and honour, that 
 even among the children of the same Abraham, the same Jacob, the same 
 Judah, God himself appointed that one should be captain of all the 
 rest. There are <I>powers ordained of God,</I> and those to whom
 honour and fear are due and must be paid. Some observe the significancy 
 of the names of these princes, at least, in general, how much God was 
 in the thoughts of those that gave them their names, for most of them 
 have <I>El, God,</I> at one end or other of their names. <I>Nethaneel,
 the gift of God; Eliab, my God a Father; Elizur, my God a rock; 
 Shelumiel, God my peace; Eliasaph, God has added; Elishama, my God has 
 heard: Gamaliel, God my reward; Pagiel, God has met me.</I> By this it 
 appears that the Israelites in Egypt did not quite forget the name of 
 their God, but, when they wanted other memorials, preserved the 
 remembrance of it in the names of their children, and therewith 
 comforted themselves in their affliction.

 3. Those tribes were placed together under the same standard that were 
 nearest of kin to each other; Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, were the 
 three younger sons of Leah, and they were put together; and Issachar 
 and Zebulun would not grudge to be under Judah, since they were his 
 younger brethren. Reuben and Simeon would not have been content in 
 their place. Therefore Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, is made chief of the 
 next squadron; Simeon, no doubt, is willing to be under him, and Gad, 
 the son of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, is fitly added to them in Levi's 
 room: Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, are all the posterity of Rachel. 
 Dan, the eldest son of Bilhah, is made a leading tribe, though the son 
 of a concubine, that more abundant honour might be bestowed on that 
 which lacked; and it was said, <I>Dan should judge his people,</I> and 
 to him were added two younger sons of the handmaids. Thus 
 unexceptionable was the order in which they were placed. 

 4. The tribe of Judah was in the first post of honour, encamped towards
 the rising sun, and in their marches led the van, not only because it 
 was the most numerous tribe, but chiefly because from that tribe Christ 
 was to come, who is the <I>Lion of the tribe of Judah,</I> and was to 
 descend from the loins of him who was now nominated chief captain of 
 that tribe. Nahshon is reckoned among the ancestors of Christ,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:4">Matt. i. 4</A>.

 So that, when he went before them, Christ himself went before them in
 effect, as their leader. Judah was the first of the twelve sons of 
 Jacob that was blessed. Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, were censured by 
 their dying father; he therefore being first in blessing, though not in 
 birth, is put first, to teach children how to value the smiles of their 
 godly parents and dread their frowns.

 5. The tribes of Levi pitched closely about the tabernacle, within the
 rest of their tribes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They must defend the sanctuary, and then the rest of the tribes must 
 defend them. Thus, in the vision which John saw of the glory of heaven, 
 between the elders and the throne were four <I>living creatures full of 
 eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:6,8">Rev. iv. 6, 8</A>.

 Civil powers should protect the religious interests of a nation, and be
 a defence upon that glory.

 6. The camp of Dan (and so that tribe is called long after their
 settlement in Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:25">Judg. xiii. 25</A>),

 because celebrated for their military prowess), though posted in the
 left wing when they encamped, was ordered in their march to bring up 
 the rear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They were the most numerous, next to Judah, and therefore were ordered 
 into a post which, next to the front, required the most strength, for 
 as the strength is so shall the day be. <I>Lastly,</I> The children of 
 Israel observed the orders given them, and did <I>as the Lord commanded 
 Moses,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 They put themselves in the posts assigned them, without murmuring or
 disputing, and, as it was their safety, so it was their beauty; Balaam 
 was charmed with the sight of it: <I>How goodly are thy tents, O 
 Jacob!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:5"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 5</A>.

 Thus the gospel church, called the <I>camp of saints,</I> ought to be
 compact according to the scripture model, every one knowing and keeping 
 his place, and then all that wish well to the church rejoice, 
 <I>beholding their order,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:5">Col. ii. 5</A>.</P>
