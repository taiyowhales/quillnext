 Three more of the plagues of Egypt are related in this chapter, 

 I. That of the frogs, which is, 
 
 1. Threatened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.
 
 2. Inflicted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 3. Mimicked by the magicians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:7">ver. 7</A>.
 
 4. Removed, at the humble request of Pharaoh
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:8-14">ver. 8-14</A>),
 
 who yet hardens his heart, and, notwithstanding his promise while the plague was upon him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:8">ver. 8</A>),

 refuses to let Israel go,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:15">ver. 15</A>.
 
 II. The plague of lice
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),
 
 by which, 
 
 1. The magicians were baffled
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>),
 
 and yet, 
 
 2. Pharaoh was hardened,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:19">ver. 19</A>.
 
 III. That of flies. 
 
 1. Pharaoh is warned of it before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>),

 and told that the land of Goshen should be exempt from this plague,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 2. The plague is brought,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:24">ver. 24</A>.

 3. Pharaoh treats with Moses about the release of Israel, and humbles
 himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:25-29">ver. 25-29</A>.
 
 4. The plague is thereupon removed
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:31">ver. 31</A>),

 and Pharaoh's heart hardened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:32">ver. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
 him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Let my people go, that they may serve
 me.
 &nbsp; 2 And if thou refuse to let <I>them</I> go, behold, I will smite all
 thy borders with frogs:
 &nbsp; 3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
 go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
 upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
 people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:
 &nbsp; 4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy
 people, and upon all thy servants.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
 thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
 over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;
 and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
 up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
 people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
 intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
 destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, <I>that</I> they may
 remain in the river only?
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, <I>Be it</I> according to
 thy word: that thou mayest know that <I>there is</I> none like unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 &nbsp; 11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses,
 and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
 the river only.
 &nbsp; 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> because of the frogs which he had brought against
 Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did according to the word of Moses; and the
 frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
 fields.
 &nbsp; 14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
 stank.
 &nbsp; 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
 heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said.

 Pharaoh is here first threatened and then plagued with frogs, as 
 afterwards, in this chapter, with lice and flies, little despicable 
 inconsiderable animals, and yet by their vast numbers rendered sore 
 plagues to the Egyptians. God could have plagued them with lions, or 
 bears, or wolves, or with vultures or other birds of prey; but he chose 
 to do it by these contemptible instruments. 

 1. That he might magnify his own power. He is Lord of the hosts of the 
 whole creation, has them all at his beck, and makes what use he pleases 
 of them. Some have thought that the power of God is shown as much in 
 the making of an ant as in the making of an elephant; so is his 
 providence in serving his own purposes by the least creatures as 
 effectually as by the strongest, that the excellency of the power, in 
 judgment as well as mercy, may be of God, and not of the creature. See 
 what reason we have to stand in awe of this God, who, when he pleases, 
 can arm the smallest parts of the creation against us. If God be our 
 enemy, all the creatures are at war with us. 

 2. That he might humble Pharaoh's pride, and chastise his insolence. 
 What a mortification must it needs be to this haughty monarch to see 
 himself brought to his knees, and forced to submit, by such despicable 
 means!  Every child is, ordinarily, able to deal with those invaders, 
 and can triumph over them; yet now so numerous were their troops, and 
 so vigorous their assaults, that Pharaoh, with all his chariots and 
 horsemen, could make no head against them. Thus he <I>poureth contempt 
 upon princes</I> that offer contempt to him and his sovereignty, and 
 makes those who will not own him above them to know that, when he 
 pleases, he can make the meanest creature to insult them and trample 
 upon them. As to the plague of frogs we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How it was threatened. Moses, no doubt, attended the divine Majesty 
 daily for fresh instructions, and (perhaps while the river was yet 
 blood) he is here directed to give notice to Pharaoh of another 
 judgment coming upon him, in case he continue obstinate: <I>If thou 
 refuse to let them go,</I> it is at thy peril,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Note, God does not punish men for sin unless they persist in it. <I>If 
 he turn not, he will whet his sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12">Ps. vii. 12</A>),

 which implies favour <I>if he turn.</I> So here, <I>If thou refuse, I
 will smite thy borders,</I> intimating that if Pharaoh complied the 
 controversy should immediately be dropped. The plague threatened, in 
 case of refusal, was formidably extensive. Frogs were to make such an 
 inroad upon them as should make them uneasy in their houses, in their 
 beds, and at their tables; they should not be able to eat, nor drink, 
 nor sleep in quietness, but, wherever they were, should be infested by 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Note, 

 1. God's curse upon a man will pursue him wherever he goes, and lie 
 heavily upon him whatever he does. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:16">Deut. xxviii. 16</A>,

 &c.

 2. There is no avoiding divine judgments when they invade with
 commission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it was inflicted. Pharaoh not regarding the alarm, nor being at 
 all inclined to yield to the summons, Aaron is ordered to draw out the 
 forces, and with his outstretched arm and rod to give the signal of 
 battle. <I>Dictum factum--No sooner said then done;</I> the host is 
 mustered, and, under the direction and command of an invisible power, 
 shoals of frogs invade the land, and the Egyptians, with all their art 
 and all their might, cannot check their progress, nor so much as give 
 them a diversion.  Compare this with that prophecy of an army of 
 locusts and caterpillars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:2">Joel ii. 2</A>,

 &c.; and see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:16,17">Isa. xxxiv. 16, 17</A>.

 Frogs came up, at the divine call, and <I>covered the land.</I> Note,
 God has many ways of disquieting those that live at ease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How the magicians were permitted to imitate it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They also brought up frogs, but could not remove those that God sent. 
 The unclean spirits which came <I>out of the mouth of the dragon</I> 
 are said to be like frogs, which go forth to the kings of the earth, to 
 deceive them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:13">Rev. xvi. 13</A>),

 which probably alludes to these frogs, for it follows the account of
 the turning of the waters into blood. The dragon, like the magicians, 
 intended by them to deceive, but God intended by them to destroy those 
 that would be deceived.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How Pharaoh relented under this plague: it was the first time he 
 did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He begs of Moses to intercede for the removal of the frogs, and 
 promises fair that he will let the people go. He that a little while 
 ago had spoken with the utmost disdain both of God and Moses is now 
 glad to be beholden to the mercy of God and the prayers of Moses. Note, 
 Those that bid defiance to God and prayer in a day of extremity will, 
 first or last, be made to see their need of both, and will cry, 
 <I>Lord, Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22">Matt. vii. 22</A>.

 Those that have bantered prayer have been brought to beg it, as the
 rich man that had scorned Lazarus courted him for a drop of water.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How Moses fixes the time with Pharaoh, and then prevails with God by 
 prayer for the removal of the frogs. Moses, to show that his 
 performances had no dependence upon the conjunctions or oppositions of 
 the planets, or the luckiness of any one hour more than another, bids 
 Pharaoh name his time. <I>Nellum occurrit tempus regi--No time fixed on 
 by the king shall be objected to,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>Have thou this honour over me,</I> tell me <I>against when I shall 
 entreat for thee.</I> This was designed for Pharaoh's conviction, that, 
 if his eyes were not opened by the plague, they might by the removal of 
 it. So various are the methods God takes to bring men to repentance. 
 Pharaoh sets the time for <I>to-morrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And why not immediately? Was he so fond of his guests that he would 
 have them stay another night with him? No, but probably he hoped that 
 they would go away of themselves, and then he should get clear of the 
 plague without being obliged either to God or Moses. However, Moses 
 joins issue with him upon it: "<I>Be it according to thy word,</I> it 
 shall be done just when thou wouldst have it done, <I>that thou mayest 
 know that,</I> whatever the magicians pretend to, <I>there is none like 
 unto the Lord our God.</I> None has such a command as he has over all 
 the creatures, nor is any one so ready to forgive those that humble 
 themselves before him." Note, The great design both of judgments and 
 mercies is to convince us that there is none like the Lord our God, 
 none so wise, so mighty, so good, no enemy so formidable, no friend so 
 desirable, so valuable. Moses, hereupon, applies to God, prays 
 earnestly to him, to remand the frogs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, We must pray for our enemies and persecutors, even the worst as 
 Christ did. In answer to the prayer of Moses, the frogs that came up 
 one day perished the next, or the next but one. They all died

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and, that it might appear that they were real frogs, their dead bodies 
 were left to be raked together in heaps, so that the smell of them 
 became offensive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, The great Sovereign of the world makes what use he pleases of the 
 lives and deaths of his creatures; and he that gives a being, to serve 
 one purpose, may, without wrong to his justice, call for it again 
 immediately, to serve another purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. What was the issue of this plague 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>When Pharaoh saw there was a respite,</I> without considering either 
 what he had lately felt or what he had reason to fear, he hardened his 
 heart. Note, 

 1.  Till the heart is renewed by the grace of God, the impressions made 
 by the force of affliction do not abide; the convictions wear off, and 
 the promises that were extorted are forgotten. Till the disposition of 
 the air is changed, what thaws in the sun will freeze again in the 
 shade.  

 2. God's patience is shamefully abused by impenitent sinners.  The 
 respite he gives them, to lead them to repentance, they are hardened 
 by; and while he graciously allows them a truce, in order to the making 
 of their peace, they take that opportunity to rally again the baffled 
 forces of an obstinate infidelity. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11,Ps+78:34">Eccl. viii. 11; Ps. lxxviii. 34</A>,
 
 &c.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex8_16"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ex8_17"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ex8_18"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ex8_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out
 thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
 throughout all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
 rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man,
 and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all
 the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
 forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and
 upon beast.
 &nbsp; 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This <I>is</I> the finger
 of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
 unto them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a short account of the plague of lice. It does not appear that 
 any warning was given of it before. Pharaoh's abuse of the respite 
 granted to him might have been a sufficient warning to him to expect 
 another plague: for if the removal of an affliction harden us, and so 
 we lose the benefit of it, we may conclude it goes away with a purpose 
 to return or to make room for a worse.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this plague of lice was inflicted on the Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 The frogs were produced out of the waters, but these live out of <I>the
 dust of the earth;</I> for out of any part of the creation God can 
 fetch a scourge, with which to correct those that rebel against him. He 
 has many arrows in his quiver. Even the dust of the earth obeys him. 
 "<I>Fear not then, thou worm Jacob,</I> for God can use thee as a 
 threshing instrument, if he please," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:14,15">Isa. xli. 14, 15</A>.

 These lice, no doubt, were extremely vexatious, as well as scandalous,
 to the Egyptians. Though they had respite, they had respite but awhile, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:14">Rev. xi. 14</A>.

 The second woe was past, but behold the third woe came very
 quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the magicians were baffled by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They attempted to imitate it, but they could not. When they failed in 
 this, it should seem they attempted to remove it; for it follows, <I>So 
 there were lice upon man and beast,</I> in spite of them.  This forced 
 them to confess themselves overpowered: <I>This is the finger of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 that is, "This check and restraint put upon us must needs be from a 
 divine power." Note, 

 1. God has the devil in a chain, and limits him both as a deceiver and 
 as a destroyer; <I>hitherto he shall come, but no further.</I> The 
 devil's agents when God permitted them, could do great things; but when 
 he laid an embargo upon them, though but with his finger, they could do 
 nothing. The magicians' inability, in this less instance, showed whence 
 they had their ability in the former instances which seemed greater, 
 and that they had no power against Moses but what was given them from 
 above. 

 2. Sooner or later God will extort, even from his enemies, an 
 acknowledgment of his own sovereignty and over-ruling power. It is 
 certain they must all (as we say) knock under at last, as Julian the 
 apostate did, when his dying lips confessed, <I>Thou hast overcome me, 
 O thou Galilean!</I> God will not only be too hard for all opposers, 
 but will force them to own it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How Pharaoh, notwithstanding this, was made more and more 
 obstinate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 even those that had deceived him now said enough to undeceive him, and 
 yet he grew more and more obstinate. Even the miracles and the 
 judgments were to him a savour of death unto death.  Note, Those that 
 are not made better by God's word and providences are commonly made 
 worse by them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
 and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and
 say unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Let my people go, that they
 may serve me.
 &nbsp; 21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
 swarms <I>of flies</I> upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
 people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
 shall be full of swarms <I>of flies,</I> and also the ground whereon
 they <I>are.</I>
 &nbsp; 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
 people dwell, that no swarms <I>of flies</I> shall be there; to the
 end thou mayest know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the midst of the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people:
 to morrow shall this sign be.
 &nbsp; 24 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did so; and there came a grievous swarm <I>of
 flies</I> into the house of Pharaoh, and <I>into</I> his servants'
 houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by
 reason of the swarm <I>of flies.</I>
 &nbsp; 25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
 sacrifice to your God in the land.
 &nbsp; 26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
 sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God:
 lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before
 their eyes, and will they not stone us?
 &nbsp; 27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
 sacrifice to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, as he shall command us.
 &nbsp; 28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice
 to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
 far away: intreat for me.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will
 intreat the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that the swarms <I>of flies</I> may depart from
 Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but
 let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the
 people go to sacrifice to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 31 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did according to the word of Moses; and he
 removed the swarms <I>of flies</I> from Pharaoh, from his servants,
 and from his people; there remained not one.
 &nbsp; 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
 would he let the people go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the story of the plague of flies, in which we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How it was threatened, like that of frogs, before it was inflicted. 
 Moses is directed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 to rise early in the morning, to meet Pharaoh when he came forth to the 
 water, and there to repeat his demands. Note, 

 1. Those that would bring great things to pass for God and their 
 generation must rise early, and redeem time in the morning. Pharaoh was 
 early up at his superstitious devotions to the river; and shall we be 
 for more sleep and more slumber when any service is to be done which 
 would pass well in our account in the great day? 

 2. Those that would approve themselves God's faithful servants must not 
 be afraid of the face of man. Moses must <I>stand before Pharaoh,</I> 
 proud as he was, and tell him that which was in the highest degree 
 humbling, must challenge him (if he refused to release his captives) to 
 engage with any army of flies, which would obey God's orders of Pharaoh 
 would not.  See a similar threatening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:18">Isa. vii. 18</A>,

 <I>The Lord will hiss</I> (or whistle) <I>for the fly and the bee,</I>
 to come and serve his purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the Egyptians and the Hebrews were to be remarkably 
 distinguished in this plague, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 It is probable that this distinction had not been so manifest and 
 observable in any of the foregoing plagues as it was to be in this. 
 Thus, as the plague of lice was made more convincing than any before 
 it, by its running the magicians aground, so was this, by the 
 distinction made between the Egyptians and the Hebrews. Pharaoh must be 
 made to know that <I>God is the Lord in the midst of the earth;</I> and 
 by this it will be known beyond dispute. 

 1. Swarms of flies, which seem to us to fly at random, shall be 
 manifestly under the conduct of an intelligent mind, while they are 
 above the direction of any man.  "Hither they shall go," says Moses, 
 "and thither they shall not come;" and the performance is punctually 
 according to this appointment, and both, compared, amount to a 
 demonstration that he that said it and he that did it was the same, 
 even a Being of infinite power and wisdom. 

 2.  The servants and worshippers of the great Jehovah shall be 
 preserved from sharing in the common calamities of the place they live 
 in, so that the plague which annoys all their neighbours shall not 
 approach them; and this shall be an incontestable proof that God is 
 <I>the Lord in the midst of the earth.</I> Put both these together, and 
 it appears that <I>the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the 
 earth,</I> and through the air too, to direct that which to us seems 
 most casual, to serve some great designed end, that he may <I>show 
 himself strong on the behalf of those whose hearts are upright with 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>.

 Observe how it is repeated: <I>I will put a division between my people
 and thy people</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, The Lord knows those that are his, and will make it appear, 
 perhaps in this world, certainly in the other, that he has set them 
 apart for himself. A day will come when you shall <I>return and discern 
 between the righteous and the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:18">Mal. iii. 18</A>),

 <I>the sheep and the goats</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32,Eze+34:17">Matt. xxv. 32; Ezek. xxxiv. 17</A>),

 though now intermixed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it was inflicted, the day after it was threatened: <I>There 
 came a grievous swarm of flies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 flies of divers sorts, and such as devoured them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:45">Ps. lxxviii. 45</A>.

 The prince of the power of the air has gloried in being
 <I>Beelzebub--the god of flies;</I> but here it is proved that even in 
 <I>that</I> he is a pretender and a usurper, for even with swarms of 
 flies God fights against his kingdom and prevails.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How Pharaoh, upon this attack, sounded a parley, and entered into a 
 treaty with Moses and Aaron about a surrender of his captives: but 
 observe with what reluctance he yields.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is content they should sacrifice to their God, provided they 
 would do it in the land of Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Note, God can extort a toleration of his worship, even from those that 
 are really enemies to it. Pharaoh, under the smart of the rod, is 
 content they should do sacrifice, and will allow liberty of conscience 
 to God's Israel, even in his own land. But Moses will not accept his 
 concession; he cannot do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It would be an abomination to God should they offer the Egyptian 
 sacrifices, and an abomination to the Egyptians should they offer to 
 God their own sacrifices, as they ought; so that they could not 
 sacrifice in the land without incurring the displeasure either of their 
 God or of their task-masters; therefore he insists: <I>We will go three 
 days' journey into the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:27"><I>v.</I>  27</A>.

 Note, Those that would offer an acceptable sacrifice to God must, 

 (1.) Separate themselves from the wicked and profane; for we cannot 
 have fellowship both with the Father of lights and with the works of 
 darkness, both with Christ and with Belial,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14,Ps+26:4,6">2 Cor. vi. 14, &c.; Ps. xxvi. 4, 6</A>.

 (2.) They must retire from the distractions of the world, and get as
 far as may be from the noise of it. Israel cannot keep the feast of the 
 Lord either among the brick-kilns or among the flesh-pots of Egypt; no, 
 <I>We will go into the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14,So+7:11">Hos. ii. 14; Cant. vii. 11</A>.

 (3.) They must observe the divine appointment: "We will sacrifice as
 God shall command us, and not otherwise." Though they were in the 
 utmost degree of slavery to Pharaoh, yet in the worship of God, they 
 must observe his commands and not Pharaoh's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When this proposal is rejected, he consents for them to go into the 
 wilderness, provided they do not go <I>very far away,</I> not so far 
 but that he might fetch them back again, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is probable he had heard of their design upon Canaan, and suspected 
 that if once they left Egypt they would never come back again; and 
 therefore, when he is forced to consent that they shall go (the swarms 
 of flies buzzing the necessity in his ears), yet he is not willing that 
 they should go out of his reach.  Thus some sinners who, in a pang of 
 conviction, part with their sins, yet are loth they should go very far 
 away; for, when the fright is over, they will return to them again. We 
 observe here a struggle between Pharaoh's convictions and his 
 corruptions; his convictions said, "Let them go;" his corruptions said, 
 "Yet not very far away:" but he sided with his corruptions against his 
 convictions, and this was his ruin. This proposal Moses so far accepted 
 as that he promised the removal of this plague upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 See here, 

 (1.) How ready God is to accept sinners' submissions. Pharaoh does but 
 say, <I>Entreat for me</I> (though it is with regret that he humbles so 
 far), and Moses promises immediately, <I>I will entreat the Lord for 
 thee,</I> that Pharaoh might see what the design of the plague was, not 
 to bring him to ruin, but to bring him to repentance. With what 
 pleasure did God say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:29">1 Kings xxi. 29</A>),

 <I>Seest thou how Ahab humbles himself?</I> 

 (2.) What need we have to be admonished that we be sincere in our 
 submission: <I>But let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more.</I> Those 
 that deal deceitfully are justly suspected, and must be cautioned not 
 to return again to folly, after God has once more spoken peace. <I>Be 
 not deceived, God is not mocked;</I> if we think to put a cheat upon 
 God by a counterfeit repentance, and a fraudulent surrender of 
 ourselves to him, we shall prove, in the end, to have put a fatal cheat 
 upon our own souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The issue of all was that God graciously removed the
 plague 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>),

 but Pharaoh perfidiously returned to his hardness, and <I>would not let 
 the people go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 His pride would not let him part with such a flower of his crown as his 
 dominion over Israel was, nor his covetousness with such a branch of 
 his revenue as their labours were.  Note, Reigning lusts break through 
 the strongest bounds, and make men impudently presumptuous and 
 scandalously perfidious. Let not sin therefore reign; for, if it do, it 
 will betray and hurry us to the grossest absurdities.</P>
