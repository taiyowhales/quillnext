 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The contents of this chapter we have, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:6-8">2 Pet. ii. 6-8</A>,
 where we find 
 that "God, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into 
 ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, and delivered just 
 Lot." It is the history of Sodom's ruin, and Lot's rescue from 
 that ruin. We read
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:1-33"><I>ch.</I> xviii</A>)
 of God's coming to take a view 
 of the present state of Sodom, what its wickedness was, and 
 what righteous persons there were in it: now here we have the 
 result of that enquiry. 
 
 I. It was found, upon trial, that Lot was 
 very good
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),
 and it did not appear that there was any 
 more of the same character. 
 
 II. It was found that the Sodomites 
 were very wicked and vile,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:4-11">ver. 4-11</A>.
 
 III. Special care was therefore 
 taken for the securing of Lot and his family, in a place of
 safety,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:12-23">ver. 12-23</A>.
 
 IV. Mercy having rejoiced therein, justice 
 shows itself in the ruin of Sodom and the death of Lot's wife
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:24-26">ver. 24-26</A>),
 with a general repetition of the story,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:27-29">ver. 27-29</A>.
 
 V. A foul sin that Lot was guilty of, in committing incest 
 with his two daughters,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:30-38">ver. 30</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And there came two angels to 
 Sodom at even; and Lot sat 
 in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing 
 <I>them</I> rose up to meet them; and he 
 bowed himself with his face toward 
 the ground;
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, Behold 
 now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, 
 into your servant's house, and tarry 
 all night, and wash your feet, and ye 
 shall rise up early, and go on your 
 ways. And they said, Nay; but we 
 will abide in the street all night.
 &nbsp; 3 And he pressed upon them greatly; 
 and they turned in unto him, and entered 
 into his house; and he made 
 them a feast, and did bake unleavened 
 bread, and they did eat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These angels, it is likely, were two of the 
 three that had just before been with Abraham, 
 the two created angels that were sent to 
 execute God's purpose concerning Sodom. 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. There was but one good 
 man in Sodom, and these heavenly messengers 
 soon found him out. Wherever we are, 
 we should enquire out those of the place that 
 live in the fear of God, and should choose to 
 associate ourselves with them. 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:11">Matt. x. 11</A>,
 <I>Enquire who is worthy, and there abide.</I> Those 
 of the same country, when they are in a 
 foreign country, love to be together. 
 
 2. Lot sufficiently distinguished himself from the 
 rest of his neighbours, at this time, which 
 plainly set a mark upon him. He that did 
 not act like the rest must not fare like the 
 rest. 
 
 (1.) Lot sat in the gate of Sodom at 
 even. When the rest, it is likely, were tippling 
 and drinking, he sat alone, waiting for 
 an opportunity to do good. 
 
 (2.) He was extremely respectful to men whose mien 
 and aspect were sober and serious, though 
 they did not come in state. He bowed himself 
 to the ground, when he met them, as if, 
 upon the first view, he discerned something 
 divine in them. 
 
 (3.) He was hospitable, and 
 very free and generous in his invitations and 
 entertainments. He courted these strangers 
 to his house, and to the best accommodations 
 he had, and gave them all the evidences that 
 he could of his sincerity; for, 
 
 [1.] When the 
 angels, to try whether he was hearty in the 
 invitation, declined the acceptance of it, at 
 first (which is the common usage of modesty, 
 and no reproach at all to truth and honesty), 
 their refusal did not make him more importunate; 
 for he <I>pressed upon them greatly</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>), 
 partly because he would by no means have
 them to expose themselves to the inconveniences 
 and perils of lodging in the street of 
 Sodom, and partly because he was desirous 
 of their company and converse. He had not 
 seen two such honest faces in Sodom this 
 great while. Note, Those that live in bad 
 places should know how to value the society 
 of those that are wise and good, and earnestly 
 desire it. 
 
 [2.] When the angels accepted 
 his invitation, he treated them nobly; he 
 made a feast for them, and thought it well-bestowed 
 on such guests. Note, Good 
 people should be (with prudence) generous 
 people.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 But before they lay down, the 
 men of the city, <I>even</I> the men of Sodom, 
 compassed the house round, 
 both old and young, all the people 
 from every quarter:
 &nbsp; 5 And they 
 called unto Lot, and said unto him, 
 Where <I>are</I> the men which came in to 
 thee this night? bring them out unto 
 us, that we may know them.
 &nbsp; 6 And 
 Lot went out at the door unto them, 
 and shut the door after him,
 &nbsp; 7 And 
 said, I pray you, brethren, do not so 
 wickedly.
 &nbsp; 8 Behold now, I have two 
 daughters which have not known man;
 let me, I pray you, bring them out 
 unto you, and do ye to them as <I>is</I> 
 good in your eyes: only unto these 
 men do nothing; for therefore came 
 they under the shadow of my roof.
 &nbsp; 9 And they said, Stand back. And 
 they said <I>again,</I> This one <I>fellow</I> 
 came in to sojourn, and he will needs 
 be a judge: now will we deal worse 
 with thee, than with them. And 
 they pressed sore upon the man, <I>even</I> 
 Lot, and came near to break the 
 door.
 &nbsp; 10 But the men put forth their 
 hand, and pulled Lot into the house to 
 them, and shut to the door.
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 they smote the men that <I>were</I> at the

 <A NAME="Page122"> </A>

 door of the house with blindness, both
 small and great: so that they wearied
 themselves to find the door.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now it appeared, beyond contradiction, 
 that the cry of Sodom was no louder than 
 there was cause for. This night's work was 
 enough to fill the measure. For we find here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they were all wicked,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 Wickedness had become universal, and they were 
 unanimous in any vile design. Here were 
 old and young, and all from every quarter, 
 engaged in this riot; the old were not 
 past it, and the young had soon come up to 
 it. Either they had no magistrates to keep 
 the peace, and protect the peaceable, or their 
 magistrates were themselves aiding and abetting. 
 Note, When the disease of sin has 
 become epidemical, it is fatal to any place, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:5-7">Isa. i. 5-7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they had arrived at the highest 
 pitch of wickedness; they were <I>sinners before 
 the Lord exceedingly</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>);
 for, 
 
 1. It 
 was the most unnatural and abominable 
 wickedness that they were now set upon, a 
 sin that still bears their name, and is called 
 <I>Sodomy.</I> They were carried headlong by 
 those vile affections 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:26,27">Rom. i. 26, 27</A>),
 which are worse than brutish, and the eternal 
 reproach of the human nature, and which 
 cannot be thought of without horror by those 
 that have the least spark of virtue and any 
 remains of natural light and conscience. 
 Note, Those that allow themselves in unnatural 
 uncleanness are marked for the vengeance 
 of eternal fire. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.
 
 2. They 
 were not ashamed to own it, and to prosecute 
 their design by force and arms. The practice 
 would have been bad enough if it had been 
 carried on by intrigue and wheedling; but 
 they proclaimed war with virtue, and bade open 
 defiance to it. Hence daring sinners are said 
 to <I>declare their sin as Sodom,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9">Isa. iii. 9</A>.
 Note, 
 Those that have become impudent in sin 
 generally prove impenitent in sin; and it will 
 be their ruin. Those have hard hearts indeed 
 that sin with a high hand, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:15">Jer. vi. 15</A>.

 3. When Lot interposed, with all the mildness 
 imaginable, to check the rage and fury of 
 their lust, they were most insolently rude and 
 abusive to him. He ventured himself among 
 them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 He spoke civilly to them, called 
 them <I>brethren</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 and begged of them 
 not to do so wickedly; and, being greatly 
 disturbed at their vile attempt, he unadvisedly 
 and unjustifiably offered to prostitute his two 
 daughters to them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 It is true, of two 
 evils we must choose the less; but of two
 sins we must choose neither, nor ever do
 evil that good may come of it. He reasoned 
 with them, pleaded the laws of hospitality 
 and the protection of his house which his 
 guests were entitled to; but he might as well 
 have offered reason to a roaring lion and a 
 raging bear as to these head-strong sinners, 
 who were governed only by lust and passion. 
 Lot's arguing with them does but exasperate 
 them; and, to complete their wickedness, 
 and fill up the measure of it, they fall foul 
 upon him. 
 
 (1.) They ridicule him, charge him 
 with the absurdity of pretending to be a magistrate, 
 when he was not so much as a free-man 
 of their city,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Note, It is common for a 
 reprover to be unjustly upbraided as a usurper; 
 and, while offering the kindness of a 
 friend, to be charged with assuming the 
 authority of a judge: as if a man might not 
 speak reason without taking too much upon
 him. 
 
 (2.) They threaten him, and lay violent 
 hands upon him; and the good man is in 
 danger of being pulled in pieces by this outrageous 
 rabble. Note, 
 
 [1.] Those that hate 
 to be reformed hate those that reprove them, 
 though with ever so much tenderness. Presumptuous 
 sinners do by their consciences 
 as the Sodomites did by Lot, baffle their 
 checks, stifle their accusations, press hard 
 upon them, till they have seared them and 
 quite stopped their mouths, and so made 
 themselves ripe for ruin. 
 
 [2.] Abuses offered 
 to God's messengers and to faithful reprovers 
 soon fill the measure of a people's wickedness, 
 and bring destruction without remedy. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:1">Prov. xxix. 1</A>,
 and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.
 If reproofs remedy not, there is no remedy. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That nothing less than the power of 
 an angel could save a good man out of their 
 wicked hands. It was now past dispute 
 what Sodom's character was and what course 
 must be taken with it, and therefore the 
 angels immediately give a specimen of what 
 they further intended. 
 1. They rescue Lot,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Note, He that watereth shall be 
 watered also himself. Lot was solicitous to 
 protect them, and now they take effectual 
 care for his safety, in return for his kindness. 
 Note further, Angels are employed for the 
 special preservation of those that expose 
 themselves to danger by well-doing. The 
 saints, at death, are pulled like Lot into a 
 house of perfect safety, and the door shut for 
 ever against those that pursue them. 
 
 2. They 
 chastise the insolence of the Sodomites: <I>They 
 smote them with blindness,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 This was 
 designed, 
 
 (1.) To put an end to their 
 attempt, and disable them from pursuing it. 
 Justly were those struck blind who had been 
 deaf to reason. Violent persecutors are often 
 infatuated so that they cannot push on their 
 malicious designs against God's messengers, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:14,15">Job v. 14, 15</A>.
 Yet these Sodomites, after 
 they were struck blind, continued seeking the 
 door, to break it down, till they were tired. 
 No judgments will, of themselves, change 
 the corrupt natures and purposes of wicked 
 men. If their minds had not been blinded 
 as well as their bodies, they would have said, 
 as the magicians, <I>This is the finger of God,</I> 
 and would have submitted. 
 
 (2.) It was to 
 be an earnest of their utter ruin, the next day. 
 When God, in a way of righteous judgment, 
 blinds men, their condition is already desperate, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8,9">Rom. xi. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the men said unto Lot, 
 Hast thou here any besides? son in 
 law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, 
 and whatsoever thou hast in the city, 
 bring <I>them</I> out of this place:
 &nbsp; 13 For 
 we will destroy this place, because 
 the cry of them is waxen great before 
 the face of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 hath sent us to destroy it.
 &nbsp; 14 And 
 Lot went out, and spake unto his 
 sons in law, which married his daughters, 
 and said, Up, get you out of this 
 place; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will destroy this 
 city. But he seemed as one that
 mocked unto his sons in law.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the preparation for Lot's 
 deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Notice is given him of the approach of 
 Sodom's ruin: <I>We will destroy this place,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Note, The holy angels are ministers 
 of God's wrath for the destruction of sinners, 
 as well as of his mercy for the preservation 
 and deliverance of his people. In this 
 sense, the good angels become <I>evil angels,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:49">Ps. lxxviii. 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is directed to give notice to his 
 friends and relations, that they, if they would,
 might be saved with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 "<I>Hast 
 thou here any besides,</I> that thou art concerned 
 for? If thou hast, go tell them what is 
 coming." Now this implies, 
 
 1. The command 
 of a great duty, which was to do all he could 
 for the salvation of those about him, to snatch 
 them as brands out of the fire. Note, Those 
 who through grace are themselves delivered 
 out of a sinful state should do what they can 
 for the deliverance of others, especially their 
 relations. 
 
 2. The offer of great favour. They 
 do not ask whether he knew any righteous 
 ones in the city fit to be spared: no, they 
 knew there were none; but they ask what 
 relations he had there, that, whether righteous 
 or unrighteous, they might be saved with 
 him. Note, Bad people often fare the better 
 in this world for the sake of their good relations. 
 It is good being akin to a godly man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He applies himself accordingly to his 
 sons-in-law,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. The fair 
 warning that Lot gave them: <I>Up, get you 
 out of this place.</I> The manner of expression 
 is startling and quickening. It was no time 
 to trifle when the destruction was just at the 
 door. They had not forty days to repent in, 
 as the Ninevites had. Now or never they 
 must make their escape. At midnight this 
 cry was made. Such as this is our call to the 
 unconverted, to turn and live. 
 
 2. The slight 
 they put upon this warning: <I>He seemed to 
 them as one that mocked.</I> They thought, 
 perhaps, that the assault which the Sodomites 
 had just now made upon his house had disturbed 
 his head, and put him into such a 
 fright that he knew not what he said; or 
 they thought that he was not in earnest with 
 them. Those who lived a merry life, and made 
 a jest of everything, made a jest of this warning, 
 and so they perished in the overthrow. 
 Thus many who are warned of the misery 
 and danger they are in by sin make a light 
 matter of it, and think their ministers do but 
 jest with them; such will perish with their 
 blood upon their own heads.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And when the morning arose, 
 then the angels hastened Lot, saying, 
 Arise, take thy wife, and thy two 
 daughters, which are here; lest thou 
 be consumed in the iniquity of the 
 city.
 &nbsp; 16 And while he lingered, the 
 men laid hold upon his hand, and
 upon the hand of his wife, and upon 
 the hand of his two daughters; the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> being merciful unto him: and 
 they brought him forth, and set him 
 without the city.
 &nbsp; 17 And it came to 
 pass, when they had brought them 
 forth abroad, that he said, Escape for 
 thy life; look not behind thee, neither 
 stay thou in all the plain; escape to 
 the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
 &nbsp; 18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not 
 so, my Lord:
 &nbsp; 19 Behold now, thy 
 servant hath found grace in thy sight, 
 and thou hast magnified thy mercy, 
 which thou hast showed unto me in
 saving my life; and I cannot escape 
 to the mountain, lest some evil 
 take me, and I die:
 &nbsp; 20 Behold now, 
 this city <I>is</I> near to flee unto, and it <I>is</I> 
 a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, 
 (<I>is</I> it not a little one?) and my soul 
 shall live.
 &nbsp; 21 And he said unto him, 
 See, I have accepted thee concerning
 this thing also, that I will not overthrow 
 this city, for the which thou 
 hast spoken.
 &nbsp; 22 Haste thee, escape 
 thither; for I cannot do any thing 
 till thou be come thither. Therefore 
 the name of the city was called Zoar.
 &nbsp; 23 The sun was risen upon the earth 
 when Lot entered into Zoar.

 Here is, 
 
 I. The rescue of Lot out of Sodom. 
 Though there were not ten righteous 
 men in Sodom, for whose sakes it might 
 be spared, yet that one righteous man that 
 was among them delivered his own soul, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>.
 Early in the morning his 
 own guests, in kindness to him, turned him 
 out of doors, and his family with him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 His daughters that were married perished 
 with their unbelieving husbands; but those 
 that continued with him were preserved with 
 him. Observe,</P>

 <A NAME="Page124"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With what a gracious violence Lot was 
 brought out of Sodom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 It seems, 
 though he did not make a jest of the warning 
 given, as his sons-in-law did, yet he lingered, 
 he trifled, he did not make so much haste as 
 the case required. Thus many that are under 
 some convictions about the misery of their 
 spiritual state, and the necessity of a change, 
 yet defer that needful work, and foolishly 
 linger. Lot did so, and it might have been 
 fatal to him if the angels had not <I>laid hold of
 his hand, and brought him forth,</I> and saved 
 him with fear, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:23">Jude 23</A>.
 Herein it is said, 
 <I>The Lord was merciful to him;</I> otherwise he 
 might justly have left him to perish, since he 
 was so loth to depart. Note, 
 
 (1.) The salvation 
 of the most righteous men must be 
 attributed to God's mercy, not to their own 
 merit. We are saved by grace. 
 
 (2.) God's 
 power also must be acknowledged in the 
 bringing of souls out of a sinful state. If 
 God had not brought us forth, we had never 
 come forth. 
 
 (3.) If God had not been merciful 
 to us, our lingering had been our ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With what a gracious vehemence he 
 was urged to make the best of his way, when 
 he was <I>brought forth,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 (1.) He must 
 still apprehend himself in danger of being 
 consumed, and be quickened by the law of 
 self-preservation to flee for his life. Note, 
 A holy fear and trembling are found necessary 
 to the working out of our salvation. 
 
 (2.) He must therefore mind his business 
 with the utmost care and diligence. He must 
 not hanker after Sodom: <I>Look not behind thee.</I> 
 He must not loiter by the way: <I>Stay not in 
 the plain;</I> for it would all be made one 
 dead sea. He must not take up short of the 
 place of refuge appointed him: <I>Escape to the 
 mountain.</I> Such as these are the commands 
 given to those who through grace are delivered 
 out of a sinful state. 
 
 [1.] Return not 
 to sin and Satan, for that is looking back to 
 Sodom. 
 
 [2.] Rest not in self and the world, 
 for that is staying in the plain. And, 
 
 [3.] Reach towards Christ and heaven, for that is 
 escaping to the mountain, short of which we 
 must not take up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fixing of a place of refuge for him. 
 The mountain was first appointed for him to 
 flee to, but, 
 
 1. He begged for a city of refuge, 
 one of the five that lay together, called <I>Bela,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:2,19:18-20"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 2, xix. 18-20</A>.
 It was Lot's weakness to 
 think a city of his own choosing safer than 
 the mountain of God's appointing. And he 
 argued against himself when he pleaded, 
 <I>Thou hast magnified thy mercy in saving my 
 life, and I cannot escape to the mountain;</I> for 
 could not he that plucked him out of Sodom, 
 when he lingered, carry him safely to the 
 mountain, though he began to tire? Could 
 not he that saved him from greater evils save 
 him from the less? He insists much in his 
 petition upon the smallness of the place: <I>It 
 is a little one, it is not?</I> therefore, it was to 
 be hoped, not so bad as the rest. This gave 
 a new name to the place; it was called <I>Zoar, 
 a little one.</I> Intercessions for little ones are 
 worthy to be remembered. 
 
 2. God granted 
 him his request, though there was much 
 infirmity in it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.
 See what favour 
 God showed to a true saint, though weak. 
 
 (1.) Zoar was spared, to gratify him. Though 
 his intercession for it was not, as Abraham's 
 for Sodom, from a principle of generous 
 charity, but merely from self-interest, yet 
 God granted him his request, to show how 
 much the fervent prayer of a righteous man 
 avails. 
 
 (2.) Sodom's ruin was suspended 
 till he was safe: <I>I cannot do any thing till 
 thou shalt have come thither.</I> Note, The very 
 presence of good men in a place helps to keep 
 off judgments. See what care God takes for 
 the preservation of his people. The winds 
 are held till God's servants are sealed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3,Eze+9:4">Rev. vii. 3; Ezek. ix. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is taken notice of that the sun had 
 risen when Lot entered into Zoar; for when 
 a good man comes into a place he brings 
 light along with him, or should do.</P>

 &nbsp; 25 And he overthrew those cities, and 
 all the plain, and all the inhabitants 
 of the cities, and that which grew 
 upon the ground.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Then,</I> when Lot had got safely into Zoar, 
 then this ruin came; for good men are taken 
 away from the evil to come. <I>Then,</I> when the 
 sun had risen bright and clear, promising a 
 fair day, then this storm arose, to show that 
 it was not from natural causes. Concerning 
 this destruction observe, 
 
 1. God was the 
 immediate author of it. It was destruction 
 from the Almighty: <I>The Lord rained--from 
 the Lord</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 that is, God from himself, 
 by his own immediate power, and not in the 
 common course of nature. Or, God the Son 
 from God the Father; for the Father has 
 committed all judgment to the Son. Note, 
 He that is the Saviour will be the destroyer 
 of those that reject the salvation. 
 
 2. It was 
 a strange punishment, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:3">Job xxxi. 3</A>.
 Never 
 was the like before nor since. Hell was 
 rained from heaven upon them. <I>Fire, and 
 brimstone, and a horrible tempest, were the 
 portion of their cup</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>);
 not a flash of 
 lightning, which is destructive enough when 
 God gives it commission, but a shower of 
 lightning. Brimstone was scattered upon 
 their habitation 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:15">Job xviii. 15</A>),
 and then the 
 fire soon fastened upon them. God could 
 have drowned them, as he did the old world; 
 but he would show that he has many arrows
 in his quiver, fire as well as water. 
 
 3. It was 
 a judgment that laid all waste: <I>It overthrew
 the cities,</I> and destroyed all the inhabitants of 
 them, the plain, and all that grew upon the 
 ground,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 It was an utter ruin, and 
 irreparable. That fruitful valley remains to 
 this day a great lake, or dead sea; it is called 
 
 <A NAME="Page125"> </A>

 <I>the Salt Sea,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:12">Num. xxxiv. 12</A>.
 Travellers say 
 that it is about thirty miles long and ten 
 miles broad; it has no living creature in it; 
 it is not moved by the wind; the smell of it 
 is offensive; things do not easily sink in it. 
 The Greeks call it <I>Asphaltites,</I> from a sort of 
 pitch which it casts up. Jordan falls into it, 
 and is lost there. 
 
 4. It was a punishment 
 that answered to their sin. Burning lusts 
 against nature were justly punished with 
 this preternatural burning. Those that went 
 after strange flesh were destroyed by strange 
 fire, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.
 They persecuted the angels 
 with their rabble, and made Lot afraid; and 
 now God persecuted them with his tempest, 
 and made them afraid with his storm, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:15">Ps. lxxxiii. 15</A>.

 5. It was designed for a standing 
 revelation of the wrath of God against sin 
 and sinners in all ages. It is, accordingly, 
 often referred to in the scripture, and made a 
 pattern of the ruin of Israel 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:23">Deut. xxix. 23</A>),
 of Babylon 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:19">Isa. xiii. 19</A>),
 of Edom
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:17,18">Jer. xlix. 17, 18</A>),
 of Moab and Ammon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:9">Zep. ii. 9</A>.
 Nay, 
 it was typical of <I>the vengeance of eternal fire</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>),
 and the ruin of all <I>that live ungodly</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:6">2 Pet. ii. 6</A>),
 especially that despise the gospel, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:15">Matt. x. 15</A>.
 It is in allusion to this 
 destruction that the place of the damned is 
 often represented by a lake that burns, as 
 Sodom did, with fire and brimstone. Let us 
 learn from it, 
 
 (1.) The evil of sin, and the 
 hurtful nature of it. Iniquity tends to ruin. 
 
 (2.) The terrors of the Lord. See what a 
 fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the 
 living God!</P>

 <A NAME="Ge19_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 But his wife looked back from 
 behind him, and she became a pillar of 
 salt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This also is written for our admonition. 
 Our Saviour refers to it 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:32">Luke xvii. 32</A>),
 <I>Remember Lot's wife.</I> As by the example of 
 Sodom the wicked are warned to turn from 
 their wickedness, so by the example of Lot's 
 wife the righteous are warned not to turn 
 from their righteousness. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:18,20">Ezek. iii. 18, 20</A>.
 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin of Lot's wife: <I>She looked back 
 from behind him.</I> This seemed a small thing, 
 but we are sure, by the punishment of it, 
 that it was a great sin, and exceedingly sinful. 
 
 1. She disobeyed an express command, and 
 so sinned after the similitude of Adam's 
 transgression, which ruined us all. 
 
 2. Unbelief 
 was at the bottom of it; she questioned 
 whether Sodom would be destroyed, and 
 thought she might still have been safe in it. 
 
 3. She looked back upon her neighbours 
 whom she had left behind with more concern 
 than was fit, now that their day of grace was 
 over, and divine justice was glorifying itself 
 in their ruin. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24">Isa. lxvi. 24</A>.

 4. Probably 
 she hankered after her house and goods 
 in Sodom, and was loth to leave them. 
 Christ intimates this to be her sin 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:31,32">Luke xvii. 31, 32</A>);
 she too much regarded her 
 <I>stuff.</I> 
 
 5. Her looking back evinced an inclination 
 to go back; and therefore our Saviour 
 uses it as a warning against apostasy from 
 our Christian profession. We have all renounced 
 the world and the flesh, and have 
 set our faces heaven-ward; we are in the 
 plain, upon our probation; and it is at our 
 peril if we return into the interests we profess 
 to have abandoned. Drawing back is to 
 perdition, and looking back is towards it. 
 <I>Let us therefore fear,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The punishment of Lot's wife for this 
 sin. She was struck dead in the place; yet 
 her body did not fall down, but stood fixed 
 and erect like a pillar, or monument, not liable 
 to waste nor decay, as human bodies exposed 
 to the air are, but metamorphosed into a 
 metallic substance which would last perpetually. 
 Come, behold the goodness and 
 severity of God 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22">Rom. xi. 22</A>),
 towards Lot, 
 who went forward, goodness; towards his 
 wife, who looked back, severity. Though 
 she was nearly related to a righteous man,
 though better than her neighbours, and 
 though a monument of distinguishing mercy 
 in her deliverance out of Sodom, yet God 
 did not connive at her disobedience; for 
 great privileges will not secure us from the 
 wrath of God if we do not carefully and 
 faithfully improve them. This pillar of salt 
 should season us. Since it is such a dangerous 
 thing to look back, let us always press 
 forward, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13,14">Phil. iii. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 28 And he

 and toward all the land of the plain, 
 and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the 
 country went up as the smoke of a 
 furnace.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass, 
 when God destroyed the cities of the
 plain, that God remembered Abraham, 
 and sent Lot out of the midst of the 
 overthrow, when he overthrew the 
 cities in the which Lot dwelt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our communion with God consists in our 
 gracious regard to him and his gracious 
 regard to us; we have here therefore the 
 communion that was between God and Abraham, 
 in the event concerning Sodom, as 
 before in the consultation concerning it, for 
 communion with God is to be kept up in 
 providences as well as in ordinances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Abraham's pious regard to God 
 in this event, in two things:--
 
 1. A careful 
 expectation of the event,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 <I>He got up 
 early</I> to look towards Sodom; and, to intimate 
 that his design herein was to see what 
 became of his prayers, he went to the very 
 place where he had stood before the Lord, 
 and set himself there, as upon his watch 
 tower, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>.
 Note, When we have 
 prayed we must look after our prayers, and 
 observe the success of them. We must 
 direct our prayer as a letter, and then look 
 up for an answer, direct our prayer as an 
 arrow, and then look up to see whether it 
 reach the mark, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:3">Ps. v. 3</A>.
 Our enquiries 
 after news must be in expectation of an 
 answer to our prayers. 
 
 2. An awful observation 
 of it: <I>He looked towards Sodom</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 not as Lot's wife did, tacitly reflecting 
 upon the divine severity, but humbly adoring 
 it and acquiescing in it. Thus the saints, 
 when they see the smoke of Babylon's torment 
 rising up for ever (like Sodom's here), 
 will say again and again, <I>Alleluia,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:3">Rev. xix. 3</A>.
 Those that have, in the day of grace, 
 most earnestly interceded for sinners, will, in 
 the day of judgment, be content to see them 
 perish, and will glorify God in their destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is God's favourable regard to 
 Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 As before, when Abraham 
 prayed for Ishmael, God heard him for 
 Isaac, so now, when he prayed for Sodom, 
 he heard him for Lot. <I>He remembered Abraham, 
 and,</I> for his sake, <I>sent Lot out of the 
 overthrow.</I> Note, 
 
 1. God will certainly give 
 an answer of peace to the prayer of faith, in 
 his own way and time; though, for a while, 
 it seem to be forgotten, yet, sooner or later, 
 it will appear to be remembered. 
 
 2. The 
 relations and friends of godly people fare the 
 better for their interest in God and intercessions 
 with him; it was out of respect to 
 Abraham that Lot was rescued: perhaps this 
 word encouraged Moses long afterwards to pray 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:13">Exod. xxxii. 13</A>),
 <I>Lord, remember Abraham;</I> 
 and see

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, 
 and dwelt in the mountain, and his 
 two daughters with him; for he feared 
 to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a 
 cave, he and his two daughters.
 &nbsp; 31 And 
 the firstborn said unto the younger, 
 Our father <I>is</I> old, and <I>there is</I> not a 
 man in the earth to come in unto us
 after the manner of all the earth:
 &nbsp; 32 Come, let us make our father drink 
 wine, and we will lie with him, that 
 we may preserve seed of our father.
 &nbsp; 33 And they made their father drink 
 wine that night: and the firstborn 
 went in, and lay with her father; and 
 he perceived not when she lay down, 
 nor when she arose.
 &nbsp; 34 And it came 
 to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn 
 said unto the younger, Behold, 
 I lay yesternight with my father: let
 us make him drink wine this night 
 also; and go thou in, <I>and</I> lie with him, 
 that we may preserve seed of our father.
 &nbsp; 35 And they made their father drink 
 wine that night also: and the younger 
 arose, and lay with him; and he perceived 
 not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
 &nbsp; 36 Thus were both 
 the daughters of Lot with child by 
 their father.
 &nbsp; 37 And the firstborn 
 bare a son, and called his name Moab: 
 the same <I>is</I> the father of the Moabites 
 unto this day.
 &nbsp; 38 And the younger, 
 she also bare a son, and called his name
 Ben-ammi: the same <I>is</I> the father of 
 the children of Ammon unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The great trouble and distress that 
 Lot was brought into after his deliverance,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 1. He was frightened out of Zoar, durst not 
 dwell there; probably because he was conscious 
 to himself that it was a refuge of his 
 own choosing and that herein he had foolishly 
 prescribed to God, and therefore he could 
 not but distrust his safety in it; or because 
 he found it as wicked as Sodom, and therefore 
 concluded it could not long survive it; 
 or perhaps he observed the rise and increase 
 of those waters which after the conflagration, 
 perhaps from Jordan, began to overflow the 
 plain, and which, mixing with the ruins, by 
 degrees made the Dead Sea; in those waters 
 he concluded Zoar must needs perish (though 
 it had escaped the fire) because it stood upon
 the same flat. Note, Settlements and shelters 
 of our own choosing, and in which we do 
 not follow God, commonly prove uneasy to 
 us. 
 
 2. He was forced to betake himself to 
 the mountain, and to take up with a cave for 
 his habitation there. Methinks it was strange 
 that he did not return to Abraham, and put 
 himself under his protection, to whom he 
 had once and again owed his safety: but the 
 truth is there are some good men that are 
 not wise enough to know what is best for 
 themselves. Observe, 
 
 (1.) He was now glad 
 to go to the mountain, the place which God 
 had appointed for his shelter. Note, It is 
 well if disappointment in our way drive us 
 at last to God's way. 
 
 (2.) He that, awhile 
 ago, could not find room enough for himself 
 and his stock in the whole land, but
 must jostle with Abraham, and get as far 
 from him as he could, is now confined to a 
 hole in a hill, where he has scarcely room to 
 turn himself, and there he is solitary and 
 trembling. Note, It is just with God to 
 reduce those to poverty and restraint who
 have abused their liberty and plenty. See 
 also in Lot what those bring themselves to, 
 at last, that forsake the communion of saints 
 for secular advantages; they will be beaten 
 with their own rod.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great sin that Lot and his 
 daughters were guilty of, when they were in 
 this desolate place. It is a sad story.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His daughters laid a very wicked plot 
 to bring him to sin; and theirs was, doubtless, 
 the greater guilt. They contrived, 
 under pretence of cheering up the spirits of 
 
 <A NAME="Page127"> </A>

 their father in his present condition, to make 
 him drunk, and then to lie with him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.
 
 (1.) Some think that their pretence was 
 plausible. Their father had no sons, they 
 had no husbands, nor knew they where to
 have any of the holy seed, or, if they had
 children by others, their father's name would 
 not be preserved in them. Some think that 
 they had the Messiah in their eye, who, they 
 hoped, might descend form their father; for 
 he came from Terah's elder son, who separated 
 from the rest of Shem's posterity as 
 well as Abraham, and was now signally delivered 
 out of Sodom. Their mother, and 
 the rest of the family, were gone; they might 
 not marry with the cursed Canaanites; and 
 therefore they supposed that the end they 
 aimed at and the extremity they were brought 
 to, would excuse the irregularity. Thus the 
 learned Monsieur Allix. Note, Good intentions 
 are often abused to patronise bad 
 actions. But, 
 
 (2.) Whatever their pretence 
 was, it is certain that their project was very 
 wicked and vile, and an impudent affront to 
 the very light and law of nature. Note, 
 
 [1.] The sight of God's most tremendous judgments 
 upon sinners will not of itself, without 
 the grace of God, restrain evil hearts from 
 evil practices: one would wonder how the 
 fire of lust could possibly kindle upon those, 
 who had so lately been the eye-witnesses of 
 Sodom's flames.
 
 [2.] Solitude has its temptations 
 as well as company, and particularly 
 to uncleanness. When Joseph was alone 
 with his mistress he was in danger,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:11"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 11</A>.
 Relations that dwell together, 
 especially if solitary, have need carefully to 
 watch even against the least evil thought of 
 this kind, lest Satan get an advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Lot himself, by his own folly and unwariness, 
 was wretchedly overcome, and suffered 
 himself so far to be imposed upon by 
 his own children as, two nights together, to 
 be drunk, and to commit incest,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>,
 &c. 
 <I>Lord, what is man!</I> What are the best of 
 men, when God leaves them to themselves! 
 See here, 
 
 (1.) The peril of security. Lot, 
 who not only kept himself sober and chaste 
 in Sodom, but was a constant mourner for 
 the wickedness of the place and a witness 
 against it, was yet, in the mountain, where 
 he was alone, and as he thought quite out of 
 the way of temptation, shamefully overtaken. 
 Let him therefore that thinks he stands, 
 stands high and stands firm, <I>take heed lest he 
 fall.</I> No mountain, on this side the holy 
 hill above, can set us out of the reach of 
 Satan's fiery darts. 
 
 (2.) The peril of drunkenness. 
 It is not only a great sin itself, but 
 it is the inlet of many sins; it may prove the 
 inlet of the worst and most unnatural sins, 
 which may be a perpetual wound and dishonour. 
 Excellently does Mr. Herbert describe 
 it,</P>

 A man may do that without reluctance, when 
 he is drunk, which, when he is sober, he 
 could not think of without horror. 
 
 (3.) The 
 peril of temptation from our dearest relations 
 and friends, whom we love, and esteem, and 
 expect kindness from. Lot, whose temperance 
 and chastity were impregnable against 
 the batteries of foreign force, was surprised 
 into sin and shame by the base treachery of 
 his own daughters: we must dread a snare 
 wherever we are, and be always upon our 
 guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In the close we have an account of the 
 birth of the two sons, or grandsons (call 
 them which you will), of Lot, Moab and 
 Ammon, the fathers of two nations, neighbours 
 to Israel, and which we often read of 
 in the Old Testament; both together are 
 called <I>the children of Lot,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:8">Ps. lxxxiii. 8</A>.
 Note, Though prosperous births may attend 
 incestuous conceptions, yet they are so far 
 from justifying them that they rather perpetuate 
 the reproach of them and entail infamy 
 upon posterity; yet the tribe of Judah, of 
 which our Lord sprang, descended from such 
 a birth, and Ruth, a Moabitess, has a name 
 in his genealogy, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:3,5">Matt. i. 3, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Observe that, after this, we never 
 read any more of Lot, nor what became of 
 him: no doubt he repented of his sin, and 
 was pardoned; but from the silence of the 
 scripture concerning him henceforward we 
 may learn that drunkenness, as it makes 
 men forgetful, so it makes them forgotten; 
 and many a name, which otherwise might 
 have been remembered with respect, is buried 
 by it in contempt and oblivion.</P>
