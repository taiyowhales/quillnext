 The ceremonial law is described by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9,10">Heb. ix. 9, 10</A>)

 to consist, not only "in gifts and sacrifices," which hitherto have
 been treated of in this book, but "in meats, and drinks, and divers 
 washings" from ceremonial uncleanness, the laws concerning which begin 
 with this chapter, which puts a difference between some sorts of 
 flesh-meat and others, allowing some to be eaten as clean and 
 forbidding others as unclean. "There is one kind of flesh of men." 
 Nature startles at the thought of eating this, and none do it but such 
 as have arrived at the highest degree of barbarity, and become but one 
 remove from brutes; therefore there needed no law against it. But there 
 is "another kind of flesh of beasts," concerning which the law directs 
 here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>),

 "another of fishes"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>),

 "another of birds" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:13-19">ver. 13-19</A>),
 
 and "another of creeping things," which are distinguished into two
 sorts, flying creeping things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:20-28">ver. 20-28</A>) 

 and creeping things upon the earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:29-43">ver. 29-43</A>.

 And the law concludes with the general rule of holiness, and reasons
 for it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <I>are</I> the
 beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <I>are</I> on the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <I>and</I>
 cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
 &nbsp; 4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the
 cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <I>as</I> the camel, because he
 cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <I>is</I> unclean unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
 the hoof; he <I>is</I> unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
 the hoof; he <I>is</I> unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be
 clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <I>is</I> unclean to you.
 &nbsp; 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
 not touch; they <I>are</I> unclean to you.

 Now that Aaron was consecrated a high priest over the house of God, God 
 spoke to him with Moses, and appointed them both as joint-commissioners 
 to deliver his will to the people. He spoke both to Moses and to Aaron 
 about this matter; for it was particularly required of the priests that 
 they should put a difference between clean and unclean, and teach the 
 people to do so. After the flood, when God entered into covenant with 
 Noah and his sons, he allowed them to eat flesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:13">Gen. ix. 13</A>),

 whereas before they were confined to the productions of the earth. But
 the liberty allowed to the sons of Noah is here limited to the sons of 
 Israel. They might eat flesh, but not all kinds of flesh; some they 
 must look upon as unclean and forbidden to them, others as clean and 
 allowed them. The law in this matter is both very particular and very 
 strict. But what reason can be given for this law? Why may not God's 
 people have as free a use of all the creatures as other people?

 1. It is reason enough that God would have it so: his will, as it is
 law sufficient, so it is reason sufficient; for his will is his wisdom. 
 He saw good thus to try and exercise the obedience of his people, not 
 only in the solemnities of his altar, but in matters of daily 
 occurrence at their own table, that they might remember they were under 
 authority.  Thus God had tried the obedience of man in innocency, by 
 forbidding him to eat of one particular tree. 

 2. Most of the meats forbidden as unclean are such as were really 
 unwholesome, and not fit to be eaten; and those of them that we think 
 wholesome enough, and use accordingly, as the rabbit, the hare, and the 
 swine, perhaps in those countries, and to their bodies, might be 
 hurtful. And then God in this law did by them but as a wise and loving 
 father does by his children, whom he restrains from eating that which 
 he knows will make them sick.  Note, The Lord is for the body, and it 
 is not only folly, but sin against God, to prejudice our health for the 
 pleasing of our appetite.  

 3. God would thus teach his people to distinguish themselves from other 
 people, not only in their religious worship, but in the common actions 
 of life.  Thus he would show them that they must not be numbered among 
 the nations. It should seem there had been, before this, some 
 difference between the Hebrews and other nations in their food, kept up 
 by tradition; for the Egyptians and they would not eat together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32">Gen. xliii. 32</A>.

 And even before the flood there was a distinction of beasts into clean
 and not clean 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:2">Gen. vii. 2</A>),

 which distinction was quite lost, with many other instances of
 religion, among the Gentiles. But by this law it is reduced to a 
 certainty, and ordered to be kept up among the Jews, that thus, by 
 having a diet peculiar to themselves, they might be kept from familiar 
 conversation with their idolatrous neighbours, and might typify God's 
 spiritual Israel, who not in these little things, but in the temper of 
 their spirits, and the course of their lives, should be governed by a 
 sober singularity, and not be conformed to this world.  The learned 
 observe further, That most of the creatures which by this law were to 
 be abominated as unclean were such as were had in high veneration among 
 the heathen, not so much for food as for divination and sacrifice to 
 their gods; and therefore those are here mentioned as unclean, and an 
 abomination, which yet they would not be in any temptation to eat, that 
 they might keep up a religious loathing of that for which the Gentiles 
 had a superstitious value. The swine, with the later Gentiles, was 
 sacred to Venus, the owl to Minerva, the eagle to Jupiter, the dog to 
 Hecate, &c., and all these are here made unclean.  As to the beasts, 
 there is a general rule laid down, that those which both part the hoof 
 and chew the cud were clean, and those only: these are particularly 
 mentioned in the repetition of this law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:4,5">Deut. xiv. 4, 5</A>),

 where it appears that the Israelites had variety enough allowed them,
 and needed not to complain of the confinement they were under.  Those 
 beasts that did not both <I>chew the cud and divide the hoof</I> were 
 unclean, by which rule the flesh of swine, and of hares, and of 
 rabbits, was prohibited to them, though commonly used among us.  
 Therefore, particularly at the eating of any of these, we should give 
 thanks for the liberty granted us in this matter by the gospel, which 
 teaches us that <I>every creature of God is good,</I> and we are to 
 <I>call nothing common or unclean.</I> Some observe a significancy in 
 the rule here laid down for them to distinguish by, or at least think 
 it may be alluded to. Meditation, and other acts of devotion done by 
 the hidden man of the heart, may be signified by the chewing of the 
 cud, digesting our spiritual food; justice and charity towards men, and 
 the acts of a good conversation, may be signified by the <I>dividing of 
 the hoof.</I> Now either of these without the other will not serve to 
 recommend us to God, but both must go together, good affections in the 
 heart and good works in the life: if either be wanting, we are not 
 clean, surely we are not clean.  Of all the creatures here forbidden as 
 unclean, none has been more dreaded and detested by the pious Jews than 
 swine's flesh.  Many were put to death by Antiochus because they would 
 not eat it.  This, probably, they were most in danger of being tempted 
 to, and therefore possessed themselves and their children with a 
 particular antipathy to it, calling it not by its proper name, but <I>a 
 strange thing.</I> It should seem the Gentiles used it superstitiously

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:4">Isa. lxv. 4</A>),

 <I>they eat swine's flesh;</I> and therefore God forbids all use of it 
 to his people, lest they should learn of their neighbours to make that 
 ill use of it. Some suggest that the prohibition of these beasts as 
 unclean was intended to be a caution to the people against the bad 
 qualities of these creatures. We must not be filthy nor wallow in the 
 mire as swine, nor be timorous and faint-hearted as hares, nor dwell in 
 the earth as rabbits; let not man that is in honour make himself like 
 these beasts that perish. The law forbade, not only the eating of them, 
 but the very touching of them; for those that would be kept from any 
 sin must be careful to avoid all temptations to it, and every thing 
 that looks towards it or leads to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A general rule concerning fishes, which were clean and which not.
 All that had fins and scales they might eat, and only those odd sorts 
 of water-animals that have not were forbidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 The ancients accounted fish the most delicate food (so far were they 
 from allowing it on fasting-days, or making it an instance of 
 mortification to eat fish); therefore God did not lay much restraint 
 upon his people in them; for he is a Master that allows his servants 
 not only for necessity but for delight. Concerning the prohibited fish 
 it is said, <I>They shall be an abomination to you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>),

 that is, "You shall count them unclean, and not only not eat of them, 
 but keep at a distance from them." Note, Whatever is unclean should be 
 to us an abomination; <I>touch not the unclean thing.</I> But observe, 
 It was to be an abomination only to Jews; the neighbouring nations were 
 under none of these obligations, nor are these things to be an 
 abomination to us Christians. The Jews were honoured with peculiar 
 privileges, and therefore, lest they should be proud of those, 
 <I>Transeunt cum onere--They were likewise laid under peculiar 
 restraints.</I> Thus God's spiritual Israel, as they are dignified 
 above others by the gospel-covenant of adoption and friendship, so they 
 must be mortified more than others by the gospel-commands of 
 self-denial and bearing the cross. 

 2. Concerning fowls here is no general rule given, but a particular 
 enumeration of those fowls that they must abstain from as unclean, 
 which implies an allowance of all others. The critics here have their 
 hands full to find out what is the true signification of the Hebrew 
 words here used, some of which still remain uncertain, some sorts of 
 fowls being peculiar to some countries.  Were the law in force now, we 
 should be concerned to know with certainty what are prohibited by it; 
 and perhaps if we did, and were better acquainted with the nature of 
 the fowls here mentioned, we should admire the knowledge of Adam, in 
 giving them names expressive of their natures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:20">Gen. ii. 20</A>.

 But the law being repealed, and the learning in a great measure lost,
 it is sufficient for us to observe that of the fowls here forbidden,

 (1.) Some are birds of prey, as the eagle, vulture, &c., and God would
 have his people to abhor every thing that is barbarous and cruel, and 
 not to live by blood and rapine. Doves that are preyed upon were fit to 
 be food for man and offerings to God; but kites and hawks that prey 
 upon them must be looked upon as an abomination to God and man; for the 
 condition of those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake appears 
 to an eye of faith every way better than that of their persecutors.  
 (2.) Others of them are solitary birds, that abide in dark and desolate 
 places, as the owl and the pelican 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:6">Ps. cii. 6</A>),

 and the cormorant and raven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11">Isa. xxxiv. 11</A>);

 for God's Israel should not be a melancholy people, nor affect sadness
 and constant solitude.

 (3.) Others of them feed upon that which is impure, as the stork on 
 serpents, others of them on worms; and we must not only abstain from 
 all impurity ourselves, but from communion with those that allow 
 themselves in it. 

 (4.) Others of them were used by the Egyptians and other Gentiles in
 their divinations. Some birds were reckoned fortunate, others ominous; 
 and their soothsayers had great regard to the flights of these birds, 
 all which therefore must be an abomination to God's people, who must 
 not learn the way of the heathen.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 All fowls that creep, going upon <I>all</I> four, <I>shall be</I> an
 abomination unto you.
 &nbsp; 21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that
 goeth upon <I>all</I> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
 withal upon the earth;
 &nbsp; 22 <I>Even</I> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind,
 and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his
 kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
 &nbsp; 23 But all <I>other</I> flying creeping things, which have four
 feet, <I>shall be</I> an abomination unto you.
 &nbsp; 24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
 carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 25 And whosoever beareth <I>ought</I> of the carcase of them shall
 wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 26 <I>The carcases</I> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and
 <I>is</I> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <I>are</I> unclean unto
 you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
 &nbsp; 27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of
 beasts that go on <I>all</I> four, those <I>are</I> unclean unto you: whoso
 toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
 clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <I>are</I> unclean unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 29 These also <I>shall be</I> unclean unto you among the creeping
 things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and
 the tortoise after his kind,
 &nbsp; 30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
 snail, and the mole.
 &nbsp; 31 These <I>are</I> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever
 doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
 even.
 &nbsp; 32 And upon whatsoever <I>any</I> of them, when they are dead, doth
 fall, it shall be unclean; whether <I>it be</I> any vessel of wood, or
 raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <I>it be,</I> wherein
 <I>any</I> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
 unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
 &nbsp; 33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto <I>any</I> of them falleth,
 whatsoever <I>is</I> in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
 &nbsp; 34 Of all meat which may be eaten, <I>that</I> on which <I>such</I> water
 cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every
 <I>such</I> vessel shall be unclean.
 &nbsp; 35 And every <I>thing</I> whereupon <I>any part</I> of their carcase
 falleth shall be unclean; <I>whether it be</I> oven, or ranges for
 pots, they shall be broken down: <I>for</I> they <I>are</I> unclean, and
 shall be unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <I>wherein there is</I> plenty of
 water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
 shall be unclean.
 &nbsp; 37 And if <I>any part</I> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
 which is to be sown, it <I>shall be</I> clean.
 &nbsp; 38 But if <I>any</I> water be put upon the seed, and <I>any part</I> of
 their carcase fall thereon, it <I>shall be</I> unclean unto you.
 &nbsp; 39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
 the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

 be</I> an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
 &nbsp; 42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon

 Here is the law, 

 1. Concerning flying insects, as flies, wasps, bees, &c.; these they
 might not eat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 nor indeed are they fit to be eaten; but there were several sorts of
 locusts which in those countries were very good meat, and much used: 
 John Baptist lived upon them in the desert, and they are here allowed 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 2. Concerning the creeping things on the earth; these were all 
 forbidden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>,
 
 and again,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>);

 for it was the curse of the serpent that <I>upon his belly he should 
 go,</I> and therefore between him and man there was an enmity put 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>),

 which was preserved by this law. Dust is the meat of the creeping
 things, and therefore they are not fit to be man's meat.

 3.  Concerning the dead carcasses of all these unclean animals.

 (1.) Every one that touched them was to be unclean until the evening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:24-28"><I>v.</I> 24-28</A>.
 
 This law is often repeated, to possess them with a dread of every thing 
 that was prohibited, though no particular reason for the prohibition 
 did appear, but only the will of the Law-maker. Not that they were to 
 be looked upon as defiling to the conscience, or that it was a sin 
 against God to touch them, unless done in contempt of the law: in many 
 cases, somebody must of necessity touch them, to remove them; but it 
 was a <I>ceremonial</I> uncleanness they contracted, which for the time 
 forbade them to come into the tabernacle, or to eat of any of the holy 
 things, or so much as to converse familiarly with their neighbours. But 
 the uncleanness continued only till the evening, to signify that all 
 ceremonial pollutions were to come to an end by the death of Christ in 
 the evening of the world. And we must learn, by daily renewing our 
 repentance every night for the sins of the day, to cleanse ourselves 
 from the pollution we contract by them, that we may not lie down in our 
 uncleanness. Even unclean animals they might touch while they were 
 alive without contracting any ceremonial uncleanness by it, as horses 
 and dogs, because they were allowed to use them for service; but they 
 might not touch them when they were dead, because they might not eat 
 their flesh; and what must not be eaten must not be touched, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:3">Gen. iii. 3</A>.

 (2.) Even the vessels, or other things they fell upon, were thereby
 made unclean until the evening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and if they were earthen vessels they must be broken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 This taught them carefully to avoid every thing that was polluting, 
 even in their common actions. Not only the vessels of the sanctuary, 
 but every pot in Jerusalem and Judah, must be <I>holiness to the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:20,21">Zech. xiv. 20, 21</A>.

 The laws in these cases are very critical, and the observance of them
 would be difficult, we should think, if every thing that a dead mouse 
 or rat, for instance, falls upon must be unclean; and if it were an 
 oven, or ranges for pots, they must all be broken down,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The exceptions also are very nice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>,

 &c. All this was designed to exercise them to a constant care and
 exactness in their obedience, and to teach us, who by Christ are 
 delivered from these burdensome observances, not to be less circumspect 
 in the more weighty matters of the law. We ought as industriously to 
 preserve our precious souls from the pollutions of sin, and as speedily 
 to cleanse them when they are polluted, as they were to preserve and 
 cleanse their bodies and household goods from those ceremonial 
 pollutions.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
 thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
 with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
 &nbsp; 44 For I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
 yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <I>am</I> holy: neither shall
 ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
 creepeth upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 45 For I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that bringeth you up out of the land of
 Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <I>am</I>
 holy.
 &nbsp; 46 This <I>is</I> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of
 every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
 creature that creepeth upon the earth:
 &nbsp; 47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
 between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be
 eaten.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. The exposition of this law, or a key to let us into the meaning of
 it. It was not intended merely for a bill of fare, or as the directions 
 of a physician about their diet, but God would hereby teach them to 
 sanctify themselves and to be holy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.
 
 That is, 

 1. They must hereby learn to put a difference between good and evil, 
 and to reckon that it could not be all alike what they did, when it was 
 not all alike what they ate. 2. To maintain a constant observance of 
 the divine law, and to govern themselves by that in all their actions, 
 even those that are common, which ought to be performed <I>after a 
 godly sort,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:6">3 John 6</A>.

 Even eating and drinking must be by rule, and <I>to
 the glory of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>.

 3. To distinguish themselves from all their neighbours, as a people set
 apart for God, and obliged not to walk as the Gentiles: and all this is 
 holiness. Thus these <I>rudiments of the world</I> were their tutors 
 and governors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:2,3">Gal. iv. 2, 3</A>),

 to bring them to that which is the revival of our first state in Adam
 and the earnest of our best state with Christ, that is, 
 <I>holiness,</I> without which no man shall see the Lord. This is 
 indeed the great design of all the ordinances, that by them we may 
 sanctify ourselves and learn to be holy.  Even This law concerning 
 their food, which seemed to stoop so very low, aimed thus high, for it 
 was the statute-law of heaven, under the Old Testament as well as the 
 New, that <I>without holiness no man shall see the Lord.</I> The 
 caution therefore

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>)

 is, <I>You shall not make yourselves abominable.</I> Note, By having 
 fellowship with sin, which is abominable, we make ourselves abominable. 
 That man is truly miserable who is in the sight of God abominable; and 
 none are so but those that make themselves so.  The Jewish writers 
 themselves suggest that the intention of this law was to forbid them 
 all communion by marriage, or otherwise, with the heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2,3">Deut. vii. 2, 3</A>.

 And thus the moral of it is obligatory on us, forbidding us to <I>have
 fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness;</I> and, without this 
 real holiness of the heart and life, <I>he that offereth an 
 oblation</I> is <I>as if he offered swine's blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:3">Isa. lxvi. 3</A>);

 and, if it was such a provocation for a man to eat swine's flesh
 himself, much more it must be so to offer swine's blood at God's altar; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons of this law; and they are all taken from the Law-maker 
 himself, to whom we must have respect in all acts of obedience. 

 1. <I>I am the Lord your God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 "Therefore you are bound to do thus, in pure obedience." God's 
 sovereignty over us, and propriety in us, oblige us to do whatever he 
 commands us, how much soever it crosses our inclinations. 2. <I>I am 
 holy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>,

 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 If God be holy, we must be so, else we cannot expect to be accepted of
 him. His holiness is his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>),

 and therefore it <I>becomes his house for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:5">Ps. xciii. 5</A>.

 This great precept, thus enforced, though it comes in here in the midst
 of abrogated laws, is quoted and stamped for a gospel precept, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:16">1 Pet. i. 16</A>,

 where it is intimated that all these ceremonial restraints were
 designed to teach us that we must not <I>fashion ourselves according to 
 our former lusts in our ignorance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 3.  <I>I am the Lord that bringeth you out of the land of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 This was a reason why they should cheerfully submit to distinguishing 
 laws, having of late been so wonderfully dignified with distinguishing 
 favours. He that had done more for them than for any other people might 
 justly expect more from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conclusion of this statute: <I>This is the law of the beasts, 
 and of the fowl,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>.

 This law was to them a statute for ever, that is, as long as that 
 economy lasted; but under the gospel we find it expressly repealed by a 
 voice from heaven to Peter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:15">Acts x. 15</A>),

 as it had before been virtually set aside by the death of Christ, with
 the other ordinances that <I>perished in the using: Touch not, taste 
 not, handle not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:21,22">Col. ii. 21, 22</A>.

 And now we are sure that <I>meat commends us not to God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:8">1 Cor. viii. 8</A>),

 and that <I>nothing is unclean of itself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:14">Rom. xiv. 14</A>),

 nor does that defile a man which goes into his mouth, but that which
 comes out from the heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:11">Matt. xv. 11</A>.

 Let us therefore,

 1. Give thanks to God that we are not under this yoke, but that to us 
 every creature of God is allowed as good, and nothing to be refused. 2. 
 <I>Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free,</I> and 
 take heed of those doctrines which <I>command to abstain from 
 meats,</I> and so would revive Moses again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:3,4">1 Tim. iv. 3, 4</A>.

 3. Be strictly and conscientiously temperate in the use of the good
 creatures God has allowed us. If God's law has given us liberty, let us 
 lay restraints upon ourselves, and never feed ourselves without fear, 
 lest our table be a snare. <I>Set a knife to thy throat, if thou be a 
 man given to appetite;</I> and <I>be not desirous of dainties</I> or 
 varieties, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:2,3">Prov. xxiii. 2, 3</A>.

 Nature is content with little, grace with less, but lust with
 nothing.</P>
