 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is a prophecy; the likest to it we have yet met with 
 was that of Noah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25-27"><I>ch.</I> ix. 25</A>,
 &c. Jacob is here upon his death-bed, 
 making his will. He put it off till now, because dying men's 
 words are apt to make deep impressions, and to be remembered 
 long: what he said here, he could not say when he would, but as 
 the Spirit gave him utterance, who chose this time, that divine 
 strength might be perfected in his weakness. The twelve sons 
 of Jacob were, in their day, men of renown, but the twelve tribes 
 of Israel, which descended and were denominated from them, 
 were much more renowned; we find their names upon the gates 
 of the New Jerusalem,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:12">Rev. xxi. 12</A>.
 In the prospect of this their 
 dying father says something remarkable of each son, or of the 
 tribe that bore his name. Here is, 
 
 I. The preface,

 II. The prediction concerning each tribe,

 repeated concerning his burial,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Jacob called unto his sons, 
 and said, Gather yourselves 

 <A NAME="Page259"> </A>

 together, that I may tell you <I>that</I> which 
 shall befal you in the last days.
 &nbsp; 2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, 
 ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto 
 Israel your father.
 &nbsp; 3 Reuben, thou 
 <I>art</I> my firstborn, my might, and the 
 beginning of my strength, the excellency 
 of dignity, and the excellency of 
 power:
 &nbsp; 4 Unstable as water, thou 
 shalt not excel; because thou wentest
 up to thy father's bed; then defiledst 
 thou <I>it:</I> he went up to my couch.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The preface to the prophecy, in 
 which, 
 
 1. The congregation is called together
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 <I>Gather yourselves together;</I> let them 
 all be sent for from their several employments, 
 to see their father die, and to hear his 
 dying words. It was a comfort to Jacob, 
 now that he was dying, to see all his children 
 about him, and none missing, though he had 
 sometimes thought himself bereaved. It was 
 of use to them to attend him in his last moments, 
 that they might learn of him how to 
 die, as well as how to live: what he said to 
 each he said in the hearing of all the rest; 
 for we may profit by the reproofs, counsels, 
 and comforts, that are principally intended 
 for others. His calling upon them once and 
 again to gather together intimated both a 
 precept to them to unite in love, (to keep together, 
 not to mingle with the Egyptians, not 
 to forsake the assembling of themselves together,) 
 and a prediction that they should not 
 be separated from each other, as Abraham's 
 sons and Isaac's were, but should be incorporated, 
 and all make one people. 
 
 2. A general 
 idea is given of the intended discourse
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 <I>That I may tell you that which shall 
 befal you</I> (not your persons, but your posterity) 
 <I>in the latter days;</I> this prediction would 
 be of use to those that came after them, for 
 the confirming of their faith and the guiding 
 of their way, on their return to Canaan, and 
 their settlement there. We cannot tell our 
 children what shall befal them or their families
 in this world; but we can tell them, from 
 the word of God, what will befal them in the 
 last day of all, according as they conduct 
 themselves in this world. 
 
 3. Attention is 
 demanded
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 "<I>Hearken to Israel your 
 father;</I> let Israel, that has prevailed with 
 God, prevail with you." Note, Children 
 must diligently hearken to what their godly 
 parents say, particularly when they are dying. 
 <I>Hear, you children, the instruction of a father,</I> 
 which carries with it both authority and 
 affection,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:1">Prov. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prophecy concerning Reuben. He 
 begins with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),
 for he was the firstborn; 
 but by committing uncleanness with 
 his father's wife, to the great reproach of the 
 family to which he ought to have been an 
 ornament, he forfeited the prerogatives of the 
 birthright; and his dying father here solemnly 
 degrades him, though he does not 
 disown nor disinherit him: he shall have all 
 the privileges of a son, but not of a firstborn. 
 We have reason to think Reuben had repented 
 of his sin, and it was pardoned; yet 
 it was a necessary piece of justice, in detestation 
 of the villany, and for warning to others,
 to put this mark of disgrace upon him. Now 
 according to the method of degrading, 
 
 1. Jacob here puts upon him the ornaments of 
 the birthright
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 that he and all his brethren 
 might see what he had forfeited, and, in 
 that, might see the evil of the sin: as the 
 firstborn, he was his father's joy, almost his 
 pride, being <I>the beginning of his strength.</I> 
 How welcome he was to his parents his name
 bespeaks, <I>Reuben, See a son.</I> To him belonged 
 the excellency of dignity above his 
 brethren, and some power over them. Christ 
 Jesus is the firstborn among many brethren, 
 and to him, of right, belong the most excellent 
 power and dignity: his church also, 
 through him, is a church of firstborn. 
 
 2. He then strips him of these ornaments
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 lifts him up, that he may cast him down, by 
 that one word, "<I>Thou shalt not excel;</I> a 
 being thou shalt have as a tribe, but not an 
 excellency." No judge, prophet, nor prince, 
 is found of that tribe, nor any person of renown 
 except Dathan and Abiram, who were 
 noted for their impious rebellion against 
 Moses. That tribe, as not aiming to excel, 
 meanly chose a settlement on the other side 
 Jordan. Reuben himself seems to have lost 
 all that influence upon his brethren to which 
 his birthright entitled him; for <I>when he spoke 
 unto them they would not hear,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:22"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 22</A>.
 Those that have not understanding and spirit 
 to support the honours and privileges of their 
 birth will soon lose them, and retain only 
 the name of them. The character fastened 
 upon Reuben, for which he is laid under this 
 mark of infamy, is that he was <I>unstable as 
 water.</I> 
 
 (1.) His virtue was unstable; he had 
 not the government of himself and his own 
 appetites: sometimes he would be very regular 
 and orderly, but at other times he deviated 
 into the wildest courses. Note, Instability 
 is the ruin of men's excellency. 
 Men do not thrive because they do not fix. 
 
 (2.) His honour consequently was unstable; 
 it departed from him, vanished into smoke, 
 and became as water spilt upon the ground. 
 Note, Those that throw away their virtue 
 must not expect to save their reputation. 
 Jacob charges him particularly with the sin 
 for which he was thus disgraced: <I>Thou wentest 
 up to thy father's bed.</I> It was forty years 
 ago that he had been guilty of this sin, yet 
 now it is remembered against him. Note, 
 As time will not of itself wear off the guilt of 
 any sin from the conscience, so there are 
 some sins whose stains it will not wipe off 
 from the good name, especially seventh-commandment 
 sins. Reuben's sin left an indelible 
 mark of infamy upon his family, a dishonour 
 that was a wound not to be healed 

 <A NAME="Page260"> </A>
 
 without a scar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:32,33">Prov. vi. 32, 33</A>.
 Let us 
 never do evil, and then we need not fear being 
 told of it.</P>

 &nbsp; 6 O my soul, come not

 down a wall.

 These were next in age to Reuben, and 
 they also had been a grief and shame to 
 Jacob, when they treacherously and barbarously 
 destroyed the Shechemites, which 
 he here remembers against them. Children 
 should be afraid of incurring their parents' 
 just displeasure, lest they fare the worse for 
 it long afterwards, and, when they would 
 inherit the blessing, be rejected. Observe, 
 
 1. The character of Simeon and Levi: they were 
 brethren in disposition; but, unlike their 
 father, they were passionate and revengeful, 
 fierce and uncontrollable; their swords, which 
 should have been only weapons of defence, 
 were (as the margin reads it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 <I>weapons of violence,</I> to do wrong to 
 others, not to save themselves from wrong. Note, It is 
 no new thing for the temper of children to 
 differ very much from that of their parents. 
 We need not think this strange: it was so in 
 Jacob's family. It is not in the power of 
 parents, no, not by education, to form the 
 dispositions of their children; Jacob bred 
 his sons to every thing that was mild and 
 quiet, and yet they proved to be thus furious. 
 
 2. A proof of this is the murder of the Shechemites, 
 which Jacob deeply resented at the 
 time
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:30"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 30</A>)
 and still continued to 
 resent. They slew a man, Shechem himself, 
 and many others; and, to effect that, 
 they digged down a wall, broke the houses, 
 to plunder them, and murder the inhabitants. 
 Note, The best governors cannot always restrain 
 those under their charge from committing 
 the worst villanies. And when two 
 in a family are mischievous they commonly 
 make one another so much the worse, and 
 it were wisdom to part them. Simeon and 
 Levi, it is probable, were most active in the 
 wrong done to Joseph, to which some think 
 Jacob has here some reference; for in their 
 anger they would have slain <I>that man.</I> Observe 
 what a mischievous thing self-will is 
 in young people: Simeon and Levi would 
 not be advised by their aged and experienced 
 father; no, they would be governed by their 
 own passion rather than by his prudence. 
 Young people would better consult their own 
 interests if they would less indulge their 
 own will. 
 
 3. Jacob's protestation against 
 this barbarous act of theirs: <I>O my soul, come 
 not thou into their secret.</I> Hereby he professes 
 not only his abhorrence of such practices 
 in general, but his innocence particularly 
 in that matter. Perhaps he had been 
 suspected as, under-hand, aiding and abetting; 
 he therefore thus solemnly expresses 
 his detestation of the fact, that he might not 
 die under that suspicion. Note, Our soul 
 is our honour; by its powers and faculties 
 we are distinguished from, and dignified 
 above, the beasts that perish. Note, further, 
 We ought, from our hearts, to detest 
 and abhor all society and confederacy with 
 bloody and mischievous men. We must not 
 be ambitious of coming into their secret, or 
 knowing the depths of Satan. 
 
 4. His abhorrence 
 of those brutish lusts that led them 
 to this wickedness: <I>Cursed be their anger.</I> 
 He does not curse their persons, but their 
 lusts. Note, 
 
 (1.) Anger is the cause and original 
 of a great deal of sin, and exposes us 
 to the curse of God, and his judgment,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:22">Matt. v. 22</A>.
 
 (2.) We ought always, in the expressions 
 of our zeal, carefully to distinguish 
 between the sinner and the sin, so as not to 
 love nor bless the sin for the sake of the 
 person, nor to hate nor curse the person 
 for the sake of the sin. 
 
 5. A token of displeasure 
 which he foretels their posterity 
 should lie under for this: <I>I will divide them.</I> 
 The Levites were scattered throughout all the 
 tribes, and Simeon's lot lay not together, 
 and was so strait that many of the tribe were 
 forced to disperse themselves in quest of 
 settlements and subsistence. This curse 
 was afterwards turned into a blessing to the 
 Levites; but the Simeonites, for Zimri's sin
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:14">Num. xxv. 14</A>),
 had it bound on. Note, 
 Shameful dispersions are the just punishment 
 of sinful unions and confederacies.</P>

 Glorious things are here said of Judah. 
 The mention of the crimes of the three elder 

 <A NAME="Page261"> </A>

 of his sons had not so put the dying patriarch 
 out of humour but that he had a blessing 
 ready for Judah, to whom blessings 
 belonged. Judah's name signifies <I>praise,</I> in 
 allusion to which he says, <I>Thou art he whom 
 thy brethren shall praise,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 God was 
 praised for him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:35"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 35</A>),
 praised by 
 him, and praised in him; and therefore his 
 brethren shall praise him. Note, Those that 
 are to God for a praise shall be the praise 
 of their brethren. It is prophesied that, 
 
 1. The tribe of Judah should be victorious and 
 successful in war: <I>Thy hand shall be in the 
 neck of thy enemies.</I> This was fulfilled in 
 David,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:40">Ps. xviii. 40</A>.
 
 2. It should be superior 
 to the rest of the tribes; not only in itself 
 more numerous and illustrious, but having 
 a dominion over them: <I>Thy father's children 
 shall bow down before thee.</I> Judah was the 
 <I>lawgiver,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:7">Ps. lx. 7</A>.
 That tribe led the van 
 through the wilderness, and in the conquest 
 of Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:2">Judg. i. 2</A>.
 The prerogatives 
 of the birthright which Reuben had forfeited, 
 the excellency of dignity and power, 
 were thus conferred upon Judah. Observe, 
 "Thy brethren shall bow down before thee, 
 and yet shall praise thee, reckoning themselves 
 happy in having so wise and bold a 
 commander." Note, Honour and power 
 are then a blessing to those that have them 
 when they are not grudged and envied, but 
 praised and applauded, and cheerfully submitted 
 to. 
 
 3. It should be a strong and 
 courageous tribe, and so qualified for command 
 and conquest: <I>Judah is a lion's whelp,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 The lion is the king of beasts, the 
 terror of the forest when he roars; when he 
 seizes his prey, none can resist him; when he 
 goes up from the prey, none dare pursue him
 to revenge it. By this it is foretold that the 
 tribe of Judah should become very formidable, 
 and should not only obtain great victories, 
 but should peaceably and quietly enjoy 
 what was obtained by those victories--that 
 they should make war, not for the sake of 
 war, but for the sake of peace. Judah is 
 compared, not to a lion <I>rampant,</I> always tearing, 
 always raging, always ranging; but to 
 a lion <I>couchant,</I> enjoying the satisfaction of 
 his power and success, without creating vexation 
 to others: this is to be truly great. 
 
 4. It should be the royal tribe, and the tribe 
 from which Messiah the Prince should come: 
 <I>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, till 
 Shiloh come,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Jacob here foresees and 
 foretels, 
 
 (1.) That the sceptre should come
 into the tribe of Judah, which was fulfilled in 
 David, on whose family the crown was entailed. 
 
 (2.) That Shiloh should be of this tribe--his 
 seed, that promised seed, in whom the 
 earth should be blessed: <I>that peaceable and 
 prosperous one,</I> or <I>the Saviour,</I> so others 
 translate it, he shall come of Judah. Thus 
 dying Jacob, at a great distance, saw Christ's 
 day, and it was his comfort and support on 
 his death-bed. (3.) That after the coming 
 of the sceptre into the tribe of Judah it should 
 continue in that tribe, at least a government 
 of their own, till the coming of the Messiah, 
 in whom, as the king of the church, and the 
 great high priest, it was fit that both the 
 priesthood and the royalty should determine. 
 Till the captivity, all along from David's 
 time, the sceptre was in Judah, and subsequently 
 the governors of Judea were of that 
 tribe, or of the Levites that adhered to it 
 (which was equivalent), till Judea became 
 a province of the Roman empire, just at the 
 time of our Saviour's birth, and was at that 
 time taxed as one of the provinces,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>.
 And at the time of his death the 
 Jews expressly owned, <I>We have no king 
 but C&aelig;sar.</I> Hence it is undeniably inferred 
 against the Jews that our Lord Jesus is 
 he that should come, and that we are to 
 look for no other; for he came exactly at 
 the time appointed. Many excellent pens 
 have been admirable well employed in explaining 
 and illustrating this famous prophecy 
 of Christ. 
 
 5. It should be a very fruitful 
 tribe, especially that it should abound 
 with milk for babes, and wine to make glad 
 the heart of strong men
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>)--vines
 so common in the hedge-rows and so strong 
 that they should tie their asses to them, and 
 so fruitful that they should load their asses 
 from them--wine as plentiful as water, so 
 that the men of that tribe should be very 
 healthful and lively, their eyes brisk and 
 sparkling, their teeth white. Much of what 
 is here said concerning Judah is to be applied 
 to our Lord Jesus. 
 
 (1.) He is the 
 ruler of all his father's children, and the
 conqueror of all his father's enemies; and 
 he it is that is the praise of all the saints. 
 
 (2.) He is <I>the lion of the tribe of Judah,</I> as he 
 is called with reference to this prophecy
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:5">Rev. v. 5</A>),
 who, having spoiled principalities and 
 powers, went up a conqueror, and couched 
 so as none can stir him up, when he sat 
 down on the right hand of the Father. 
 
 (3.) To him belongs the sceptre; he is the <I>lawgiver,</I> 
 and <I>to him shall the gathering of the 
 people be,</I> as the desire of all nations
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7">Hag. ii. 7</A>),
 who, being lifted up from the earth, 
 should draw all men unto him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32">John xii. 32</A>),
 and in whom the children of God that 
 are scattered abroad should meet as the 
 centre of their unity,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>.

 (4.) In 
 him there is plenty of all that which is 
 nourishing and refreshing to the soul, and 
 which maintains and cheers the divine life 
 in it; in him we may have wine and milk, 
 the riches of Judah's tribe, without money 
 and without price,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 that his 
 posterity should have their lot upon the seacoast, 
 and should be merchants, and mariners, 
 and traders at sea. This was fulfilled 
 when, two or three hundred years after, the 
 land of Canaan was divided by lot, and the 
 <I>border of Zebulun went up towards the sea,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:11">Josh. xix. 11</A>.
 Had they chosen their lot 
 themselves, or Joshua appointed it, we might 
 have supposed it done with design to make 
 Jacob's words good; but, being done by lot, 
 it appears that it was divinely disposed, and 
 Jacob divinely inspired. Note, The lot of 
 God's providence exactly agrees with the 
 plan of God's counsel, like a true copy with 
 the original. If prophecy says, <I>Zebulun shall 
 be a haven of ships,</I> Providence will so plant 
 him. Note, 
 
 1. God appoints the bounds of 
 our habitation. 
 
 2. It is our wisdom and 
 duty to accommodate ourselves to our lot 
 and to improve it. If Zebulun dwell at the 
 haven of the sea, let him be for a haven of 
 ships.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning Issachar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 1. That the men of that tribe should be strong 
 and industrious, fit for labour and inclined 
 to labour, particularly the toil of husbandry, 
 like the ass, that patiently carries his burden, 
 and, by using himself to it, makes it the 
 easier. Issachar submitted to two burdens, 
 tillage and tribute. It was a tribe that took 
 pains, and, thriving thereby, was called upon 
 for rents and taxes. 
 
 2. That they should be 
 encouraged in their labour by the goodness 
 of the land that should fall to their lot. 
 
 (1.) <I>He saw that rest</I> at home <I>was good.</I> Note, 
 The labour of the husbandman is really rest, 
 in comparison with that of soldiers and 
 seamen, whose hurries and perils are such 
 that those who tarry at home in the most 
 constant service have no reason to envy 
 them. 
 
 (2.) <I>He saw that the land was pleasant,</I> 
 yielding not only pleasant prospects to charm 
 the eye of the curious, but pleasant fruits to 
 recompense his toils. Many are the pleasures 
 of a country life, abundantly sufficient 
 to balance the inconveniences of it, if we can 
 but persuade ourselves to think so, Issachar, 
 in prospect of advantage, <I>bowed his shoulders 
 to bear:</I> let us, with an eye of faith, see the 
 heavenly rest to be good, and that land of 
 promise to be pleasant; and this will make 
 our present services easy, and encourage us 
 to bow our shoulder to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning Dan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 What 
 is said concerning Dan has reference either, 
 
 1. To that tribe in general, that though Dan 
 was one of the sons of the concubines yet he 
 should be a tribe governed by judges of his 
 own as well as other tribes, and should, by 
 art, and policy, and surprise, gain advantages 
 against his enemies, like a serpent suddenly 
 biting the heel of the traveller. Note, In 
 God's spiritual Israel there is no distinction 
 made of <I>bond or free,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.
 Dan shall 
 be incorporated by as good a charter as any 
 of the other tribes. Note, also, Some, like 
 Dan, may excel in the subtlety of the serpent, 
 as others, like Judah, in the courage 
 of the lion; and both may do good service 
 to the cause of God against the Canaanites. 
 Or it may refer, 
 
 2. To Samson, who was of 
 that tribe, and judged Israel, that is, delivered 
 them out of the hands of the Philistines, not 
 as the other judges, by fighting them in the 
 field, but by the vexations and annoyances 
 he gave them underhand: when he pulled 
 the house down under the Philistines that 
 were upon the roof of it, he made the horse 
 throw his rider.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus was Jacob going on with his discourse; 
 but now, being almost spent with 
 speaking, and ready to faint and die away, 
 he relieves himself with those words which 
 come in as a parenthesis
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 <I>I have 
 waited for thy salvation, O Lord!</I> as those 
 that are fainting are helped by taking a 
 spoonful of a cordial, or smelling at a bottle 
 of spirits; or, if he must break off here, 
 and his breath will not serve him to finish 
 what he intended, with these words he pours 
 out his soul into the bosom of his God, and 
 even breathes it out. Note, The pious ejaculations 
 of a warm and lively devotion, though 
 sometimes they may be incoherent, are not 
 therefore to be censured as impertinent; that 
 may be uttered affectionately which does 
 not come in methodically. It is no absurdity, 
 when we are speaking to men, to lift up our 
 hearts to God. The salvation he waited for 
 was <I>Christ,</I> the promised seed, whom he had 
 spoken of,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Now that he was going to 
 be gathered to his people, he breathes after 
 him to whom the gathering of the people 
 shall be. The salvation he waited for was 
 also <I>heaven,</I> the better country, which he 
 declared plainly that he sought
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13,14">Heb. xi. 13, 14</A>),
 and continued seeking, now that he was 
 in Egypt. Now that he is going to enjoy 
 the salvation he comforts himself with this, 
 that he had waited for the salvation. Note, 
 It is the character of a living saint that he 
 waits for the salvation of the Lord. Christ, 
 as our way to heaven, is to be waited on; 

 <A NAME="Page263"> </A>

 and heaven, as our rest in Christ, is to be 
 waited for. Again, It is the comfort of a dying 
 saint thus to have waited for the salvation of 
 the Lord; for then he shall have what he has 
 been waiting for: long-looked-for will come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning Gad,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 He alludes 
 to his name, which signifies a <I>troop,</I> foresees 
 the character of that tribe, that it should be 
 a warlike tribe, and so we find
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:8">1 Chron. xii. 8</A>);
 the <I>Gadites were men of war fit for the 
 battle.</I> He foresees that the situation of that 
 tribe on the other side Jordan would expose 
 it to the incursions of its neighbours, the 
 Moabites and Ammonites; and, that they 
 might not be proud of their strength and 
 valour, he foretels that the troops of their 
 enemies should, in many skirmishes, overcome 
 them; yet, that they might not be discouraged 
 by their defeats, he assures them 
 that they should <I>overcome at the last,</I> which 
 was fulfilled when, in Saul's time and David's, 
 the Moabites and Ammonites were 
 wholly subdued: see
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:18-22">1 Chron. v. 18</A>,
 &c. 
 Note, The cause of God and his people, 
 though it may seem for a time to be baffled 
 and run down, will yet be victorious at 
 last. <I>Vincimur in pr&aelig;lio, sed non in bello--We 
 are foiled in a battle, but not in a campaign.</I> 
 Grace in the soul is often foiled in 
 its conflicts, troops of corruption overcome 
 it, but the cause is God's, and grace will in 
 the issue come off conqueror, yea, <I>more than 
 conqueror,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:37">Rom. viii. 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Concerning Asher
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 that it should 
 be a very rich tribe, replenished not only 
 with bread for necessity, but with fatness, 
 with <I>dainties, royal dainties</I> (for the king 
 himself is <I>served of the field,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:9">Eccl. v. 9</A>),
 and 
 these exported out of Asher to other tribes, 
 perhaps to other lands. Note, The God of 
 nature has provided for us not only necessaries 
 but dainties, that we might call him a 
 bountiful benefactor; yet, whereas all places 
 are competently furnished with necessaries, 
 only some places afford dainties. Corn is 
 more common than spices. Were the supports 
 of luxury as universal as the supports 
 of life, the world would be worse than it is, 
 and that it needs not be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Concerning Naphtali
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 a tribe 
 that carries struggles in its name; it signifies 
 <I>wrestling,</I> and the blessing entailed upon it 
 signifies prevailing; it is <I>a hind let loose.</I> 
 Though we find not this prediction so fully 
 answered in the event as some of the rest, 
 yet, no doubt, it proved true that those of 
 this tribe were, 
 
 1. As the loving hind (for 
 that is her epithet,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>),
 friendly and 
 obliging to one another and to other tribes; 
 their converse remarkably kind and endearing.
 
 2. As the loosened hind, zealous for 
 their liberty. 
 
 3. As the swift hind
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:33">Ps. xviii. 33</A>),
 quick in despatch of business; and perhaps, 
 
 4. As the trembling, timorous in 
 times of public danger. It is rare that those 
 that are most amiable to their friends are 
 most formidable to their enemies. 
 
 5. That 
 they should be affable and courteous, their 
 language refined, and they complaisant, <I>giving 
 goodly words.</I> Note, Among God's Israel 
 there is to be found a great variety of dispositions, 
 contrary to each other, yet all contributing 
 to the beauty and strength of the 
 body, Judah like a lion, Issachar like an ass, 
 Dan like a serpent, Naphtali like a hind. Let 
 not those of different tempers and gifts censure 
 one another, nor envy one another, any 
 more than those of different statures and 
 complexions.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Joseph <I>is</I> a fruitful bough, <I>even</I> a 
 fruitful bough by a well; <I>whose</I> branches 
 run over the wall:
 &nbsp; 23 The archers 
 have sorely grieved him, and shot <I>at 
 him,</I> and hated him:
 &nbsp; 24 But his bow 
 abode in strength, and the arms of his 
 hands were made strong by the hands 
 of the mighty <I>God</I> of Jacob; (from
 thence <I>is</I> the shepherd, the stone of 
 Israel:)
 &nbsp; 25 <I>Even</I> by the God of thy 
 father, who shall help thee; and by
 the Almighty, who shall bless thee 
 with blessings of heaven above, blessings 
 of the deep that lieth under, 
 blessings of the breasts, and of the 
 womb:
 &nbsp; 26 The blessings of thy father 
 have prevailed above the blessings of 
 my progenitors unto the utmost bound 
 of the everlasting hills: they shall be 
 on the head of Joseph, and on the 
 crown of the head of him that was separate 
 from his brethren.
 &nbsp; 27 Benjamin 
 shall ravin <I>as</I> a wolf: in the 
 morning he shall devour the prey, and 
 at night he shall divide the spoil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He closes with the blessings of his best 
 beloved sons, Joseph and Benjamin; with 
 these he will breathe his last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The blessing of Joseph, which is very 
 large and full. He is compared
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 to <I>a 
 fruitful bough,</I> or young tree; for God had 
 made him fruitful in the land of his affliction; 
 he owned it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:52"><I>ch.</I> xli. 52</A>.
 His two sons 
 were as branches of a vine, or other spreading 
 plant, <I>running over the wall.</I> Note, God 
 can make those fruitful, great comforts to 
 themselves and others, who have been looked 
 upon as dry and withered. More is recorded 
 in the history concerning Joseph than concerning 
 any other of Jacob's sons; and 
 therefore what Jacob says of him is historical 
 as well as prophetical. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The providences of God concerning Joseph,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 These are mentioned to 
 the glory of God, and for the encouragement 
 of Jacob's faith and hope, that God had 
 blessings in store for his seed. Here observe 
 (1.) Joseph's straits and troubles,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 Though he now lived at ease and in honour, 

 <A NAME="Page264"> </A>

 Jacob reminds him of the difficulties he had 
 formerly waded through. He had had many 
 enemies, here called <I>archers,</I> being skilful to 
 do mischief, masters of their art of persecution. 
 They hated him: there persecution 
 begins. They shot their poisonous darts at 
 him, and thus they sorely grieved him. His 
 brethren, in his father's house, were very 
 spiteful towards him, mocked him, stripped 
 him, threatened him, sold him, thought they 
 had been the death of him. His mistress, in 
 the house of Potiphar, sorely grieved him, 
 and shot at him, when she impudently assaulted 
 his chastity (temptations are fiery 
 darts, thorns in the flesh, sorely grievous to 
 gracious souls); when she prevailed not in 
 this, she hated him, and shot at him by her 
 false accusations, arrows against which there 
 is little fence but the hold God has in the 
 consciences of the worst of men. Doubtless 
 he had enemies in the court of Pharaoh, that 
 envied his preferment, and sought to undermine 
 him. 
 
 (2.) Joseph's strength and support 
 under all these troubles
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 <I>His bow 
 abode in strength,</I> that is, his faith did not 
 fail, but he kept his ground, and came off a 
 conqueror. The <I>arms of his hands were made 
 strong,</I> that is, his other graces did their part, 
 his wisdom, courage, and patience, which are 
 better than weapons of war. In short, he 
 maintained both his integrity and his comfort 
 through all his trials; he bore all his 
 burdens with an invincible resolution, and 
 did not sink under them, nor do any thing 
 unbecoming him. 
 
 (3.) The spring and fountain 
 of this strength; it was <I>by the hands of 
 the mighty God,</I> who was therefore able to 
 strengthen him, and <I>the God of Jacob,</I> a God 
 in covenant with him, and therefore engaged 
 to help him. All our strength for the resisting 
 of temptations, and the bearing of afflictions, 
 comes from God: his grace is sufficient, 
 and his strength is perfected in our weakness. 
 
 (4.) The state of honour and usefulness to 
 which he was subsequently advanced: <I>Thence</I> 
 (from this strange method of providence) he 
 became the <I>shepherd and stone,</I> the feeder 
 and supporter, <I>of</I> God's <I>Israel,</I> Jacob and his 
 family. Herein Joseph was a type, 
 
 [1.] Of Christ; he was shot at and hated, but borne 
 up under his sufferings 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7-9">Isa. l. 7-9</A>),
 and 
 was afterwards advanced to be <I>the shepherd 
 and stone.</I> 
 
 [2.] Of the church in general, 
 and particular believers; hell shoots its arrows 
 against the saints, but Heaven protects
 and strengthens them, and will crown them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The promises of God to Joseph. See 
 how these are connected with the former: 
 <I>Even by the God of thy father Jacob, who 
 shall help thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Note, Our experiences 
 of God's power and goodness in strengthening 
 us hitherto are our encouragements still 
 to hope for help from him; he that has helped 
 us will help: we may build much upon our 
 <I>Eben-ezers.</I> See what Joseph may expect 
 from <I>the Almighty,</I> even <I>the God of his father.</I> 
 
 (1.) He shall help thee in difficulties and dangers 
 which may yet be before thee, help thy 
 seed in their wars. Joshua came from him, 
 who commanded in chief in the wars of Canaan. 
 
 (2.) He shall bless thee; and he only 
 blesses indeed. Jacob prays for a blessing 
 upon Joseph, but the God of Jacob commands 
 the blessing. Observe the blessings 
 conferred on Joseph. 
 
 [1.] Various and abundant 
 blessings: <I>Blessings of heaven above</I> 
 (rain in its season, and fair weather in its 
 season, and the benign influences of the heavenly 
 bodies); <I>blessings of the deep that lieth 
 under</I> this earth, which, compared with the 
 upper world, is but a great deep, with subterraneous 
 mines and springs. Spiritual 
 blessings are blessings of heaven above, which 
 we ought to desire and seek for in the first 
 place, and to which we must give the preference; 
 while temporal blessings, those of this 
 earth, must lie under in our account and 
 esteem. <I>Blessings of the womb and the breasts</I> 
 are given when children are safely born and 
 comfortably nursed. In the word of God, 
 by which we are born again, and nourished 
 up
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23,2:2">1 Pet. i. 23; ii. 2</A>),
 there are to the new 
 man blessings both of the womb and the 
 breasts. 
 
 [2.] Eminent and transcendent 
 blessings, which <I>prevail above the blessings 
 of my progenitors,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 His father Isaac 
 had but one blessing, and, when he had given 
 that to Jacob, he was at a loss for a blessing 
 to bestow upon Esau; but Jacob had a blessing 
 for each of his twelve sons, and now, at 
 the latter end, a copious one for Joseph. The 
 great blessing entailed upon that family was 
 increase, which did not so immediately and 
 so signally follow the blessings which Abraham 
 and Isaac gave to their sons as it followed 
 the blessing which Jacob gave to his; 
 for, soon after his death, they multiplied 
 exceedingly. 
 
 [3.] Durable and extensive 
 blessings: <I>Unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting 
 hills,</I> including all the productions of 
 the most fruitful hills, and lasting as long as 
 they last,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa. liv. 10</A>.
 Note, the blessings of 
 the everlasting God include the riches of the 
 everlasting hills, and much more. Well, of 
 these blessings it is here said, <I>They shall be,</I> 
 so it is a promise, or, <I>Let them be,</I> so it is a 
 prayer, <I>on the head of Joseph,</I> to which let 
 them be as a crown to adorn it and a helmet 
 to protect it. Joseph <I>was separated from his 
 brethren</I> (so we read it) for a time; yet, as 
 others read it, <I>he was a Nazarite among his 
 brethren,</I> better and more excellent than they. 
 Note, It is no new thing for the best men to 
 meet with the worst usage, for Nazarites 
 among their brethren to be cast out and separated 
 from their brethren; but the blessing 
 of God will make it up to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessing of Benjamin
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 He 
 <I>shall raven as a wolf;</I> it is plain by this that 
 Jacob was guided in what he said by a spirit 
 of prophecy, and not by natural affection; 
 else he would have spoken with more tenderness 
 of his beloved son Benjamin, concerning 
 whom he only foresees and foretels this, that 

 <A NAME="Page265"> </A>

 his posterity should be a warlike tribe, strong 
 and daring, and that they should enrich 
 themselves with the spoils of their enemies--that 
 they should be active and busy in the 
 world, and a tribe as much feared by their 
 neighbours as any other: <I>In the morning, he 
 shall devour the prey,</I> which he seized and 
 divided over night. Or, in the first times of 
 Israel, they shall be noted for activity, though 
 many of them left-handed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:15,20:16">Judg. iii. 15; xx. 16</A>.
 Ehud the second judge, and Saul the 
 first king, were of this tribe; and so also in 
 the last times Esther and Mordecai, by whom 
 the enemies of the Jews were destroyed, 
 were of this tribe. The Benjamites ravened 
 like wolves when they desperately espoused 
 the cause of the men of Gibeah, those men 
 of Belial,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:14">Judg. xx. 14</A>.
 Blessed Paul was of 
 this tribe
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1,Php+3:5">Rom. xi. 1; Phil. iii. 5</A>);
 and he did, 
 in the morning of his day, devour the prey 
 as a persecutor, but, in the evening, divided 
 the spoil as a preacher. Note, God can serve 
 his own purposes by the different tempers of 
 men; <I>the deceived and the deceiver are his.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28 All these <I>are</I> the twelve tribes 
 of Israel: and this <I>is it</I> that their father 
 spake unto them, and blessed 
 them; every one according to his 
 blessing he blessed them.
 &nbsp; 29 And he 
 charged them, and said unto them, I 
 am to be gathered unto my people: 
 bury me with my fathers in the cave 
 that <I>is</I> in the field of Ephron the 
 Hittite,
 &nbsp; 30 In the cave that <I>is</I> in the 
 field of Machpelah, which <I>is</I> before 
 Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which 
 Abraham bought with the field of 
 Ephron the Hittite for a possession of 
 a buryingplace.
 &nbsp; 31 There they buried 
 Abraham and Sarah his wife; there 
 they buried Isaac and Rebekah his 
 wife; and there I buried Leah.
 &nbsp; 32 The purchase of the field and of the 
 cave that <I>is</I> therein <I>was</I> from the 
 children of Heth.
 &nbsp; 33 And when Jacob 
 had made an end of commanding 
 his sons, he gathered up his feet into 
 the bed, and yielded up the ghost, 
 and was gathered unto his people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The summing up of the blessings 
 of Jacob's sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 Though Reuben, 
 Simeon, and Levi were put under the marks 
 of their father's displeasure, yet he is said to 
 <I>bless them every one according to his blessing;</I> 
 for none of them were rejected as Esau was. 
 Note, Whatever rebukes of God's word or 
 providence we are under at any time, yet, as 
 long as we have an interest in God's covenant, 
 a place and a name among his people, 
 and good hopes of a share in the heavenly 
 Canaan, we must account ourselves blessed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemn charge Jacob gave them 
 concerning his burial, which is a repetition 
 of what he had before given to Joseph. See 
 how he speaks of death, now that he is dying: 
 <I>I am to be gathered unto my people,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 Note, It is good to represent death to 
 ourselves under the most desirable images, 
 that the terror of it may be taken off. Though 
 it separates us from our children and our 
 people in this world, it gathers us to our 
 fathers and to our people in the other world. 
 Perhaps Jacob uses this expression concerning 
 death as a reason why his sons should 
 bury him in Canaan; for, says he, "<I>I am to 
 be gathered unto my people,</I> my soul must go 
 to <I>the spirits of just men made perfect:</I> and 
 therefore bury me with my fathers, Abraham 
 and Isaac, and their wives," 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 Observe,
 
 1. His heart was very much upon it, not so 
 much from a natural affection to his native 
 soil as from a principle of faith in the promise 
 of God, that Canaan should be the inheritance 
 of his seed in due time. Thus he 
 would keep up in his sons a remembrance of 
 the promised land, and not only would have 
 their acquaintance with it renewed by a journey 
 thither on that occasion, but their desire 
 towards it and their expectation of it preserved. 
 
 2. He is very particular in describing 
 the place both by the situation of it 
 and by the purchase Abraham had made of 
 it for a burying-place,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:30,32"><I>v.</I> 30, 32</A>.
 He was 
 afraid lest his sons, after seventeen years' 
 sojourning in Egypt, had forgotten Canaan, 
 and even the burying-place of their ancestors 
 there, or lest the Canaanites should dispute 
 his title to it; and therefore he specifies it 
 thus largely, and the purchase of it, even 
 when he lies a-dying, not only to prevent 
 mistakes, but to show how mindful he was 
 of that country. Note, It is, and should be, 
 a great pleasure to dying saints to fix their 
 thoughts upon the heavenly Canaan, and the rest 
 they hope for there after death.</P>

 III. The death of Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 When he 
 had finished both his blessing and his charge 
 (both which are included in the commanding 
 of his sons), and so had finished his testimony, 
 he addressed himself to his dying 
 work. 
 
 1. He put himself into a posture 
 for dying; having before seated himself upon 
 the bed-side, to bless his sons (the spirit of 
 prophecy bringing fresh oil to his expiring 
 lamp,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:19">Dan. x. 19</A>),
 when that work was done, 
 <I>he gathered up his feet into the bed,</I> that he 
 might lie along, not only as one patiently 
 submitting to the stroke, but as one cheerfully 
 composing himself to rest, now that he 
 was weary. <I>I will lay me down, and sleep.</I> 
 
 2. He freely resigned his spirit into the hand 
 of God, the Father of spirits: <I>He yielded up 
 the ghost.</I> 
 
 3. His separated soul went to 
 the assembly of the souls of the faithful, 
 which, after they are delivered from the burden 
 of the flesh, are in joy and felicity: he 
 was <I>gathered to his people.</I> Note, If God's people 
 be our people, death will gather us to them.</P>
