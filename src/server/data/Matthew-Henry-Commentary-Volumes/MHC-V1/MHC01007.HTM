 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the performance of what was foretold in 
 the foregoing chapter, both concerning the destruction of the 
 old world and the salvation of Noah; for we may be sure that no 

 <A NAME="Page58"> </A>

 word of God shall fall to the ground. There we left Noah busy
 about his ark, and full of care to get it finished in time, while 
 the rest of his neighbours were laughing at him for his pains. 
 Now here we see what was the end thereof, the end of his care 
 and of their carelessness. And this famous period of the old 
 world gives us some idea of the state of things when the world
 that now is shall be destroyed by fire, as that was by water. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:6,7">2 Pet. iii. 6, 7</A>.
 We have, in this chapter,

 I. God's gracious call
 to Noah to come into the ark
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1">ver. 1</A>),
 and to bring the creatures
 that were to be preserved alive along with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>),
 in consideration of the deluge at hand,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:4">ver. 4</A>.

 II. Noah's obedience
 to this heavenly vision,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:5">ver. 5</A>.
 When he was six hundred years
 old, he came with his family into the ark
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),
 and brought
 the creatures along with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),
 an account of which is
 repeated
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>),
 to which is added God's tender care to 
 shut him in.

 III. The coming of the threatened deluge
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:10">ver. 10</A>);
 the causes of it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>):
 the prevalency of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 IV. The dreadful desolations that were made by it in the
 death of every living creature upon earth, except those that were
 in the ark,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.

 V. The continuance of it in full sea,
 before it began to ebb, one hundred and fifty days,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:24">ver. 24</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Noah,
 Come thou and all thy house
 into the ark; for thee have I seen
 righteous before me in this generation.
 &nbsp; 2 Of every clean beast thou 
 shalt take to thee by sevens, the male 
 and his female: and of beasts that 
 <I>are</I> not clean by two, the male and 
 his female.
 &nbsp; 3 Of fowls also of the 
 air by sevens, the male and the female;
 to keep seed alive upon the 
 face of all the earth.
 &nbsp; 4 For yet 
 seven days, and I will cause it to rain 
 upon the earth forty days and forty 
 nights; and every living substance
 that I have made will I destroy from 
 off the face of the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A gracious invitation of Noah 
 and his family into a place of safety, now 
 that the flood of waters was coming, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The call itself is very kind, like that of 
 a tender father to his children, to come in 
 doors, when he sees night or a storm coming: 
 <I>Come thou, and all thy house,</I> that small 
 family that thou hast, <I>into the ark.</I> Observe, 
 
 (1.) Noah did not go into the ark till God 
 bade him; though he knew it was designed 
 for his place of refuge, yet he waited for a 
 renewed command, and had it. It is very 
 comfortable to follow the calls of Providence, 
 and to see God going before us in every step 
 we take. 
 
 (2.) God does not bid him <I>go</I> into 
 the ark, but <I>come</I> into it, implying that God 
 would go with him, would lead him into it, 
 accompany him in it, and in due time bring 
 him safely out of it. Note, Wherever we are, 
 it is very desirable to have the presence of 
 God with us, for this is all in all to the comfort 
 of every condition. It was this that 
 made Noah's ark, which was a prison, to be 
 to him not only a refuge, but a palace. 
 
 (3.) Noah had taken a great deal of pains to build 
 the ark, and now he was himself preserved alive 
 in it. Note, What we do in obedience to the 
 command of God, and in faith, we ourselves 
 shall certainly have the comfort of, first or 
 last. 
 
 (4.) Not he only, but his house also, 
 his wife and children, are called with him 
 into the ark. Note, It is good to belong to 
 the family of a godly man; it is safe and 
 comfortable to dwell under such a shadow. 
 One of Noah's sons was Ham, who proved 
 afterwards a bad man, yet he was saved in 
 the ark, which intimates, 
 
 [1.] That wicked 
 children often fare the better for the sake of 
 their godly parents. 
 
 [2.] That there is a mixture
 of bad with good in the best societies on
 earth, and we are not to think it strange. In
 Noah's family there was a Ham, and in
 Christ's family there was a Judas. There is no
 perfect purity on this side heaven.

 (5.) This
 call to Noah was a type of the call which the
 gospel gives to poor sinners. Christ is an
 ark already prepared, in whom alone we can
 be safe when death and judgment come.
 Now the burden of the song is, "Come,
 come;" the word says, "Come;" ministers
 say, "Come;" the Spirit says, "Come, come
 into the ark."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason for this invitation is a very 
 honourable testimony to Noah's integrity: 
 <I>For thee have I seen righteous before me in 
 this generation.</I> Observe, 
 
 (1.) Those are 
 righteous indeed that are righteous before 
 God, that have not only the form of godliness 
 by which they appear righteous before 
 men, who may easily be imposed upon, but 
 the power of it by which they approve themselves 
 to God, who searches the heart, and 
 cannot be deceived in men's characters. 
 
 (2.) God takes notice of and is pleased with 
 those that are righteous before him: <I>Thee 
 have I seen.</I> In a world of wicked people 
 God could see one righteous Noah; that 
 single grain of wheat could not be lost, no, 
 not in so great a heap of chaff. <I>The Lord 
 knows those that are his.</I> 
 
 (3.) God, that is a 
 witness to, will shortly be a witness for, his 
 people's integrity; he that sees it will proclaim 
 it before angels and men, to their immortal 
 honour. Those that obtain mercy to 
 be righteous shall obtain witness that they 
 are righteous. 
 
 (4.) God is, in a special manner, 
 pleased with those that are good in bad 
 times and places. Noah was therefore illustriously 
 righteous, because he was so in that 
 wicked and adulterous generation. 
 
 (5.) Those 
 that keep themselves pure in times of common
 iniquity God will keep safe in times of 
 common calamity; those that partake not 
 with others in their sins shall not partake 
 with them in their plagues; those that are 
 better than others are, even in this life, safer 
 than others, and it is better with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are necessary orders given concerning 
 the brute-creatures that were to be 
 preserved alive with Noah in the ark, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 They were not capable of receiving the warning 
 and directions themselves, as man was, 
 who herein is taught <I>more than the beasts of 
 the earth, and made wiser than the fowls of 
 heaven</I>--that he is endued with the power of 
 foresight; therefore man is charged with the 
 care of them: being under his dominion, 
 they must be under his protection; and, 
 though he could not secure every individual, 
 
 <A NAME="Page59"> </A>

 yet he must carefully preserve every species, 
 that no tribe, no, not the least considerable, 
 might entirely perish out of the creation. 
 Observe in this, 
 
 1. God's care for man, for 
 his comfort and benefit. We do not find 
 that Noah was solicitous of himself about 
 this matter; but God consults our happiness 
 more than we do ourselves. Though God 
 saw that the old world was very provoking, 
 and foresaw that the new one would be little 
 better, yet he would preserve the brute creatures 
 for man's use. <I>Doth God take care for 
 oxen?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9">1 Cor. ix. 9</A>.
 Or was it not rather for 
 man's sake that this care was taken? 
 
 2. Even the unclean beasts, which were least 
 valuable and profitable, were preserved alive 
 in the ark; for God's tender mercies are 
 over all his works, and not over those only 
 that are of most eminence and use. 
 
 3. Yet 
 more of the clean were preserved than of the 
 unclean. 
 
 (1.) Because the clean were most 
 for the service of man; and therefore, in 
 favour to him, more of them were preserved 
 and are still propagated. Thanks be to God, 
 there are not herds of lions as there are of 
 oxen, nor flocks of tigers as there are of 
 sheep. 
 
 (2.) Because the clean were for sacrifice 
 to God; and therefore, in honour to 
 him, more of them were preserved, three 
 couple for breed, and the odd seventh for 
 sacrifice, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20"><I>ch.</I> viii. 20</A>.
 God gives us six for 
 one in earthly things, as in the distribution 
 of the days of the week, that in spiritual 
 things we should be all for him. What is 
 devoted to God's honour, and used in his 
 service, is particularly blessed and increased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is notice given of the now imminent 
 approach of the flood: <I>Yet seven days, 
 and I will cause it to rain,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. "It shall 
 be seven days <I>yet,</I> before I do it." After the 
 hundred and twenty years had expired, God 
 grants them a reprieve of seven days longer, 
 both to show how slow he is to anger and 
 that punishing work is his strange work, and 
 also to give them some further space for repentance: 
 but all in vain; these seven days 
 were trifled away, after all the rest; they 
 continued secure and sensual until the day 
 that the flood came. 
 
 2. "It shall be <I>but</I> 
 seven days." While Noah told them of the 
 judgment at a distance, they were tempted 
 to put off their repentance, because the 
 vision was for a great while to come; but 
 now he is ordered to tell them that it is at 
 the door, that they have but one week more 
 to turn them in, but one sabbath more to improve, 
 to see if that will now, at last, awaken 
 them to consider the things that belong to 
 their peace, which otherwise will soon be 
 hidden from their eyes. But it is common 
 for those that have been careless of their 
 souls during the years of their health, when 
 they have looked upon death at a distance, 
 to be as careless during the days, the seven 
 days, of their sickness, when they see it approaching, 
 their hearts being hardened by 
 the deceitfulness of sin.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And Noah did according unto all 
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded him.
 &nbsp; 6 And Noah <I>was</I> six hundred years old 
 when the flood of waters was upon 
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 7 And Noah went in, and 
 his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
 wives with him, into the ark, because 
 of the waters of the flood.
 &nbsp; 8 Of clean 
 beasts, and of beasts that <I>are</I> not clean, 
 and of fowls, and of every thing 
 that creepeth upon the earth,
 &nbsp; 9 There went in two and two unto Noah 
 into the ark, the male and the female, 
 as God had commanded Noah.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass after seven 
 days, that the waters of the flood were 
 upon the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is Noah's ready obedience to the 
 commands that God gave him. Observe, 
 
 1. He went into the ark, upon notice that the 
 flood would come after seven days, though 
 probably as yet there appeared no visible 
 sign of its approach, no cloud arising that 
 threatened it, nothing done towards it, but 
 all continued serene and clear; for, as he 
 prepared the ark by faith in the warning given 
 that the flood would come, so he went into it 
 by faith in this warning that it would come 
 quickly, though he did not see that the second 
 causes had yet begun to work. In every 
 step he took, he walked by faith, and not by 
 sense. During these seven days, it is likely, 
 he was settling himself and his family in the 
 ark, and distributing the creatures into their 
 several apartments. This was the conclusion 
 of that visible sermon which he had long 
 been preaching to his careless neighbours, 
 and which, one would think, might have 
 awakened them; but, not obtaining that desired 
 end, it left their blood upon their own 
 heads. 
 
 2. He took all his family along with 
 him, his wife, to be his companion and comfort 
 (though it should seem that, after this, 
 he had no children by her), his sons, and his 
 sons' wives, that by them not only his family, 
 but the world of mankind, might be built up. 
 Observe, Though men were to be reduced 
 to so small a number, and it would be very 
 desirable to have the world speedily repeopled, 
 yet Noah's sons were each of them to have 
 but one wife, which strengthens the argument 
 against having many wives; for from 
 the beginning of this new world it was not 
 so: as, at first, God made, so now he kept 
 alive, but one woman for one man. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:4,8">Matt. xix. 4, 8</A>.

 3. The brute creatures 
 readily went in with him. The same hand 
 that at first brought them to Adam to be 
 named now brought them to Noah to be 
 preserved. The ox now knew his owner, and 
 the ass his protector's crib, nay, even the 
 wildest creatures flocked to it; but man had 
 become more brutish than the brutes

 <A NAME="Page60"> </A>

 themselves, and did not know, did not consider, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3">Isa. i. 3</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Ge7_11"> </A>
 <A NAME="Ge7_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 In the six hundredth year of 
 Noah's life, in the second month, the 
 seventeenth day of the month, the 
 same day were all the fountains of 
 the great deep broken up, and the 
 windows of heaven were opened.
 &nbsp; 12 And the rain was upon the earth 
 forty days and forty nights.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The date of this great event; 
 this is carefully recorded, for the greater certainty 
 of the story.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was in the 600th year of Noah's life, 
 which, by computation, appears to be 1656 
 years from the creation. The years of the 
 old world are reckoned, not by the reigns of 
 the giants, but the lives of the patriarchs; 
 saints are of more account with God than 
 princes. <I>The righteous shall be had in everlasting 
 remembrance.</I> Noah was now a very 
 old man, even as men's years went then. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) The longer we live in this world 
 the more we see of the miseries and calamities 
 of it; it is therefore spoken of as the privilege 
 of those that die young that their <I>eyes 
 shall not see the evil</I> which is coming, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:20">2 Kings xxii. 20</A>.

 (2.) Sometimes God exercises his 
 old servants with extraordinary trials of 
 obedient patience. The oldest of Christ's 
 soldiers must not promise themselves a discharge 
 from their warfare till death discharge 
 them. Still they must gird on their harness, 
 and not boast as though they had put it off. 
 As the year of the deluge is recorded, so,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are told that it was in the <I>second 
 month, the seventeenth day of the month,</I> which 
 is reckoned to be about the beginning of November; 
 so that Noah had had a harvest just 
 before, from which to victual his ark.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The second causes that concurred to 
 this deluge. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the self-same day that Noah was 
 fixed in the ark, the inundation began. Note, 
 
 (1.) Desolating judgments come not till God 
 has provided for the security of his own 
 people; see 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:22"><I>ch.</I> xix. 22</A>,
 I can <I>do nothing till 
 thou be come thither:</I> and we find 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:3">Rev. vii. 3</A>)
 that the winds are held till the servants of 
 God are sealed. 
 
 (2.) When good men are 
 removed judgments are not far off; for they 
 are <I>taken away from the evil to come,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1">Isa. lvii. 1</A>.
 When they are called into the chambers, hidden 
 in the grave, hidden in heaven, then God 
 is <I>coming out of his place to punish,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:20,21">Isa. xxvi. 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See what was done on that day, that fatal 
 day to the world of the ungodly. 
 
 (1.) <I>The 
 fountains of the great deep were broken up.</I> 
 Perhaps there needed no new creation of 
 waters; what were already made to be, in the 
 common course of providence, blessings to 
 the earth, were now, by an extraordinary act 
 of divine power, made the ruin of it. God 
 has laid up the deep in storehouses 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:7">Ps. xxxiii. 7</A>),
 and now he broke up those stores. 
 As our bodies have in themselves those humours 
 which, when God pleases, become the 
 seeds and springs of mortal diseases, so the 
 earth had in it bowels those waters which, 
 at God's command, sprang up and flooded it. 
 God had, in the creation, set <I>bars and doors</I> 
 to the waters of <I>the sea,</I> that they <I>might not 
 return to cover the earth</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:9,Job+38:9-11">Ps. civ. 9; Job xxxviii. 9-11</A>);
 and now he only removed 
 those ancient land-marks, mounds, and fences, 
 and the waters of the sea returned to cover 
 the earth, as they had done at first, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>.
 Note, All the creatures are ready to fight
 against sinful man, and any of them is able 
 to be the instrument of his ruin, if God do 
 but take off the restraints by which they are 
 held in during the day of God's patience. 
 
 (2.) <I>The windows of heaven were opened,</I> and 
 <I>the waters which were above the firmament</I> 
 were poured out upon the world; those 
 treasures which God has <I>reserved against the 
 time of trouble, the day of battle and war,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>.
 The rain, which ordinarily 
 descends in drops, then came down 
 in streams, or <I>spouts,</I> as they call them in the 
 Indies, where clouds have been often known 
 to <I>burst,</I> as they express it there, when the 
 rain descends in a much more violent torrent 
 than we have ever seen in the greatest shower. 
 We read 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:8">Job xxvi. 8</A>)
 that <I>God binds up the 
 waters in his thick clouds,</I> and the <I>cloud is not 
 rent under them;</I> but now the bond was 
 loosed, the cloud was rent, and such rains 
 descended as were never known before nor 
 since, in such abundance and of such continuance: 
 the thick cloud was not, as ordinarily 
 it is, wearied with waterings 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:11">Job xxxvii. 11</A>),
 that is, soon spent and exhausted; 
 but still the clouds returned after the rain, 
 and the divine power brought in fresh recruits. 
 It rained, without intermission or 
 abatement, <I>forty days and forty nights</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 and that upon the whole earth at once, not, 
 as sometimes, <I>upon one city and not upon another.</I> 
 God made the world in six days, but 
 he was forty days in destroying it; for he is 
 slow to anger: but, though the destruction
 came slowly and gradually, yet it came effectually.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Now learn from this, 
 
 (1.) That all the 
 creatures are at God's disposal, and that he 
 makes what use he pleases of them, whether 
 <I>for correction, or for his land, or for mercy,</I> 
 as Elihu speaks of the rain, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:12,13">Job xxxvii. 12, 13</A>.

 (2.) That God often makes that which <I>should 
 be for our welfare to become a trap,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22">Ps. lxix. 22</A>.
 That which usually is a comfort and benefit 
 to us becomes, when God pleases, a scourge 
 and a plague to us. Nothing is more needful 
 nor useful than water, both the springs 
 of the earth and the showers of heaven; and 
 yet now nothing was more hurtful, nothing 
 more destructive: every creature is to us 
 what God makes it. 
 
 (3.) That it is impossible 
 to escape the righteous judgments of God 

 <A NAME="Page61"> </A>

 when they come against sinners with commission; 
 for God can arm both heaven and 
 earth against them; see 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:27">Job xx. 27</A>.
 God can surround men with the messengers of his 
 wrath, so that, if they look upwards, it is 
 with horror and amazement, if they look to 
 the earth, <I>behold, trouble and darkness,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21,22">Isa. viii. 21, 22</A>.
 Who then is able to stand before 
 God, when he is angry? 
 
 (4.) In this 
 destruction of the old world by water God 
 gave a specimen of the final destruction of 
 the world that now is by fire. We find the 
 apostle setting the one of these over against 
 the other, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:6,7">2 Pet. iii. 6, 7</A>.
 As there are waters 
 under the earth, so &AElig;tna, Vesuvius, and other 
 volcanoes, proclaim to the world that there 
 are subterraneous fires too; and fire often 
 falls from heaven, many desolations are made 
 by lightning; so that, when the time predetermined 
 comes, between these two fires the 
 earth and all the works therein shall be burnt 
 up, as the flood was brought upon the old 
 world out of the fountains of the great deep 
 and through the windows of heaven.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 In the selfsame day entered 
 Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, 
 the sons of Noah, and Noah's 
 wife, and the three wives of his sons 
 with them, into the ark;
 &nbsp; 14 They, 
 and every beast after his kind, and 
 all the cattle after their kind, and 
 every creeping thing that creepeth 
 upon the earth after his kind, and 
 every fowl after his kind, every bird
 of every sort.
 &nbsp; 15 And they went 
 in unto Noah into the ark, two and 
 two of all flesh, wherein <I>is</I> the breath 
 of life.
 &nbsp; 16 And they that went in, 
 went in male and female of all flesh,
 as God had commanded him: and 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shut him in.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is repeated what was related before 
 of Noah's entrance into the ark, with his family 
 and creatures that were marked for 
 preservation. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is thus repeated for the honour of 
 Noah, whose faith and obedience herein shone 
 so brightly, by which he obtained a good report, 
 and who herein appeared so great a favourite 
 of Heaven and so great a blessing to 
 this earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Notice is here taken of the beasts going 
 in <I>each after his kind,</I> according to the 
 phrase used in the history of the creation 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:21-25"><I>ch.</I> i. 21-25</A>),
 to intimate that just as many kinds 
 as were created at first were saved now, and 
 no more; and that this preservation was as a 
 new creation: a life remarkably protected is, 
 as it were, a new life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Though all enmities and hostilities 
 between the creatures ceased for the present, 
 and ravenous creatures were not only so mild 
 and manageable as that the <I>wolf and the lamb 
 lay down together,</I> but so strangely altered as 
 that the <I>lion did eat straw like an ox</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:6,7">Isa. xi. 6, 7</A>),
 yet, when this occasion was over, the 
 restraint was taken off, and they were still of 
 the same kind as ever; for the ark did not 
 alter their constitution. Hypocrites in the 
 church, that externally conform to the laws 
 of that ark, may yet be unchanged, and then 
 it will appear, one time or other, what kind 
 they are after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is added (and the circumstance deserves 
 our notice), <I>The Lord shut him in,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 As Noah continued his obedience to God, so 
 God continued his care of Noah: and here 
 it appeared to be a very distinguishing care; 
 for the shutting of this door set up a partition 
 wall between him and all the world besides. 
 God shut the door, 
 
 1. To secure him, and 
 keep him safe in the ark. The door must be 
 shut very <I>close,</I> lest the waters should break 
 in and sink the ark, and very <I>fast,</I> lest any
 without should break it down. Thus God 
 made up Noah, as he <I>makes up his jewels,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:17">Mal. iii. 17</A>.

 2. To exclude all others, and 
 keep them for ever out. Hitherto the door 
 of the ark stood open, and if any, even during 
 the last seven days, had repented and
 believed, for aught I know they might have 
 been welcomed into the ark; but now the 
 door was shut, and they were cut off from all 
 hopes of admittance: for God <I>shutteth, and 
 none can open.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. There is much of our gospel duty and 
 privilege to be seen in Noah's preservation in 
 the ark. The apostle makes it a type of our 
 baptism, that is, our Christianity, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:20,21">1 Pet. iii. 20, 21</A>.
 Observe then, 
 
 1. It is our great 
 duty, in obedience to the gospel call, by a 
 lively faith in Christ, to come into that way 
 of salvation which God has provided for poor 
 sinners. When Noah came into the ark, he 
 quitted his own house and lands; so must 
 we quit our own righteousness and our 
 worldly possessions, whenever they come into 
 competition with Christ. Noah must, for a 
 while, submit to the confinements and inconveniences 
 of the ark, in order to his preservation 
 for a new world; so those that come 
 into Christ to be saved by him must deny 
 themselves, both in sufferings and services. 
 
 2. Those that come into the ark themselves 
 should bring as many as they can in with 
 them, by good instructions, by persuasions, 
 and by a good example. <I>What knowest thou, 
 O man, but thou mayest thus save thy wife</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:16">1 Cor. vii. 16</A>),
 as Noah did his? There is 
 room enough in Christ for all comers. 
 
 3. Those that by faith come into Christ, the ark, 
 shall by the power of God be shut in, and 
 kept as in a strong-hold <I>by the power of God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>.
 God put Adam into paradise, but he 
 did not shut him in, and so he threw himself out; 
 but when he put Noah into the ark he shut him 
 in, and so when he brings a soul to Christ 
 he ensures its salvation: it is not in our own 
 keeping, but in the Mediator's hand. 
 
 4. The 
 door of mercy will shortly be shut against 

 <A NAME="Page62"> </A>
 
 those that now make light of it. Now, <I>knock 
 and it shall be opened;</I> but the time will come 
 when it shall not,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And the flood was forty days 
 upon the earth; and the waters increased, 
 and bare up the ark, and it 
 was lift up above the earth.
 &nbsp; 18 And 
 the waters prevailed, and were increased 
 greatly upon the earth; and 
 the ark went upon the face of the 
 waters.
 &nbsp; 19 And the waters prevailed 
 exceedingly upon the earth; and all
 the high hills, that <I>were</I> under the 
 whole heaven, were covered.
 &nbsp; 20 Fifteen 
 cubits upward did the waters prevail; 
 and the mountains were covered.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How long the flood was increasing--<I>forty 
 days,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 The profane world, who 
 believed not that it would come, probably 
 when it came flattered themselves with hopes 
 that it would soon abate and never come to 
 extremity; but still it increased, it prevailed. 
 Note, 
 
 1. When God judges he will overcome. 
 If he begin, he will make an end; his way is 
 perfect, both in judgment and mercy. 
 
 2. The 
 gradual approaches and advances of God's 
 judgments, which are designed to bring sinners 
 to repentance, are often abused to the 
 hardening of them in their presumption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To what degree they increased: they 
 rose so high that not only the low flat countries 
 were deluged, but to make sure work, 
 and that none might escape, the tops of the 
 highest mountains were overflowed--<I>fifteen 
 cubits,</I> that is, seven yards and a half; so that 
 <I>in vain was salvation hoped for from hills or 
 mountains,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:23">Jer. iii. 23</A>.
 None of God's creatures 
 are so high but his power can overtop 
 them; and he will make them know that 
 wherein they deal proudly he is above them. 
 Perhaps the tops of the mountains were 
 washed down by the strength of the waters, 
 which helped much towards the prevailing of 
 the waters above them; for it is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:15">Job xii. 15</A>),
 <I>He sends out the waters,</I> and they not 
 only overflow, but overturn, the earth. Thus 
 the refuge of lies was swept away, and the 
 waters overflowed the hiding-place of those 
 sinners 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17">Isa. xxviii. 17</A>),
 and in vain they fly to 
 them for safety, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.
 Now the mountains 
 departed, and the hills were removed, 
 and nothing stood a man in stead but the 
 <I>covenant of peace,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa. liv. 10</A>.
 There is no 
 place on earth so high as to set men out of 
 the reach of God's judgments, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:16,Ob+1:3,4">Jer. xlix. 16; Obad. 3, 4</A>.
 God's hand will <I>find out all his 
 enemies,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8">Ps. xxi. 8</A>.
 Observe how exactly they 
 are fathomed (<I>fifteen cubits</I>), not by Noah's 
 plummet, but by his knowledge who <I>weighs 
 the waters by measure,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:25">Job xxviii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What became of Noah's ark when the 
 waters thus increased: <I>It was lifted up above 
 the earth</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 <I>and went upon the face of the 
 waters,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 When all other buildings were 
 demolished by the waters, and buried under 
 them, the ark alone subsisted. Observe, 
 
 1. The waters which broke down every thing
 else bore up the ark. That which to unbelievers
 is a savour of death unto death is
 to the faithful a savour of life unto life.

 2. The more the waters increased the higher 
 the ark was lifted up towards heaven. Thus 
 sanctified afflictions are spiritual promotions; 
 and as troubles abound consolations much 
 more abound.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And all flesh died that moved 
 upon the earth, both of fowl, and of 
 cattle, and of beast, and of every 
 creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
 earth, and every man:
 &nbsp; 22 All in 
 whose nostrils <I>was</I> the breath of life,

 &nbsp; 23 And every living substance was

 <I>were</I> with him in the ark.
 &nbsp; 24 And 
 the waters prevailed upon the earth 
 a hundred and fifty days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The general destruction of all
 flesh by the waters of the flood. <I>Come, and
 see the desolations which God makes in the
 earth</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:8">Ps. xlvi. 8</A>),
 and how he lays heaps upon 
 heaps. Never did death triumph, from its 
 first entrance unto this day, as it did then. 
 Come, and see Death upon his pale horse, and 
 hell following with him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:7,8">Rev. vi. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All the cattle, fowl, and creeping things,
 died, except the few that were in the ark. 
 Observe how this is repeated: <I>All flesh died,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 <I>All in whose nostrils was the breath of 
 life, of all that was on the dry land,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 <I>Every living substance,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 And why so? 
 Man only had done wickedly, and justly is 
 God's hand against him; but <I>these sheep, 
 what have they done?</I> I answer, 
 
 (1.) We are 
 sure God did them no wrong. He is the 
 sovereign Lord of all life, for he is the sole 
 fountain and author of it. He that made 
 them as he pleased might unmake them when 
 he pleased; and who shall say unto him, 
 <I>What doest thou?</I> May he not do what he 
 will with his own, which were created for his 
 pleasure? 
 
 (2.) God did admirably serve the 
 purposes of his own glory by their destruction, 
 as well as by their creation. Herein his 
 holiness and justice were greatly magnified; 
 by this it appears that he hates sin, and is 
 highly displeased with sinners, when even the 
 inferior creatures, because they are the servants 
 of man and part of his possession, and 
 because they have been abused to be the servants 
 of sin, are destroyed with him. This 

 <A NAME="Page63"> </A>

 makes the judgment the more remarkable, 
 the more dreadful, and, consequently, the 
 more expressive of God's wrath and vengeance. 
 The destruction of the creatures was 
 their deliverance from the bondage of corruption, 
 which deliverance the whole creation 
 now groans after, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21,22">Rom. viii. 21, 22</A>.
 It was 
 likewise an instance of God's wisdom. As 
 the creatures were made for man when he 
 was made, so they were multiplied for him 
 when he was multiplied; and therefore, now 
 that mankind was reduced to so small a 
 number, it was fit that the beasts should proportionably 
 be reduced, otherwise they would 
 have had the dominion, and would have replenished 
 the earth, and the remnant of mankind 
 that was left would have been overpowered 
 by them. See how God considered 
 this in another case, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29">Exod. xxiii. 29</A>,
 <I>Lest the 
 beast of the field multiply against thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. All the men, women, and children, that 
 were in the world (except that were in the 
 ark) died. <I>Every man</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>
 and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 and perhaps they were as many as are now upon 
 the face of the earth, if not more. Now, 
 
 (1.) We may easily imagine what terror and 
 consternation seized on them when they saw 
 themselves surrounded. Our Saviour tells 
 us that till the very day that the flood came 
 they were <I>eating and drinking</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26,27">Luke xvii. 26, 27</A>);
 they were drowned in security and sensuality 
 before they were drowned in those 
 waters, crying <I>Peace, peace,</I> to themselves, 
 deaf and blind to all divine warnings. In 
 this posture death surprised them, as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:16,17">1 Sam. xxx. 16, 17</A>.
 But O what an amazement were 
 they in then! Now they see and feel that 
 which they would not believe and fear, and 
 are convinced of their folly when it is too 
 late; now they find no place for repentance, 
 though they seek it carefully with tears. 
 
 (2.) We may suppose that they tried all ways 
 and means possible for their preservation, but 
 all in vain. Some climb to the tops of trees 
 or mountains, and spin out their terrors there 
 awhile. But the flood reaches them, at last, 
 and they are forced to die with the more 
 deliberation. Some, it is likely, cling to the 
 ark, and now hope that this may be their 
 safety which they had so long made their 
 sport. Perhaps some get to the top of the 
 ark, and hope to shift for themselves there; 
 but either they perish there for want of food, 
 or, by a speedier despatch, a dash of rain 
 washes them off that deck. Others, it may 
 be, hoped to prevail with Noah for admission 
 into the ark, and pleaded old acquaintance, 
 <I>Have we not eaten and drunk in thy presence? 
 Hast thou not taught in our streets?</I> "Yes," 
 might Noah say, "that I have, many a time, 
 to little purpose. <I>I called but you refused; 
 you set at nought all my counsel</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24,25">Prov. i. 24, 25</A>),
 and now it is not in my power to help 
 you: God has shut the door, and I cannot 
 open it." Thus it will be at the great day. 
 Neither climbing high in an outward profession, 
 nor claiming relation to good people, 
 will bring men to heaven, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,25:8-9">Matt. vii. 22; xxv. 8, 9</A>.
 Those that are not found in Christ, 
 the ark, are certainly undone, undone for 
 ever; salvation itself cannot save them. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:3">Isa. x. 3</A>.

 (3.) We may suppose that some 
 of those that perished in the deluge had 
 themselves assisted Noah, or were employed 
 by him, in the building of the ark, and yet 
 were not so wise as by repentance to secure 
 themselves a place in it. Thus wicked ministers, 
 though they may have been instrumental 
 to help others to heaven, will themselves 
 be thrust down to hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now pause awhile and consider this 
 tremendous judgment! Let our hearts meditate 
 terror, the terror of this destruction. 
 Let us see, and say, <I>It is a fearful thing to 
 fall into the hands of the living God; who can 
 stand before him when he is angry?</I> Let us 
 see and say, <I>It is an evil thing, and a bitter, 
 to depart from God.</I> The sin of sinners will, 
 without repentance, be their ruin, first or last; 
 if God be true, it will. <I>Though hand join in 
 hand, yet the wicked shall not go unpunished.</I> 
 The righteous God knows how to bring a 
 flood upon the world of the ungodly, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5">2 Pet. ii. 5</A>.
 Eliphaz appeals to this story as a standing 
 warning to a careless world 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:15,16">Job xxii. 15, 16</A>),
 <I>Hast thou marked the old way, which 
 wicked men have trodden, who were cut down 
 out of time,</I> and sent into eternity, <I>whose 
 foundation was overflown with the flood?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The special preservation of Noah and 
 his family: <I>Noah only remained alive, and 
 those that were with him in the ark,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. Noah lives. When all about him 
 were monuments of justice, thousands falling 
 on his right hand and ten thousands on his 
 left, he was a monument of mercy. Only 
 with his eyes might he <I>behold and see the 
 reward of the wicked,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:7,8">Ps. xci. 7, 8</A>.
 <I>In the 
 floods of great waters, they did not come nigh 
 him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:6">Ps. xxxii. 6</A>.
 We have reason to think 
 that, while the long-suffering of God waited, 
 Noah not only preached to, but prayed for, 
 that wicked world, and would have turned 
 away the wrath; but his prayers return into 
 his own bosom, and are answered only in his 
 own escape, which is plainly referred to, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>,
 <I>Noah, Daniel, and Job, shall 
 but deliver their own souls.</I> A mark of honour 
 shall be set on intercessors. 
 
 2. He but lives. 
 Noah remains alive, and this is all; he is, in 
 effect, buried alive--cooped up in a close 
 place, alarmed with the terrors of the descending 
 rain, the increasing flood, and the 
 shrieks and outcries of his perishing neighbours, 
 his heart overwhelmed with melancholy 
 thoughts of the desolations made. But 
 he comforts himself with this, that he is in 
 the way of duty and in the way of deliverance. 
 And we are taught 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:4,5">Jer. xlv. 4, 5</A>)
 that when desolating judgments are abroad 
 we must not seek great nor pleasant things 
 to ourselves, but reckon it an unspeakable 
 favour if we have our lives given us for a 
 prey.</P>
