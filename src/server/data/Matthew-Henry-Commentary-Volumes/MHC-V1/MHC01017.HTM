 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter contains articles of agreement covenanted and concluded 
 upon between the great Jehovah, the Father of mercies, 
 on the one part, and pious Abram, the father of the faithful, on 
 the other part. Abram is therefore called "the friend of God,"
 not only because he was the man of his counsel, but because he 
 was the man of his covenant; both these secrets were with him. 
 Mention was made of this covenant
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18"><I>ch.</I> xv. 18</A>), 
 but here it is 
 particularly drawn up, and put into the form of a covenant, that 
 Abram might have strong consolation. Here are, 
 
 I. The circumstances 
 of the making of this covenant, the time and manner
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">ver. 1</A>),
 and the posture Abram was in,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:3">ver. 3</A>.
 
 II. The covenant 
 itself. In the general scope of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">ver. 1</A>.
 And, afterwards, 
 in the particular instances. 
 
 1. That he should be the father of 
 many nations
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:4,6">ver. 4, 6</A>),
 and, in token of this, his name was 
 changed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:5">ver. 5</A>.
 
 2. That God would be a God to him and his 
 seed, and would give them the land of Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.
 And the seal of this part of the covenant was circumcision,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.
 
 3. That he should have a son by Sarai, and, in token thereof, 
 her name was changed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.
 This promise Abram received,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17">ver. 17</A>.
 And his request for Ishmael, 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:18">ver. 18</A>)
 was answered, 
 abundantly to his satisfaction, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.
 
 III. The 
 circumcision of Abram and his family, according to God's appointment, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:23-27">ver. 23</A>,
 &c.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when Abram was ninety
 years old and nine, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 appeared to Abram, and said unto
 him, I <I>am</I> the Almighty God; walk
 before me, and be thou perfect.
 &nbsp; 2 And I will make my covenant between
 me and thee, and will multiply 
 thee exceedingly.
 &nbsp; 3 And Abram fell
 on his face: and God talked with 
 him, saying,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The time when God made Abram 
 this gracious visit: <I>When he was ninety-nine 
 years old,</I> full thirteen years after the birth of 
 Ishmael. 
 
 1. So long, it should seem, God's 
 extraordinary appearances to Abram were 
 intermitted; and all the communion he had 
 with God was only in the usual way of ordinances
 and providences. Note, There are
 some special comforts which are not the 
 daily bread, no, not of the best saints, but 
 they are favoured with them now and then. 
 On this side heaven they have convenient 
 food, but not a continual feast. 
 
 2. So long 
 the promise of Isaac was deferred. 
 
 (1.) Perhaps 
 to correct Abram's over-hasty marrying 
 of Hagar. Note, The comforts we sinfully 
 anticipate are justly delayed. 
 
 (2.) That 
 Abram and Sarai being so far stricken in age 
 God's power, in this matter, might be the 
 more magnified, and their faith the more 
 tried. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36,Joh+11:6,15">Deut. xxxii. 36; John xi. 6, 15</A>.

 (3.) That a child so long waited for might be 
 an <I>Isaac, a son indeed,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The way in which God made this covenant 
 with him: <I>The Lord appeared to Abram,</I> 
 in the <I>shechinah,</I> some visible display of God's 
 immediate glorious presence with him. Note, 
 God first makes himself known to us, and 
 gives us a sight of him by faith, and then 
 takes us into his covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The posture Abram put himself into 
 upon this occasion: <I>He fell on his face while 
 God talked with him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 1. As one overcome 
 by the brightness of the divine glory, 
 and unable to bear the sight of it, though he 
 had seen it several times before. Daniel and 
 John did likewise, though they were also acquainted 
 with the visions of the Almighty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:17,10:9,15,Re+1:17">Dan. viii. 17; x. 9, 15; Rev. i. 17</A>.
 Or,

 2. As one ashamed of himself, and blushing to 
 think of the honours done to one so unworthy. 
 He looks upon himself with humility, 
 and upon God with reverence, and, in 
 token of both, <I>falls on his face,</I> putting himself 
 into a posture of adoration. Note, 
 
 (1.) God graciously condescends to talk with 
 those whom he takes into covenant and 
 communion with himself. He talks with 
 them by his <I>word,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:22">Prov. vi. 22</A>.
 He talks 
 with them by his <I>Spirit,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>.
 This honour have all his saints. 
 
 (2.) Those that 
 are admitted into fellowship with God are, 
 and must be, very humble and very reverent 
 in their approaches to him. If we say we 
 have fellowship with him, and the familiarity 
 breeds contempt, we deceive ourselves. 
 
 (3.) Those that would receive comfort from God 
 must set themselves to give glory to God 
 and to worship at his footstool.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The general scope and summary of 
 the covenant laid down as the foundation on 
 which all the rest was built; it is no other 
 than the covenant of grace still made with 
 all believers in Jesus Christ,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What we may expect to find God to us: 
 <I>I am the Almighty God.</I> By this name he 
 chose to make himself known to Abram 
 rather than by his name <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>.
 He used it to Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:3,43:14,48:3"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 3; xliii. 14; xlviii. 3</A>.
 It is the name of God that is 
 mostly used throughout the book of Job, 
 at least in the <I>discourses</I> of that book. 
 After Moses, <I>Jehovah</I> is more frequently 
 used, and this, <I>El-shaddai,</I> very rarely; it 
 bespeaks the almighty power of God, either, 
 
 (1.) As an avenger, from
 <B><I>sdh</I></B> <I>he laid 
 waste,</I> so some; and they think God took 
 this title from the destruction of the old 
 world. This is countenanced by 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:6">Isa. xiii. 6</A>,
 and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:15">Joel i. 15</A>.
 Or, (2.) As a benefactor <B><I>s</I></B> for
 <B><I>asr</I></B> <I>who,</I> and <B><I>dy</I></B> <I>sufficient.</I> He is a God 
 that is enough; or, as our old English translation 
 reads it here very significantly, <I>I am 
 God all-sufficient.</I> Note, The God with whom 
 we have to do is a God <I>that is enough.</I> 
 
 [1.] He is enough in himself; he is self-sufficient; 
 he has every thing, and he needs not any 
 thing. 
 
 [2.] He is enough to us, if we be in 
 covenant with him: we have all in him, and 
 we have enough in him, enough to satisfy 
 our most enlarged desires, enough to supply 
 the defect of every thing else, and to secure 
 to us a happiness for our immortal souls. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5,6,73:25">Ps. xvi. 5, 6; lxxiii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What God requires that we should be 
 to him. The covenant is mutual: <I>Walk 

 <A NAME="Page111"> </A>

 before me, and be thou perfect,</I> that is, upright 
 and sincere; for herein the covenant of grace 
 is well-ordered that sincerity is our gospel 
 perfection. Observe, 
 
 (1.) That to be religious 
 is to walk before God in our integrity; 
 it is to set God always before us, and to 
 think, and speak, and act, in every thing, as 
 those that are always under his eye. It is 
 to have a constant regard to his word as our 
 rule and to his glory as our end in all our 
 actions, and to be continually in his fear. It 
 is to be <I>inward with him,</I> in all the duties of 
 religious worship, for in them particularly we 
 walk before God 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>),
 and to be 
 <I>entire for him,</I> in all holy conversation. I 
 know no religion but sincerity. 
 
 (2.) That 
 upright walking with God is the condition of 
 our interest in his all-sufficiency. If we neglect 
 him, or dissemble with him, we forfeit 
 the benefit and comfort of our relation to 
 him. 
 
 (3.) A continual regard to God's all-sufficiency 
 will have a great influence upon 
 our upright walking with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 As for me, behold, my covenant 
 <I>is</I> with thee, and thou shalt be a father 
 of many nations.
 &nbsp; 5 Neither
 shall thy name any more be called 
 Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; 
 for a father of many nations 
 have I made thee.
 &nbsp; 6 And I will
 make thee exceeding fruitful, and I 
 will make nations of thee, and kings 
 shall come out of thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The promise here is introduced with solemnity: 
 "<I>As for me,</I>" says the great God, 
 "behold, behold and admire it, behold and 
 be assured of it, my covenant is with thee;" 
 as before
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 <I>I will make my covenant.</I> 
 Note, The covenant of grace is a covenant 
 of God's own making; this he glories in 
 (<I>as for me</I>), and so may we. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is promised to Abraham that he 
 should be a <I>father of many nations;</I> that is, 
 
 1. That his seed after the flesh should be 
 very numerous, both in Isaac and Ishmael, 
 as well as in the sons of Keturah: something 
 extraordinary is doubtless included in 
 this promise, and we may suppose that the 
 event answered to it, and that there have 
 been, and are, more of the children of men 
 descended from Abraham than from any one 
 man at an equal distance with him from 
 Noah, the common root. 
 
 2. That all believers 
 in every age should be looked upon 
 as his spiritual seed, and that he should be 
 called, not only <I>the friend of God,</I> but <I>the 
 father of the faithful.</I> In this sense the 
 apostle directs us to understand this promise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:16,17">Rom. iv. 16, 17</A>.
 He is the father of 
 those in every nation that by faith enter into 
 covenant with God, and (as the Jewish 
 writers express it) <I>are gathered under the 
 wings of the divine Majesty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In token of this his name was changed 
 from <I>Abram, a high father,</I> to <I>Abraham, the 
 father of a multitude.</I> This was, 
 
 1. To put 
 an honour upon him. It is spoken of as the 
 glory of the church that she shall be <I>called 
 by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord 
 shall name,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:2">Isa. lxii. 2</A>.
 Princes dignify their 
 favourites by conferring new titles upon 
 them; thus was Abraham dignified by him 
 that is indeed the fountain of honour. All 
 believers have a new name, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:17">Rev. ii. 17</A>.
 Some think it added to the honour of Abraham's 
 new name that a letter of the name 
 <I>Jehovah</I> was inserted into it, as it was a disgrace 
 to Jeconiah to have the first syllable of 
 his name cut off, because it was the same 
 as the first syllable of the sacred name, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:28">Jer. xxii. 28</A>.
 Believers are named from 
 Christ, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15">Eph. iii. 15</A>.

 2. To encourage and 
 confirm the faith of Abraham. While he 
 was childless perhaps even his own name 
 was sometimes an occasion of grief to him: 
 why should he be called a high father who 
 was not a father at all? But now that God 
 had promised him a numerous issue, and had 
 given him a name which signified so much, 
 that name was his joy. Note, God calls things 
 that are not as though they were. It is the 
 apostle's observation upon this very thing, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17">Rom. iv. 17</A>.
 He called Abraham <I>the father 
 of a multitude</I> because he should prove to be 
 so in due time, though as yet he had but one 
 child.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And I will establish my covenant 
 between me and thee and thy seed 
 after thee in their generations for an 
 everlasting covenant, to be a God 
 unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And I will give unto thee, and to
 thy seed after thee, the land wherein 
 thou art a stranger, all the land of 
 Canaan, for an everlasting possession; 
 and I will be their God.
 &nbsp; 9 And God
 said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep 
 my covenant therefore, thou, and thy 
 seed after thee in their generations.
 &nbsp; 10 This <I>is</I> my covenant, which ye
 shall keep, between me and you and 
 thy seed after thee; Every man child 
 among you shall be circumcised.
 &nbsp; 11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of
 your foreskin; and it shall be a token 
 of the covenant betwixt me and you.
 &nbsp; 12 And he that is eight days old
 shall be circumcised among you, every 
 man child in your generations, he 
 that is born in the house, or bought 
 with money of any stranger, 
 which <I>is</I> not of thy seed.
 &nbsp; 13 He that is
 born in thy house, and he that is 
 bought with thy money, must needs 

 <A NAME="Page112"> </A>

 be circumcised: and my covenant 
 shall be in your flesh for an everlasting 
 covenant.
 &nbsp; 14 And the uncircumcised
 man child whose flesh of 
 his foreskin is not circumcised, that 
 soul shall be cut off from his people;
 he hath broken my covenant.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The continuance of the covenant, 
 intimated in three things:--
 
 1. It is 
 established; not to be altered nor revoked. 
 It is fixed, it is ratified, it is made as firm as 
 the divine power and truth can make it. 
 
 2. It is entailed; it is a covenant, not with 
 Abraham only (then it would die with him), 
 but with his seed after him, not only his 
 seed after the flesh, but his spiritual seed. 
 
 3. It is everlasting in the evangelical sense 
 and meaning of it. The covenant of grace 
 is everlasting. It is from everlasting in the counsels 
 of it, and to everlasting in the consequences 
 of it; and the external administration 
 of it is transmitted with the seal of it 
 to the seed of believers, and the internal administration 
 of it by the Spirit of Christ's 
 seed in every age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The contents of the covenant: it is a 
 covenant of promises, exceedingly great and 
 precious promises. Here are two which 
 indeed are all-sufficient:--
 
 1. That God 
 would be their God,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 All the privileges 
 of the covenant, all its joys and all its
 hopes, are summed up in this. A man needs 
 desire no more than this to make him happy. 
 What God is himself, that he will be to his 
 people: his wisdom theirs, to guide and counsel 
 them; his power theirs, to protect and 
 support them; his goodness theirs, to supply
 and comfort them. What faithful worshippers 
 can expect from the God they serve believers 
 shall find in God as theirs. This is 
 enough, yet not all. 
 
 2. That Canaan should 
 be their everlasting possession,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 God had before promised this land to Abraham 
 and his seed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18"><I>ch.</I> xv. 18</A>.
 But here, where it 
 is promised for an everlasting possession, 
 surely it must be looked upon as a type of 
 heaven's happiness, that everlasting rest 
 which remains for the people of God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:9">Heb. iv. 9</A>.
 This is that better country to which 
 Abraham had an eye, and the grant of which 
 was that which answered to the vast extent 
 and compass of that promise, that God 
 would be to them a God; so that, if God had 
 not prepared and designed this, he would 
 have been ashamed to be called their God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>.
 As the land of Canaan was secured 
 to the seed of Abraham according to 
 the flesh, so heaven is secured to all his 
 spiritual seed, by a covenant, and for a possession, 
 truly everlasting. The offer of this 
 eternal life is made in the word, and confirmed 
 by the sacraments, to all that are 
 under the external administration of the 
 covenant; and the earnest of it is given to 
 all believers, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:14">Eph. i. 14</A>.
 Canaan is here said 
 to be the land wherein Abraham was a 
 stranger; and the heavenly Canaan is a land 
 to which we are strangers, for it does not yet 
 appear what we shall be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The token of the covenant, and that 
 is circumcision, for the sake of which the covenant 
 is itself called the <I>covenant of circumcision,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:8">Acts vii. 8</A>.
 It is here said to be the 
 covenant which Abraham and his seed must 
 keep, as a copy or counterpart, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 It is called a sign and seal 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11">Rom. iv. 11</A>),
 for it was, 
 
 1. A confirmation to Abraham and 
 his seed of those promises which were God's 
 part of the covenant, assuring them that they
 should be fulfilled, that in due time Canaan 
 would be theirs: and the continuance of 
 this ordinance, after Canaan was theirs, intimates 
 that these promises looked further 
 to another Canaan, which they must still be 
 in expectation of. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:8">Heb. iv. 8</A>.

 2. An obligation upon Abraham and his seed to
 that duty which was their part of the covenant; 
 not only to the duty of accepting the 
 covenant and consenting to it, and putting 
 away the corruption of the flesh (which were 
 more immediately and primarily signified by 
 circumcision), but, in general, to the observance 
 of all God's commands, as they 
 should at any time hereafter be intimated 
 and made known to them; for circumcision 
 made men <I>debtors to do the whole law,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:3">Gal. v. 3</A>.
 Those who will have God to be to 
 them a God must consent and resolve to be 
 to him a people. Now, 
 
 (1.) Circumcision 
 was a bloody ordinance; for all things by 
 the law were purged with blood, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:8">Exod. xxiv. 8</A>.
 But, the blood of Christ 
 being shed, all bloody ordinances are now 
 abolished; circumcision therefore gives way 
 to baptism. 
 
 (2.) It was peculiar to the males, 
 though the women were also included in 
 the covenant, for the man is the head of the 
 woman. In our kingdom, the oath of allegiance 
 is required only from men. Some 
 think that the blood of the males only was 
 shed in circumcision because respect was 
 had in it to Jesus Christ and his blood. 
 
 (3.) It was the flesh of the foreskin that 
 was to be cut off, because it is by ordinary 
 generation that sin is propagated, and with an 
 eye to the promised seed, who was to 
 come from the loins of Abraham. Christ 
 having not yet offered himself to us, God 
 would have man to enter into covenant 
 by the offering of some part of his own body, 
 and no part could be better spared. It is a 
 secret part of the body; for the true circumcision 
 is that of the heart: this honour God 
 put upon an uncomely part, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:23,24">1 Cor. xii. 23, 24</A>.

 (4.) The ordinance was to be administered 
 to children when they were eight days 
 old, and not sooner, that they might gather 
 some strength, to be able to undergo the 
 pain of it, and that at least one sabbath 
 might pass over them. 
 
 (5.) The children 
 of the strangers, of whom the master of the 
 family was the true domestic owner, were to 
 
 <A NAME="Page112"> </A>

 be circumcised
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),
 which looked favourably 
 upon the Gentiles, who should in
 due time be brought into the family of Abraham, 
 by faith. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.

 (6.) The 
 religious observance of this institution was 
 required under a very severe penalty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 The contempt of circumcision was a contempt 
 of the covenant; if the parents did 
 not circumcise their children, it was at their 
 peril, as in the case of Moses, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:24,25">Exod. iv. 24, 25</A>.
 With respect to those that were not 
 circumcised in their infancy, if, when they 
 grew up, they did not themselves come under 
 this ordinance, God would surely reckon 
 with them. If they cut not off the flesh of 
 their foreskin, God would cut them off from 
 their people. It is a dangerous thing to 
 make light of divine institutions, and to live 
 in the neglect of them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And God said unto Abraham, 
 As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
 not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <I>shall</I> 
 her name <I>be.</I>
 &nbsp; 16 And I will bless 
 her, and give thee a son also of her: 
 yea, I will bless her, and she shall be 
 <I>a mother</I> of nations; kings of people 
 shall be of her.
 &nbsp; 17 Then Abraham fell 
 upon his face, and laughed, and 
 said in his heart, Shall <I>a child</I> be 
 born unto him that is a hundred
 years old? and shall Sarah, that is 
 ninety years old, bear?
 &nbsp; 18 And 
 Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael 
 might live before thee!
 &nbsp; 19 And 
 God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear 
 thee a son indeed; and thou shalt 
 call his name Isaac: and I will establish 
 my covenant with him for an 
 everlasting covenant, <I>and</I> with his
 seed after him.
 &nbsp; 20 And as for Ishmael, 
 I have heard thee: Behold, I 
 have blessed him, and will make him 
 fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; 
 twelve princes shall he beget, 
 and I will make him a great nation.
 &nbsp; 21 But my covenant will I 
 establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall 
 bear unto thee at this set time in the 
 next year.
 &nbsp; 22 And he left off talking 
 with him, and God went up from
 Abraham.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The promise made to Abraham 
 of a son by <I>Sarai,</I> that son in whom the 
 promise made to him should be fulfilled, 
 that he should be the father of many nations; 
 for <I>she also shall be a mother of nations, and 
 kings of people shall be of her,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 Note, 
 
 1. God reveals the purposes of his good-will 
 to his people by degrees. God had told 
 Abraham long before that he should have a 
 son, but never till now that he should have 
 a son by <I>Sarai.</I> 
 
 2. The blessing of the 
 Lord makes fruitful, and adds no sorrow 
 with it, no such sorrow as was in Hagar's 
 case. "I will bless her with the blessing of 
 fruitfulness, and then thou shalt have a son 
 of her." 
 
 3. Civil government and order are 
 a great blessing to the church. It is promised, 
 not only that <I>people,</I> but <I>kings of 
 people,</I> should be of her; not a headless rout, 
 but a well-modelled well-governed society.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ratification of this promise was 
 the change of <I>Sarai's</I> name into <I>Sarah</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 the same letter being added to her name 
 that was to Abraham's, and for the same reasons. 
 <I>Sarai</I> signifies <I>my princess,</I> as if her 
 honour were confined to one family only. 
 <I>Sarah</I> signifies <I>a princess</I>--namely, of <I>multitudes,</I> 
 or signifying that from her should 
 come the Messiah the prince, even the prince 
 of the kings of the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abraham's joyful, thankful, entertainment 
 of this gracious promise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 Upon this occasion he expressed, 
 
 1. Great 
 humility: He <I>fell on his face.</I> Note, The 
 more honours and favours God confers upon 
 us the lower we should be in our own eyes, 
 and the more reverent and submissive before 
 God. 
 
 2. Great joy: He <I>laughed.</I> It 
 was a laughter of delight, not of distrust. 
 Note, Even the promises of a holy God, as 
 well as his performances, are the joys of 
 holy souls; there is the joy of faith as well 
 as the joy of fruition. Now it was that Abraham 
 rejoiced to see Christ's day. Now he 
 saw it and was glad 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">John viii. 56</A>);
 for, as 
 he saw heaven in the promise of Canaan, so 
 he saw Christ in the promise of Isaac. 
 
 3. Great admiration: <I>Shall a child be born to 
 him that is a hundred years old?</I> He does 
 not here speak of it as at all doubtful (for 
 we are sure that <I>he staggered not at the promise,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:20">Rom. iv. 20</A>),
 but as very wonderful 
 and that which could not be effected but by 
 the almighty power of God, and as very <I>kind,</I> 
 and a favour which was the more affecting 
 and obliging for this, that it was extremely 
 surprising,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1,2">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Abraham's prayer for Ishmael: <I>O 
 that Ishmael might live before thee!</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 This he speaks, not as desiring that Ishmael 
 might be preferred before the son he 
 should have by Sarah; but, dreading lest he 
 should be abandoned and forsaken of God, 
 he puts up this petition on his behalf. Now 
 that God is talking with him he thinks he 
 has a very fair opportunity to speak a good 
 word for Ishmael, and he will not let it slip. 
 Note, 
 
 1. Though we ought not to prescribe 
 to God, yet he gives us leave, in prayer, to 
 be humbly free with him, and particular in 
 making known our requests, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Phil. iv. 6</A>.
 Whatever is the matter of our care and fear 
 should be spread before God in prayer. 
 
 2. It is the duty of parents to pray for their 
 children, for all their children, as Job, who 

 <A NAME="Page114"> </A>

 offered burnt offerings according to the number 
 of them all, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">Job i. 5</A>.
 Abraham would 
 not have it thought that, when God promised 
 him a son by Sarah, which he so 
 much desired, then his son by Hagar was 
 forgotten; no, still he bears him upon his
 heart, and shows a concern for him. The 
 prospect of further favours must not make us 
 unmindful of former favours. 
 
 3. The great 
 thing we should desire of God for our children 
 is that they may live before him, that 
 is, that they may be kept in covenant with 
 him, and may have grace to walk before him in 
 their uprightness. Spiritual blessings are the 
 best blessings, and those for which we should 
 be most earnest with God, both for ourselves 
 and others. Those live well that live before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God's answer to his prayer; and it is 
 an answer of peace. Abraham could not say 
 that he sought God's face in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Common blessings are secured to Ishmael
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20)</A>:
 <I>As for Ishmael,</I> whom thou art 
 in so much care about, <I>I have heard thee;</I> 
 he shall find favour for thy sake; <I>I have 
 blessed him,</I> that is, I have many blessings in 
 store for him. 
 
 (1.) His posterity shall be 
 numerous: <I>I will multiply him exceedingly,</I> 
 more than his neighbours. This is the fruit 
 of the blessing, as that,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>.
 
 (2.) They 
 shall be considerable: <I>Twelve princes shall 
 he beget.</I> We may charitably hope that 
 spiritual blessings also were bestowed upon 
 him, though the visible church was not 
 brought out of his loins and the covenant 
 was not lodged in his family. Note, Great 
 plenty of outward good things is often given 
 to those children of godly parents who are 
 born after the flesh, for their parents' sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Covenant blessings are reserved for 
 Isaac, and appropriated to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:19,21"><I>v.</I> 19, 21</A>.
 If Abraham, in his prayer for Ishmael, meant 
 that he would have the covenant made with 
 him, and the promised seed to come from 
 him, then God did not answer him in the 
 letter, but in that which was equivalent, nay, 
 which was every way better. 
 
 (1.) God repeats 
 to him the promise of a son by Sarah: 
 <I>She shall bear thee a son indeed.</I> Note, Even 
 true believers need to have God's promises 
 doubled and repeated to them, that they may 
 have strong consolation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:18">Heb. vi. 18</A>.
 Again, Children of the promise are children indeed. 
 
 (2.) He names that child--calls him <I>Isaac, 
 laughter,</I> because Abraham rejoiced in spirit 
 when this son was promised him. Note, If 
 God's promises be our joy, his mercies promised 
 shall in due time be our <I>exceeding</I> joy. 
 Christ will be laughter to those that look for 
 him; those that now rejoice in hope shall 
 shortly rejoice in having that which they 
 hope for: this is laughter that is not mad. 
 
 (3.) He entails the covenant upon that child: 
 <I>I will establish my covenant with him.</I> Note, 
 God takes whom he pleases into covenant 
 with himself, according to the good pleasure 
 of his will. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:8,18">Rom. ix. 8, 18</A>.
 Thus was 
 the covenant settled between God and Abraham, 
 with its several limitations and remainders, 
 and then the conference ended: <I>God 
 left off talking with him,</I> and the vision disappeared, 
 <I>God went up from Abraham.</I> Note, 
 Our communion with God here is broken 
 and interrupted; in heaven it will be a 
 continual and everlasting feast.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And Abraham took Ishmael his 
 son, and all that were born in his 
 house, and all that were bought with 
 his money, every male among the 
 men of Abraham's house; and circumcised 
 the flesh of their foreskin 
 in the selfsame day, as God had said 
 unto him.
 &nbsp; 24 And Abraham <I>was</I> 
 ninety years old and nine, when he 
 was circumcised in the flesh of his 
 foreskin.
 &nbsp; 25 And Ishmael his son 
 <I>was</I> thirteen years old, when he was
 circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
 &nbsp; 26 In the selfsame day was 
 Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael 
 his son.
 &nbsp; 27 And all the men of his 
 house, born in the house, and bought
 with money of the stranger, were circumcised 
 with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Abraham's obedience to the 
 law of circumcision. He himself and all his 
 family were circumcised, so receiving the 
 token of the covenant and distinguishing 
 themselves from other families, that had no 
 part nor lot in the matter. 
 
 1. It was an implicit 
 obedience: He did <I>as God had said to 
 him,</I> and did not ask why or wherefore. 
 God's will was not only a law to him, but a 
 reason; he did it because God told him. 
 
 2. It was a speedy obedience: <I>In the self-same 
 day,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:23,26"><I>v.</I> 23, 26</A>.
 Sincere obedience is not 
 dilatory, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:60">Ps. cxix. 60</A>.
 While the command 
 is yet sounding in our ears, and the sense of 
 duty is fresh, it is good to apply ourselves to 
 it immediately, lest we deceive ourselves by 
 putting it off to a more convenient season. 
 
 3. It was a universal obedience: He did not 
 circumcise his family and excuse himself, 
 but set them an example; nor did he take 
 the comfort of the seal of the covenant to 
 himself only, but desired that all his might 
 share with him in it. This is a good example 
 to masters of families; they and their 
 houses must serve the Lord. Though God's 
 covenant was not established with Ishmael, 
 yet he was circumcised; for children of believing 
 parents, as such, have a right to the 
 privileges of the visible church, and the seals 
 of the covenant, whatever they may prove 
 afterwards. Ishmael is blessed, and therefore 
 circumcised. 
 
 4. Abraham did this 
 though much might be objected against it. 
 Though circumcision was painful,--though 
 to grown men it was shameful,--though, 
 while they were sore and unfit for action, 
 
 <A NAME="Page115"> </A>

 their enemies might take advantage against 
 them, as Simeon and Levi did against the 
 Shechemites,--though Abraham was ninety-nine 
 years old, and had been justified and 
 accepted of God long since,--though so 
 strange a thing done religiously might be 
 turned to his reproach by the Canaanite and 
 the Perizzite that dwelt then in the land,--yet 
 God's command was sufficient to answer 
 these and a thousand such objections: what 
 God requires we must do, not <I>conferring 
 with flesh and blood.</I></P>
