 Two passages of story are recorded in this chapter, 

 I. The watering of the host of Israel. 

 1. In the wilderness they wanted water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. In their want they chided Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 3. Moses cried to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:4">ver. 4</A>.

 4. God ordered him to smite the rock, and fetch water out of that; 
 Moses did so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 5. The place named from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7">ver. 7</A>.

 II. The defeating of the host of Amalek. 

 1. The victory obtained by the prayer of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 2. By the sword of Joshua, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:13">ver. 13</A>.

 3. A record kept of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14,16">ver. 14, 16</A>.

 And these things which happened to them are written for our instruction
 in our spiritual journey and warfare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
 from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
 the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and pitched in Rephidim: and <I>there
 was</I> no water for the people to drink.
 &nbsp; 2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
 water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye
 with me? wherefore do ye tempt the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
 murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> thou
 hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and
 our cattle with thirst?
 &nbsp; 4 And Moses cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, What shall I do unto
 this people? they be almost ready to stone me.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
 take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
 thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.
 &nbsp; 6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in
 Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water
 out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
 sight of the elders of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
 because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
 they tempted the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Is the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> among us, or not?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The strait that the children of Israel were in for want of water; 
 once before the were in the like distress, and now, a second time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They journeyed <I>according to the commandment of the Lord,</I> led by 
 the pillar of cloud and fire, and yet they came to a place where there 
 was no water for them to drink. Note, We may be in the way of our duty, 
 and yet may meet with troubles, which Providence brings us into for the 
 trial of our faith, and that God may be glorified in our relief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their discontent and distrust in this strait. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 They <I>thirsted there for water.</I> If they had no water to drink, 
 they must needs thirst; but this intimates, not only that they wanted 
 water and felt the inconvenience of that want, but that their passion 
 sharpened their appetites and they were violent and impatient in their 
 desire; their thirst made them outrageous. Natural desires, and those 
 that are most craving, have need to be kept under the check and control 
 of religion and reason. See what was the language of this inordinate 
 desire. 
 
 1. They challenged Moses to supply them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Give us water, that we may drink,</I> demanding it as a debt, and 
 strongly suspecting that he was not able to discharge it. Because they 
 were supplied with bread, they insist upon it that they must be 
 supplied with water too; and indeed to those that by faith and prayer 
 live a life of dependence upon God one favour is an earnest of another, 
 and may be humbly pleaded; but the unthankful and unbelieving have 
 reason to think that the abuse of former favours is the forfeiture of 
 further favours: <I>Let not them think that they shall receive any 
 thing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:7">Jam. i. 7</A>),

 yet they are ready to demand every thing. 

 2. They quarrelled with him for bringing them out of Egypt, as if,
 instead of delivering them, he designed to murder them, than which 
 nothing could be more base and invidious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Many that have not only designed well, but done well, for their 
 generation, have had their best services thus misconstrued, and their 
 patience thereby tried, by unthinking unthankful people. To such a 
 degree their malice against Moses rose that they were <I>almost ready 
 to stone him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>Many good works he had shown them;</I> and for which of these would 
 they stone him? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>.

 Ungoverned passions, provoked by the crossing of unbridled appetites,
 sometimes make men guilty of the greatest absurdities, and act like 
 madmen, that cast firebrands, arrows, and death, among their best 
 friends. 

 3. They began to question whether God were with them or not: They 
 <I>tempted the Lord, saying, "Is the Lord among us or not?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Is Jehovah among us by that name by which he made himself known to us 
 in Egypt?" They question his essential presence--whether there was a 
 God or not; his common providence--whether that God governed the world; 
 and his special promise--whether he would be as good as his word to 
 them. This is called their <I>tempting God,</I> which signifies, not 
 only a distrust of God in general, but a distrust of him after they had 
 received such proofs of his power and goodness, for the confirmation of 
 his promise. They do, in effect, suppose that Moses was an impostor,
 Aaron a deceiver, the pillar of cloud and fire a mere sham and 
 illusion, which imposed upon their senses, that long series of miracles 
 which had rescued them, served them, and fed them, a chain of cheats, 
 and the promise of Canaan a banter upon them; it was all so, if <I>the 
 Lord was not among them.</I> Note, It is a great provocation to God for 
 us to question his presence, providence, or promise, especially for his 
 Israel to do it, who are so peculiarly bound to trust him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The course that Moses took, when he was thus set upon, and 
 insulted. 
 
 1. He reproved the murmurers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Why chide you with me?</I> Observe how mildly he answered them; it 
 was well that he was a man of extraordinary meekness, else their 
 tumultuous conduct would have made him lose the possession of himself: 
 it is folly to answer passion with passion, for that makes bad worse; 
 but <I>soft answers turn away wrath.</I> He showed them whom their 
 murmurings reflected upon, and that the reproaches they cast on him 
 fell on God himself: <I>You tempt the Lord;</I> that is, "By 
 distrusting his power, you try his patience, and so provoke his wrath." 

 2. He made his complaint to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Moses cried unto the Lord.</I> This servant came, and showed his 
 Lord all these things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21">Luke xiv. 21</A>.

 When men unjustly censure us and quarrel with us, it will be a great
 relief to us to go to God, and by prayer lay the case before him and 
 leave it with him: if men will not hear us, God will; if their bad 
 conduct towards us ruffle our spirits, God's consolations will compose 
 them. Moses begs of God to direct him what he should do, for he was 
 utterly at a loss; he could not of himself either supply their want or 
 pacify their tumult; God only could do it. He pleads his own peril: 
 "<I>They are almost ready to stone me;</I> Lord, if thou hast any 
 regard to the life of thy poor servant, interpose now."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God's gracious appearance for their relief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 He orders Moses to go on before the people, and venture himself in his 
 post, though they spoke of stoning him. He must take his rod with him, 
 not (as God might justly have ordered) to summon some plague or other 
 to chastise them for their distrust and murmuring, but to fetch water 
 for their supply. O the wonderful patience and forbearance of God 
 towards provoking sinners! He loads those with benefits that make him 
 to serve with their sins, maintains those that are at war with him, and 
 reaches out the hand of his bounty to those that lift up the heel 
 against him. Thus he teaches us, if our enemy hunger, to feed him, and
 if he thirst, as Israel did now, <I>to give him drink,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:20,Mt+5:44,45">Rom. xii. 20; Matt. v. 44, 45</A>.

 Will he fail those that trust him, when he was so liberal even to those
 that tempted him? If God had only shown Moses a fountain of water in 
 the wilderness, as he did Hagar not far hence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:19">Gen. xxi. 19</A>),

 that would have been a great favour; but that he might show his power
 as well as his pity, and make it a miracle of mercy, he gave them water 
 out of a rock. He directed Moses whither to go, and appointed him to 
 take some of the elders of Israel with him, to be witnesses of what was 
 done, that they might themselves be satisfied, and might satisfy 
 others, of the certainty of God's presence with them. He promised to
 meet him there in the cloud of glory (to encourage him), and ordered 
 him to smite the rock; Moses obeyed, and immediately water came out of 
 the rock in great abundance, which ran throughout the camp in streams 
 and rivers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:15,16">Ps. lxxviii. 15, 16</A>),

 and followed them wherever they went in that wilderness: it is called
 <I>a fountain of waters,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:8">Ps. cxiv. 8</A>.

 God showed the care he took of his people in giving them water when
 they wanted it; he showed his power in fetching the water out of a 
 rock; and he put an honour upon Moses in appointing the water to flow 
 out upon his smiting the rock. This fair water, that came out of the 
 rock, is called <I>honey and oil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13">Deut. xxxii. 13</A>),

 because the people's thirst made it doubly pleasant; coming when they
 were in extreme want, it was like honey and oil to them. It is probable 
 that the people digged canals for the conveyance of it, and pools for 
 the reception of it, in like manner as, long afterwards, passing 
 through the valley of Baca, they made it a well,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6,Nu+21:18">Ps. lxxxiv. 6; Num. xxi. 18</A>.

 Let this direct us to live in a dependence, 

 1. Upon God's providence, even in the greatest straits and 
 difficulties. God can open fountains for our supply where we least 
 expect them, <I>waters in the wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:20">Isa. xliii. 20</A>),

 because he makes a <I>way in the wilderness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Those who, in this wilderness, keep to God's way, may trust him to
 provide for them. While we follow the pillar of cloud and fire, surely 
 goodness and mercy shall follow us, like the water out of the rock. 

 2. Upon Christ's grace: <I>That rock was Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:4">1 Cor. x. 4</A>.

 The graces and comforts of the Spirit are compared to <I>rivers of
 living water,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38,39,Joh+4:14">John vii. 38, 39; iv. 14</A>.

 These flow from Christ, who is the rock smitten by the law of Moses,
 for he was made under the law. Nothing will supply the needs, and
 satisfy the desires, of a soul, but water out of this rock, this 
 fountain opened. The pleasures of sense are puddle-water; spiritual 
 delights are rock-water, so pure, so clear, so refreshing--rivers of 
 pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A new name was, upon this occasion, given to the place, preserving 
 the remembrance, not of the mercy of their supply (the water that 
 followed them was sufficient to do that), but of the sin of their 
 murmuring--<I>Massah, temptation,</I> because they tempted God; 
 <I>Meribah, strife,</I> because they chid with Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 There was thus a remembrance kept of sin, both for the disgrace of the 
 sinners themselves (sin leaves a blot upon the name) and for warning to 
 their seed to take heed of sinning after the similitude of their 
 transgression.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
 fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill
 with the rod of God in mine hand.
 &nbsp; 10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
 Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that
 Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek
 prevailed.
 &nbsp; 12 But Moses' hands <I>were</I> heavy; and they took a stone, and
 put <I>it</I> under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed
 up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
 side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
 &nbsp; 13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge
 of the sword.
 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Write this <I>for</I> a memorial in
 a book, and rehearse <I>it</I> in the ears of Joshua: for I will
 utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
 &nbsp; 15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
 Jehovahnissi:
 &nbsp; 16 For he said, Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sworn <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>will have</I> war with Amalek from generation to generation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of the war with Amalek, which, we may suppose, 
 was the first that was recorded in the <I>book of the wars of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:14">Num. xxi. 14</A>.

 Amalek was the first of the nations that Israel fought with,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:20">Num. xxiv. 20</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Amalek's attempt: They <I>came out, and fought with Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The Amalekites were the posterity of Esau, who hated Jacob because of 
 the birthright and blessing, and this was an effort of the hereditary 
 enmity, a malice that ran in the blood, and perhaps was now exasperated 
 by the working of the promise towards an accomplishment. Consider
 this, 

 1. As Israel's affliction. They had been quarrelling with Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and now God sends Amalekites to quarrel with them; wars abroad are the 
 just punishment of strifes and discontents at home.

 2. As Amalek's sin; so it is reckoned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:17,18">Deut. xxv. 17, 18</A>.

 They did not boldly front them as a generous enemy, but without any
 provocation given by Israel, or challenge given to them, basely fell 
 upon their rear, and smote those that were faint and feeble and could 
 neither make resistance nor escape. Herein they bade defiance to that 
 power which had so lately ruined the Egyptians; but in vain did they 
 attack a camp guarded and victualled by miracles: verily they knew not 
 what they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel's engagement with Amalek, in their own necessary defence 
 against the aggressors. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The post assigned to Joshua, of whom this is the first mention: he 
 is nominated commander-in-chief in this expedition, that he might be 
 trained up to the services he was designed for after the death of 
 Moses, and be a <I>man of war from his youth.</I> He is ordered to draw 
 out a detachment of choice men from the thousands of Israel and to 
 drive back the Amalekites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When the Egyptians pursued them Israel must stand still and see what 
 God would do; but now it was required that they should bestir 
 themselves. Note, God is to be trusted in the use of means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The post assumed by Moses: <I>I will stand on the top of the hill 
 with the rod of God in my hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 See how God qualifies his people for, and calls them to, various 
 services for the good of his church: Joshua fights, Moses prays, and 
 both minister to Israel. Moses went up to the top of the hill, and 
 placed himself, probably, so as to be seen by Israel; there he held up 
 <I>the rod of God in his hand,</I> that wonder-working rod which had 
 summoned the plagues of Egypt, and under which Israel had passed out of 
 the house of bondage. This rod Moses held up to Israel, to animate 
 them; the rod was held up as the banner to encourage the soldiers, who 
 might look up, and say, "Yonder is the rod, and yonder the hand that 
 used it, when such glorious things were wrought for us." Note, It tends 
 much to the encouragement of faith to reflect upon the great things God 
 has done for us, and review the monuments of his favours. Moses also 
 held up this rod to God, by way of appeal to him: "Is not the battle 
 the Lord's? Is not he able to help, and engaged to help? Witness this 
 rod, the voice of which, thus held up, is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:9,10">Isa. li. 9, 10</A>),

 <I>Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; art not thou it that hath cut
 Rahab?</I>" Moses was not only a standard-bearer, but an intercessor, 
 pleading with God for success and victory. Note, When the host goes 
 forth against the enemy earnest prayers should be made to the God of 
 hosts for his presence with them. It is here the praying legion that 
 proves the thundering legion. There, in Salem, in Sion where prayers 
 were made, there the victory was won, <I>there broke the arrows of the 
 bow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:2,3">Ps. lxxvi. 2, 3</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) How Moses was tired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>His hands were heavy.</I> The strongest arm will fail with being 
 long extended; it is God only whose hand is <I>stretched out still.</I> 
 We do not find that Joshua's hands were heavy in fighting, but Moses's 
 hands were heavy in praying. The more spiritual any service is the more 
 apt we are to fail and flag in it. Praying work, if done with due 
 intenseness of mind and vigour of affection, will be found hard work, 
 and, though <I>the spirit be willing, the flesh will be weak.</I> Our 
 great Intercessor in heaven faints not, nor is he weary, though he 
 attends continually to this very thing. 

 (2.) What influence the rod of Moses had upon the battle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>When Moses held up his hand</I> in prayer (so the Chaldee explains 
 it) <I>Israel prevailed,</I> but, <I>when he let down his hand</I> from 
 prayer, <I>Amalek prevailed.</I> To convince Israel that the hand of 
 Moses (with whom they had just now been chiding) contributed more to 
 their safety than their own hands, his rod than their sword, the 
 success rises and falls as Moses lifts up or lets down his hands. It 
 seems, the scale wavered for some time, before it turned on Israel's 
 side. Even the best cause must expect disappointments as an alloy to 
 its successes; though the battle be the Lord's, Amalek may prevail for 
 a time. The reason was, Moses let down his hands. Note, The church's 
 cause is, commonly, more or less successful according as the church's 
 friends are more or less strong in faith and fervent in prayer. 

 (3.) The care that was taken for the support of Moses. When he could
 not stand any longer he sat down, not in a chair of state, but upon a 
 stone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 when he could not hold up his hands, he would have them held up. Moses, 
 the man of God, is glad of the assistance of Aaron his brother, and 
 Hur, who, some think, was his brother-in-law, the husband of Miriam. We 
 should not be shy either of asking help from others or giving help to 
 others, for we are members one of another. Moses's hands, thus stayed, 
 were <I>steady till the going down of the sun;</I> and, though it was 
 with much ado that he held out, yet his willing mind was accepted. No 
 doubt it was a great encouragement to the people to see Joshua before 
 them in the field of battle and Moses above them upon the top of the 
 hill: Christ is both to us--our Joshua, the captain of our salvation 
 who fights our battles, and our Moses, who, in the upper world, ever 
 lives making intercession, that our faith fail not.</P>

 III. The defeat of Amalek. Victory had hovered awhile between the 
 camps; sometimes Israel prevailed and sometimes Amalek, but Israel 
 carried the day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Though Joshua fought with great disadvantages--his soldiers 
 undisciplined, ill-armed, long inured to servitude, and apt to murmur; 
 yet by them God wrought a great salvation, and made Amalek pay dearly 
 for his insolence. Note, Weapons formed against God's Israel cannot 
 prosper long, and shall be broken at last. The cause of God and his 
 Israel will be victorious. Though God gave the victory, yet it is said, 
 <I>Joshua discomfited Amalek,</I> because Joshua was a type of Christ, 
 and of the same name, and in him it is that we are more than 
 conquerors. It was his arm alone that spoiled principalities and 
 powers, and routed all their force.</P>

 IV. The trophies of this victory set up. 

 1. Moses took care that God should have the glory of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 instead of setting up a triumphal arch, to the honour of Joshua (though 
 it had been a laudable policy to put marks of honour upon him), he 
 builds an altar to the honour of God, and we may suppose it was not an 
 altar without sacrifice; but that which is most carefully recorded is 
 the inscription upon the altar, <I>Jehovah-nissi--The Lord is my 
 banner,</I> which probably refers to the lifting up of the rod of God 
 as a banner in this action. The presence and power of Jehovah were the 
 banner under which they enlisted, by which they were animated and kept 
 together, and therefore which they erected in the day of their triumph. 
 In the name of our God we must always lift up our banners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:5">Ps. xx. 5</A>.

 It is fit that he who does all the work should have all the praise. 

 2. God took care that posterity should have the comfort and benefit of
 it: "<I>Write this for a memorial,</I> not in loose papers, but in a 
 book, <I>write it,</I> and then <I>rehearse it in the ears of 
 Joshua,</I> let him be entrusted with this memorial, to transmit it to 
 the generations to come." Moses must now begin to keep a diary or 
 journal of occurrences; it is the first mention of writing that we find 
 in scripture, and perhaps the command was not given till after the 
 writing of the law upon the tables of stone: "Write it <I>in perpetuam 
 rei memoriam--that the event may be had in perpetual remembrance;</I> 
 that which is written remains."

 (1.) "Write what has been done, what Amalek has done against Israel;
 write in gall their bitter hatred, write in blood their cruel attempts, 
 let them never be forgotten, nor yet what God has done for Israel in 
 saving them from Amalek. Let ages to come know that God fights for his 
 people, and <I>he that touches them touches the apple of his eye.</I>" 
 
 (2.) Write what shall be done. 

 [1.] That in process of time Amalek shall be totally ruined and rooted
 out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that he shall be remembered only in history." Amalek would have cut off 
 the name of Israel, that it might be no more in remembrance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4,7">Ps. lxxxiii. 4, 7</A>);

 and therefore God not only disappoints him in this, but cuts off his
 name. "Write it for the encouragement of Israel, whenever the 
 Amalekites are an annoyance to them, that Israel will at last 
 undoubtedly triumph in the fall of Amalek." This sentence was executed 
 in part by Saul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:1-35">1 Sam. xv</A>),

 and completely by David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:1-31,2Sa+1:1,8:12"><I>ch.</I> xxx.; 2 Sam. i. 1; viii. 12</A>);

 after his time we never read so much as of the name of Amalek.

 [2.] This is the mean time God would have a continual controversy with
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Because his hand is upon the throne of the Lord,</I> that is, 
 against the camp of Israel in which the Lord ruled, which was the 
 <I>place of his sanctuary,</I> and is therefore called a <I>glorious 
 high throne from the beginning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:12">Jer. xvii. 12</A>);

 therefore the Lord will have <I>war with Amalek from generation to
 generation.</I> This was written for direction to Israel never to make 
 any league with the Amalekites, but to look upon them as irreconcilable 
 enemies, doomed to ruin. Amalek's destruction was typical of the 
 destruction of all the enemies of Christ and his kingdom. Whoever 
 <I>make war with the Lamb, the Lamb will overcome them.</I></P>
