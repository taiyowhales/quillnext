 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses having very largely and fully set before the people their duty, 
 both to God and one another, in general and in particular 
 instances,--having shown them plainly what is good, and what the law
 requires of them,--and having in the close of the foregoing chapter laid
 them under the obligation both of the command and the covenant, he 
 comes in this chapter to prescribe outward means, 

 I. For the helping of their memories, that they might not forget the
 law as a strange thing.  They must write all the words of this law upon
 stones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II.  For the moving of their affections, that they might not be
 indifferent to the law as a light thing. Whey they came into Canaan, 
 the blessings and curses which were the sanctions of the law, were to 
 be solemnly pronounced in the hearing of all Israel, who were to say 
 Amen to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:11-26">ver. 11-26</A>.

 And if such a solemnity as this would not make a deep impression upon
 them, and affect them with the great things of God's law, nothing 
 would.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
 saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
 &nbsp; 2 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan
 unto the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
 set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law,
 when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk
 and honey; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of thy fathers hath promised thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, <I>that</I> ye
 shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount
 Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
 &nbsp; 5 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, an
 altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up <I>any</I> iron <I>tool</I> upon
 them.
 &nbsp; 6 Thou shalt build the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God of whole
 stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God:
 &nbsp; 7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there,
 and rejoice before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this
 law very plainly.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
 saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
 become the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and
 do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this
 day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general charge to the people to keep God's commandments; for in 
 vain did they know them, unless they would do them. This is pressed 
 upon them, 

 1. With all authority. <I>Moses with the elders of Israel,</I> the
 rulers of each tribe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and again, <I>Moses and the priests the Levites</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 so that the charge is given by Moses who was king in Jeshurun, and by
 their lords, both spiritual and temporal, in concurrence with him. Lest 
 they should think that it was Moses only, an old and dying man, that 
 made such ado about religion, or the priests and Levites only, whose 
 trade it was to attend religion and who had their maintenance out of 
 it, the elders of Israel, whom God had placed in honour and power over 
 them, and who were men of business in the world and likely to be so 
 long so when Moses was gone, <I>they</I> commanded their people to 
 <I>keep God's law.</I> Moses, having put some of his honour upon them, 
 joins them in commission with himself, in giving this charge, as Paul 
 sometimes in his epistles joins with himself Silvanus and Timotheus. 
 Note, All that have any interest in others, or power over them, should 
 use it for the support and furtherance of religion among them. Though 
 the supreme power of a nation provide ever so good laws for this 
 purpose, if inferior magistrates in their places, and ministers in 
 theirs, and masters of families in theirs, do not execute their 
 offices, it will all be to little effect. 

 2. With all importunity. They press it upon them with the utmost
 earnestness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:9"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>Take heed and hearken, O Israel.</I> It is a thing that requires and
 deserves the highest degree of caution and attention. They tell them of 
 their privilege and honour: "<I>This day thou hast become the people of 
 the Lord thy God,</I> the Lord having avouched thee to be his own, and 
 being now about to put thee in possession of Canaan which he had long 
 promised as <I>thy God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:7,8">Gen. xvii. 7, 8</A>),

 and which if he had failed to do in due time, he would have been
 ashamed to be called thy God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>.

 Now thou art more than ever his people, therefore <I>obey his
 voice.</I>" Privileges should be improved as engagements to duty. 
 Should not a people be ruled by their God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular direction to them with great solemnity to register 
 <I>the words of this law,</I> as soon as they came into Canaan. It was 
 to be done but once, and at their entrance into the land of promise, in 
 token of their taking possession of it under the several provisos and 
 conditions contained in this law. There was a solemn ratification of 
 the covenant between God and Israel at Mount Sinai, when an altar was 
 erected, with twelve pillars, and the book of the covenant was 
 produced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:4">Exod. xxiv. 4</A>.

 That which is here appointed is a somewhat similar solemnity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must set up a monument on which they must <I>write the words of 
 this law.</I> 

 (1.) The monument itself was to be very mean, only rough unhewn stone
 plastered over; not polished marble or alabaster, nor brass tables, but 
 common plaster upon stone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 The command is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and orders are given that it be written, not very finely, to be admired
 by the curious, but very plainly, that he who runs may read it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:2">Hab. ii. 2</A>.

 The word of God needs not to be set off by the art of man, nor
 embellished with the <I>enticing words of man's wisdom.</I> But,

 (2.) The inscription was to be very great: <I>All the words of this
 law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,
 
 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Some understand it only of the covenant between God and Israel,
 mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:17,18"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 17, 18</A>.

 Let this help be set up for a witness, like that memorial of the
 covenant between Laban and Jacob, which was nothing but a heap of 
 stones thrown hastily together, upon which they did eat together in 
 token of friendship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:46,47">Gen. xxxi. 46, 47</A>),

 and that stone which Joshua set up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26">Josh. xxiv. 26</A>.

 Others think that the curses of the covenant in this chapter were
 written upon this monument, the rather because it was set up in Mount 
 Ebal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Others think that the whole book of Deuteronomy was written upon this
 monument, or at least the statutes and judgments from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:1-26:19"><I>ch.</I> xii. 
 to the end of <I>ch.</I> xxvi.</A>

 And it is not improbable that the heap might be so large as, taking in
 all the sides of it, to contain so copious an inscription, unless we 
 will suppose (as some do) that the ten commandments only were here 
 written, as an authentic copy of the close rolls which were laid up in 
 the ark. They must write this when they had gone into Canaan, and yet 
 Moses says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "<I>Write it that thou mayest go in,</I>" that is, "that thou mayest go
 in with comfort, and assurance of success and settlement, otherwise it 
 were well for thee not to go in at all. Write it as the conditions of 
 thy entry, and own that thou comest in upon these terms and no other: 
 since Canaan is given by promise, it must beheld by obedience."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must also set up an altar. By the words of the law which were 
 written upon the plaster, God <I>spoke to them;</I> by the altar, and 
 the sacrifices offered upon it, they spoke to God; and thus was 
 communion kept up between them and God. The word and prayer must go 
 together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar 
 besides that at the tabernacle, yet, but the appointment of God, they 
 might upon a special occasion. Elijah built a temporary altar of twelve 
 unhewn stones, similar to this, when he brought Israel back to the 
 covenant which was now made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:31,32">1 Kings xviii. 31, 32</A>.

 Now, 

 (1.) This altar must be made of such stones as they found ready upon
 the field, not newly cut out of the rock, much less squared 
 artificially: <I>Thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Christ, our altar, is a <I>stone cut out of the mountain without
 hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:34,35">Dan. ii. 34, 35</A>),

 and therefore <I>refused by the builders,</I> as having no form or
 comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the head of the 
 corner.

 (2.) Burnt-offerings and peace-offerings must be offered upon this
 altar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 that by them they might give glory to God and obtain favour. Where the
 law was written, an altar was set up close by it, to signify that we 
 could not look with any comfort upon the law, being conscious to 
 ourselves of the violation of it, if it were not for the great 
 sacrifice by which atonement is made for sin; and the altar was set up 
 on Mount Ebal, the mount on which those tribes stood that said 
 <I>Amen</I> to the curses, to intimate that through Christ we are 
 <I>redeemed from the curse of the law.</I> In the Old Testament the 
 words of the law are written, with the curse annexed, which would fill 
 us with horror and amazement if we had not in the New Testament (which
 is bound up with it) an altar erected close by it, which gives us 
 everlasting consolation.

 (3.) They must eat there, and <I>rejoice before the Lord their God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This signified,

 [1.] The consent they gave to the covenant; for the parties to a 
 covenant ratified the covenant by feasting together.  They were 
 partakers of the altar, which was God's table, as his servants and 
 tenants, and such they acknowledged themselves, and, being put in 
 possession of this good land, bound themselves to pay the rent and to 
 do the services reserved by the royal grant. 

 [2.] The comfort they took in the covenant; they had reason to rejoice 
 in the law, when they had an altar, a remedial law, so near it. It was 
 a great favour to them, and a token for good, that God <I>gave them his 
 statutes;</I> and that they were owned as the people of God, and the 
 <I>children of the promise,</I> was what they had reason to rejoice in, 
 though, when this solemnity was to be performed, they were not put in 
 full possession of Canaan; but God has <I>spoken in his holiness,</I> 
 and then <I>I will rejoice, Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;</I> all 
 my own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people,
 when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
 Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
 &nbsp; 13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
 and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
 &nbsp; 14 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
 Israel with a loud voice,
 &nbsp; 15 Cursed <I>be</I> the man that maketh <I>any</I> graven or molten
 image, an abomination unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the work of the hands of the
 craftsman, and putteth <I>it</I> in <I>a</I> secret <I>place.</I> And all the
 people shall answer and say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 16 Cursed <I>be</I> he that setteth light by his father or his
 mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 17 Cursed <I>be</I> he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And
 all the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 18 Cursed <I>be</I> he that maketh the blind to wander out of the
 way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 19 Cursed <I>be</I> he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
 fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 20 Cursed <I>be</I> he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
 uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
 Amen.
 &nbsp; 21 Cursed <I>be</I> he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 22 Cursed <I>be</I> he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of
 his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
 shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 23 Cursed <I>be</I> he that lieth with his mother in law. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 24 Cursed <I>be</I> he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all
 the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 25 Cursed <I>be</I> he that taketh reward to slay an innocent
 person. And all the people shall say, Amen.
 &nbsp; 26 Cursed <I>be</I> he that confirmeth not <I>all</I> the words of this
 law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the law was written, to be <I>seen and read by all men,</I> the 
 sanctions of it were to be published, which, to complete the solemnity 
 of their covenanting with God, they were deliberately to declare their 
 approbation of. This they were before directed to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:29,30"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29, 30</A>),
 
 and therefore the appointment here begins somewhat abruptly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 There were, it seems, in Canaan, that part of it which afterwards fell
 to the lot of Ephraim (Joshua's tribe), two mountains that lay near 
 together, with a valley between, one called <I>Gerizim</I> and the 
 other <I>Ebal.</I> On the sides of these two mountains, which faced one 
 another, all the tribes were to be drawn up, six on one side and six on 
 the other, so that in the valley, at the foot of each mountain, they 
 came pretty near together, so near as that the priests standing betwixt 
 them might be heard by those that were next them on both sides; then 
 when silence was proclaimed, and attention commanded, one of the 
 priests, or perhaps more at some distance from each other, pronounced 
 with a loud voice one of the curses here following, and all the people 
 that stood on the side and foot of Mount Ebal (those that stood further 
 off taking the signal from those that stood nearer and within hearing) 
 said <I>Amen;</I> then the contrary blessing was pronounced, "Blessed 
 is he that doth not so or so," and then those that stood on the side, 
 and at the foot, of Mount Gerizim, said <I>Amen.</I> This could not but 
 affect them very much with the blessings and curses, the promises and 
 threatenings, of the law, and not only acquaint all the people with 
 them, but teach them to apply them to themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Something is to be observed, in general, concerning this solemnity, 
 which was to be done, but once and not repeated, but would be talked of 
 to posterity,. 

 1. God appointed which tribes should stand upon Mount Gerizim and which
 on Mount Ebal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:12,13"><I>v.</I>  12, 13</A>),

 to prevent the disputes that might have arisen if they had been left to
 dispose of themselves.  The six tribes that were appointed for blessing 
 were all the children of the free women, for to such the promise 
 belongs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:31">Gal. iv. 31</A>.

 Levi is here put among the rest, to teach ministers to apply to
 themselves the blessing and curse which they preach to others, and by 
 faith to set their own <I>Amen</I> to it. 

 2. Of those tribes that were to say <I>Amen</I> to the blessings it is
 said, <I>They stood to bless the people,</I> but of the other, <I>They 
 stood to curse,</I> not mentioning the people, as loth to suppose that 
 any of this people whom God had taken for his own should lay themselves 
 under the curse. Or, perhaps, the different mode of expression 
 intimates that there was to be but one blessing pronounced in general 
 upon the people of Israel, as a happy people, and that should ever be 
 so, <I>if they were obedient;</I> and to this blessing the tribes on 
 Mount Gerizim were to say <I>Amen</I>--"Happy art thou, O Israel, and 
 mayest thou ever be so;" but then the curses come in as exceptions from 
 the general rule, and we know <I>exceptio firmat regulam--the exception 
 confirms the rule.</I> Israel is a blessed people, but, if there be any 
 particular persons even among them that do such and such things as are 
 mentioned, let them know that they have no part nor lot in the matter, 
 but are under a curse. This shows how ready God is to bestow the 
 blessing; if any fall under the curse, they may thank themselves, they 
 bring it upon their own heads. 

 3. The Levites or priests, such of them as were appointed for that
 purpose, were to pronounce the curses as well as the blessings. They 
 were ordained to bless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:8"><I>ch.</I> x. 8</A>),

 the priests did it daily, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:23">Num. vi. 23</A>.

 But they <I>must separate between the precious and the vile;</I> they
 must not give that blessing promiscuously, but must declare it to whom 
 it did not belong, lest those who had no right to it themselves should 
 think to share in it by being in the crowd. Note, Ministers must preach 
 the terrors of the law as well as the comforts of the gospel; must not 
 only allure people to their duty with the promises of a blessing, but 
 awe them to it with the threatenings of a curse. 

 4.  The curses are here expressed, but not the blessings; for as many
 as were under the law were under the curse, but it was a honour 
 reserved for Christ to bless us, and so to do that for us which <I>the 
 law could not do, in that it was weak.</I> In Christ's sermon upon the 
 mount, which was the true Mount Gerizim, we have blessings only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3-11">Matt. v. 3</A>,

 &c.

 5. To each of the curses the people were to say <I>Amen.</I> It is easy 
 to understand the meaning of <I>Amen</I> to the blessings. The Jews 
 have a saying to encourage people to say <I>Amen</I> to the public 
 prayers, <I>Whosoever answereth</I> Amen, <I>after him that blesseth, 
 he is as he that blesseth.</I> But how could they say <I>Amen</I> to 
 the curses? 

 (1.) It was a profession of their faith in the truth of them, that
 these and the like curses were not bug-bears to frighten children and 
 fools, but the real declarations of the wrath of God against the 
 ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, not one <I>iota</I> of which 
 shall fall to the ground.

 (2.) It was an acknowledgment of the equity of these curses; when they
 said <I>Amen,</I> they did in effect say, not only, <I>It is certain it 
 shall be so,</I> but, <I>It is just it should be so.</I> Those who do 
 such things deserve to fall and lie under the curse.

 (3.) It was such an imprecation upon themselves as strongly obliged
 them to have nothing to do with those evil practices upon which the 
 curse is here entailed. "Let God's wrath fall upon us if ever we do 
 such things." We read of those that entered into a curse (and with us 
 that is the usual form of a solemn oath) to <I>walk in God's law</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:29">Neh. x. 29</A>.

 Nay, the Jews say (as the learned bishop Patrick quotes them), "All the
 people, by saying this <I>Amen,</I> became bound for one another, that 
 they would observe God's laws, by which every man was obliged, as far 
 as he could, to prevent his neighbour from breaking these laws, and to 
 reprove those that had offended, lest they should bear sin and the 
 curse for them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now observe what are the particular sins against which the 
 curses are here denounced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Sins against the second commandment. This flaming sword is set to 
 keep that commandment first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Those are here cursed, not only that worship images, but that make them
 or keep them, if they be such (or like such) as idolaters used in the 
 service of their gods. Whether it be a graven image or a molten image, 
 it comes all to one, <I>it is an abomination to the Lord,</I> even 
 though it be not set up in public, but in a secret place,--though it be 
 not actually worshipped, nor is it said to be designed for worship, but 
 reserved there with respect and a constant temptation. He that does 
 this may perhaps escape punishment from men, but he cannot escape the 
 curse of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Against the fifth commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The contempt of parents is a sin so heinous that it is put next to the
 contempt of God himself. If a man abused his parents, either in word or 
 deed, he fell under the sentence of the magistrate, and must be <I>put 
 to death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:15,17">Exod. xxi. 15, 17</A>.

 But to set light by them in his heart was a thing which the magistrate
 could not take cognizance of, and therefore it is here laid under the 
 curse of God, who knows the heart. Those are cursed children that carry 
 themselves scornfully and insolently towards their parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Against the eighth commandment. The curse of God is here fastened, 
 
 (1.) Upon an unjust neighbour that <I>removes the land-marks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:14"><I>ch.</I> xix. 14</A>.

 Upon an unjust counsellor, who, when his advice is asked, maliciously
 directs his friend to that which he knows will be to his prejudice, 
 which is <I>making the blind to wander out of the way,</I> under 
 pretence of directing him in the way, than which nothing can be either 
 more barbarous or more treacherous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Those that seduce others from the way of God's commandments, and entice
 them to sin, bring this curse upon themselves, which our Saviour has 
 explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:14">Matt. xv. 14</A>,

 <I>The blind lead the blind, and both shall fall into the ditch.</I>

 (3.) Upon an unjust judge, that <I>perverteth the judgment of the
 stranger, fatherless, and widow,</I> whom he should protect and 
 vindicate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 These are supposed to be poor and friendless (nothing to be got by
 doing them a kindness, nor any thing lost by disobliging them), and 
 therefore judges may be tempted to side with their adversaries against 
 right and equity; but cursed are such judges.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Against the seventh commandment. Incest is a cursed sin, with a 
 <I>sister, a father's wife, or a mother-in-law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:20,22,23"><I>v.</I> 20, 22, 23</A>.
 
 These crimes not only exposed men to the sword of the magistrate
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:11">Lev. xx. 11</A>),

 but, which is more dreadful, to the wrath of God; bestiality likewise,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Against the sixth commandment. Two of the worst kinds of murder are 
 here specified:-- 

 (1.) Murder unseen, when a man does not set upon his neighbour as a
 fair adversary, giving him an opportunity to defend himself, but 
 <I>smites him secretly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 as by poison or otherwise, when he sees not who hurts him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:8,9">Ps. x. 8, 9</A>.

 Though such secret murders may go undiscovered and unpunished, yet the
 curse of God will follow them.

 (2.) Murder under colour of law, which is the greatest affront to God, 
 for it makes an ordinance of his to patronise the worst of villains, 
 and the greatest wrong to our neighbour, for it ruins his honour as 
 well as his life: cursed therefore is he that will be hired, or bribed, 
 to accuse, or to convict, or to condemn, and so <I>to slay, an innocent 
 person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:5">Ps. xv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The solemnity concludes with a general curse upon him <I>that 
 confirmeth not,</I> or, as it might be read, that <I>performeth not, 
 all the words of this law to do them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 By our obedience to the law we set our seal to it, and so confirm it,
 as by our disobedience we do what lies in us to disannul it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:126">Ps. cxix. 126</A>.

 The apostle, following all the ancient versions, reads it, <I>Cursed is
 every one that continues not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Gal. iii. 10</A>.

 Lest those who were guilty of other sins, not mentioned in this
 commination, should think themselves safe from the curse, this last 
 reaches all; not only those who do the evil which the law forbids, but 
 those also who omit the good which the law requires: to this we must 
 all say <I>Amen,</I> owning ourselves under the curse, justly to have 
 deserved it, and that we must certainly have perished for ever under 
 it, if Christ had not <I>redeemed us from the curse of the law, by
 being made a curse for us.</I></P>
