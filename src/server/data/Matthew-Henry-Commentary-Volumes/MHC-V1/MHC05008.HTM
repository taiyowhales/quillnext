 Moses had charged parents in teaching their children to whet the word 
 of God upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>)

 by frequent repetition of the same things over and over again; and here
 he himself takes the same method of instructing the Israelites as his 
 children, frequently inculcating the same precepts and cautions, with 
 the same motives or arguments to enforce them, that what they heard so 
 often might abide with them. In this chapter Moses gives them, 

 I. General exhortations to obedience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:1,6">ver. 1, 6</A>.

 II. A review of the great things God had done for them in the
 wilderness, as a good argument for obedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:2-5,15,16">ver. 2-5, 15, 16</A>.

 III. A prospect of the good land into which God would now bring them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 IV. A necessary caution against the temptations of a prosperous
 condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:10-14,17,18">ver. 10-14, and 17, 18</A>.

 V. A fair warning of the fatal consequences of apostasy from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
 observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
 possess the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto your fathers.
 &nbsp; 2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee,
 <I>and</I> to prove thee, to know what <I>was</I> in thine heart, whether
 thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
 &nbsp; 3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed
 thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
 know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
 bread only, but by every <I>word</I> that proceedeth out of the mouth
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth man live.
 &nbsp; 4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
 swell, these forty years.
 &nbsp; 5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
 chasteneth his son, <I>so</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God chasteneth thee.
 &nbsp; 6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
 &nbsp; 7 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land
 of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
 valleys and hills;
 &nbsp; 8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
 pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
 &nbsp; 9 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
 shalt not lack any <I>thing</I> in it; a land whose stones <I>are</I> iron,
 and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The charge here given them is the same as before, to keep and do all 
 God's commandments. Their obedience must be, 

 1. Careful: <I>Observe to do.</I>

 2. Universal: To <I>do all the commandments,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 And, 

 3. From a good principle, with a regard to God as the Lord, and their
 God, and particularly with a holy fear of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 from a reverence of his majesty, a submission to his authority, and a
 dread of his wrath. To engage them to this obedience, besides the
 great advantages of it, which he sets before them (that they should 
 <I>live and multiply,</I> and all should be well with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 he directs them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To look back upon the wilderness through which God had now brought 
 them: <I>Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led 
 thee these forty years in the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Now that they had come of age, and were entering upon their 
 inheritance, they must be reminded of the discipline they had been 
 under during their minority and the method God had taken to train them 
 up for himself. The wilderness was the school in which they had been 
 for forty years boarded and taught, under tutors and governors; and 
 this was a time to bring it all to remembrance. The occurrences of 
 these last forty years were very memorable and well worthy to be 
 remembered, very useful and profitable to be remembered, as yielding a 
 complication of arguments for obedience; and they were recorded on 
 purpose that they might be remembered. As the feast of the passover was 
 a memorial of their deliverance out of Egypt, so was the feast of 
 tabernacles of their passage through the wilderness. Note, It is very 
 good for us to remember all the ways both of God's providence and 
 grace, by which he has led us hitherto through this wilderness, that we 
 may be prevailed with cheerfully to serve him and trust in him. Here 
 let us set up our Ebenezer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must remember the straits they were sometimes brought into, 
 
 (1.) For the mortifying of their pride; it was to <I>humble</I> them,
 that they might not be exalted above measure with the abundance of 
 miracles that were wrought in their favor, and that they might not be 
 secure, and confident of being in Canaan immediately. 

 (2.) For the manifesting of their perverseness: to <I>prove</I> them,
 that they and others might know (for God himself perfectly knew it 
 before) all that was in their heart, and might see that God chose them 
 not for any thing in them that might recommend them to his favour, for 
 their whole carriage was untoward and provoking. Many commandments God 
 gave them which there would have been no occasion for if they had not 
 been led through the wilderness, as those relating to the manna

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:28">Exod. xvi. 28</A>);

 and God thereby tried them, as our first parents were tried by the
 trees of the garden, whether they would keep God's commandments or not. 
 Or God thereby proved them whether they would trust his promises, the 
 word which he commanded to a thousand generations, and, in dependence 
 on his promises, obey his precepts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must remember the supplies which were always granted them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God himself took particular care of their food, raiment, and 
 health; and what would they have more? 
 
 [1.] They had manna for food
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>God suffered them to hunger,</I> and the <I>fed them with manna,</I>
 that the extremity of their want might make the supply the more 
 acceptable, and God's goodness to them therein the more remarkable. God 
 often brings his people low, that he may have the honour of helping 
 them. And thus the manna of heavenly comforts is given to those that 
 <I>hunger and thirst after righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:6">Matt. v. 6</A>.

 <I>To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</I> It is said of
 the manna that it was a sort of food which neither <I>they nor their 
 fathers knew.</I> And again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If they knew there was such a thing that fell sometimes with the dew in 
 those countries, as some think they did, yet it was never known to fall 
 in such vast quantities, so constantly, and at all seasons of the year, 
 so long, and only about a certain place. These things were altogether 
 miraculous, and without precedent; <I>the Lord created a new thing</I> 
 for their supply. And hereby he taught them the <I>man liveth not by 
 bread alone.</I> Though God has appointed bread for the strengthening 
 of man's heart, and that is ordinarily made the staff of life, yet God 
 can, when he pleases, command support and nourishment without it, and 
 make something else, very unlikely, to answer the intention as well. We 
 might live upon air if it were sanctified for that use by <I>the word 
 of God;</I> for the means God ordinarily uses he is not tied to, but 
 can perform his kind purposes to his people without them. Our Saviour 
 quotes this scripture in answer to that temptation of Satan, <I>Command 
 that these stones be made bread.</I> "What need of that?" says Christ; 
 "my heavenly Father can keep me alive without bread,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3,4">Matt. iv. 3, 4</A>.

 Let none of God's children distrust their Father, nor take any sinful
 indirect course for the supply of their own necessities; some way or 
 other, God will provide for them in the way of duty and honest 
 diligence, <I>and verily they shall be fed.</I> It may be applied 
 spiritually; the <I>word of God,</I> as it is the revelation of God's 
 will and grace duly received and entertained by faith, is the food of 
 the soul, the life which is supported by that is the life of the man, 
 and not only that life which is supported by bread. The manna typified 
 Christ, <I>the bread of life.</I> He is <I>the Word of God;</I> by him 
 we live. The Lord evermore give us that bread which endures to eternal 
 life, and let us not be put off with the <I>meat that perisheth!</I> 
 
 [2.] The same clothes served them from Egypt to Canaan, at least the
 generality of them. Though they had no change of raiment, yet it was 
 always new, and waxed not old upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This was a standing miracle, and the greater if, as the Jews say, they 
 grew with them, so as to be always fit for them. But it is plain that 
 they brought out of Egypt bundles of clothes on their shoulders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:34">Exod. xii. 34</A>),

 which they might barter with each other as there was occasion; and
 these, with what they wore, sufficed till they came into a country 
 where they could furnish themselves with new clothes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By the method God took of providing food and raiment for them 

 [1.] He humbled them. It was a mortification to them to be tied for
 forty years together to the same meat, without any varieties, and to 
 the same clothes, in the same fashion. Thus he taught them that the 
 good things he designed for them were figures of better things, and 
 that the happiness of man consists not in being clothed in <I>purple or 
 fine linen,</I> and in <I>faring sumptuously every day,</I> but in 
 being taken into covenant and communion with God, and in <I>learning 
 his righteous judgements.</I> God's law, which was given to Israel in 
 the wilderness, must be to them instead of food and raiment.

 [2.] He proved them, whether they could trust him to provide for them
 when means and second causes failed. Thus he taught them to live in a 
 dependence upon Providence, and not to perplex themselves with care 
 <I>what they should eat and drink,</I> and <I>wherewithal they should 
 be clothed.</I> Christ would have his disciples learn the same lesson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>),

 and took a like method to teach it to them, when he <I>sent them out
 without purse or scrip,</I> and yet took care that they <I>lacked 
 nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:35">Luke xxii. 35</A>.

 [3.] God took care of their health and ease. Though they travelled on
 foot in a dry country, the way rough and untrodden, yet their <I>feet 
 swelled not.</I> God preserved them from taking hurt by the 
 inconveniences of their journey; and mercies of this kind we ought to 
 acknowledge. Note, Those that follow God's conduct are not only safe 
 but easy. Our feet swell not while we keep in the way of duty; it is 
 the <I>way of transgression</I> that <I>is hard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:15">Prov. xiii. 15</A>.

 God had promised to <I>keep the feet of his saints,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9">1 Sam. ii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They must also remember the rebukes they had been under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:6"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 During these years of their education they had been kept under a strict 
 discipline, and not without need. <I>As a man chasteneth his son,</I> 
 for his good, and because he loves him, <I>so the Lord thy God 
 chasteneth thee.</I> God is a loving tender Father to all his children, 
 yet when there is occasion they shall feel the smart of the rod. Israel 
 did so: they were chastened that they might not be condemned, chastened 
 with the rod of men. Not as a man wounds and slays his enemies whose
 destruction he aims at, but as a man chastens his son whose happiness 
 and welfare he designs: so did their God chasten them; he chastened and 
 taught them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:12">Ps. xciv. 12</A>.

 This they must <I>consider in their heart,</I> that is, they must own
 it from their own experience that God had corrected them with a 
 fatherly love, for which they must return to him a filial reverence and 
 compliance. Because God has chastened thee as a father, 
 <I>therefore</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>thou shalt keep his commandments.</I> This use we should make of all
 our afflictions; by them let us be engaged and quickened to our duty. 
 Thus they are directed to look back upon the wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He directs them to look forward to Canaan, into which God was now 
 bringing them. Look which way we will, both our reviews and our 
 prospects will furnish us with arguments for obedience. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The land which they were now going to take possession of is here 
 described to be a very good land, having every thing in it that was 
 desirable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 (1.) It was <I>well-watered, like Eden, the garden of the Lord.</I> It
 was <I>a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths,</I> which 
 contributed to the fruitfulness of the soil. Perhaps there was a 
 greater plenty of water there now than in Abraham's time, the 
 Canaanites having found and digged wells; so that Israel reaped the 
 fruit of their industry as well as of God's bounty.

 (2.) The ground produced great plenty of all good things, not only for
 the necessary support, but for the convenience and comfort of human 
 life. In their fathers' land they had bread enough; it was corn land, a 
 land of wheat and barley, where, with the common care and labour of the 
 husbandman, they might eat bread without scarceness. It was a fruitful 
 land, that was never turned into barrenness but for the iniquity of 
 those that dwelt therein. They had not only water enough to quench 
 their thirst, but vines, the fruit whereof was ordained to make glad 
 the heart. And, if they were desirous of dainties, they needed not to 
 send to far countries for them, when their own was so well stocked with 
 fig-trees, and pomegranates, olives of the best kind, and honey, or 
 <I>date-trees,</I> as some think it should be read.

 (3.) Even the bowels of its earth were very rich, though it should seem
 that <I>silver and gold they had none;</I> of these the princes of 
 Sheba should bring presents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:10,15">Ps. lxxii. 10, 15</A>);

 yet they had plenty of those more serviceable metals, iron and brass.
 Iron-stone and mines of brass were found in their hills. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:2">Job xxviii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These things are mentioned, 

 (1.) To show the great difference between that wilderness through which
 God had led them and the good land into which he was bringing them. 
 Note, Those that bear the inconveniences of an afflicted state with 
 patience and submission, are humbled by them and prove well under them, 
 are best prepared for better circumstances.

 (2.) To show what obligations they lay under to keep God's
 commandments, both in gratitude for his favours to them and from a 
 regard to their own interest, that the favours might be continued. The
 only way to keep possession of this good land would be to keep in the 
 way of their duty.

 (3.) To show what a figure it was of good things to come. Whatever
 others saw, it is probable that Moses in it saw a type of the better 
 country: The gospel church is the New-Testament Canaan, watered with 
 the Spirit in his gifts and graces, planted with the trees of 
 righteousness, bearing the fruits of righteousness. Heaven is the good 
 land, in which there is nothing wanting, and where there is a fulness 
 of joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses, having mentioned the great plenty they would find in the land of 
 Canaan, finds it necessary to caution them against the abuse of that 
 plenty, which was a sin they would be the more prone to new that they 
 came into the vineyard of the Lord, immediately out of a barren 
 desert.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He directs them to the duty of a prosperous condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They are allowed to eat even to fulness, not to surfeiting no excess; 
 but let them always remember their benefactor, the founder of their 
 feast, and never fail to give thanks after meat: <I>Then thou shalt 
 bless the Lord thy God.</I> 

 1. They must take heed of eating or drinking so much as to indispose
 themselves for this duty of blessing God, rather aiming to serve God 
 therein with so much the more cheerfulness and enlargement.

 2. They must not have any fellowship with those that, when they had 
 eaten and were full, blessed false gods, as the Israelites themselves 
 had done in their worship of the golden calf,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:6">Exod. xxxii. 6</A>.

 3. Whatever they had the comfort of God must have the glory of. As our
 Saviour has taught us to bless before we eat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:19,20">Matt. xiv. 19, 20</A>),

 so we are here taught to bless after meat. That is our <I>Hosannah--God
 bless;</I> this is our <I>Hallelujah--Blessed be God. In every thing we
 must give thanks.</I> From this law the religious Jews took up a 
 laudable usage of blessing God, not only at their solemn meals, but 
 upon other occasions; if they drank a cup of wine they lifted up their 
 hands and said, <I>Blessed be he that created the fruit of the vine to 
 make glad the heart.</I> If they did but smell at a flower, they said, 
 <I>Blessed be he that made this flower sweet.</I> 

 4. When they gave thanks for the fruits of the land they must give
 thanks for the fruits of the land itself, which was given them by 
 promise From all our comfortable enjoyments we must take occasion to 
 thank God for our comfortable settlements; and I know not but we of 
 this nation have as much reason as they had to give thanks for a good 
 land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He arms them against the temptations of a prosperous condition, and 
 charges them to stand upon their guard against them: "When thou art 
 settled in goodly houses of thy own building," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>

 (for though God gave them houses which they builded not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10"><I>ch.</I> vi. 10</A>,

 these would not serve them, they must have larger and finer),--"and
 when thou hast grown <I>rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 as Abraham
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:2">Gen. xiii. 2</A>),--when

 <I>all thou hast is multiplied,</I>" 

 1. "Then take heed of pride. Beware <I>lest then thy heart be lifted
 up,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When the estate rises, the mind is apt to rise with it, in 
 self-conceit, self-complacency, and self-confidence. Let us therefore 
 strive to keep the spirit low in a high condition; humility is both the 
 ease and the ornament of prosperity. Take heed of saying, so much as in 
 thy heart, that proud word, <I>My power, even the might of my hand, 
 hath gotten me this wealth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, We must never take the praise of our prosperity to ourselves, nor 
 attribute it to our ingenuity or industry; for bread is not always 
 <I>to the wise,</I> nor <I>riches to men of understanding,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11">Eccl. ix. 11</A>.

 It is spiritual idolatry thus to <I>sacrifice to our own net,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:16">Hab. i. 16</A>.

 2. "Then take heed of forgetting God." This follows upon the <I>lifting 
 up on the heart;</I> for it is <I>through the pride of the 
 countenance</I> that the <I>wicked seek not after God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:4">Ps. x. 4</A>.
 
 Those that admire themselves despise God.

 (1.) "Forget not thy duty to God." 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We forget God if we keep not his commandments; we forget his authority 
 over us, and our obligations to him and expectations from him, if we 
 are not obedient to his laws. When men grow rich they are tempted to
 think religion a needless thing. They are happy without it, think it a
 thing below them and too hard upon them. Their dignity forbids them to 
 stoop, and their liberty forbids them to serve. But we are basely 
 ungrateful if the better God is to us the worse we are to him.

 (2.) "Forget not God's former dealings with thee. Thy deliverance out
 of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The provision he made for thee in the wilderness, that great and 
 terrible wilderness." They must never forget the impressions which the 
 horror of that wilderness made upon them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6">Jer. ii. 6</A>,

 where it is called the very <I>shadow of death.</I> There God preserved
 them from being destroyed by the fiery serpents and scorpions, though 
 sometimes he made use of them for their correction: there he kept them 
 from perishing for want of water, following them with water out of a 
 rock of flint

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 out of which (says bishop Patrick) one would rather have expected fire
 than water. There he fed them with manna, of which before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 taking care to keep them alive, that he might <I>do them good at their
 latter end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, God reserves the best till the last for his Israel. However he 
 may seem to deal hardly with them by the way, he will not fail to do 
 them good at their latter end.

 (3.) "Forget not God's hand in thy present prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Remember it is he that giveth thee wealth; for he <I>giveth thee power 
 to get wealth.</I>" See here how God's giving and our getting are 
 reconciled, and apply it to spiritual wealth. It is our duty to get 
 wisdom, and above all our gettings to get understanding; and yet it is 
 God's grace that gives wisdom, and when we have got it we must not say, 
 It was the might of our hand that got it, but must own it was God that 
 gave us power to get it, and therefore to him we must give the praise 
 and consecrate the use of it. The <I>blessing of the Lord</I> on the 
 <I>hand of the diligent</I> makes rich both for this world and for the 
 other. He <I>giveth thee power to get wealth,</I> not so much to 
 gratify thee, and make thee easy, as that he may establish his 
 covenant. All God's gifts are in pursuance of his promises.</P>

 III. He repeats the fair warning he had often given them of the fatal 
 consequences of their apostasy from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How he describes the sin; it is forgetting God, and then worshipping 
 other gods. What wickedness will not those fall into that keep thoughts 
 of God out of their minds? And, when once the affections are displaced 
 from God, they will soon be misplaced upon lying vanities. 

 2. How he denounces wrath and ruin against them for it: "If you do so, 
 <I>you shall surely perish,</I> and the power and might of your hands, 
 which you are so proud of, cannot help you. Nay, you shall perish as 
 the nations that are driven out before you. God will make no more 
 account of you, notwithstanding his covenant with you and your relation 
 to him, than he does of them, if you will not be obedient and faithful 
 to him." Those that follow others in sin will certainly follow them to 
 destruction. If we do as sinners do, we must expect to fare as sinners 
 fare.</P>
