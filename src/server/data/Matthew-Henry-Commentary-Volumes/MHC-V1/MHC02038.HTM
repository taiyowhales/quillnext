 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And he made the altar of burnt offering <I>of</I> shittim wood:
 five cubits <I>was</I> the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
 thereof; <I>it was</I> foursquare; and three cubits the height
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
 horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.
 &nbsp; 3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
 shovels, and the basons, <I>and</I> the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
 all the vessels thereof made he <I>of</I> brass.
 &nbsp; 4 And he made for the altar a brazen grate of network under the
 compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.
 &nbsp; 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
 brass, <I>to be</I> places for the staves.
 &nbsp; 6 And he made the staves <I>of</I> shittim wood, and overlaid them
 with brass.
 &nbsp; 7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
 altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.
 &nbsp; 8 And he made the laver <I>of</I> brass, and the foot of it <I>of</I>
 brass, of the looking-glasses of <I>the women</I> assembling, which
 assembled <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

 Bezaleel having finished the gold-work, which, though the richest, yet 
 was ordered to lie most out of sight, in the tabernacle itself, here 
 goes on to prepare the court, which lay open to the view of all. Two 
 things the court was furnished with, and both made of brass:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An altar of burnt-offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:1-7"><I>v.</I> 1-7</A>.

 On this all their sacrifices were offered, and it was this which, being
 sanctified itself for this purpose by the divine appointment, 
 sanctified the gift that was in faith offered on it. Christ was himself 
 the altar to his own sacrifice of atonement, and so he is to all our 
 sacrifices of acknowledgment. We must have an eye to him in offering 
 them, as God has in accepting them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A laver, to hold water for the priests to wash in when they went in 
 to minister, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This signified the provision that is made in the gospel of Christ for 
 the cleansing of our souls from the moral pollution of sin by the merit 
 and grace of Christ, that we may be fit to serve the holy God in holy 
 duties. This is here said to be made of the <I>looking-glasses</I> (or 
 mirrors) of the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It should seem these women were eminent and exemplary for devotion, 
 attending more frequently and seriously at the place of public worship 
 than others did; and notice is here taken of it to their honour. Anna 
 was such a one long afterwards, who <I>departed not from the temple, 
 but served God with fastings and prayers night and day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:37">Luke ii. 37</A>.
 
 It seems in every age of the church there have been some who have thus
 distinguished themselves by their serious zealous piety, and they have 
 thereby distinguished themselves; for devout women are really 
 honourable women 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:50">Acts xiii. 50</A>),

 and not the less so for their being called, by the scoffers of the
 latter days, <I>silly women.</I> Probably these women were such as 
 showed their zeal upon this occasion, by assisting in the work that was 
 now going on for the service of the tabernacle. They assembled by 
 <I>troops,</I> so the word is; a blessed sight, to see so many, and 
 those so zealous and so unanimous, in this good work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These women parted with their mirrors (which were of the finest 
 brass, burnished for that purpose) for the use of the tabernacle. Those 
 women that admire their own beauty, are in love with their own shadow, 
 and make the putting on of apparel their chief adorning by which they 
 value and recommend themselves, can but ill spare their 
 <I>looking-glasses;</I> yet these women offered <I>them</I> to God, 
 either, 

 (1.) In token of their repentance for the former abuse of them, to the
 support of their pride and vanity; now that they were convinced of 
 their folly, and had devoted themselves to the service of God at the 
 door of the tabernacle, they thus threw away that which, though lawful 
 and useful in itself, yet had been an occasion of sin to them. Thus 
 Mary Magdalene, who had been a sinner, when she became a penitent wiped 
 Christ's feet with her hair. Or, 

 (2.) In token of their great zeal for the work of the tabernacle;
 rather than the workmen should want brass, or not have of the best, 
 they would part with their mirrors, though they could not do well 
 without them. God's service and glory must always be preferred by us 
 before any satisfactions or accommodations of our own. Let us never 
 complain of the want of that which we may honour God by parting 
 with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. These mirrors were used for the making of the laver. Either they 
 were artfully joined together, or else molten down and cast anew; but 
 it is probable that the laver was so brightly burnished that the sides 
 of it still served for mirrors, that the priests, when they came to 
 wash, might there see their faces, and so discover the spots, to wash 
 them clean. Note, In the washing of repentance, there is need of the 
 looking-glass of self-examination. The word of God is a glass, in which 
 we may see our own faces (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:23">Jam. i. 23</A>);

 and with it we must compare our own hearts and lives, that, finding out
 our blemishes, we may wash with particular sorrow, and application of 
 the blood of Christ to our souls. Usually the more particular we are in 
 the confession of sin the more comfort we have in the sense of the 
 pardon.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
 hangings of the court <I>were of</I> fine twined linen, an hundred
 cubits:
 &nbsp; 10 Their pillars <I>were</I> twenty, and their brazen sockets
 twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <I>were of</I>
 silver.
 &nbsp; 11 And for the north side <I>the hangings were</I> an hundred
 cubits, their pillars <I>were</I> twenty, and their sockets of brass
 twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets <I>of</I> silver.
 &nbsp; 12 And for the west side <I>were</I> hangings of fifty cubits, their
 pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and
 their fillets <I>of</I> silver.
 &nbsp; 13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.
 &nbsp; 14 The hangings of the one side <I>of the gate were</I> fifteen
 cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
 &nbsp; 15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
 that hand, <I>were</I> hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
 three, and their sockets three.
 &nbsp; 16 All the hangings of the court round about <I>were</I> of fine
 twined linen.
 &nbsp; 17 And the sockets for the pillars <I>were of</I> brass; the hooks
 of the pillars and their fillets <I>of</I> silver; and the overlaying
 of their chapiters <I>of</I> silver; and all the pillars of the court
 <I>were</I> filleted with silver.
 &nbsp; 18 And the hanging for the gate of the court <I>was</I> needlework,
 <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
 twenty cubits <I>was</I> the length, and the height in the breadth
 <I>was</I> five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
 &nbsp; 19 And their pillars <I>were</I> four, and their sockets <I>of</I> brass
 four; their hooks <I>of</I> silver, and the overlaying of their
 chapiters and their fillets <I>of</I> silver.
 &nbsp; 20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
 about, <I>were of</I> brass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The walls of the court, or church-yard, were like the rest curtains or 
 hangings, made according to the appointment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+27:9-19"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 9</A>,

 &c. This represented the state of the Old-Testament church: it was a
 garden enclosed; the worshippers were then confined to a little 
 compass. But the enclosure being of curtains only intimated that the 
 confinement of the church in one particular nation was not to be 
 perpetual. The dispensation itself was a tabernacle-dispensation, 
 movable and mutable, and in due time to be taken down and folded up, 
 when the place of the tent should be enlarged and its cords lengthened, 
 to make room for the Gentile world, as is foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:2,3">Isa. liv. 2, 3</A>.

 The church here on earth is but the court of God's house, and happy
 they that tread these courts and flourish in them; but through these 
 courts we are passing to the holy place above. <I>Blessed are those 
 that dwell in that house</I> of God: they well be <I>still praising 
 him.</I> The enclosing of a court before the tabernacle teaches us a 
 gradual approach to God. The priests that ministered must pass through 
 the holy court, before they entered the holy house. Thus before solemn 
 ordinances there ought to be the separated and enclosed court of a 
 solemn preparation, in which we must wash our hands, and so draw near 
 with a true heart.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, <I>even</I> of the tabernacle
 of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
 Moses, <I>for</I> the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
 son to Aaron the priest.
 &nbsp; 22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
 Judah, made all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 23 And with him <I>was</I> Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe
 of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
 blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.
 &nbsp; 24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work
 of the holy <I>place,</I> even the gold of the offering, was twenty
 and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
 shekel of the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the
 congregation <I>was</I> an hundred talents, and a thousand seven
 hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of
 the sanctuary:
 &nbsp; 26 A bekah for every man, <I>that is,</I> half a shekel, after the
 shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered,
 from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and
 three thousand and five hundred and fifty <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets
 of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
 of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
 &nbsp; 28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels
 he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
 filleted them.
 &nbsp; 29 And the brass of the offering <I>was</I> seventy talents, and two
 thousand and four hundred shekels.
 &nbsp; 30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the
 brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
 &nbsp; 31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
 the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the
 pins of the court round about.

 Here we have a breviat of the account which, by Moses's appointment, 
 the Levites took and kept of the gold, silver, and brass, that was 
 brought in for the tabernacle's use, and how it was employed. Ithamar 
 the son of Aaron was appointed to draw up this account, and was thus by 
 less services trained up and fitted for greater, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Bezaleel and Aholiab must bring in the account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 and Ithamar must audit it, and give it in to Moses. And it was
 thus:--

 1.  All the gold was a free-will offering; every man brought as he 
 could and would, and it amounted to twenty-nine talents, and 730 
 shekels over, which some compute to be about 150,000<I>l.</I> worth of 
 gold, according to the present value of it. Of this were made all the 
 golden furniture and vessels. 

 2. The silver was levied by way of tax; every man was assessed half a 
 shekel, a kind of poll-money, which amounted in the whole to 100 
 talents, and 1775 shekels over,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Of this they made the sockets into which the boards of the tabernacle 
 were let, and on which they rested; so that they were as the foundation 
 of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The silver amounted to about 34,000<I>l.</I> of our money. The raising 
 of the gold by voluntary contribution, and of the silver by way of 
 tribute, shows that either way may be taken for the defraying of public 
 expenses, provided that nothing be done with partiality. 

 3. The brass, though less valuable, was of use not only for the brazen 
 altar, but for the sockets of the court, which probably in other tents 
 were of wood: but it is promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:17">Isa. lx. 17</A>),

 <I>For wood I will bring brass.</I> See how liberal the people were and
 how faithful the workmen were, in both which respects their good 
 example ought to be followed.</P>
