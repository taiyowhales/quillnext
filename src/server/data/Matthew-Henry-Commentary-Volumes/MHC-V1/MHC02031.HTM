 God is here drawing towards a conclusion of what he had to say to Moses 
 upon the mount, where he had now been with him forty days and forty 
 nights; and yet no more is recorded of what was said to him in all that 
 time than what we have read in the six chapters foregoing. In this, 

 I. He appoints what workmen should be employed in the building and
 furnishing of the tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He repeats the law of the sabbath, and the religious observance of
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 III. He delivers to him the two tables of the testimony at parting,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:18">ver. 18</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
 of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
 &nbsp; 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
 in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
 workmanship,
 &nbsp; 4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
 in brass,
 &nbsp; 5 And in cutting of stones, to set <I>them,</I> and in carving of
 timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
 &nbsp; 6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
 Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are
 wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I
 have commanded thee;
 &nbsp; 7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
 testimony, and the mercy seat that <I>is</I> thereupon, and all the
 furniture of the tabernacle,
 &nbsp; 8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick
 with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,
 &nbsp; 9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
 the laver and his foot,
 &nbsp; 10 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron
 the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
 priest's office,
 &nbsp; 11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy
 <I>place:</I> according to all that I have commanded thee shall they
 do.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A great deal of fine work God had ordered to be done about the 
 tabernacle; the materials the people were to provide, but who must put 
 them into form? Moses himself was learned in all the learning of the 
 Egyptians, nay, he was well acquainted with the words of God, and the 
 visions of the Almighty; but he knew not how to engrave or embroider. 
 We may suppose that there were some very ingenious men among the 
 Israelites; but, having lived all their days in bondage in Egypt, we 
 cannot think they were any of them instructed in these curious arts. 
 They knew how to make brick and work in clay, but to work in gold and 
 in cutting diamonds was what they had never been brought up to. How 
 should the work be done with the neatness and exactness that were 
 required when they had no goldsmiths or jewellers but what must be made 
 out of masons and bricklayers? We may suppose that there were a 
 sufficient number who would gladly be employed, and would do their 
 best; but it would be hard to find out a proper person to preside in 
 this work. <I>Who was sufficient for these things?</I> But God takes 
 care of this matter also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He nominates the persons that were to be employed, that there might 
 be no contest about the preferment, nor envy at those that were 
 preferred, God himself having made the choice. 

 1. Bezaleel was to be the architect, or master workman,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was of the tribe of Judah, a tribe that God delighted to honour; the 
 grandson of Hur, probably that Hur who had helped to hold up Moses's 
 hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:1-16"><I>ch.</I> xvii.</A>),

 and was at this time in commission with Aaron for the government of the
 people in the absence of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:14"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 14</A>);

 out of that family which was of note in Israel was the workman chosen,
 and it added no little honour to the family that a branch of it was 
 employed, though but as a mechanic, or handicraft tradesman, for the 
 service of the tabernacle.  The Jews' tradition is that Hur was the 
 husband of Miriam; and, if so, it was requisite that God should appoint 
 him to this service, lest, if Moses himself had done it, he should be 
 thought partial to his own kindred, his brother Aaron also being 
 advanced to the priesthood. God will put honour upon Moses's relations, 
 and yet will make it to appear that he takes not the honour to himself 
 or his own family, but that it is purely the Lord's doing. 

 2. Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, is appointed next to Bezaleel, and 
 partner with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Two are better than one.  Christ sent forth his disciples who were to 
 rear the gospel tabernacle, two and two, and we read of his two 
 witnesses. Aholiab was of the tribe of Dan, which was one of the less 
 honourable tribes, that the tribes of Judah and Levi might not be 
 lifted up, as if they were to engross all the preferments; to prevent a 
 schism in the body, God gives honour to <I>that part which lacked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:24">1 Cor. xii. 24</A>.

 <I>The head cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee.</I> Hiram,
 who was the head workman in the building of Solomon's temple, was also 
 of the tribe of Dan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:14">2 Chron. ii. 14</A>.

 3. There were others that were employed by and under these in the
 several operations about the tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, When God has work to do he will never want instruments to do it 
 with, for all hearts and heads too are under his eye, and in his hand; 
 and those may cheerfully go about any service for God, and go on in it, 
 who have reason to think that, one way or other, he has called them to 
 it; for whom he calls he will own and bear out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He qualifies these persons for the service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I have filled him with the Spirit of God;</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom.</I> 
 Note, 

 1.  Skill in common arts and employments is the gift of God; from him 
 are derived both the faculty and the improvement of the faculty. It is 
 he that puts even this <I>wisdom into the inward parts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:36">Job xxxviii. 36</A>.

 He teaches the husbandman discretion 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:26">Isa. xxviii. 26</A>),

 and the tradesman too; and he must have the praise of it. 

 2. God dispenses his gifts variously, one gift to one, another to 
 another, and all for the good of the whole body, both of mankind and of 
 the church.  Moses was fittest of all to govern Israel, but Bezaleel 
 was fitter than he to build the tabernacle.  The common benefit is very 
 much supported by the variety of men's faculties and inclinations; the 
 genius of some leads them to be serviceable one way, of others another 
 way, and <I>all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:11">1 Cor. xii. 11</A>.

 This forbids pride, envy, contempt, and carnal emulation, and
 strengthens the bond of mutual love. 

 3. Those whom God calls to any service he will either find, or make, 
 fit for it.  If God give the commission, he will in some measure give 
 the qualifications, according as the service is.  The work, that was to 
 be done here was to make the tabernacle and the utensils of it, which 
 are here particularly reckoned up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 &c. And for this the persons employed were enabled to <I>work in gold, 
 and silver, and brass.</I> When Christ sent his apostles to rear the 
 gospel tabernacle, he poured out his Spirit upon them, to enable them 
 to speak with tongues the wonderful works of God; not to work upon 
 metal, but to work upon men; so much more excellent were the gifts, as 
 the tabernacle to be pitched was a <I>greater and more perfect 
 tabernacle,</I> as the apostle calls it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily
 my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it <I>is</I> a sign between me and you
 throughout your generations; that <I>ye</I> may know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that doth sanctify you.
 &nbsp; 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it <I>is</I> holy unto
 you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
 whosoever doeth <I>any</I> work therein, that soul shall be cut off
 from among his people.
 &nbsp; 15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh <I>is</I> the
 sabbath of rest, holy to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: whosoever doeth <I>any</I> work in
 the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
 &nbsp; 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
 observe the sabbath throughout their generations, <I>for</I> a
 perpetual covenant.
 &nbsp; 17 It <I>is</I> a sign between me and the children of Israel for
 ever: for <I>in</I> six days the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made heaven and earth, and on
 the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
 &nbsp; 18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
 with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
 stone, written with the finger of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A strict command for the sanctification of the sabbath day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:13-17"><I>v.</I> 13-17</A>.

 The law of the sabbath had been given them before any other law, by was
 of preparation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:23"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 23</A>);

 it had been inserted in the body of the moral law, in the fourth
 commandment; it had been annexed to the judicial law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:12"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 12</A>);

 and here it is added to the first part of the ceremonial law, because
 the observance of the sabbath is indeed the hem and hedge of the whole 
 law; where no conscience is made of that, farewell both godliness and 
 honesty; for, in the moral law, it stands in the midst between the two 
 tables. Some suggest that it comes in here upon another account. Orders 
 were now given that a tabernacle should be set up and furnished for the 
 service of God with all possible expedition; but lest they should think 
 that the nature of the work, and the haste that was required, would 
 justify them in working at it on sabbath days, that they might get it 
 done the sooner, this caution is seasonably inserted, <I>Verily,</I> or 
 <I>nevertheless, my sabbaths you shall keep.</I> Though they must 
 hasten the work, yet they must not make more haste than good speed; 
 they must not break the law of the sabbath in their haste: even 
 tabernacle-work must give way to the sabbath-rest; so jealous is God 
 for the honour of his sabbaths. Observe what is here said concerning 
 the sabbath day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The nature, meaning, and intention, of the sabbath, by the
 declaration of which God puts an honour upon it, and teaches us to 
 value it. Divers things are here said of the sabbath. 

 (1.) <I>It is a sign between me and you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The institution of the sabbath was a great instance of God's favour to 
 them, and a sign that he had distinguished them from all other people; 
 and their religious observance of the sabbath was a great instance of 
 their duty and obedience to him. God, by sanctifying this day among 
 them, let them know that he sanctified them, and set them apart for 
 himself and his service; otherwise he would not have revealed to them 
 his holy sabbaths, to be the support of religion among them. Or it may 
 refer to the law concerning the sabbath, <I>Keep my sabbaths, that you 
 may know that I the Lord do sanctify you.</I> Note, If God by his grace 
 incline our hearts to keep the law of the fourth commandment, it will 
 be an evidence of a good work wrought in us by his Spirit.  If we 
 sanctify God's day, it is a sign between him and us that he has 
 sanctified our hearts: hence it is the character of the blessed man 
 that he <I>keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:2">Isa. lvi. 2</A>.

 The Jews, by observing one day in seven, after six days' labour,
 testified and declared that they worshipped the God who made the world 
 in six days, and rested the seventh; and so distinguished themselves 
 from other nations, who, having first lost the sabbath, which was 
 instituted to be a memorial of the creation, by degrees lost the 
 knowledge of the Creator, and gave that honour to the creature which 
 was due to him alone. 
 
 (2.) <I>It is holy unto you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that is, "It is designed for your benefit as well as for God's honour;" 
 <I>the sabbath was made for man.</I> Or, "It shall be accounted holy by 
 you, and shall so be observed, and you shall look upon it a sacrilege 
 to profane it." 

 (3.) It is the <I>sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is separated from common use, and designed for the honour and 
 service of God, and by the observance of it we are taught to rest from 
 worldly pursuits and the service of the flesh, and to devote ourselves, 
 and all we are, have, and can do, to God's glory. 

 (4.) It was to be observed <I>throughout their generations,</I> in
 every age, <I>for a perpetual covenant.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was to be one of the most lasting tokens of that covenant which 
 was between God and Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The law of the sabbath. They must keep it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:13,14,16"><I>v.</I> 13, 14, 16</A>),

 keep it as a treasure, as a trust, observe it and preserve it, keep it 
 from polluting it, keep it up as a sign between God and them, keep it 
 and never part with it. The Gentiles had anniversary-feasts, to the 
 honour of their gods; but it was peculiar to the Jews to have a weekly 
 festival; this therefore they must carefully observe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reason of the sabbath; for God's laws are not only backed with 
 the highest authority, but supported with the best reason. God's own 
 example is the great reason, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 As the work of creation is worthy to be thus commemorated, so the great 
 Creator is worthy to be thus imitated, by a holy rest, the seventh day, 
 after six days' labour, especially since we hope, in further conformity 
 to the same example, shortly to rest with him from all our labours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The penalty to be inflicted for the breach of this law: "Every one 
 that <I>defileth the sabbath,</I> by doing <I>any work therein</I> but 
 works of piety and mercy, <I>shall be cut off from among his people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 <I>he shall surely be put to death.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The magistrate must cut him off the sword of justice if the crime can 
 be proved; if it cannot, or if the magistrate be remiss, and do not do 
 his duty, God will take the work into his own hands, and cut him off by 
 a stroke from heaven, and his family shall be rooted out of Israel." 
 Note, The contempt and profanation of the sabbath day is an iniquity to 
 be punished by the judges; and, if men do not punish it, God will, here 
 or hereafter, unless it be repented of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The delivering of the two tables of testimony to Moses. God had 
 promised him these tables when he called him up into the mount 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:12"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 12</A>),

 and now, when he was sending him down, he delivered them to him, to be
 carefully and honourably deposited in the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1. The ten commandments which God had spoken upon mount Sinai in the 
 hearing of all the people were now written, <I>in perpetuam rei 
 memoriam--for a perpetual memorial,</I> because that which is written 
 remains. 

 2. They were written in <I>tables of stone,</I> prepared, not by Moses, 
 as it should seem (for it is intimated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:12"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 12</A>,

 that he found them ready written when he went up to the mount), but, as
 some think, by the ministry of angels. The law was written in <I>tables 
 of stone,</I> to denote the perpetual duration of it (what can be 
 supposed to last longer than that which is written in stone, and laid 
 up?), to denote likewise the hardness of our hearts; one might more 
 easily write in stone than write any thing that is good in our corrupt 
 and sinful hearts. 

 3. They were written <I>with the finger of God,</I> that is, by his 
 will and power immediately, without the use of any instrument. It is 
 God only that can write his law in the heart; he <I>gives a heart of 
 flesh,</I> and then, by his Spirit, which is the <I>finger of God,</I> 
 he writes his will in the <I>fleshly tables of the heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:3">2 Cor. iii. 3</A>.

 4. They were written in two tables, being designed to direct us in our
 duty both towards God and towards man. 

 5.  They are called <I>tables of testimony,</I> because this written 
 law testified both the will of God concerning them and his good-will 
 towards them, and would be a testimony against them if they were 
 disobedient. 

 6. They were delivered to Moses, probably with a charge, before he laid 
 them up in the ark, to show them publicly, that they might be <I>seen 
 and read of all men,</I> and so what they had heard with the hearing of 
 the ear might now be brought to their remembrance.  Thus <I>the law was 
 given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</I></P>
