 Moses, in this chapter, goes on with his charge to Israel, to be sure 
 to keep up their religion in Canaan. It is much the same with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:1-40"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>

 I.  His preface is a persuasive to obedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He lays down the great principles of obedience. The first truth to
 be believed, That God is one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:4">ver. 4</A>.

 The first duty to be done, To love him with all our heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:5">ver. 5</A>.

 III. He prescribes the means for keeping up religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 IV.  He cautions them against those things which would be the ruin of
 religion--abuse of plenty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10-24">ver. 10-12</A>),
 
 inclination to idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>),

 and gives them some general precepts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13,16-18">ver. 13, 16-18</A>.

 V. He directs them what instructions to give their children,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now these <I>are</I> the commandments, the statutes, and the
 judgments, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God commanded to teach you, that
 ye might do <I>them</I> in the land whither ye go to possess it:
 &nbsp; 2 That thou mightest fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to keep all his
 statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
 thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
 thy days may be prolonged.
 &nbsp; 3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do <I>it;</I> that it may
 be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth
 with milk and honey.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. That Moses taught the people all that, and that only, which God
 commanded him to teach them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Thus Christ's ministers are to teach his churches <I>all that he has
 commanded,</I> and neither more nor less,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 2. That the end of their being taught was that they might do as they
 were taught 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 might <I>keep God's statutes</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and <I>observe to do them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Good instructions from parents and ministers will but aggravate our
 condemnation if we do not live up to them.

 3. That Moses carefully endeavoured to fix them for God and godliness,
 now that they were entering upon the land of Canaan, that they might be 
 prepared for the comforts of that land, and fortified against the 
 snares of it, and now that they were setting out in the world might set 
 out well. 

 4. That the fear of God in the heart will be the most powerful 
 principle of obedience: <I>That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to 
 keep all his statutes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 5. The entail of religion in a family, or country, is the best entail:
 it is highly desirable that not we only, but our children, and our 
 children's children, may fear the Lord. 

 6. Religion and righteousness advance and secure the prosperity of any
 people. Fear God, and it shall be well with thee. Those that are well 
 taught, if they do what they are taught, shall be well fed too, as 
 Israel in the <I>land flowing with milk and honey,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 Hear, O Israel: The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God <I>is</I> one L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 5 And thou shalt love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God with all thine heart,

 thine heart:

 shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
 thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
 risest up.

 shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.
 &nbsp; 9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
 thy gates.
 &nbsp; 10 And it shall be, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall have brought
 thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham,
 to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
 which thou buildedst not,
 &nbsp; 11 And houses full of all good <I>things,</I> which thou filledst
 not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and
 olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
 and be full;
 &nbsp; 12 <I>Then</I> beware lest thou forget the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which brought thee
 forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
 &nbsp; 13 Thou shalt fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and serve him, and shalt
 swear by his name.
 &nbsp; 14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
 which <I>are</I> round about you;
 &nbsp; 15 (For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>is</I> a jealous God among you) lest the
 anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
 thee from off the face of the earth.
 &nbsp; 16 Ye shall not tempt the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, as ye tempted <I>him</I> in
 Massah.

 Here is, 

 I. A brief summary of religion, containing the first principles of
 faith and obedience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 These two verses the Jews reckon one of the choicest portions of
 scripture: they write it in their phylacteries, and think themselves 
 not only obliged to say it at least twice every day, but very happy in 
 being so obliged, having this saying among them, <I>Blessed are we, who 
 every morning and evening say, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one 
 Lord.</I> But more blessed are we if we duly consider and improve,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What we are here taught to believe concerning God: that <I>Jehovah 
 our God is one Jehovah.</I> 

 (1.) That the God whom we serve is Jehovah, a Being infinitely and
 eternally perfect, self-existent, and self-sufficient.

 (2.) That he is the one only living and true God; he only is God, and
 he is but one. The firm belief of this self-evident truth would 
 effectually arm them against all idolatry, which was introduced by that 
 fundamental error, that there are gods many. It is past dispute that 
 there is one God, and there <I>is no other but he,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:32">Mark xii. 32</A>.

 Let us therefore have no other, nor desire to have any other. Some have
 thought there is here a plain intimation of the trinity of persons in 
 the unity of the Godhead; for here is the name of God three times, and 
 yet all declared to be one. Happy they that have this one Lord for 
 their God; for they have but one master to please, but one benefactor 
 to seek to. It is better to have one fountain that a thousand cisterns, 
 one all-sufficient God than a thousand insufficient ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What we are here taught concerning the duty which God requires of 
 man. It is all summed up in this as its principle, <I>Thou shalt love 
 the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</I> He had undertaken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 to teach them to fear God; and, in pursuance of his undertaking, he
 here teaches them to love him, for the warmer our affection to him the 
 greater will be our veneration for him; the child that honours his 
 parents no doubt loves them. Did ever any prince make a law that his 
 subjects should love him?  Yet such is the condescension of the divine 
 grace that this is made the first and great commandment of God's law, 
 that we love him, and that we perform all other parts of our duty to 
 him from a principle of love. <I>My son, give me thy heart.</I> We must 
 highly esteem him, be well pleased that there is such a Being, well 
 pleased in all his attributes, and relations to us: our desire must be 
 towards him, our delight in him, our dependence upon him, and to him we 
 must be entirely devoted. It must be a constant pleasure to us to think 
 of him, hear from him, speak to him, and serve him. We must love him,

 (1.) As the Lord, the best of beings, most excellent and amiable in
 himself. 

 (2.) As our God, a God in covenant with us, our Father, and the most
 kind and bountiful of friends and benefactors. We are also commanded to 
 love God <I>with all our heart, and soul, and might;</I> that is, we 
 must love him, 

 [1.] With a sincere love; not in word and tongue only, saying we love
 him when our hearts are not with him, but inwardly, and in truth, 
 solacing ourselves in him. 

 [2.] With a strong love; the heart must be carried out towards him with
 great ardour and fervency of affection.  Some have hence though that we 
 should avoid saying (as we commonly express ourselves) that we will do 
 this or that with all our heart, for we must not do any thing with all 
 our heart but love God; and that this phrase, being here used 
 concerning that sacred fire, should not be unhallowed. He that is our 
 all must have our all, and none but he.  

 [3.] With a superlative love; we must love God above any creature
 whatsoever, and love nothing besides him but what we love for him and 
 in subordination to him. 

 [4.] With an intelligent love; for so it is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:33">Mark xii. 33</A>.

 To love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, we must
 know him, and therefore love him as those that see good cause to love 
 him. 

 [5.] With an entire love; he is one, and therefore our hearts must be
 united in this love, and the whole stream of our affections must run 
 towards him. O that this love of God may be shed abroad in our 
 hearts!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Means are here prescribed for the maintaining and keeping up of 
 religion in our hearts and houses, that it might not wither and go to 
 decay. And they are these:--

 1. Meditation: <I>These words which I command thee shall be in thy
 heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Though the words alone without the things will do us no good, yet we
 are in danger of losing the things if we neglect the words, by which 
 ordinarily divine light and power are conveyed to the heart. God's 
 words must be laid up on our heart, that our thoughts may be daily 
 conversant with them and employed about them, and thereby the whole 
 soul may be brought to abide and act under the influence and impression 
 of them. This immediately follows upon the law of loving God with all 
 your heart; for those that do so will lay up his word in their hearts 
 both as an evidence and effect of that love and as a means to preserve 
 and increase it. He that loves God loves his Bible.

 2. The religious education of children

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children;</I> and by
 communicating thy knowledge thou wilt increase it." Those that love the 
 Lord God themselves should do what they can to engage the affections of 
 their children to him, and so to preserve the entail of religion in 
 their families from being cut off. <I>Thou shalt whet them diligently 
 upon thy children,</I> so some read it; frequently repeat these things 
 to them, try all ways of instilling them into their minds, and making 
 them pierce into their hearts; as, in whetting a knife, it is turned 
 first on this side, then on that. "Be careful and exact in teaching thy 
 children; and aim, as by whetting, to sharpen them, and put an edge 
 upon them. Teach them to thy children, not only those of thy own body" 
 (say the Jews) "but all those that are anyway under thy care and 
 tuition." Bishop Patrick well observes here that Moses thought his law 
 so very plain and easy that every father might be able to instruct his 
 sons in it and every mother her daughters. Thus that good thing which 
 is committed to us we must carefully transmit to those that come after 
 us, that it may be perpetuated. 

 3. Pious discourse. "Thou shalt talk of these things, with due
 reverence and seriousness, for the benefit not only of thy children, 
 but of thy other domestics, thy friends and companions, as thou sittest 
 in thy house at work, or at meat, or at rest, or to receive visits, and 
 when thou walkest by the way for diversion, or for conversation, of in 
 journeys, when at night thou art retiring from thy family to lie down 
 for sleep, and when in the morning thou hast risen up and returnest to 
 thy family again. Take all occasions to discourse with those about thee 
 of divine things; not of unrevealed mysteries, or matters of doubtful 
 disputation, but of the plain truths and laws of God, and the things 
 that belong to our peace." So far is it from being reckoned a 
 diminution to the honour of sacred things to make them subject of our 
 familiar discourse that they are recommended to us to be talked of; for 
 the more conversant we are with them the more we shall admire them and 
 be affected with them, and may thereby be instrumental to communicate 
 divine light and heat. 

 4.  Frequent reading of the word: <I>They shall be as frontlets between 
 thy eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 It is probable that at that time there were few written copies of the
 whole law, only at the feasts of tabernacles the people had it read to 
 them; and therefore God appointed them, at least for the present, to 
 write some select sentences of the law, that were most weighty and 
 comprehensive, upon their walls, or in scrolls of parchment to be worn 
 about their wrists; and some think that hence the phylacteries so much 
 used among the Jews took rise. Christ blames the Pharisees, not for 
 wearing them, but for affecting to have them broader than other 
 people's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:5">Matt. xxiii. 5</A>.

 But when Bibles came to be common among them there was less occasion
 for this expedient. It was prudently and piously provided by the first 
 reformers of the English church that then, when Bibles were scarce, 
 some select portions of scripture should be written on the walls and 
 pillars of the churches, which the people might make familiar to them, 
 in conformity to this direction, which seems to have been binding in 
 the letter of it to the Jews as it is to us in the intent of it, which 
 is that we should endeavour by all means possible to make the word of 
 God familiar to us, that we may have it ready to us upon all occasions, 
 for our restraint from sin and our direction and excitement to our 
 duty. It must be as that which is <I>graven on the palms of our 
 hands,</I> always before our eyes. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:1-3">Prov. vii. 1-3</A>.

 It is also intimated that we must never be ashamed to own our religion,
 nor to own ourselves under the check and government of it. Let it be 
 written on our gates, and let every one that goes by our door read it, 
 that we believe Jehovah to be God alone, and believe ourselves bound to 
 <I>love him with all our hearts.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A caution is here given not to forget God in a day of prosperity 
 and plenty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. He raises their expectations of the goodness of their God, taking it
 for granted that he would bring them into the good land that he had 
 promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>),

 that they should no longer dwell in tents as shepherds and poor
 travellers, but should settle in great and goodly cities, should no 
 longer wander in a barren wilderness, but should enjoy houses will 
 furnished and gardens well planted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and all this without any care and expense of their own, which he here
 lays a great stress upon--<I>Cities which thou buildest not, houses 
 which thou filledst not, &c.,</I> both because it made the mercy really 
 much more valuable that what they had come to them so cheaply, and yet, 
 if they did not actually consider it, the mercy would be the less 
 esteemed, for we are most sensible of the value of that which has cost 
 us dear. When they came so easily by the gift they would be apt to grow 
 secure, and unmindful of the giver. 

 2. He engages their watchfulness against the badness of their own
 hearts: <I>Then beware,</I> when thou liest safe and soft, <I>lest thou 
 forget the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) In a day of prosperity we are in great danger of forgetting God,
 our dependence upon him, our need of him, and our obligations to him. 
 When the world smiles we are apt to make our court to it, and expect 
 our happiness in it, and so we forget him that his our only portion and 
 rest. Agur prays against this temptation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:9">Prov. xxx. 9</A>):

 <I>Lest I be full and deny thee.</I>

 (2.) There is therefore need of great care and caution at such a time,
 and a strict watch over our own hearts. "<I>Then beware;</I> being 
 warned of your danger, stand upon your guard against it. <I>Bind the 
 words of God for a sign upon thy hand,</I> for this end to prevent thy 
 forgetting God.  When thou art settled in Canaan forget not thy 
 deliverance out of Egypt; but look to the <I>rock out of which thou 
 wast hewn.</I> When thy latter end has greatly increased, remember the 
 smallness of thy beginnings."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some special precepts and prohibitions are here given, which are of 
 great consequence. 
 
 1. They must upon all occasions give honour to God
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13">(<I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Fear him and serve him</I> (for, if he be a Master, we must both
 reverence him and do his work); <I>and swear by his name,</I> that is, 
 they must not upon any occasion appeal to any other, as the discerner 
 of truth and avenger of wrong. Swear by him only, and not by an idol, 
 or any other creature. Swear by his name in all treaties and covenants 
 with the neighbouring nations, and do not compliment them so far as to 
 swear by their gods. Swearing by his mane is sometimes put for an open 
 profession of his name. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:23">Isa. xlv. 23</A>,

 <I>Every tongue shall swear,</I> is expounded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:11">Rom. xiv. 11</A>),

 <I>Every tongue shall confess to God.</I> 

 2. They must not upon any occasion give that honour to other gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>You shall not go after other gods,</I> that is, "You shall not serve
 nor worship them;" for therein they went astray, they went a whoring 
 from the true God, who in this, more than in any thing, is <I>jealous 
 god</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 and the learned bishop Patrick observes here, out of Maimonides, that
 we never find, either in the law or the prophets, <I>anger,</I> or 
 <I>fury,</I> or <I>jealousy,</I> or <I>indignation,</I> attributed to 
 God but upon occasion of idolatry. 

 3.  They must take heed of dishonouring God by <I>tempting him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>You shall not tempt the Lord your God,</I> that is, "You shall not
 in any exigence distrust the power, presence, and providence of God, 
 nor quarrel with him," which, if they indulged an evil heart of 
 unbelief, they would take occasion to do in Canaan as well as in the 
 wilderness. No change of condition will cure a disposition of murmur 
 and fret. Our Saviour uses this caution as an answer to one of Satan's 
 temptations, with application to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:7">Matt. iv. 7</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</I> either by despairing of
 his power and goodness while we keep in the way of our duty, or by 
 presuming upon it when we turn aside out of that way.</P>

 in Egypt; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
 hand:
 &nbsp; 22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
 Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:
 &nbsp; 23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us
 in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.
 &nbsp; 24 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us
 alive, as <I>it is</I> at this day.
 &nbsp; 25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
 these commandments before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, as he hath commanded
 us.

 Here,

 I. Moses charges them to keep God's commandments themselves: <I>You 
 shall diligently keep God's commandments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 Note, It requires a great deal of care and pains to keep up religion in
 the power of it in our hearts and lives.  Negligence will ruin us; but 
 we cannot be saved without diligence. To induce them to this, he here 
 shows them,

 1. That this would be very acceptable to God: it is <I>right and good
 in the sight of the Lord;</I> and that is right and good indeed that 
 is, so in <I>God's sight.</I> If we have any regard to the favour of 
 our Creator as our felicity, and the law of our creation as our rule, 
 we shall be religious. 

 2. That it would be very advantageous and profitable to themselves. It
 would secure to them the possession of the land of Canaan, prosperity 
 there, and constant victory over those that stood in their way. In 
 short, "Do well, and it shall be <I>well with thee.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charges them to instruct their children in the commands of God, 
 not only that they might in their tender years intelligently and 
 affectionately join in religious services, but that afterwards they 
 might in their day keep up religion, and convey it to those that should 
 come after them. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a proper question which it is supposed the children would 
 ask 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>What mean the testimonies and the statutes?</I> What is the meaning
 of the feasts we observe, the sacrifices we offer, and the many 
 peculiar customs we keep up?" Observe,

 (1.) All divine institutions have a certain meaning, and there is
 something great designed in them.

 (2.) It concerns us to know and understand the meaning of them, that we 
 may perform a reasonable service and may not <I>offer the blind for 
 sacrifice.</I>

 (3.) It is good for children betimes to enquire into the true intent
 and meaning of the religious observances they are trained up in. If any 
 are thus inquisitive in divine things it is a good sign that they are 
 concerned about them, and a good means of their attaining to a great 
 acquaintance with them.  <I>Then shall we know</I> if thus we <I>follow 
 on to know.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a full answer put into the parents' mouths to be given to 
 this good question. Parents and teachers must give instruction to those 
 under their charge, though they do not ask it, nay, though they have an 
 aversion to it; much more must they be ready to answer questions, and 
 to give instruction when it is desired; for it may be hoped that those 
 who ask it will be willing to receive it. Did the children ask the 
 meaning of God's laws? Let them be told that they were to be observed, 
 
 (1.) In a grateful remembrance of God's former favours to them,
 especially their deliverance out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>.

 The children must be often told of the deplorable state their ancestors
 were in when they were bondmen in Egypt, the great salvation God 
 wrought for them in fetching them out thence, and that God, in giving 
 them these peculiar statutes, meant to perpetuate the memorial of that 
 work of wonder, by which they were formed into a peculiar people.

 (2.) As the prescribed condition of his further favours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:24"><I>v.</I>  24</A>):

 <I>The Lord commanded us all these statutes for our good.</I> Note, God 
 commands us nothing but what is really for our good. It is our interest 
 as well as our duty to be religious. 

 [1.] It will be our life: <I>That he might preserve us alive,</I> which
 is a great favour, and more than we could expect, considering how often 
 we have forfeited life itself.  Godliness has the promise of the 
 continuance and comfort of the life that now is as far as it is for 
 God's glory. 

 [2.] It will be our righteousness.  Could we perfectly fulfil but that
 one command of loving God with all our heart, soul, and might, and 
 could we say, "We have never done otherwise," this would be so our 
 righteousness as to entitle us to the benefits of the covenant of 
 innocency; had we continued in every thing that is written in the book 
 of the law to do it, the law would have justified us. But this we 
 cannot pretend to, therefore our sincere obedience shall be accepted 
 through a Mediator to denominate us, as Noah was, <I>righteous before 
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:1,Lu+1:6,1Jo+3:7">Gen. vii. 1; 
 Luke i. 6; and 1 John iii. 7</A>.

 The Chaldee reads it, <I>There shall be a reward to us if we observe to
 do these commandments;</I> for, without doubt, in keeping God's 
 commandments there is great reward.</P>
