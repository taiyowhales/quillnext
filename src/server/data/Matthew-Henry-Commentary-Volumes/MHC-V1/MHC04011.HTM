 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto things had gone pretty well in Israel; little interruption had 
 been given to the methods of God's favour to them since the matter of 
 the golden calf; the people seemed teachable in marshalling and 
 purifying the camp, the princes devout and generous in dedicating the 
 altar, and there was good hope that they would be in Canaan presently. 
 But at this chapter begins a melancholy scene; the measures are all 
 broken, God has turned to be their enemy, and fights against them--and
 it is sin that makes all this mischief. 

 I. Their murmurings kindled a fire among them, which yet was soon
 quenched by the prayer of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. No sooner was the fire of judgment quenched than the fire of sin
 breaks out again, and God takes occasion from it to magnify both his 
 mercy and his justice.

 1. The people fret for want of flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4-9">ver.  4-9</A>.

 2. Moses frets for want of help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) God promises to gratify them both, to appoint help for Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),
 
 and to give the people flesh,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.
 
 And,

 (2.) He presently makes good both these promises. For, 

 [1.] The Spirit of God qualifies the seventy elders for the government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:24-30">ver. 24-30</A>.

 [2.] The power of God brings quails to feast the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:31,32">ver. 31, 32</A>.
 
 Yet 

 [3.] The justice of God plagued them for their murmurings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:33-35">ver. 33</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And <I>when</I> the people complained, it displeased the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard <I>it;</I> and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> burnt among them, and consumed <I>them that were</I> in the
 uttermost parts of the camp.
 &nbsp; 2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the fire was quenched.
 &nbsp; 3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> burnt among them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The people's sin. They <I>complained,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>They were, as it were, complainers.</I> So it is in the margin. 
 There were some secret grudgings and discontents among them, which as 
 yet did not break out in an open mutiny. But how great a matter did 
 this little fire kindle! They had received from God excellent laws and 
 ordinances, and yet no sooner had they departed from the mount of the 
 Lord than they began to quarrel with God himself. See in this,

 1. The sinfulness of sin, which takes occasion from the commandment to 
 be the more provoking. 

 2. The weakness of the law through the flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.

 The law discovered sin, but could not destroy it; checked it, but could
 not conquer it. They <I>complained.</I> Interpreters enquire what they 
 complained of; and truly, when they were furnished with so much matter 
 for thanksgiving, one may justly wonder where they found any matter for 
 complaint; it is probable that those who complained did not all agree 
 in the cause. Some perhaps complained that they were removed from Mount 
 Sinai, where they had been at rest so long, others that they did not 
 remove sooner: some complained of the weather, others of the ways: some 
 perhaps thought three days' journey was too long a march, others 
 thought it not long enough, because it did not bring them into Canaan.  
 When we consider how their camp was guided, guarded, graced, what good 
 victuals they had and good company, and what care was taken of them in 
 their marches that their feet should not swell nor their clothes wear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:4">Deut. viii. 4</A>),

 we may ask, "What could have been done more for a
 people to make them easy?" And yet they complained.  Note, Those that 
 are of a fretful discontented spirit will always find something or 
 other to quarrel with, though the circumstances of their outward 
 condition be ever so favourable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's just resentment of the affront given to him by this sin: 
 <I>The Lord heard it,</I> though it does not appear that Moses did. 
 Note, God is acquainted with the secret frettings and murmurings of the 
 heart, though they are industriously concealed from men. What he took 
 notice of his was much displeased with, and his <I>anger was 
 kindled.</I> Note, Though God graciously gives us leave to complain to 
 him when there is cause 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+142:2">Ps. cxlii. 2</A>),

 yet he is justly provoked, and takes it very ill, if we complain of him
 when there is no cause: such conduct in our inferiors provokes us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The judgment wherewith God chastised them for this sin: <I>The 
 fire of the Lord burnt among them,</I> such flashes of fire from the 
 cloud as had consumed Nadab and Abihu. The fire of their wrath against 
 God burned in their minds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:3">Ps. xxxix. 3</A>),

 and justly does the fire of God's wrath fasten upon their bodies. We
 read of their murmurings several times, when they came first out of 
 Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-17:16">
 Exod. xv., and xvi., and xvii.</A>. But

 we do not read of any plagues inflicted on them for their murmurings,
 as there were now; for now they had had great experience of God's care 
 of them, and therefore now to distrust him was so much the more 
 inexcusable. Now a <I>fire was kindled against Jacob</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:21">Ps. lxxviii. 21</A>),

 but, to show how unwilling God was to contend with them, it fastened on
 those only that were <I>in the uttermost parts of the camp.</I> Thus 
 God's judgments came upon them gradually, that they might take 
 warning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their cry to Moses, who was their tried intercessor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>When he slew them, then they sought him,</I> and made their 
 application to Moses to stand their friend. Note,

 1. When we complain without cause, it is just with God to give us cause 
 to complain. 

 2. Those that slight God's friends when they are in prosperity would be 
 glad to make them their friends when they are in distress. <I>Father 
 Abraham, send Lazarus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The prevalency of Moses's intercession for them: <I>When Moses 
 prayed unto the Lord</I> (he was always ready to stand in the gap to 
 turn away the wrath of God) God had respect to him and his offering, 
 and <I>the fire was quenched.</I> By this it appears that God delights 
 not in punishing, for, when he has begun his controversy, he is soon 
 prevailed with to let it fall. Moses was one of those worthies who 
 <I>by faith quenched the violence of fire.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. A new name given hereupon to the place, to perpetuate the shame of 
 a murmuring people and the honour of a righteous God; the place was 
 called <I>Taberah,</I> a <I>burning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that others might hear, and fear, and take warning not to sin as they 
 did, lest they should smart as they did,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And the mixt multitude that <I>was</I> among them fell a lusting:
 and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
 give us flesh to eat?
 &nbsp; 5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
 cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
 garlick:
 &nbsp; 6 But now our soul <I>is</I> dried away: <I>there is</I> nothing at all,
 beside this manna, <I>before</I> our eyes.
 &nbsp; 7 And the manna <I>was</I> as coriander seed, and the colour thereof
 as the colour of bdellium.
 &nbsp; 8 <I>And</I> the people went about, and gathered <I>it,</I> and ground
 <I>it</I> in mills, or beat <I>it</I> in a mortar, and baked <I>it</I> in pans,
 and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of
 fresh oil.
 &nbsp; 9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
 fell upon it.
 &nbsp; 10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
 every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was
 kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.
 &nbsp; 11 And Moses said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
 thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight,
 that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
 &nbsp; 12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
 thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing
 father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou
 swarest unto their fathers?
 &nbsp; 13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
 they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
 &nbsp; 14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because <I>it is</I>
 too heavy for me.
 &nbsp; 15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
 hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my
 wretchedness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses represent things sadly unhinged and out of order in 
 Israel, both the people and the prince uneasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the people fretting, and speaking against God himself (as it 
 is interpreted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19">Ps. lxxviii. 19</A>),

 notwithstanding his glorious appearances both to them and for them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who were the criminals. 

 (1.) The <I>mixed multitude</I> began, they <I>fell a lusting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The rabble that came with them out of Egypt, expecting only the land of 
 promise, but not a state of probation in the way to it. They were 
 hangers on, who took hold of the skirts of the Jews, and would go with 
 them only because they knew not how to live at home, and were disposed 
 to seek their fortunes (as we say) abroad.  These were the scabbed 
 sheep that infected the flock, the leaven that leavened the whole lump.  
 Note, A few factious, discontented, ill-natured people, may do a great 
 deal of mischief in the best societies, if great care be not taken to 
 discountenance them. Such as these are an <I>untoward generation,</I> 
 from which it is our wisdom to <I>save ourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:40">Acts ii. 40</A>.

 (2.) Even <I>the children of Israel</I> took the infection, as we are 
 informed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The holy seed joined themselves to the people of these abominations. 
 The mixed multitude here spoken of were not numbered with the children 
 of Israel, but were set aside as a people God made no account of; and 
 yet the children of Israel, forgetting their own character and 
 distinction, herded themselves with them and learned their way, as if 
 the scum and outcasts of the camp were to be the privy-counsellors of 
 it. The children of Israel, a people near to God and highly privileged, 
 yet drawn into rebellion against him! O how little honour has God in 
 the world, when even the people which he formed for himself, to show 
 forth his praise, were so much a dishonour to him! Therefore let none 
 think that their external professions and privileges will be their 
 security either against Satan's temptations to sin or God's judgments 
 for sin.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1,2,12">1 Cor. x. 1, 2, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the crime: they lusted and murmured. Though they had been 
 lately corrected for this sin, and many of them overthrown for it, as 
 God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and the smell of the fire was still 
 in their nostrils, yet they returned to it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:22">Prov. xxvii. 22</A>.

 (1.) They magnified the plenty and dainties they had had in Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 as if God had done them a great deal of wrong in taking them thence. 
 While they were in Egypt they sighed by reason of their burdens, for 
 their lives were made bitter to them with hard bondage; and yet now 
 they talk of Egypt as if they had all lived like princes there, when 
 this serves as a colour for their present discontent. But with what 
 face can they talk of eating fish in Egypt freely, or for nought, as if 
 it cost them nothing, when they paid so dearly for it with their hard 
 service? They <I>remember the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, 
 and the onions, and the garlick</I> (precious stuff indeed to be fond 
 of!), but they do not remember the brick-kilns and the task-masters, 
 the voice of the oppressor and the smart of the whip. No, these are 
 forgotten by these ungrateful people.

 (2.) They were sick of the good provision God had made for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 It was bread from heaven, angels' food. To show how unreasonable their 
 complaint was, it is here described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 It was good for food, and pleasant to the eye, every grain like an 
 orient pearl; it was wholesome food and nourishing; it was not to be 
 called <I>dry bread,</I> for it tasted like fresh oil; it was agreeable 
 (the Jews say, 

 <U>Wisd. xvi. 20</U>)

 to every man's palate, and tasted as he
 would have it; and, though it was still the same, yet, by the different 
 ways of dressing it, it yielded them a grateful variety; it cost them 
 no money, nor care, for it fell in the night, while they slept; and the 
 labour of gathering it was not worth speaking of; they lived upon free 
 quarter, and yet could talk of Egypt's cheapness and the fish they ate 
 there freely. Nay, which was much more valuable than all this, the 
 manna came from the immediate power and bounty of God, not from common 
 providence, but from special favour. It was, as God's compassion, new 
 every morning, always fresh, not as their food who live on shipboard.  
 While they lived on manna, they seemed to be exempted from the curse 
 which sin has brought on man, that in the <I>sweat of his face should 
 he eat bread.</I> And yet they speak of manna with such scorn, as if it 
 were not good enough to be meat for swine: <I>Our soul is dried 
 away.</I> They speak as if God dealt hardly with them in allowing them 
 no better food. At first they admired it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:15">Exod. xvi. 15</A>):

 <I>What is this?</I> "What a curious precious thing is this!" But now
 they despised it. Note, Peevish discontented minds will find fault with 
 that which has no fault in it but that it is too good for them. It is 
 very provoking to God to undervalue his favours, and to put a 
 <I>but</I> upon our common mercies. Nothing but manna! Those that might 
 be very happy often make themselves very miserable by their 
 discontents.

 (3.) They could not be satisfied unless they had flesh to eat. They 
 brought flocks and herds with them in great abundance out of Egypt; but 
 either they were covetous, and could not find in their hearts to kill 
 them, lest they should lessen their flocks (they must have flesh as 
 cheap as they had bread, or they would not be pleased), or else they 
 were curious, beef and mutton would not please them; they must have 
 something more nice and delicate, like the fish they did eat in Egypt.  
 Food would not serve; they must be feasted. They had feasted with God 
 upon the peace-offerings which they had their share of; but it seems 
 God did not keep a table good enough for them, they must have daintier 
 bits than any that came to his altar. Note, It is an evidence of the 
 dominion of the carnal mind when we are solicitous to have all the 
 delights and satisfactions of sense wound up to the height of 
 pleasurableness. <I>Be not desirous of dainties,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:1-3">Prov. xxiii. 1-3</A>.

 If God gives us food convenient, we ought to be thankful, though we do
 not eat the fat and drink the sweet.

 (4.) They distrusted the power and goodness of God as insufficient for 
 their supply: <I>Who will give us flesh to eat?</I> taking it for 
 granted that God could not. Thus this question is commented up on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19,20">Ps. lxxviii. 19, 20</A>,

 <I>Can he provide flesh also?</I> though he had given them flesh with
 their bread once, when he saw fit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:13">Exod. xvi. 13</A>),

 and they might have expected that he would do it again, and in mercy,
 if, instead of murmuring, they had prayed.  Note, It is an offence to 
 God to let our desires go beyond our faith.

 (5.) They were eager and importunate in their desires; they <I>lusted a
 lust,</I> so the word is, lusted greatly and greedily, till they wept
 again for vexation. So childish were the children of Israel, and so
 humoursome, that they cried because they had not what they would have
 and when they would have it. They did not offer up this desire to God,
 but would rather be beholden to any one else than to him. We should not
 indulge ourselves in any desire which we cannot in faith turn into
 prayer, as we cannot when we <I>ask meat for our lust,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:18">Ps. lxxviii. 18</A>.

 For this sin the <I>anger of the Lord was kindled greatly against
 them,</I> which is written for our admonition, that we should not 
 <I>lust after evil things as they lusted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:6">1 Cor. x. 6</A>.

 (6.) Flesh is good food, and may lawfully be eaten; yet they are said 
 to lust after evil things. What is lawful of itself becomes evil to us 
 when it is what God does not allot to us and yet we eagerly desire 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses himself, though so meek and good a man, is uneasy upon this 
 occasion: <I>Moses also was displeased.</I> Now, 

 1. It must be confessed that the provocation was very great. These 
 murmurings of theirs reflected great dishonour upon God, and Moses laid 
 to heart the reproaches cast on himself; they knew that he did his 
 utmost for their good, and that he neither did nor could do any thing 
 without a divine appointment; and yet to be thus continually teased and 
 clamoured against by an unreasonable ungrateful people would break in 
 upon the temper even of Moses himself. God considered this, and 
 therefore we do not find that he chided him for his uneasiness. 

 2. Yet Moses expressed himself otherwise than became him upon this 
 provocation, and came short of his duty both to God and Israel in these 
 expostulations.

 (1.) He undervalues the honour God had put upon him, in making him the 
 illustrious minister of his power and grace, in the deliverance and 
 guidance of that peculiar people, which might have been sufficient to 
 balance the burden.

 (2.) He complains too much of a sensible grievance, and lays too near 
 his heart a little noise and fatigue. If he could not bear the toil of 
 government, which was but running with the footman, how would he bear 
 the terrors of war, which was contending with horses?  He might easily 
 have furnished himself with considerations enough to enable him to 
 slight their clamours, and make nothing of them.

 (3.) He magnifies his own performances, that <I>all the burden of the 
 people lay upon him;</I> whereas God himself did in effect ease him of 
 all the burden. Moses needed not to be in care to provide quarters for 
 them, or victuals; God did all. And, if any difficult case happened, he 
 needed not to be in any perplexity, while he had the oracle to consult, 
 and in it the divine wisdom to direct him, the divine authority to back 
 him and bear him out, and almighty power itself to dispense rewards and 
 punishments.

 (4.) He is not so sensible as he ought to be of the obligation he lay 
 under, by virtue of the divine commission and command, to do the utmost 
 he could for his people, when he suggests that because they were not 
 the children of his body therefore he was not concerned to take a 
 fatherly care of them, though God himself, who might employ him as he 
 pleased, had appointed him to be a father to them.

 (5.) He takes too much to himself when he asks, <I>Whence should I have 
 flesh to give them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 as if he were the housekeeper, and not God. <I>Moses gave them not the 
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32">John vi. 32</A>.

 Nor was it expected that he should give them the flesh, but as an
 instrument in God's hand; and if he meant, "Whence should God have it 
 for them?" he too much limited the power of the Holy One of Israel.

 (6.) He speaks distrustfully of the divine grace when he despairs of 
 being <I>able to bear all this people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Had the work been much less, he could not have gone through it in his 
 own strength; but had it been much greater, through God strengthening 
 him, he might have done it.

 (7.) It was worst of all passionately to wish for death, and desire to 
 be killed out of hand, because just at this time his life was made a 
 little uneasy to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Is this Moses? Is this the meekest of all the men on the earth? The 
 best have their infirmities, and fail sometimes in the exercise of that 
 grace for which they are most eminent. But God graciously overlooked 
 Moses's passion at this time, and therefore we must not be severe in 
 our animadversions upon it, but pray, <I>Lord, lead us not into 
 temptation.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
 the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the
 people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
 tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
 thee.
 &nbsp; 17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will
 take of the spirit which <I>is</I> upon thee, and will put <I>it</I> upon
 them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee,
 that thou bear <I>it</I> not thyself alone.
 &nbsp; 18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
 morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for <I>it was</I>
 well with us in Egypt: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will give you flesh,
 and ye shall eat.
 &nbsp; 19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days,
 neither ten days, nor twenty days;
 &nbsp; 20 <I>But</I> even a whole month, until it come out at your
 nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have
 despised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which <I>is</I> among you, and have wept before him,
 saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
 &nbsp; 21 And Moses said, The people, among whom I <I>am,</I> <I>are</I> six
 hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them
 flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
 &nbsp; 22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
 them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for
 them, to suffice them?
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Is the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s hand waxed
 short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
 thee or not.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here God's gracious answer to both the foregoing complaints, 
 wherein his goodness takes occasion from man's badness to appear so 
 much the more illustrious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Provision is made for the redress of the grievances Moses complains 
 of. If he find the weight of government lie too heavy upon him, though 
 he was a little too passionate in his remonstrance, yet he shall be 
 eased, not by being discarded from the government himself, as he justly 
 might have been if God had been extreme to mark what he said amiss, but 
 by having assistants appointed him, who should be, as the apostle 
 speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:28">1 Cor. xii. 28</A>),

 <I>helps, governments</I> (that is, helps in government), not at all to
 lesson or eclipse his honour, but to make the work more easy to him, 
 and to <I>bear the burden of the people with him.</I> And that this 
 provision might be both agreeable and really serviceable,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Moses is directed to nominate the persons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The people were too hot and heady and tumultuous to be entrusted with 
 the election; Moses must please himself in the choice, that he may not 
 afterwards complain. The number he is to choose is seventy men, 
 according to the number of the souls that went down into Egypt. He must 
 choose such as he knew to be elders, that is, wise and experienced men. 
 Those that had acquitted themselves best, as <I>rulers of thousands and 
 hundreds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:25">Exod. xviii. 25</A>),

 purchase to themselves now this good degree. "Choose such as thou
 knowest to be elders indeed, and not in name only, officers that 
 execute their office." We read of the same number of elders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1">Exod. xxiv. 1</A>)

 that went up with Moses to Mount Sinai, but they were distinguished
 only for that occasion, these for a perpetuity; and, according to this 
 constitution, the Sanhedrim, or great council of the Jews, which in 
 after ages sat at Jerusalem, and was the highest court of judgment
 among them, consisted of seventy men.  Our Saviour seems to have had an
 eye to it in the choice of seventy disciples, who were to be assistants
 to the apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1-24">Luke x.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God promises to qualify them. If they were not found fit for the 
 employ, they should be made fit, else they might prove more a hindrance 
 than a help to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Though Moses had talked too boldly with God, yet God does not therefore 
 break off communion with him; he bears a great deal with us, and we 
 must with one another: <I>I will come down</I> (said God) <I>and talk 
 with thee,</I> when thou art more calm and composed; <I>and I will take 
 of the same spirit</I> of wisdom, and piety, and courage, <I>that is 
 upon thee,</I> and <I>put it upon them.</I> Not that Moses had the less 
 of the Spirit for their sharing, nor that they were hereby made equal 
 with him; Moses was still unequalled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:10">Deut. xxxiv. 10</A>),

 but they were clothed with a spirit of government proportionable to
 their place, and with a spirit of prophecy to prove their divine call 
 to it, the government being a Theocracy.  Note,

 (1.) Those whom God employs in any service he qualifies for it, and
 those that are not in some measure qualified cannot think themselves 
 duly called.

 (2.) All good qualifications are from God; every <I>perfect gift is
 from the Father of lights.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Even the humour of the discontented people shall be gratified too, 
 that every mouth may be stopped. They are ordered to <I>sanctify 
 themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, to put themselves into a posture to receive such a proof of 
 God's power as should be a token both of mercy and judgment. <I>Prepare 
 to meet thy God, O Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:12">Amos iv. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God promises (shall I say?)--he threatens rather, that they shall
 have their fill of flesh, that for a month together they shall not only 
 be fed, but feasted, with flesh, besides their daily manna; and, if 
 they have not a better government of their appetites than now it 
 appears they have they shall be surfeited with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 You shall eat <I>till it come out at your nostrils, and become 
 loathsome to you.</I> See here,

 (1.) The vanity of all the delights of sense; they will cloy, but not 
 satisfy: spiritual pleasures are the contrary. As the world passes 
 away, so do the lusts of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:17">1 John ii. 17</A>.

 What was greedily coveted in a little time comes to be nauseated.

 (2.) What brutish sins (and worse than brutish) gluttony and
 drunkenness are; they put a force upon nature, and make that the 
 sickness of the body which should be its health; they are sins that are 
 their own punishments, and yet not the worst that attend them.

 (3.) What a righteous thing it is with God to make that loathsome to 
 men which they have inordinately lusted after. God could make them 
 despise flesh as much as they had despised manna.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses objects the improbability of making good this word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.
 
 It is an objection like that which the disciples made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:4">Mark viii. 4</A>,

 <I>Whence can a man satisfy these men?</I> Some excuse Moses here, and
 construe what he says as only a modest enquiry which way the supply 
 must be expected; but it savours too much of diffidence and distrust of 
 God to be justified. He objects the number of the people, as if he that 
 provided bread for them all could not, by the same unlimited power, 
 provide flesh too.  He reckons it must be the flesh either of beasts or 
 fishes, because they are the most bulky animals, little thinking that 
 the flesh of birds, little birds, should serve the purpose. God sees 
 not as man sees, but his thoughts are above ours. He objects the 
 greediness of the people's desires in that word, <I>to suffice 
 them.</I> Note, Even true and great believers sometimes find it hard to 
 trust God under the discouragements of second causes, and <I>against 
 hope to believe in hope.</I> Moses himself could scarcely forbear 
 saying, <I>Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</I> when this had 
 become the common cry. No doubt this was his infirmity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God gives a short but sufficient answer to the objection in that 
 question, <I>Has the Lord's hand waxed short?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 If Moses had remembered <I>the years of the right hand of the Most 
 High,</I> he would not have started all these difficulties; therefore 
 God reminds him of them, intimating that this objection reflected upon 
 the divine power, of which he himself had been so often, not only the 
 witness, but the instrument. Had he forgotten what wonders the divine 
 power had wrought for that people, when it inflicted the plagues of 
 Egypt, divided the sea, broached the rock, and rained bread from 
 heaven? Had that power abated? Was God weaker than he used to be? Or 
 was he tired with what he had done? Whatever our unbelieving hearts may 
 suggest to the contrary, it is certain,

 (1.) That God's hand is not short; his power cannot be restrained in 
 the exerting of itself by any thing but his own will; with him nothing 
 is impossible. That hand is not short which measures the waters, metes 
 out the heavens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:12">Isa. xl. 12</A>),

 and grasps the winds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>.

 (2.) That it has not waxed short. He is as strong as ever he was, 
 <I>fainteth not, neither is weary.</I> And this is sufficient to 
 silence all our distrusts when means fail us, <I>Is any thing too hard 
 for the Lord?</I> God here brings Moses to this first principle, sets 
 him back in his lesson, to learn the ancient name of God, <I>The Lord 
 God Almighty,</I> and puts the proof upon the issue: <I>Thou shalt see 
 whether my word shall come to pass or not.</I> This magnifies God's 
 word above all his name, that his works never come short of it. If he 
 speaks, it is done.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people,
 and set them round about the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 25 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
 took of the spirit that <I>was</I> upon him, and gave <I>it</I> unto the
 seventy elders: and it came to pass, <I>that,</I> when the spirit
 rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
 &nbsp; 26 But there remained two <I>of the</I> men in the camp, the name of
 the one <I>was</I> Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the
 spirit rested upon them; and they <I>were</I> of them that were
 written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they
 prophesied in the camp.
 &nbsp; 27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad
 and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
 &nbsp; 28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, <I>one</I> of
 his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
 that all the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s people were prophets, <I>and</I> that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 would put his spirit upon them!

 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the performance of God's word to Moses, that he should 
 have help in the government of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the case of the seventy privy-counsellors in general. Moses, 
 though a little disturbed by the tumult of the people, yet was 
 thoroughly composed by the communion he had with God, and soon came to 
 himself again. And according as the matter was concerted, 

 1. He did his part; he presented the seventy elders before the Lord,
 round the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 that they might there stand ready to receive the grace of God, in the 
 place where he manifested himself, and that the people also might be 
 witnesses of their solemn call. Note, Those that expect favour from God 
 must humbly offer themselves and their service to him.

 2. God was not wanting to do his part. <I>He gave of his Spirit to the
 seventy elders</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 which enabled those whose capacities and education set them but on a 
 level with their neighbours of a sudden to say and do that which was 
 extraordinary, and which proved them to be actuated by divine 
 inspiration: they prophesied, and did not cease all that day, and (some 
 think) only that day. They discoursed to the people of the things of 
 God, and perhaps commented upon the law they had lately received with 
 admirable clearness, and fulness, and readiness, and aptness of 
 expression, so that all who heard them might see and say that <I>God 
 was with them of a truth;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25">1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25</A>.

 Thus, long afterwards, Saul was marked for the government by the gift
 of prophecy, which came upon him for a day and a night, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:6,11">1 Sam. x. 6, 11</A>.

 When Moses was to fetch Israel out of Egypt, Aaron was appointed to be
 his prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1">Exod. vii. 1</A>.

 But, now that God had called Aaron to other work, in his room Moses has
 seventy prophets to attend him. Note, Those are fittest to rule in 
 God's Israel that are well acquainted with divine things and are apt to 
 teach to edification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the particular case of two of them, <I>Eldad</I> and 
 <I>Medad,</I> probably two brothers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were nominated by Moses to be assistants in the government, but 
 they <I>went not out unto the tabernacle</I> as the rest did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 Calvin conjectures that the summons was sent them, but that it did not 
 find them, they being somewhere out of the way; so that, though they 
 were written, yet they were not called. Most think that they declined 
 coming to the tabernacle out of an excess of modesty and humility; 
 being sensible of their own weakness and unworthiness, they desired to 
 be excused from coming into the government. Their principle was their 
 praise, but their practice in not obeying orders was their fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The Spirit of God found them out in the camp, where they were hidden 
 among the stuff, and there they prophesied, that is, they exercised 
 their gift of praying, preaching, and praising God, in some private 
 tent. Note, The Spirit of God is not tied to the tabernacle, but, 
 <I>like the wind, blows where he listeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:8">John iii. 8</A>.

 <I>Whither can we go from that Spirit?</I> There was a special
 providence in it that these two should be absent, for thus it appeared 
 that it was indeed a divine Spirit which the elders were actuated by, 
 and that Moses gave them not that Spirit, but God himself. They 
 modestly declined preferment, but God forced it upon them; nay, they 
 have the honour of being <I>named,</I> which the rest have not: for 
 those that humble themselves shall be exalted, and those are most fit 
 for government who are least ambitious of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Information of this was given to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp;</I> there is a conventicle 
 in such a tent, and Eldad and Medad are holding forth there, from under 
 the inspection and presidency of Moses, and out of the communion of the 
 rest of the elders." Whoever the person was that brought the tidings, 
 he seems to have looked upon it as an irregularity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Joshua moved to have them silenced: <I>My lord Moses, forbid 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is probable that Joshua himself was one of the seventy, which made
 him the more jealous for the honour of their order.  He takes it for 
 granted that they were not under any necessitating impulse, <I>for the 
 spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets,</I> and therefore he 
 would have them either not to prophesy at all or to come to the 
 tabernacle and prophesy in concert with the rest. He does not desire 
 that they should be punished for what they had done, but only 
 restrained for the future. This motion he made from a good principle, 
 not out of any personal dislike to Eldad and Medad, but out of an 
 honest zeal for that which he apprehended to be the unity of the 
 church, and concern for the honour of God and Moses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Moses rejected the motion, and reproved him that made it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Enviest thou for my sake?</I> Thou knowest not what manner of 
 spirit thou art of." Though Joshua was Moses's particular friend and 
 confidant, though he said this out of a respect to Moses, whose honour 
 he was very loth to see lessened by the call of those elders, yet Moses 
 reproves him, and in him all that show such a spirit. 

 (1.) We must not secretly grieve at the gifts, graces, and usefulness
 of others. It was the fault of John's disciples that they envied 
 Christ's honour because it shaded their master's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:26-36">John iii. 26</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) We must not be transported into heats against the weaknesses and 
 infirmities of others. Granting that Eldad and Medad were guilty of an 
 irregularity, yet Joshua was too quick and too warm upon them. Our zeal 
 must always be tempered with the meekness of wisdom: the righteousness 
 of God needs not the wrath of man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20">Jam. i. 20</A>.

 (3.) We must not make even the best and most useful men heads of a 
 party. Paul would not have his name made use of to patronise a faction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:12,13">1 Cor. i. 12, 13</A>.

 (4.) We must not be forward to condemn and silence those that differ
 from us, as if they did not follow Christ because they do not follow 
 <I>him with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:38">Mark ix. 38</A>.

 Shall we reject those whom Christ has owned, or restrain any from doing
 good because they are not in every thing of our mind? Moses was of 
 another spirit; so far from silencing these two, and quenching the 
 Spirit in them, he wished <I>all the Lord's people were prophets,</I> 
 that is, that he would <I>put his Spirit upon them.</I> Not that he 
 would have any set up for prophets that were not duly qualified, or 
 that he expected that the Spirit of prophecy should be made thus 
 common; but thus he expresses the love and esteem he had for <I>all the 
 Lord's people,</I> the complacency he took in the gifts of others, and 
 how far he was from being displeased at Eldad and Medad's prophesying 
 from under his eye. Such an excellent spirit as this blessed Paul was 
 of, rejoicing that Christ was preached, though it was by those who 
 therein intended to <I>add affliction to his bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:16">Phil. i. 16</A>.

 We ought to be pleased that God is served and glorified, and good done, 
 though to the lessening of our credit and the credit of our way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The elders, now newly ordained, immediately entered upon their 
 administration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 when their call was sufficiently attested by their prophesying, they 
 went with Moses to the camp, and applied themselves to business. Having 
 received the gift, they <I>ministered the same as good stewards.</I> 
 And now Moses was pleased that he had so many to share with him in his 
 work and honour. And,

 (1.) Let the testimony of Moses be credited by those who desire to be
 in power, that government is a burden. It is a burden of care and 
 trouble to those who make conscience of the duty of it; and to those 
 who do not it will prove a heavier burden in the day of account, when 
 they fall under the doom of the unprofitable servant that buried his 
 talent.

 (2.) Let the example of Moses be imitated by those that are in power;
 let them not despise the advice and assistance of others, but desire 
 it, and be thankful for it, not coveting to monopolize wisdom and 
 power. In the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</P>

 <I>high</I> upon the face of the earth.
 &nbsp; 32 And the people stood up all that day, and all <I>that</I> night,
 and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
 gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread <I>them</I> all
 abroad for themselves round about the camp.
 &nbsp; 33 And while the flesh <I>was</I> yet between their teeth, ere it
 was chewed, the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against the people,
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> smote the people with a very great plague.

 God, having performed his promise to Moses by giving him assessors in 
 the government, thereby proving the power he has over the spirits of 
 men by his Spirit, he here performs his promise to the people by giving 
 them flesh, proving thereby his power over the inferior creatures and 
 his dominion in the kingdom of nature. Observe, 

 1. How the people were gratified with flesh in abundance: <I>A wind</I>
 (a south-east wind, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:26">Ps. lxxviii. 26</A>)

 <I>brought quails,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 It is uncertain what sort of animals they were; the psalmist
 calls them <I>feathered fowl,</I> or <I>fowl of wing.</I> The learned 
 bishop Patrick inclines to agree with some modern writers, who think 
 they were <I>locusts,</I> a delicious sort of food well known in those 
 parts, the rather because they were brought with a wind, lay in heaps, 
 and were dried in the sun for use. Whatever they were, they answered 
 the intention, they served for a month's feast for Israel, such an 
 indulgent Father was God to his froward family. Locusts, that had been 
 a plague to fruitful Egypt, feeding upon the fruits, were a blessing to 
 a barren wilderness, being themselves fed upon. 

 2. How greedy they were of this flesh that God sent them. They <I>flew 
 upon the spoil</I> with an unsatiable appetite, not regarding what 
 Moses had told them from God, that they would surfeit upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Two days and a night they were at it, gathering flesh, till every
 master of a family had brought home ten homers (that is, ten ass-loads) 
 at least. David longed for the water of the well of Bethlehem, but 
 would not drink it when he had it, because it was obtained by 
 venturing; much more reason these Israelites had to refuse this flesh, 
 which was obtained by murmuring, and which, they might easily perceive, 
 by what Moses said, was given them in anger; but those that are under 
 the power of a carnal mind will have their lusts fulfilled, though it 
 be to the certain damage and ruin of their precious souls. 

 3. How dearly they paid for their feasts, when it came into the 
 reckoning: <I>The Lord smote them with a very great plague</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 some bodily disease, which probably was the effect of their surfeit, 
 and was the death of many of them, and those, it is likely, the 
 ringleaders in the mutiny. Note, God often grants the desires of his 
 own people in love. He <I>gave them their request,</I> but <I>sent 
 leanness into their soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:15">Ps. xvi. 15</A>.

 By all that was said to them they <I>were not estranged from their
 lusts,</I> and therefore, <I>while the meat was in their mouths, the 
 wrath of God came upon them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:30,31">Ps. lxxviii. 30, 31</A>.

 What we inordinately desire, if we obtain it (we have reason to fear),
 will be some way or other a grief and cross to us. God satiated them 
 first, and then plagued them,

 (1.) To save the reputation of his own power, that it might not be
 said, "He would not have cut them off had he been able to supply them." 
 And,

 (2.) To show us the meaning of the prosperity of sinners; it is their
 preparation for ruin, they are fed as an ox for the slaughter. 
 <I>Lastly,</I> The remembrance of this is preserved in the name given 
 to the place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Moses called it <I>Kibroth-hattaavah,</I> the <I>graves of lusters</I> 
 or <I>of lust.</I> And well it had been if these graves of Israel's 
 lusters had proved the graves of Israel's lust: the warning was 
 designed to be so, but it had not its due effect, for it follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:32">Ps. lxxviii. 32</A>),

 <I>For all this, they sinned still.</I></P>
