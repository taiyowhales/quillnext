 In this chapter we have a further account concerning Abram. 
 I. In general, of his condition and behaviour in the land of promise, 
 which was now the land of his pilgrimage. 
 
 1. His removes,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, 
 he, and his wife, and all that 
 he had, and Lot with him, into the 
 south.
 &nbsp; 2 And Abram <I>was</I> very rich 
 in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
 &nbsp; 3 And he went on his journeys from 
 the south even to Beth-el, unto the 
 place where his tent had been at the 
 beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;
 &nbsp; 4 Unto the place of the altar, which 
 he had made there at the first: and 
 there Abram called on the name of 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Abram's return out of Egypt, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 He came himself and brought all his 
 with him back again to Canaan. Note, 
 Though there may be occasion to go sometimes 
 into places of temptation, yet we must 
 hasten out of them as soon as possible. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:6">Ruth i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His wealth: <I>He was very rich,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 He was very <I>heavy,</I> so the Hebrew word signifies; 
 for <I>riches are a burden,</I> and those 
 that <I>will be rich do but load themselves with 
 thick clay,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:6">Hab. ii. 6</A>.
 There is a burden 
 
 <A NAME="Page90"> </A>

 of care in getting them, fear in keeping 
 them, temptation in using them, guilt in 
 abusing them, sorrow in losing them, and 
 a burden of account, at last, to be given up 
 concerning them. Great possessions do but 
 make men heavy and unwieldy. Abram was 
 not only rich in faith and good works, and 
 in the promises, but he was <I>rich in 
 cattle, and in silver and gold.</I> Note, 
 
 1. God, in his 
 providence, sometimes makes good men rich 
 men, and teaches them how to abound, as 
 well as how to suffer want. 
 
 2. The riches 
 of good men are the fruits of God's blessing. 
 God has said to Abram, <I>I will bless thee;</I> 
 and that blessing made him rich without 
 sorrow, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:22">Prov. x. 22</A>.

 3. True piety will very 
 well consist with great prosperity. Though 
 it is hard for a rich man to get to heaven,
 yet it is not impossible, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:23,24">Mark x. 23, 24</A>.
 Abram was very rich and yet very religious. 
 Nay, as piety is a friend to outward prosperity
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8">1 Tim. iv. 8</A>),
 so outward prosperity, 
 if well-managed, is an ornament to piety, 
 and furnishes an opportunity of doing so 
 much the more good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His removal to Beth-el, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 Thither 
 he went, not only because there he had formerly 
 had his tent, and he was willing to go 
 among his old acquaintance, but because 
 there he had formerly had his altar: and, 
 though the altar was gone (probably he 
 himself having taken it down, when he left 
 the place, lest it should be polluted by the 
 idolatrous Canaanites), yet he <I>came to the 
 place of the altar,</I> either to revive the remembrance 
 of the sweet communion he had 
 had with God in that place, or perhaps to 
 pay the vows he had there made to God when 
 he undertook his journey into Egypt. Long 
 afterwards God sent Jacob to this same place 
 on that errand
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 1</A>),
 <I>Go up to Beth-el, 
 where thou vowedst the vow.</I> We have 
 need to be reminded, and should take all occasions 
 to remind ourselves, of our solemn 
 vows; and perhaps the place where they were 
 made may help to bring them afresh to mind, 
 and it may therefore do us good to visit it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His devotion there. His altar was 
 gone, so that he could not offer sacrifice; 
 but <I>he called on the name of the Lord,</I> as 
 he had done,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:8"><I>ch.</I> xii. 8</A>.
 Note, 1. All God's 
 people are praying people. You may as soon 
 find a living man without breath as a living 
 Christian without prayer. 
 
 2. Those that 
 would approve themselves upright with 
 their God must be constant and persevering 
 in the services of religion. Abram did not 
 leave his religion behind him in Egypt, as 
 many do in their travels. 
 
 3. When we cannot 
 do <I>what we would</I> we must make conscience 
 of doing <I>what we can</I> in the acts of 
 devotion. When we want an altar, let us 
 not be wanting in prayer, but, wherever we 
 are, call on the name of the Lord.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And Lot also, which went with 
 Abram, had flocks, and herds, and 
 tents.
 &nbsp; 6 And the land was not 
 able to bear them, that they might 
 dwell together: for their substance 
 was great, so that they could not
 dwell together.
 &nbsp; 7 And there was a 
 strife between the herdmen of Abram's 
 cattle and the herdmen of Lot's 
 cattle: and the Canaanite and the
 Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
 &nbsp; 8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let 
 there be no strife, I pray thee, between 
 me and thee, and between my 
 herdmen and thy herdmen; for we <I>be</I> 
 brethren.
 &nbsp; 9 <I>Is</I> not the whole land 
 before thee? separate thyself, I pray
 thee, from me: if <I>thou wilt take</I> the 
 left hand, then I will go to the right; 
 or if <I>thou depart</I> to the right hand, 
 then I will go to the left.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an unhappy falling out 
 between Abram and Lot, who had hitherto 
 been inseparable companions (see
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,
 and 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:4"><I>ch.</I> xii. 4</A>),
 but now parted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion of their quarrel was their 
 riches. We read
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 how rich Abram was; 
 now here we are told
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 that <I>Lot, who 
 went with Abram,</I> was rich too; and therefore 
 God blessed him with riches because he 
 went with Abram. Note, 
 
 1. It is good being 
 in good company, and going with those with 
 whom God is, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 2. Those that 
 are partners with God's people in their obedience 
 and sufferings shall be sharers with 
 them in their joys and comforts, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:10">Isa. lxvi. 10</A>.
 Now, they both being very rich, <I>the 
 land was not able to bear them, that they 
 might dwell</I> comfortably and peaceably together. 
 So that their riches may be considered, 
 
 (1.) As setting them at a distance 
 one from another. Because the place was 
 too strait for them, and they had not room 
 for their stock, it was necessary they should 
 live asunder. Note, Every comfort in this 
 world has its cross attending it. Business is 
 a comfort; but it has this inconvenience in 
 it, that it allows us not the society of those 
 we love, so often, nor so long, as we could 
 wish. 
 
 (2.) As setting them at variance one 
 with another. Note, Riches are often an 
 occasion of strife and contention among relations 
 and neighbours. This is one of those
 <I>foolish and hurtful lusts which those that will
 be rich fall into,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9">1 Tim. vi. 9</A>.
 Riches not 
 only afford matter for contention, and are 
 the things most commonly striven about, 
 but they also stir up a spirit of contention, 
 by making people proud and covetous. <I>Meum</I> 
 and <I>tuum--Mine</I> and <I>thine,</I> are the great 
 make-bates of the world. Poverty and travail, 
 wants and wanderings, could not separate 
 between Abram and Lot; but riches 
 did. Friends are soon lost; but God is a 
 
 <A NAME="Page91"> </A>

 friend from whose love neither the height of 
 prosperity nor the depth of adversity shall 
 separate us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The immediate instruments of the 
 quarrel were their servants. The strife began 
 between <I>the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and 
 the herdsmen of Lot's cattle,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 They 
 strove, it is probable, which should have the 
 better pasture or the better water; and both 
 interested their masters in the quarrel. Note, 
 Bad servants often make a great deal of mischief 
 in families, by the pride and passion, 
 their lying slandering, and tale-bearing. It 
 is a very wicked thing for servants to do ill 
 offices between relations and neighbours, and 
 to sow discord; those that do so are the devil's 
 agents and their masters' worst enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The aggravation of the quarrel was 
 that <I>the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then 
 in the land;</I> this made the quarrel, 
 
 1. Very dangerous. If Abram and Lot cannot agree 
 to feed their flocks together, it is well if the 
 common enemy do not come upon them and 
 plunder them both. Note, The division of 
 families and churches often proves the ruin 
 of them. 
 
 2. Very scandalous. No doubt 
 the eyes of all the neighbours were upon 
 them, especially because of the singularity of 
 their religion, and the extraordinary sanctity 
 they professed; and notice would soon be 
 taken of this quarrel, and improvement made 
 of it, to their reproach, by the Canaanites and 
 Perizzites. Note, The quarrels of professors 
 are the reproach of profession, and give occasion, 
 as much as any thing, to the enemies 
 of the Lord to blaspheme.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The making up of this quarrel was 
 very happy. It is best to preserve the peace, 
 that it be not broken; but the next best is, 
 if differences do happen, with all speed to 
 accommodate them, and quench the fire that 
 has broken out. The motion for staying this 
 strife was made by Abram, though he was 
 the senior and superior relation,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His petition for peace was very affectionate: 
 <I>Let there be not strife, I pray thee.</I> 
 Abram here shows himself to be a man, 
 
 (1.) Of a cool spirit, that had the command of his 
 passion, and knew how to turn away wrath 
 with a soft answer. Those that would keep 
 the peace must never render railing for railing. 
 
 (2.) Of a condescending spirit; he was 
 willing to beseech even his inferior to be at 
 peace, and made the first overture of reconciliation. 
 Conquerors reckon it their glory 
 to give peace by power; and it is no less so 
 to give peace by the meekness of wisdom. 
 Note, The people of God should always approve 
 themselves a peaceable people; whatever 
 others are for, they must be for peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His plea for peace was very cogent. 
 
 (1.) "Let there be no strife <I>between me and 
 thee.</I> Let the Canaanites and Perizzites contend 
 about trifles; but let not thee and me 
 fall out, who know better things, and look 
 for a better country." Note, Professors of 
 religion should, of all others, be careful to 
 avoid contention. <I>You shall not be so,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:26">Luke xxii. 26</A>.
 <I>We have no such custom,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:16">1 Cor. xi. 16</A>.
 "Let there be no strife <I>between me and 
 thee,</I> who have lived together and loved one 
 another so long." Note, The remembrance 
 of old friendships should quickly put an end 
 to new quarrels which at any time happen. 
 
 (2.) Let it be remembered that <I>we are brethren,</I> 
 Heb. <I>we are men brethren;</I> a double argument. 
 
 [1.] We are men; and, as men, we are 
 mortal creatures--we may die to-morrow, 
 and are concerned to be found in peace. We 
 are rational creatures, and should be ruled 
 by reason. We are men, and not brutes, 
 men, and not children; we are sociable creatures, 
 let us be so to the uttermost. 
 
 [2.] We are brethren. Men of the same nature, 
 of the same kindred and family, of the same 
 religion, companions in obedience, companions 
 in patience. Note, The consideration 
 of our relation to each other, as brethren, should 
 always prevail to moderate our passions, and 
 either to prevent or put an end to our contentions. 
 Brethren should love as brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His proposal for peace was very fair. 
 Many who profess to be for peace yet will 
 do nothing towards it; but Abram hereby 
 approved himself a real friend to peace that 
 he proposed an unexceptionable expedient 
 for the preserving of it: <I>Is not the whole land 
 before thee?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 As if he had said, "Why 
 should we quarrel for room, while there is 
 room enough for us both?" 
 
 (1.) He concludes 
 that they must part, and is very 
 desirous that they should part friends: <I>Separate 
 thyself, I pray thee, from me.</I> What 
 could be expressed more affectionately? He 
 does not expel him, and force him away, but 
 advises that he should separate himself. Nor 
 does he charge him to depart, but humbly 
 desires him to withdraw. Note, Those that 
 have power to command, yet sometimes, for 
 love's sake, and peace' sake, should rather 
 beseech as Paul besought Philemon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Philemon+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 When the great God condescends to 
 beseech us, we may well afford to beseech 
 one another, to <I>be reconciled,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:20">2 Cor. v. 20</A>.

 (2.) He offers him a sufficient share of the 
 land they were in. Though God had promised 
 Abram to give this land to his seed 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:7"><I>ch.</I> xii. 7</A>),
 and it does not appear that ever 
 any such promise was made to Lot, which 
 Abram might have insisted on, to the total 
 exclusion of Lot, yet he allows him to come 
 in partner with him, and tenders an equal 
 share to one that had not an equal right, and 
 will not make God's promise to patronise his 
 quarrel, nor, under the protection of that, put 
 any hardship on his kinsman. 
 
 (3.) He gives 
 him his choice, and offers to take up with his 
 leavings: <I>If thou wilt take the left hand, I will 
 go to the right.</I> There was all the reason in 
 the world that Abram should choose first; yet 
 he recedes from his right. Note, It is a 
 noble conquest to be willing to yield for 
 peace' sake; it is the conquest of ourselves, 
 and our own pride and passion, 

 <A NAME="Page92"> </A>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39,40">Matt. v. 39, 40</A>.
 It is not only the punctilios of honour, 
 but even interest itself, that in many cases 
 must be sacrificed to peace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and 
 beheld all the plain of Jordan, that 
 it <I>was</I> well watered every where, before 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> destroyed Sodom and 
 Gomorrah, <I>even</I> as the garden of the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, like the land of Egypt, as 
 thou comest unto Zoar. 
 &nbsp; 11 Then 
 Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; 
 and Lot journeyed east: and they 
 separated themselves the one from 
 the other.
 &nbsp; 12 Abram dwelled in the 
 land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in 
 the cities of the plain, and pitched <I>his</I> 
 tent toward Sodom.
 &nbsp; 13 But the men 
 of Sodom <I>were</I> wicked and sinners 
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> exceedingly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the choice that Lot made 
 when he parted from Abram. Upon this
 occasion, one would have expected, 
 
 1. That 
 he should have expressed an unwillingness
 to part from Abram, and that, at least, he 
 should have done it with reluctancy. 
 
 2. That he should have been so civil as to have 
 remitted the choice back again to Abram. 
 But we find not any instance of deference 
 or respect to his uncle in the whole management. 
 Abram having offered him the choice, 
 without compliment he accepted it, and made 
 his election. Passion and selfishness make 
 men rude. Now, in the choice which Lot 
 made, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How much he had an eye to the goodness 
 of the land. He <I>beheld all the plain of 
 Jordan,</I> the flat country in which Sodom 
 stood, that it was admirably <I>well watered every 
 where</I> (and perhaps the strife had been about 
 water, which made him particularly fond of 
 that convenience), and so <I>Lot chose all that 
 plain,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 That valley, which was like 
 the garden of Eden itself, now yielded him 
 a most pleasant prospect. It was, in his eye, 
 beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole 
 earth; and therefore he doubted not but that 
 it would yield him a comfortable settlement, 
 and that in such a fruitful soil he should certainly 
 thrive, and grow very rich: and this 
 was all he looked at. But what came of it? 
 Why, the next news we hear of him is that 
 he is in the briars among them, he and his 
 carried captive. While he lived among them, 
 he vexed his righteous soul with their conversation, 
 and never had a good day with 
 them, till, at last, God fired the town over his 
 head, and forced him to the mountain for 
 safety who chose the plain for wealth and 
 pleasure. Note, Sensual choices are sinful 
 choices, and seldom speed well. Those who 
 in choosing relations, callings, dwellings, or 
 settlements are guided and governed by the 
 lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, or the 
 pride of life, and consult not the interests of 
 their souls and their religion, cannot expect 
 God's presence with them, nor his blessing 
 upon them, but are commonly disappointed 
 even in that which they principally aimed at, 
 and miss of that which they promised themselves 
 satisfaction in. In all our choices this 
 principle should overrule us, That that is 
 best for us which is best for our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How little he considered the wickedness 
 of the inhabitants: <I>But the men of Sodom 
 were wicked,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Note,

 1. Though all are
 sinners, yet some are greater sinners than
 others. The men of Sodom were sinners of
 the first magnitude, <I>sinners before the Lord,</I>
 that is, impudent daring sinners; they were
 so to a proverb. Hence we read of those
 that <I>declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it
 not,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9">Isa. iii. 9</A>.

 2. That some sinners are the
 worse for living in a good land. So the
 Sodomites were: for this was the iniquity of
 Sodom, <I>pride, fulness of bread, and abundance
 of idleness;</I> and all these were supported by
 the great plenty their country afforded, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>.
 Thus <I>the prosperity of fools destroys 
 them.</I> 
 
 3. That God often gives great plenty 
 to great sinners. Filthy Sodomites dwell in 
 a city, in a fruitful plain, while faithful 
 Abram and his pious family dwell in tents 
 upon the barren mountains. 
 
 4. When wickedness 
 has come to the height, ruin is not far 
 off. Abounding sins are sure presages of 
 approaching judgments. Now Lot's coming 
 to dwell among the Sodomites may be considered, 
 
 (1.) As a great mercy to them, and 
 a likely means of bringing them to repentance; 
 for now they had a prophet among them and 
 a preacher of righteousness, and, if they had 
 hearkened to him, they might have been reformed, 
 and the ruin prevented. Note, God 
 sends preachers, before he sends destroyers; 
 for he is not <I>willing that any should perish.</I> 
 
 (2.) As a great affliction to Lot, who was not 
 only grieved to see their wickedness 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:7,8">2 Pet. ii. 7, 8</A>),
 but was molested and persecuted by 
 them, because he would not do as they did. 
 Note, It has often been the vexatious lot of 
 good men to live among wicked neighbours, 
 to <I>sojourn in Mesech</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:5">Ps. cxx. 5</A>),
 and it cannot 
 but be the more grievous, if, as Lot here, 
 they have brought it upon themselves by an 
 unadvised choice.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Abram, 
 after that Lot was separated from 
 him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look 
 from the place where thou art northward, 
 and southward, and eastward, 
 and westward: 
 &nbsp; 15 For all the land 
 which thou seest, to thee will I give 
 it, and to thy seed for ever.
 &nbsp; 16 And 
 I will make thy seed as the dust of 
 the earth: so that if a man can number 
 the dust of the earth, <I>then</I> shall 
 thy seed also be numbered.
 &nbsp; 17 Arise, 
 
 <A NAME="Page93"> </A>

 walk through the land in the length 
 of it and in the breadth of it; for I 
 will give it unto thee.
 &nbsp; 18 Then 
 Abram removed <I>his</I> tent, and came 
 and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, 
 which <I>is</I> in Hebron, and built there 
 an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of a gracious 
 visit which God paid to Abram, to confirm 
 the promise to him and his. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When it was that God renewed and 
 ratified the promise: <I>After that Lot was 
 separated from him,</I> that is, 
 
 1. After the 
 quarrel was over; for those are best prepared 
 for the visits of divine grace whose spirits 
 are calm and sedate, and not ruffled with any 
 passion. 
 
 2. After Abram's humble self-denying 
 condescensions to Lot for the preserving 
 of peace. It was then that God came 
 to him with this token of his favour. Note, 
 God will abundantly make up in spiritual peace 
 what we lose for the preservation of neighbourly 
 peace. When Abram had willingly 
 offered Lot one-half of his right, God came, 
 and confirmed the whole to him. 
 
 3. After 
 he had lost the comfortable society of his 
 kinsman, by whose departure his hands were 
 weakened and his heart was saddened, then 
 God came to him with these good words and 
 comfortable words. Note, Communion with 
 God may, at any time, serve to make up the 
 want of conversation with our friends; when 
 our relations are separated from us, yet God 
 is not. 
 
 4. After Lot had chosen that pleasant 
 fruitful vale, and had gone to take possession 
 of it, lest Abram should be tempted 
 to envy him and to repent that he had given 
 him the choice, God comes to him, and 
 assures him that what he had should remain 
 to him and <I>his heirs for ever;</I> so that, though 
 Lot perhaps had the better land, yet Abram 
 had the better <I>title.</I> Lot had the paradise, 
 such as it was, but Abram had the promise; 
 and the event soon made it appear that, however 
 it seemed now, Abram had really the 
 better part. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:20">Job xxii. 20</A>.
 God owned 
 Abram after his strife with Lot, as the 
 churches owned Paul after his strife with 
 Barnabas, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:39,40">Acts xv. 39, 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promises themselves with which 
 God now comforted and enriched Abram. 
 Two things he assures him of--a good land, 
 and a numerous issue to enjoy it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the grant of a good land, a land 
 famous above all lands, for it was to be the 
 holy land, and Immanuel's land; this is the 
 land here spoken of. 
 
 (1.) God here shows 
 Abram the land, as he had promised
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:1"><I>ch.</I> xii. 1</A>),
 and afterwards he showed it to Moses 
 from the top of Pisgah. <I>Lot had lifted up 
 his eyes and beheld the plain of Jordan</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 and he had gone to enjoy what he saw: 
 "Come," says God to Abram, "<I>now lift thou 
 up thy eyes, and look, and see thy own.</I>" Note, 
 That which God has to show us is infinitely 
 better and more desirable than any thing 
 that the world has to offer our view. The 
 prospects of an eye of faith are much more 
 rich and beautiful than those of an eye of 
 sense. Those for whom the heavenly Canaan 
 is designed in the other world have sometimes, 
 by faith, a comfortable prospect of it 
 in their present state; for we look at the 
 <I>things that are not seen,</I> as real, though 
 distant. 
 
 (2.) He secures this land to him 
 and his seed for ever
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 <I>To thee will I 
 give it;</I> and again
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)
 <I>I will give it unto 
 thee;</I> every repetition of the promise is a 
 ratification of it. <I>To thee and thy seed,</I> not 
 to Lot and his seed; they were not to have 
 their inheritance in this land, and therefore 
 Providence so ordered it that Lot should be 
 separated from Abram first, and then the 
 grant should be confirmed to him and 
 his seed. Thus God often brings good out 
 of evil, and makes men's sins and follies 
 subservient to his own wise and holy counsels. 
 <I>To thee and thy seed</I>--to thee to sojourn in as 
 a stranger, to thy seed to dwell and rule in 
 as proprietors. <I>To thee,</I> that is, <I>to thy seed.</I> 
 The granting of it to him and his for ever 
 intimates that it was typical of the heavenly 
 Canaan, which is given to the spiritual seed 
 of Abram for ever, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14">Heb. xi. 14</A>.
 
 (3.) He 
 gives him livery and seisin of it, though it 
 was a reversion: "<I>Arise, walk through the 
 land,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 Enter, and take possession, 
 survey the parcels, and it will appear better 
 than upon a distant prospect." Note, God 
 is willing more abundantly to show to the 
 heirs of promise the immutability of his covenant, 
 and the inestimable worth of covenant 
 blessings. <I>Go, walk about Sion,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:12">Ps. xlviii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the promise of a numerous 
 issue to replenish this good land, so that it 
 should never be lost for want of heirs
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 <I>I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth,</I> 
 that is, "They shall increase incredibly, and, 
 take them altogether, they shall be such a 
 great multitude as no man can number." 
 They were so in Solomon's time, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:20">1 Kings iv. 20</A>,
 <I>Judah and Israel were many as the sand 
 which is by the sea in multitude.</I> This God 
 here gives him the promise of. Note, The 
 same God that provides the inheritance provides 
 the heirs. He that has prepared the 
 holy land prepares the holy seed; he that gives 
 glory gives grace to make meet for glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We are told what Abram did when 
 God had thus confirmed the promise to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 1. He <I>removed his tent.</I> God bade 
 him <I>walk through the land,</I> that is, "Do not 
 think of fixing in it, but expect to be always 
 unsettled, and walking through it to a better 
 Canaan:" in compliance with God's will 
 herein, <I>he removes his tent,</I> confirming himself 
 to the condition of a pilgrim. 
 
 2. He 
 <I>built there an altar,</I> in token of his thankfulness 
 to God for the kind visit he had paid 
 him. Note, When God meets us with gracious 
 promises, he expects that we should 
 attend him with our humble praises.</P>
