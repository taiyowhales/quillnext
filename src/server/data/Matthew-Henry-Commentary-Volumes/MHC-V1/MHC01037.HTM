 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At this chapter begins the story of Joseph, who, in every subsequent 
 chapter but one to the end of this book, makes the greatest 
 figure. He was Jacob's eldest son by his beloved wife Rachel, 
 born, as many eminent men were, of a mother that had been 
 long barren. His story is so remarkably divided between his 
 humiliation and his exaltation that we cannot avoid seeing 
 something of Christ in it, who was first humbled and then 
 exalted, and, in many instances, so as to answer the type of 
 Joseph. It also shows the lot of Christians, who must through 
 many tribulations enter into the kingdom. In this chapter we 
 have, 
 
 I. The malice his brethren bore against him. They hated 
 him,
 
 1. Because he informed his father of their wickedness,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 2. Because his father loved him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.
 
 3. Because he 
 dreamed of his dominion over them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:5-11">ver. 5-11</A>.
 
 II. The mischiefs 
 his brethren designed and did to him. 
 
 1. The kind visit 
 he made them gave an opportunity,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.
 
 2. They designed 
 to slay him, but determined to starve him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:18-24">ver. 18-24</A>.
 
 3. They changed their purpose, and sold him for a slave,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:25-28">ver. 25-28</A>.
 
 4. They made their father believe that he was torn in 
 pieces,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:29-35">ver. 29-35</A>.
 
 5. He was sold into Egypt to Potiphar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:36">ver. 36</A>.
 
 And all this was working together for good.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Jacob dwelt in the land
 wherein his father was a stranger,
 in the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 2 These <I>are</I>
 the generations of Jacob. Joseph,
 <I>being</I> seventeen years old, was feeding
 the flock with his brethren; and the
 lad <I>was</I> with the sons of Bilhah, and
 with the sons of Zilpah, his father's
 wives: and Joseph brought unto his
 father their evil report.
 &nbsp; 3 Now Israel
 loved Joseph more than all his children,
 because he <I>was</I> the son of his old
 age: and he made him a coat of <I>many</I>
 colours.
 &nbsp; 4 And when his brethren saw 
 that their father loved him more than
 all his brethren, they hated him, and 
 could not speak peaceably unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses has no more to say of the Edomites, 
 unless as they happen to fall in Israel's way; 
 but now applies himself closely to the story 
 of Jacob's family: <I>These are the generations 
 of Jacob.</I> His is not a bare barren genealogy 
 as that of Esau 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 1</A>),
 but a memorable useful history. Here is, 
 
 1. Jacob a
 sojourner with his father Isaac, who has yet
 living,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 We shall never be at home, till 
 we come to heaven. 
 
 2. Joseph, a shepherd, 
 <I>feeding the flock with his brethren,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Though he was his father's darling, yet he 
 was not brought up in idleness or delicacy. 
 Those do not truly love their children that 
 do not inure them to business, and labour, 
 and mortification. The fondling of children 
 is with good reason commonly called the spoiling 
 of them. Those that are trained up 
 to do nothing are likely to be good for nothing. 
 
 3. Joseph beloved by his father
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 partly for his dear mother's sake that was 
 dead, and partly for his own sake, because he 
 was the greatest comfort of his old age; probably 
 he waited on him, and was more observant 
 of him than the rest of his sons; he 
 was the <I>son of the ancient</I> so some; that is, 
 when he was a child, he was as grave and 
 discreet as if he had been an old man, a child, 
 but not childish. Jacob proclaimed his affection 
 to him by dressing him finer than the 
 rest of his children: He <I>made him a coat of divers 
 colours,</I> which probably was significant of 
 further honors intended him. Note, Though 
 those children are happy that have that in 
 them which justly recommends them to their 
 parents' particular love, yet it is the prudence 
 of parents not to make a difference between 
 one child and another, unless there be a great 
 and manifest cause given for it by the children's 
 dutifulness or undutifulness; paternal 
 government must be impartial, and managed 
 with a steady hand. 
 
 4. Joseph hated by his 
 brethren, 
 
 (1.) Because his father loved him; 
 when parents make a difference, children soon 
 take notice of it, and it often occasions feuds 
 and quarrels in families.
 
 (2.) Because he 
 <I>brought to his father their evil report.</I> Jacob's 
 sons did that, when they were from under 
 his eye, which they durst not have done if 
 they had been at home with him; but Joseph 
 gave his father an account of their bad carriage, 
 that he might reprove and restrain 
 them; not as a malicious tale-bearer, to sow 
 discord, but as a faithful brother, who, when 
 he durst not admonish them himself, represented 
 their faults to one that had authority 
 to admonish them. Note, 
 
 [1.] It is common 
 for friendly monitors to be looked upon as 
 enemies. Those that hate to be reformed hate 
 those that would reform them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:8">Prov. ix. 8</A>.
 
 [2.] It is common for those that are beloved 
 of God to be hated by the world; whom 
 Heaven blesses, hell curses. To those to 
 whom God speaks comfortably wicked men 
 will not speak peaceably. It is said here of 
 Joseph, <I>the lad was with the sons of Bilhah;</I> 
 some read it, and he was <I>servant to them,</I> 
 they made him their drudge.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, 
 and he told <I>it</I> his brethren: and they 
 hated him yet the more. 
 &nbsp; 6 And he 
 said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this 
 dream which I have dreamed:
 &nbsp; 7 For, 
 behold, we <I>were</I> binding sheaves in 
 the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and 
 also stood upright; and, behold, your 
 sheaves stood round about, and made 
 obeisance to my sheaf.
 &nbsp; 8 And his 
 brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed 
 reign over us? or shalt thou indeed 
 have dominion over us? And 
 they hated him yet the more for his 
 dreams, and for his words.
 &nbsp; 9 And he 
 dreamed yet another dream, and told 
 it his brethren, and said, Behold, I 
 have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, 
 the sun and the moon and the 
 eleven stars made obeisance to me.
 &nbsp; 10 And he told <I>it</I> to his father, and 
 
 <A NAME="Page213"> </A>

 to his brethren: and his father rebuked 
 him, and said unto him, What 
 <I>is</I> this dream that thou hast dreamed? 
 Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren 
 indeed come to bow down ourselves 
 to thee to the earth?
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 his brethren envied him; but his father 
 observed the saying.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Joseph relates the prophetical 
 dreams he had,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:6,7,9,10"><I>v.</I> 6, 7, 9, 10</A>.
 Though he was now very young (about seventeen
 years old), yet he was pious and devout, and
 well-inclined, and this fitted him for God's
 gracious discoveries of himself to him. Joseph
 had a great deal of trouble before him,
 and therefore God gave him betimes this
 prospect of his advancement, to support and 
 comfort him under the long and grievous 
 troubles with which he was to be exercised. 
 Thus Christ had a <I>joy set before him,</I> and so 
 have Christians. Note, God has ways of 
 preparing his people beforehand for the 
 trials which they cannot foresee, but which 
 he has an eye to in the comforts with which 
 he furnishes them. His dreams were, 
 
 1. That his brethren's sheaves all bowed to his, 
 intimating upon what occasion they should 
 be brought to do homage to him, namely, in 
 seeking to him for corn; their empty sheaves 
 should bow to his full one. 
 
 2. That the sun, 
 and moon, and eleven stars, did obeisance to 
 him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Joseph was more of a prophet 
 than a politician, else he would have kept 
 this to himself, when he could not but know 
 that his brethren did already hate him and 
 that this would but the more exasperate them. 
 But, if he told it in his simplicity, yet God 
 directed it for the mortification of his brethren. 
 Observe, Joseph dreamed of his preferment, 
 but he did not dream of his imprisonment. 
 Thus many young people, when they are setting 
 out in the world, think of nothing but prosperity 
 and pleasure, and never dream of trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His brethren take it very ill, and are 
 more and more enraged against him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 <I>Shalt thou indeed reign over us?</I> See here, 
 
 1. How truly they interpreted his dream, 
 that he should reign over them. Those become 
 the expositors of his dream who were 
 enemies to the accomplishment of it, as in 
 Gideon's story 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:13,14">Judg. vii. 13, 14</A>);
 they perceived 
 that he spoke of them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:45">Matt. xxi. 45</A>.
 The event exactly answered to this interpretation,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:6"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 6</A>,
 &c. 
 
 2. How scornfully 
 they resented it: "<I>Shalt thou,</I> who are but 
 one, <I>reign over us,</I> who are many? Thou, 
 who are the youngest, over us who are 
 older?" Note, The reign and dominion of 
 Jesus Christ, our Joseph, have been, and 
 are, despised and striven against by a carnal 
 and unbelieving world, who cannot endure 
 to think that this man should reign over 
 them. The dominion also of the upright, in 
 the morning of the resurrection, is thought 
 of with the utmost disdain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His father gives him a gentle rebuke 
 for it, yet observes the saying,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 Probably he checked him for it, to lessen the 
 offence which his brethren would be apt to 
 take at it; yet he took notice of it more than 
 he seemed to do: he insinuated that it was 
 but an idle dream, because his mother was 
 brought in, who had been dead some time 
 since; whereas <I>the sun, moon, and eleven 
 stars,</I> signify no more than the whole family 
 that should have a dependence upon him, 
 and be glad to be beholden to him. Note, 
 The faith of God's people in God's promises 
 is often sorely shaken by their misunderstanding 
 the promises and then suggesting 
 the improbabilities that attend the performance; 
 but God is doing his own work, and 
 will do it, whether we understand him aright 
 or no. Jacob, like Mary
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:51">Luke ii. 51</A>),
 kept 
 these things in his heart, and no doubt remembered 
 them long afterwards, when the 
 event answered to the prediction.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And his brethren went to feed 
 their father's flock in Shechem.
 &nbsp; 13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not 
 thy brethren feed <I>the flock</I> in Shechem? 
 come, and I will send thee unto them. 
 And he said to him, Here <I>am I.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, 
 see whether it be well with thy brethren, 
 and well with the flocks; and 
 bring me word again. So he sent him 
 out of the vale of Hebron, and he 
 came to Shechem.
 &nbsp; 15 And a certain 
 man found him, and, behold, <I>he was</I> 
 wandering in the field: and the man 
 asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
 &nbsp; 16 And he said, I seek my brethren: 
 tell me, I pray thee, where they feed 
 <I>their flocks.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 And the man said, 
 They are departed hence; for I heard 
 them say, Let us go to Dothan. And 
 Joseph went after his brethren, and
 found them in Dothan.
 &nbsp; 18 And when 
 they saw him afar off, even before he 
 came near unto them, they conspired 
 against him to slay him.
 &nbsp; 19 And they 
 said one to another, Behold, this 
 dreamer cometh.
 &nbsp; 20 Come now therefore, 
 and let us slay him, and cast him 
 into some pit, and we will say, Some 
 evil beast hath devoured him: and we 
 shall see what will become of his 
 dreams.
 &nbsp; 21 And Reuben heard <I>it,</I> 
 and he delivered him out of their
 hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
 &nbsp; 22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed 
 no blood, <I>but</I> cast him into this pit 
 
 <A NAME="Page214"> </A>

 that <I>is</I> in the wilderness, and lay no 
 hand upon him; that he might rid 
 him out of their hands, to deliver him 
 to his father again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The kind visit which Joseph, 
 in obedience to his father's command, made 
 to his brethren, who were feeding the flock 
 at Shechem, many miles off. Some suggest 
 that they went thither on purpose, expecting 
 that Joseph would be sent to see them, and 
 that then they should have an opportunity 
 to do him a mischief. However, Joseph and 
 his father had both of them more of the innocence 
 of the dove than of the wisdom of 
 the serpent, else he had never come thus into 
 the hands of those that hated him: but God 
 designed it all for good. See in Joseph 
 an instance, 
 
 1. Of dutifulness to his father. 
 Though he was his father's darling, yet he 
 was made, and was willing to be, his father's 
 servant. How readily does he wait his father's 
 orders! <I>Here I am,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Note, Those 
 children that are best beloved by their parents 
 should be most obedient to their parents; and 
 then their love is well-bestowed and well-returned. 
 
 2. Of kindness to his brethren. 
 Though he knew they hated him and envied 
 him, yet he made no objections against his 
 father's commands, either from the distance 
 of the place or the danger of the journey, but 
 cheerfully embraced the opportunity of showing 
 his respect to his brethren. Note, It is 
 a very good lesson, though it is learnt with 
 difficulty and rarely practised, <I>to love those 
 that hate us;</I> if our relations do not their 
 duty to us, yet we must not be wanting in 
 our duty to them. This is thank-worthy. 
 Joseph was sent by his father to Shechem, 
 to see whether his brethren were well there, 
 and whether the country had not risen upon 
 them and destroyed them, in revenge of their 
 barbarous murder of the Shechemites some 
 years before. But Joseph, not finding them 
 there, went to Dothan, which showed that he 
 undertook this journey, not only in obedience 
 to his father (for then he might have returned 
 when he missed them at Shechem, having 
 done what his father told him), but out of 
 love to his brethren, and therefore he sought 
 diligently till he found them. Thus let 
 brotherly love continue, and let us give proofs 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The bloody and malicious plot of his 
 brethren against him, who rendered good for 
 evil, and, for his love, were his adversaries. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. How deliberate they were in the 
 contrivance of this mischief: when they <I>saw 
 him afar off, they conspired against him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 It was not in a heat, or upon a sudden provocation, 
 that they thought to slay him, but 
 from malice prepense, and in cold blood. 
 Note, Whosoever hateth his brother is a 
 murderer; for he will be one if he have an 
 opportunity,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1 John iii. 15</A>.
 Malice is a 
 most mischievous thing, and is in danger of 
 making bloody work where it is harboured and 
 indulged. The more there is of a project and 
 contrivance in a sin the worse it is; it is bad 
 to do evil, but worse to devise it. 
 
 2. How 
 cruel they were in their design; nothing less 
 than his blood would satisfy them: <I>Come, 
 and let us slay him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 Note, The old 
 enmity hunts for the precious life. It is 
 the <I>blood-thirsty</I> that <I>hate the upright</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>),
 and it is the blood of the saints 
 that the harlot is drunk with. 
 
 3. How scornfully 
 they reproached him for his dreams
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 <I>This dreamer cometh;</I> and
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 <I>We shall see what will become of his dreams.</I> 
 This shows what it was that fretted and enraged 
 them. They could not endure to think 
 of doing homage to him; this was what they 
 were plotting to prevent by the murder of 
 him. Note, Men that fret and rage at God's 
 counsels are impiously aiming to defeat them; 
 but they imagine a vain thing, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3">Ps. ii. 1-3</A>.
 God's counsels will stand. 
 
 4. How they
 agreed to keep one another's counsel, and to
 cover the murder with a lie: <I>We will say,
 Some evil beast hath devoured him;</I> whereas
 in thus consulting to devour him they proved
 themselves worse than the most evil beasts;
 for evil beasts prey not on those of their own
 kind, but they were tearing a piece of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Reuben's project to deliver him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.
 Note, God can raise up friends for his 
 people, even among their enemies; for he 
 has all hearts in his hands. Reuben, of all 
 the brothers, had most reason to be jealous 
 of Joseph, for he was the first-born, and so 
 entitled to those distinguishing favours which 
 Jacob was conferring on Joseph; yet he proves 
 his best friend. Reuben's temper seems to 
 have been soft and effeminate, which had betrayed 
 him to the sin of uncleanness; while 
 the temper of the next two brothers, Simeon 
 and Levi, was fierce, which betrayed them to 
 the sin of murder, a sin which Reuben startled 
 at the thought of. Note, Our natural constitution 
 should be guarded against those 
 sins to which it is most inclinable, and improved 
 (as Reuben's here) against those sins 
 to which it is most averse. Reuben made a 
 proposal which they thought would effectually 
 answer their intention of destroying Joseph, 
 and yet which he designed should 
 answer his intention of rescuing Joseph out 
 of their hands and restoring him to his father, 
 probably hoping thereby to recover his 
 father's favour, which he had lately lost; but 
 God overruled all to serve his own purpose 
 of making Joseph an instrument to save 
 much people alive. Joseph was here a type 
 of Christ. Though he was the beloved Son 
 of his Father, and hated by a wicked world, 
 yet the Father sent him out of his bosom to 
 visit us in great humility and love. He came 
 from heaven to earth, to seek and save us; 
 yet then malicious plots were laid against him. 
 He came to his own, and his own not only received 
 him not, but consulted against him: <I>This 
 is the heir, come let us kill him; Crucify him, 
 
 <A NAME="Page215"> </A>

 crucify him.</I> This he submitted to, in pursuance 
 of his design to redeem and save us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And it came to pass, when Joseph 
 was come unto his brethren, that 
 they stript Joseph out of his coat, <I>his</I> 
 coat of <I>many</I> colours that <I>was</I> on him;
 &nbsp; 24 And they took him, and cast him 
 into a pit: and the pit <I>was</I> empty, 
 <I>there was</I> no water in it.
 &nbsp; 25 And 
 they sat down to eat bread: and they 
 lifted up their eyes and looked, and, 
 behold, a company of Ishmeelites came 
 from Gilead with their camels bearing 
 spicery and balm and myrrh, going to 
 carry <I>it</I> down to Egypt.
 &nbsp; 26 And Judah 
 said unto his brethren, What 
 profit <I>is it</I> if we slay our brother, and 
 conceal his blood?
 &nbsp; 27 Come, and let 
 us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and 
 let not our hand be upon him; for he 
 <I>is</I> our brother <I>and</I> our flesh. And his 
 brethren were content.
 &nbsp; 28 Then there 
 passed by Midianites merchantmen; 
 and they drew and lifted up Joseph 
 out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
 Ishmeelites for twenty <I>pieces</I> of silver: 
 and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
 &nbsp; 29 And Reuben returned unto the 
 pit; and, behold, Joseph <I>was</I> not in 
 the pit; and he rent his clothes.
 &nbsp; 30 And he returned unto his brethren,

 We have here the execution of their plot
 against Joseph.

 1. They stripped him, each
 striving to seize the envied coat of many colours,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 Thus, in imagination, they degraded
 him from the birthright, of which perhaps this
 was the badge, grieving him, affronting their
 father, and making themselves sport, while
 they insulted over him. "Now, Joseph, where
 is the fine coat?" Thus our Lord Jesus was
 stripped of his seamless coat, and thus his
 suffering saints have first been industriously
 divested of their privileges and honours, and
 then made the off-scouring of all things.

 2. They went about to starve him, throwing him
 into a dry pit, to perish there with hunger
 and cold, so cruel were their tender mercies,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:25"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 Note, Where envy reigns pity is
 banished, and humanity itself is forgotten, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:4">Prov. xxvii. 4</A>.
 So full of deadly poison is 
 malice that the more barbarous any thing is 
 the more grateful it is. Now Joseph begged 
 for his life, in <I>the anguish of his soul</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:21"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 21</A>),
 entreated, by all imaginable endearments, 
 that they would be content with his coat and 
 spare his life. He pleads innocence, relation, 
 affection, submission; he weeps and makes 
 supplication, but all in vain. Reuben alone 
 relents and intercedes for him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:22"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 22</A>.
 But he cannot prevail to save Joseph from 
 the horrible pit, in which they resolve he 
 shall die by degrees, and be buried alive. Is 
 this he to whom his brethren must do 
 homage? Note, God's providences often 
 seem to contradict his purposes, even when 
 they are serving them, and working at a 
 distance towards the accomplishment of 
 them. 
 
 3. They slighted him when he was 
 in distress, and were not grieved for the 
 affliction of Joseph; for when he was pining 
 away in the pit, bemoaning his own misery, 
 and with a languishing cry calling to them 
 for pity, <I>they sat down to eat bread,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 (1.) They felt no remorse of conscience for 
 the sin; if they had, it would have spoiled 
 their appetite for their meat, and the relish 
 of it. Note, A great force put upon conscience 
 commonly stupefies it, and for the time deprives 
 it both of sense and speech. Daring 
 sinners are secure ones. But the consciences 
 of Joseph's brethren, though asleep now, 
 were roused long afterwards,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+42:21"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 21</A>.
 
 (2.) They were now pleased to think how they 
 were freed from the fear of their brother's 
 dominion over them, and that, on the contrary, 
 they had turned the wheel upon him. 
 They made merry over him, as the persecutors 
 over the two witnesses that had tormented 
 them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.
 Note, Those that 
 oppose God's counsels may possibly prevail 
 so far as to think they have gained their 
 point, and yet be deceived. 
 
 4. They sold 
 him. A caravan of merchants very opportunely 
 passed by (Providence so ordering it), 
 and Judah made the motion that they should 
 sell Joseph to them, to be carried far enough 
 off into Egypt, where, in all probability, he 
 would be lost, and never heard of more. 
 
 (1.) Judah proposed it in compassion to Joseph
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):
 "<I>What profit is it if we slay our brother?</I> 
 it will be less guilt, and more gain, to 
 sell him." Note, When we are tempted to 
 sin, we should consider the unprofitableness 
 of it. It is what there is nothing to be got 
 by. 
 
 (2.) They acquiesced in it, because 
 they thought that if he were sold for a slave 
 he would never be a lord, if sold into Egypt 
 he would never be their lord; yet all this was 
 working towards it. Note, The wrath of 
 man shall praise God, and the remainder of 
 wrath he will restrain, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.
 Joseph's 
 brethren were wonderfully restrained from 
 murdering him, and their selling him was as 
 wonderfully turned to God's praise. As 
 Joseph was sold by the contrivance of Judah 
 for twenty pieces of silver, so was our Lord 
 Jesus for thirty, and by one of the same 
 name too, <I>Judas.</I> Reuben (it seems) had 
 gone away from his brethren, when they sold 
 Joseph, intending to come round some other 
 way to the pit, and to help Joseph out of it, 
 and return him safely to his father. This was 
 a kind project, but, if it had taken effect, 
 what had become of God's purpose concerning 
 his preferment in Egypt? Note, There 
 
 <A NAME="Page216"> </A>

 are many devices in man's heart, many devices 
 of the enemies of God's people to destroy 
 them and of their friends to help them, 
 which perhaps are both disappointed, as 
 these were; but the counsel of the Lord, 
 that shall stand. Reuben thought himself 
 undone, because the child was sold: <I>I, whither 
 shall I go?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 He being the eldest, 
 his father would expect from him an account
 of Joseph; but, as it proved, they would all 
 have been undone if he had not been sold.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31 And they took Joseph's coat, and 
 killed a kid of the goats, and dipped 
 the coat in the blood;
 &nbsp; 32 And they 
 sent the coat of <I>many</I> colours, and they 
 brought <I>it</I> to their father; and said, 
 This have we found: know now whether 
 it <I>be</I> thy son's coat or no.
 &nbsp; 33 And he knew it, and said, <I>It is</I> my 
 son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured 
 him; Joseph is without doubt rent in 
 pieces.
 &nbsp; 34 And Jacob rent his clothes, 
 and put sackcloth upon his loins, and 
 mourned for his son many days.
 &nbsp; 35 And all his sons and all his daughters 
 rose up to comfort him; but he refused 
 to be comforted; and he said, 
 For I will go down into the grave 
 unto my son mourning. Thus his 
 father wept for him.
 &nbsp; 36 And the 
 Midianites sold him into Egypt unto 
 Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, <I>and</I> 
 captain of the guard.

 I. Joseph would soon be missed, great 
 enquiry would be made for him, and therefore 
 his brethren have a further design, to 
 make the world believe that Joseph was torn
 in pieces by a wild beast; and this they did, 
 
 1. To clear themselves, that they might not 
 be suspected to have done him any mischief. 
 Note, We have all learned of Adam to cover 
 our transgression, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33">Job xxxi. 33</A>.
 When the 
 devil has taught men to commit one sin, he 
 then teaches them to conceal it with another, 
 theft and murder with lying and perjury; 
 but he that covers his sin shall not prosper 
 long. Joseph's brethren kept their own and 
 one another's counsel for some time, but 
 their villany came to light at last, and it is
 here published to the world, and the remembrance 
 of it transmitted to every age. 
 
 2. To 
 grieve their good father. It seems designed 
 by them on purpose to be revenged upon him 
 for his distinguishing love of Joseph. It was 
 contrived on purpose to create the utmost 
 vexation to him. They sent him Joseph's 
 coat of many colours, with one colour more 
 than it had had, a bloody colour,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 They 
 pretended they had found it in the fields, and 
 Jacob himself must be scornfully asked, <I>Is 
 this thy son's coat?</I> Now the badge of his 
 honour is the discovery of his fate; and it is 
 rashly inferred from the bloody coat that 
 <I>Joseph, without doubt, is rent in pieces.</I> Love 
 is always apt to fear the worst concerning 
 the person beloved; there is a love that 
 casteth out fear, but that is a perfect love. 
 Now let those that know the heart of a parent 
 suppose the agonies of poor Jacob, and put 
 their souls into his soul's stead. How 
 strongly does he represent to himself the 
 direful idea of Joseph's misery! Sleeping or 
 waking, he imagines he sees the wild beast 
 setting upon Joseph, thinks he hears his 
 piteous shrieks when the lion roared against 
 him, makes himself tremble and grow chill, 
 many a time, when he fancies how the beast 
 sucked his blood, tore him limb from limb, 
 and left no remains of him, but the coat of 
 many colours, to carry the tidings. And no 
 doubt it added no little to the grief that he 
 had exposed him, by sending him, and sending 
 him all alone, on this dangerous journey, 
 which proved so fatal to him. This cuts him 
 to the heart, and he is ready to look upon 
 himself as an accessory to the death of his 
 son. Now, 
 
 (1.) Endeavours were used to 
 comfort him. His sons basely pretended to do 
 it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 but miserable hypocritical comforters 
 were they all. Had they really desired 
 to comfort him, they might easily have done 
 it, by telling him the truth, "Joseph is alive, 
 he is indeed sold into Egypt, but it will be an 
 easy thing to send thither and ransom him." 
 This would have <I>loosened his sackcloth, and 
 girded him with gladness</I> presently. I wonder 
 their countenances did not betray their guilt, 
 and with what face they could pretend to 
 condole with Jacob on the death of Joseph, 
 when they knew he was alive. Note, The 
 heart is strangely hardened by the deceitfulness 
 of sin. But, 
 
 (2.) It was all in vain: 
 <I>Jacob refused to be comforted,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 He was 
 an obstinate mourner, resolved to go down to 
 the grave mourning. It was not a sudden 
 transport of passion, like that of David, 
 <I>Would God I had died for thee, my son, my 
 son!</I> But, like Job, he hardened himself in 
 sorrow. Note, 
 
 [1.] Great affection to any 
 creature does not prepare for so much the 
 greater affliction, when it is either removed 
 from us or embittered to us. Inordinate 
 love commonly ends in immoderate grief; as 
 much as the sway of the pendulum throws 
 one way, so much it will throw the other 
 way. 
 
 [2.] Those consult neither the comfort 
 of their souls nor the credit of their 
 religion that are determined in their sorrow 
 upon any occasion whatsoever. We must 
 never say, "We will go to our grave mourning," 
 because we know not what joyful days 
 Providence may yet reserve for us, and it is 
 our wisdom and duty to accommodate ourselves 
 to Providence. 
 
 [3.] We often perplex 
 ourselves with imaginary troubles. We fancy 
 things worse than they are, and then afflict 
 ourselves more than we need. Sometimes 
 there needs no more to comfort us than to 
 undeceive us: it is good to hope the best.</P>

 II. The Ishmaelites and Midianites having 
 bought Joseph only to make their market 
 of him, here we have him sold again (with 
 gain enough to the merchants, no doubt) to 
 Potiphar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 Jacob was lamenting the 
 loss of his life; had he known all he would
 have lamented, though not so passionately, 
 the loss of liberty. Shall Jacob's freeborn 
 son exchange the best robe of his family 
 for the livery of an Egyptian lord, and all the 
 marks of servitude? How soon was the land 
 of Egypt made a house of bondage to the 
 seed of Jacob! Note, It is the wisdom of 
 parents not to bring up their children too 
 delicately, because they know not to what 
 hardships and mortifications Providence may 
 reduce them before they die. Jacob little 
 thought that ever his beloved Joseph would 
 be thus bought and sold for a servant.</P>
