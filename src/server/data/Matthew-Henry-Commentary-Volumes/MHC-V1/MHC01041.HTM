 Two things Providence is here bringing about:--
 
 I. The advancement 
 of Joseph.

 II. The maintenance of Jacob and his family in a 
 time of famine; for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro through
 the earth, and direct the affairs of the children of men for the 
 benefit of those few whose hearts are upright with him. In order to 
 these, we have here, 
 
 1. Pharaoh's dreams,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.
 
 2. The recommendation 
 of Joseph to him for an interpreter,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.
 
 3. The 
 interpretation of the dreams, and the prediction of seven years 
 of plenty and seven years of famine in Egypt, with the prudent 
 advice given to Pharaoh thereupon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:14-36">ver. 14-36</A>.
 
 4. The preferment 
 of Joseph to a place of the highest power and trust in 
 Egypt,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:37-45">ver. 37-45</A>.
 
 5. The accomplishment of Joseph's prediction, 
 and his fidelity to his trust,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:46-57">ver. 46</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass at the end 
 of two full years, that Pharaoh 
 dreamed: and, behold, he stood by 
 the river.
 &nbsp; 2 And, behold, there came 
 up out of the river seven well favoured 
 kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a 
 meadow.
 &nbsp; 3 And, behold, seven other 
 kine came up after them out of the
 river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and 
 stood by the <I>other</I> kine upon the brink 
 of the river.
 &nbsp; 4 And the ill favoured 
 and leanfleshed kine did eat up the
 seven well favoured and fat kine. So 
 Pharaoh awoke.
 &nbsp; 5 And he slept and 
 dreamed the second time: and, behold, 
 seven ears of corn came up upon 
 one stalk, rank and good.
 &nbsp; 6 And, behold, 
 seven thin ears and blasted with 
 the east wind sprung up after them.
 &nbsp; 7 And the seven thin ears devoured 
 the seven rank and full ears. And 
 Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <I>it was</I> a 
 dream.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass in the 
 morning that his spirit was troubled; 
 and he sent and called for all the magicians 
 of Egypt, and all the wise men 
 thereof: and Pharaoh told them his 
 dreams; but <I>there was</I> none that could 
 interpret them unto Pharaoh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 
 
 1. The delay of Joseph's enlargement. 
 It was not till <I>the end of two 
 full years</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 so long he waited after he 
 had entrusted the chief butler with his case 
 and began to have some prospect of relief. 
 Note, We have need of patience, not only 
 bearing, but waiting, patience. Joseph lay 
 in prison until the time that his word came,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:19">Ps. cv. 19</A>.
 There is a time set for the deliverance 
 of God's people; that time will 
 come, though it seem to tarry; and, when it 
 comes, it will appear to have been the best 
 time, and therefore we ought to wait for it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>),
 and not think two full years too 
 long to continue waiting. 
 
 2. The means of 
 Joseph's enlargement, which were Pharaoh's 
 dreams, here related. If we were to look 
 upon them as ordinary dreams, we might 
 observe from them the follies and absurdities 
 of a roving working fancy, how it represents 
 to itself tame cows as beasts of prey (nay, 
 more ravenous than any, eating up those of 
 their own kind), and ears of corn as devouring 
 one another. Surely in the multitude of 
 dreams, nay, even in one dream, there are 
 divers vanities,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:7">Eccl. v. 7</A>.
 Now that God 
 no longer speaks to us in that way, I think it 
 is no matter how little we either heed them 
 or tell them. Foolish dreams related can 
 make no better than foolish talk. But these 
 dreams which Pharaoh dreamed carried their 
 own evidence with them that they were sent 
 of God; and therefore, when he awoke, his 
 spirit was troubled,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 It cannot but put 
 us into a concern to receive any extraordinary 
 message from heaven, because we are conscious 
 to ourselves that we have no reason to 
 expect any good tidings thence. His magicians 
 were puzzled, the rules of their art 
 failed them: these dreams of Pharaoh, it 
 seems, did not fall within the compass of 
 them, so that they could not offer at the interpretation 
 of them. This was to make Joseph's 
 performance by the Spirit of God the 
 more admirable. Human reason, prudence, 
 and foresight, must be nonplussed, that divine 
 revelation may appear the more glorious in 
 the contrivance of our redemption, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13,14">1 Cor. ii. 13, 14</A>.
 Compare with this story,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:27,4:7,5:8">Dan. ii. 27; iv. 7; v. 8</A>.
 Joseph's own dreams were the 
 occasion of his troubles, and now Pharaoh's 
 dreams were the occasion of his enlargement.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 Then spake the chief butler unto 
 Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my 
 faults this day:
 &nbsp; 10 Pharaoh was wroth 
 with his servants, and put me in ward 
 in the captain of the guard's house, 
 <I>both</I> me and the chief baker:
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 we dreamed a dream in one night, I 
 and he; we dreamed each man according 
 to the interpretation of his dream.
 &nbsp; 12 And <I>there was</I> there with us a 
 young man, a Hebrew, servant to 
 the captain of the guard; and we told 

 <A NAME="Page228"> </A>
 
 him, and he interpreted to us our 
 dreams; to each man according to his 
 dream he did interpret.
 &nbsp; 13 And it 
 came to pass, as he interpreted to us, 
 so it was; me he restored unto mine 
 office, and him he hanged.
 &nbsp; 14 Then 
 Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and 
 they brought him hastily out of the 
 dungeon: and he shaved <I>himself,</I> and 
 changed his raiment, and came in unto 
 Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 15 And Pharaoh said unto 
 Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
 <I>there is</I> none that can interpret it: 
 and I have heard say of thee, <I>that</I> 
 thou canst understand a dream to interpret 
 it.
 &nbsp; 16 And Joseph answered 
 Pharaoh, saying, <I>It is</I> not in me: God
 shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. The recommending of Joseph 
 to Pharaoh for an interpreter. The chief 
 butler did it more in compliment to Pharaoh, 
 to oblige him, than in gratitude to Joseph, 
 or in compassion for his case. He makes a 
 fair confession
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 "<I>I remember my faults 
 this day,</I> in forgetting Joseph." Note, It is 
 best to remember our duty, and to do it in 
 its time; but, if we have neglected that, it is 
 next best to remember our faults, and repent 
 of them, and do our duty at last; better late 
 than never. Some think he means his faults 
 against Pharaoh, for which he was imprisoned; 
 and then he would insinuate that, though 
 Pharaoh had forgiven him, he had not forgiven 
 himself. The story he had to tell was, 
 in short, That there was an obscure young 
 man in the king's prison, who had very properly 
 interpreted his dream, and the chief 
 baker's (the event corresponding in each with 
 the interpretation), and that he would recommend 
 him to the king his master for an interpreter. 
 Note, God's time for the enlargement 
 of his people will appear at last to be 
 the fittest time. If the chief butler had at 
 first used his interest for Joseph's enlargement, 
 and had obtained it, it is probable that 
 upon his release he would have gone back 
 to <I>the land of the Hebrews</I> again, which he spoke 
 of so feelingly
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:15"><I>ch.</I> xl. 15</A>),
 and then he would 
 neither have been so blessed himself, nor such 
 a blessing to his family, as afterwards he 
 proved. But staying two years longer, and 
 coming out now upon this occasion, at last, 
 to interpret the king's dreams, way was made 
 for his very great preferment. Those that 
 patiently wait for God shall be paid for their 
 waiting, not only principal but interest,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:26">Lam. iii. 26</A>.
 
 2. The introducing of Joseph to 
 Pharaoh. The king's business requires 
 haste. Joseph is sent for out of the dungeon 
 with all speed; Pharaoh's order discharged 
 him both from his imprisonment and from 
 his servitude, and made him a candidate for 
 some of the highest trusts at court. The 
 king can scarcely allow him time, but that 
 decency required it, to shave himself, and to 
 change his raiment,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 It is done with 
 all possible expedition, and Joseph is brought 
 in, perhaps almost as much surprised as 
 Peter was,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:9">Acts xii. 9</A>.
 So suddenly is his 
 captivity brought back that he is as one that 
 dreams,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1">Ps. cxxvi. 1</A>.
 Pharaoh immediately, 
 without enquiring who or whence he was, 
 tells him his business, that he expected he 
 should interpret his dream,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 To which,
 Joseph makes him a very modest decent reply,
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 in which, 
 
 (1.) He gives honour 
 to God. "It is not in me, God must give 
 it." Note, Great gifts appear most graceful 
 and illustrious when those that have them 
 use them humbly, and take not the praise of 
 them to themselves, but give it to God. To 
 such God gives more grace. 
 
 (2.) He shows 
 respect to Pharaoh, and hearty good-will to 
 him and his government, in supposing that 
 the interpretation would be an answer of 
 peace. Note, Those that consult God's oracles 
 may expect an answer of peace. If Joseph 
 be made the interpreter, hope the best.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, 
 In my dream, behold, I stood upon the 
 bank of the river:
 &nbsp; 18 And, behold, there 
 came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed 
 and well favoured; and they 
 fed in a meadow:
 &nbsp; 19 And, behold, 
 seven other kine came up after them, 
 poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, 
 such as I never saw in all the
 land of Egypt for badness:
 &nbsp; 20 And 
 the lean and the ill favoured kine did 
 eat up the first seven fat kine:
 &nbsp; 21 And when they had eaten them up, it 
 could not be known that they had 
 eaten them; but they <I>were</I> still ill favoured, 
 as at the beginning. So I 
 awoke.
 &nbsp; 22 And I saw in my dream, 
 and, behold, seven ears came up in
 one stalk, full and good:
 &nbsp; 23 And, 
 behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <I>and</I> 
 blasted with the east wind, sprung up 
 after them:
 &nbsp; 24 And the thin ears devoured 
 the seven good ears: and I 
 told <I>this</I> unto the magicians; but <I>there 
 was</I> none that could declare <I>it</I> to me.
 &nbsp; 25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, 
 The dream of Pharaoh <I>is</I> one: God 
 hath showed Pharaoh what he <I>is</I> about 
 to do.
 &nbsp; 26 The seven good kine <I>are</I> 
 seven years; and the seven good ears 
 <I>are</I> seven years: the dream <I>is</I> one.
 &nbsp; 27 And the seven thin and ill favoured 
 kine that came up after them <I>are</I> seven 
 years; and the seven empty ears 
 
 <A NAME="Page229"> </A>

 blasted with the east wind shall be 
 seven years of famine.
 &nbsp; 28 This <I>is</I> the 
 thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: 
 What God <I>is</I> about to do he 
 showeth unto Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 29 Behold, 
 there come seven years of great plenty 
 throughout all the land of Egypt:
 &nbsp; 30 And there shall arise after them seven 
 years of famine; and all the plenty 
 shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; 
 and the famine shall consume the land;
 &nbsp; 31 And the plenty shall not be known 
 in the land by reason of that famine following; 
 for it <I>shall be</I> very grievous.
 &nbsp; 32 And for that the dream was doubled 
 unto Pharaoh twice; <I>it is</I> because the 
 thing <I>is</I> established by God, and God 
 will shortly bring it to pass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Pharaoh relates his dream. 
 He dreamt that he stood upon the bank of 
 the river Nile, and saw the kine, both the 
 fat ones and the lean ones, come out of the 
 river. For the kingdom of Egypt had no 
 rain, as appears,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18">Zech. xiv. 18</A>,
 but the plenty 
 of the year depended upon the overflowing 
 of the river, and it was about one certain time 
 of the year that it overflowed. If it rose to 
 fifteen or sixteen cubits, there was plenty; if 
 to twelve or thirteen only, or under, there 
 was scarcity. See how many ways Providence 
 has of dispensing its gifts; yet, whatever 
 the second causes are, our dependence 
 is still the same upon the first Cause, who 
 makes every creature that to us that it is, be 
 it rain or river.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joseph interprets his dream, and tells 
 him that it signified seven years of plenty 
 now immediately to ensue, which should be 
 succeeded by as many years of famine. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. The two dreams signified the 
 same thing, but the repetition was to denote
 the certainty, the nearness, and the importance, 
 of the event,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 Thus God has often 
 shown <I>the immutability of his counsel by two 
 immutable things,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.
 The 
 covenant is sealed with two sacraments; and 
 in the one of them there are both bread 
 and wine, wherein the dream is one, and yet 
 it is doubled, for the thing is certain. 
 
 2. Yet 
 the two dreams had a distinct reference to 
 the two things wherein we most experience 
 plenty and scarcity, namely, grass and corn. 
 The plenty and scarcity of grass for the cattle 
 were signified by the fat kine and the lean 
 ones; the plenty and scarcity of herb for the 
 service of man by the full ears and the thin 
 ones. 
 
 3. See what changes the comforts of 
 this life are subject to. After great plenty 
 may come great scarcity; how strong soever 
 we may think our mountain stands, if God 
 speak the word, it will soon be moved. We 
 cannot be sure that <I>to-morrow shall be as this 
 day,</I> next year as this, and <I>much more abundant,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>.
 We must learn how to 
 want, as well as how to abound. 
 
 4. See the 
 goodness of God in sending the seven years 
 of plenty before those of famine, that provision 
 might be made accordingly. Thus he 
 <I>sets the one over-against the other,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>.
 With what wonderful wisdom has Providence, 
 that great housekeeper, ordered the 
 affairs of this numerous family from the 
 beginning hitherto! Great variety of seasons 
 there have been, and the produce of the earth 
 is sometimes more and sometimes less; yet, 
 take one time with another, what was miraculous 
 concerning the manna is ordinarily verified 
 in the common course of Providence, 
 <I>He that gathers much has nothing over, and he 
 that gathers little has no lack,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:18">Exod. xvi. 18</A>.

 5. See the perishing nature of our worldly 
 enjoyments. The great increase of the years
 of plenty was quite lost and swallowed up in 
 the years of famine; and the overplus of it, 
 which seemed very much, yet did but just 
 serve to keep men alive,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.
 <I>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God 
 shall destroy both it and them,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13">1 Cor. vi. 13</A>.
 There is bread which <I>endures to everlasting 
 life,</I> which shall not be forgotten, and which 
 it is worth while to labour for,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27">John vi. 27</A>.
 Those that make the things of this world 
 their good things will find but little pleasure 
 in remembering that they have received them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.
 
 6. Observe, God revealed 
 this beforehand to Pharaoh, who, as king of 
 Egypt, was to be the father of his country, 
 and to make prudent provision for them. 
 Magistrates are called <I>shepherds,</I> whose care 
 it must be, not only to rule, but to feed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look 
 out a man discreet and wise, and set 
 him over the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 34 Let 
 Pharaoh do <I>this,</I> and let him appoint 
 officers over the land, and take up the 
 fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
 seven plenteous years.
 &nbsp; 35 And let 
 them gather all the food of those 
 good years that come, and lay up corn 
 under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
 keep food in the cities.
 &nbsp; 36 And that 
 food shall be for store to the land 
 against the seven years of famine, 
 which shall be in the land of Egypt; 
 that the land perish not through the 
 famine.
 &nbsp; 37 And the thing was good 
 in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes 
 of all his servants.
 &nbsp; 38 And Pharaoh 
 said unto his servants, Can we find 
 <I>such a one</I> as this <I>is,</I> a man in whom 
 the Spirit of God <I>is?</I>
 &nbsp; 39 And Pharaoh 
 said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath 
 showed thee all this, <I>there is</I> 
 none so discreet and wise as thou 
 
 <A NAME="Page230"> </A>

 <I>art:</I>
 &nbsp; 40 Thou shalt be over my house, 
 and according unto thy word shall all 
 my people be ruled: only in the throne 
 will I be greater than thou.
 &nbsp; 41 And 
 Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have 
 set thee over all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 42 And Pharaoh took off his ring 
 from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's 
 hand, and arrayed him in vestures 
 of fine linen, and put a gold chain 
 about his neck;
 &nbsp; 43 And he made him 
 to ride in the second chariot which he 
 had; and they cried before him, Bow 
 the knee: and he made him <I>ruler</I> over 
 all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 44 And Pharaoh 
 said unto Joseph, I <I>am</I> Pharaoh, 
 and without thee shall no man lift up 
 his hand or foot in all the land of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's 
 name Zaphnath-paaneah; and 
 he gave him to wife Asenath the 
 daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On.
 And Joseph went out over <I>all</I> the land 
 of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The good advice that Joseph 
 gave to Pharaoh, which was, 
 
 1. That in the 
 years of plenty he should lay up for the years 
 of famine, buy up corn when it was cheap, 
 that he might both enrich himself and 
 supply the country when it would be dear and 
 scarce. Note, Fair warning should always 
 be followed with good counsel. Therefore 
 the prudent man foresees the evil, that he may 
 hide himself. God has in his word told us of 
 a day of trial and exigence before us, when 
 we shall need all the grace we can get, and 
 all little enough, "Now, therefore, provide 
 accordingly." Note, further, Times of gathering 
 must be diligently improved, because 
 there will come a time of spending. Let us 
 go to the ant, and learn of her this wisdom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6-8">Prov. vi. 6-8</A>.
 
 2. Because that which is 
 everybody's work commonly proves nobody's 
 work, he advises Pharaoh to appoint officers 
 who should make it their business, and to 
 select some one person to preside in the 
 affair,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 Probably, if Joseph had not 
 advised this, it would not have been done; 
 Pharaoh's counsellors could no more improve 
 the dream than his magicians interpret it; 
 therefore it is said of him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:22">Ps. cv. 22</A>)
 that he 
 <I>taught the senators wisdom.</I> Hence we may 
 justly infer with Solomon
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:13">Eccl. iv. 13</A>),
 <I>Better 
 is a poor and a wise child than an old and 
 foolish king.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great honour that Pharaoh did to 
 Joseph. 
 
 1. He gave him an honourable testimony: 
 He is <I>a man in whom the Spirit of 
 God is;</I> and this puts a great excellency 
 upon any man; such men ought to be valued,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 He is a nonsuch for prudence:
 <I>There is none so discreet and wise as thou art,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 Now he is abundantly recompensed 
 for the disgrace that had been done him; 
 and his righteousness is as the morning-light,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.
 
 2. He put him into an 
 honourable office; not only employed him
 to buy up corn, but made him prime-minister 
 of state, comptroller of the household--<I>Thou 
 shalt be over my house,</I> chief justice of the 
 kingdom--<I>according to thy word shall all my 
 people be ruled,</I> or <I>armed,</I> as some read it, 
 and then it bespeaks him general of the 
 forces. His commission was very ample: <I>I
 have set thee over all the land of Egypt</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);
 <I>without thee shall no man lift up his hand or 
 foot</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>);
 all the affairs of the kingdom 
 must pass through his hand. Nay
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),
 <I>only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</I> 
 Note, It is the wisdom of princes to prefer 
 those, and the happiness of people to have 
 those preferred, to places of power and trust, 
 in whom the Spirit of God is. It is probable 
 that there were those about the court who 
 opposed Joseph's preferment, which occasioned 
 Pharaoh so often to repeat the grant, 
 and with that solemn sanction
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),
 <I>I am 
 Pharaoh.</I> When the proposal was made that 
 there should be a corn-master-general nominated, 
 it is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),
 <I>Pharaoh's servants 
 were all pleased</I> with the proposal, each 
 hoping for the place; but when Pharaoh said 
 to them, "Joseph shall be the man," we do 
 not read that they made him any answer, 
 being uneasy at it, and acquiescing only 
 because they could not help it. Joseph had 
 enemies, no doubt, archers that shot at him, 
 and hated him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:23"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 23</A>),
 as Daniel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>.
 
 3. He put upon him all the marks of 
 honour imaginable, to recommend him to the 
 esteem and respect of the people as the king's 
 favourite, and one whom he delighted to 
 honour. 
 
 (1.) He gave him his own ring, as 
 a ratification of his commission, and in token 
 of peculiar favour; or it was like delivering 
 him the great seal. 
 
 (2.) He put fine clothes 
 upon him, instead of his prison garments. 
 For those that are in kings' palaces must 
 wear soft clothing; he that, in the morning, 
 was dragging his fetters of iron, before night 
 was adorned with a chain of gold. 
 
 (3.) He made him <I>ride in the second chariot</I> to his 
 own, and ordered all to do homage to him: 
 "<I>Bow the knee,</I> as to Pharaoh himself." 
 
 (4.) He gave him a new name, to show his 
 authority over him, and yet such a name as 
 bespoke the value he had for him, <I>Zaphnath-paaneah--A 
 revealer of secrets.</I> 
 
 (5.) He married 
 him honourably to a prince's daughter. 
 Where God had been liberal in giving 
 wisdom and other merits, Pharaoh was 
 not sparing in conferring honours. Now 
 this preferment of Joseph was, 
 
 [1.] An 
 abundant recompense for his innocent and 
 patient suffering, a lasting instance of the 
 equity and goodness of Providence, and an 
 encouragement to all good people to trust in 
 a good God. 
 
 [2.] It was typical of the 
 
 <A NAME="Page231"> </A>

 exaltation of Christ, that great <I>revealer of 
 secrets</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>),
 or, as some translate 
 Joseph's new name, the <I>Saviour of the world.</I> 
 The brightest glories of the upper world 
 are put upon him, the highest trust is 
 lodged in his hand, and all power is given 
 to him both in heaven and earth. He is gatherer, 
 keeper, and disposer, of all the stores 
 of divine grace, and chief ruler of the kingdom 
 of God among men. The work of ministers 
 is to cry before him, "<I>Bow the knee; kiss the 
 Son.</I>"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>46 And Joseph <I>was</I> thirty years old 
 when he stood before Pharaoh king 
 of Egypt. And Joseph went out from 
 the presence of Pharaoh, and went 
 throughout all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 47 And in the seven plenteous years the 
 earth brought forth by handfuls.
 &nbsp; 48 And he gathered up all the food of 
 the seven years, which were in the 
 land of Egypt, and laid up the food 
 in the cities: the food of the field, 
 which <I>was</I> round about every city, laid
 he up in the same.
 &nbsp; 49 And Joseph 
 gathered corn as the sand of the sea, 
 very much, until he left numbering; 
 for <I>it was</I> without number.
 &nbsp; 50 And 
 unto Joseph were born two sons before 
 the years of famine came, which 
 Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah 
 priest of On bare unto him.
 &nbsp; 51 And 
 Joseph called the name of the firstborn 
 Manasseh: For God, <I>said he,</I> 
 hath made me forget all my toil, and 
 all my father's house.
 &nbsp; 52 And the 
 name of the second called he Ephraim: 
 For God hath caused me to be fruitful 
 in the land of my affliction.
 &nbsp; 53 And the seven years of plenteousness, 
 that was in the land of Egypt, were 
 ended.
 &nbsp; 54 And the seven years of 
 dearth began to come, according as
 Joseph had said: and the dearth was 
 in all lands; but in all the land of 
 Egypt there was bread.
 &nbsp; 55 And when 
 all the land of Egypt was famished, 
 the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: 
 and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, 
 Go unto Joseph; what he saith 
 to you, do.
 &nbsp; 56 And the famine was 
 over all the face of the earth: and
 Joseph opened all the storehouses, 
 and sold unto the Egyptians; and 
 the famine waxed sore in the land of 
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 57 And all countries came 
 into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <I>corn;</I> 
 because that the famine was <I>so</I> sore in 
 all lands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 I. The building of Joseph's 
 family in the birth of two sons, Manasseh 
 and Ephraim,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:50-52"><I>v.</I> 50-52</A>.
 In the names he 
 gave them, he owned the divine Providence 
 giving this happy turn to his affairs, 
 
 1. He 
 was made to forget his misery,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:16">Job xi. 16</A>.
 We should bear our afflictions when they are 
 present as those that know not but Providence 
 may so outweigh them by after-comforts 
 as that we may even forget them 
 when they are past. But could he be so 
 unnatural as to <I>forget all his father's house?</I>
 He means the unkindness he received from 
 his brethren, or perhaps the wealth and 
 honour he expected from his father, with the 
 birthright. The robes he now wore made 
 him forget the coat of divers colours which 
 he wore in his father's house. 
 
 2. He was 
 made <I>fruitful in the land of his affliction.</I> It 
 had been the land of his affliction, and in 
 some sense it was still so, for it was not 
 Canaan, the land of promise. His distance 
 from his father was still his affliction. Note, 
 Light is sometimes sown for the righteous in 
 a barren and unlikely soil; and yet if God 
 sow it, and water it, it will come up again. 
 The afflictions of the saints promote their 
 fruitfulness. <I>Ephraim</I> signifies <I>fruitfulness,</I> 
 and <I>Manasseh forgetfulness,</I> for these two 
 often go together; when Jeshurun waxed fat, 
 he forgot God his Maker.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The accomplishment of Joseph's predictions. 
 Pharaoh had great confidence in 
 the truth of them, perhaps finding in his own 
 mind, beyond what another person could, an 
 exact correspondence between them and his 
 dreams, as between the key and the lock;
 and the event showed that he was not deceived. 
 The seven plenteous years came
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),
 and, at length, they were ended,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:54"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.
 Note, We ought to foresee the approaching 
 period of the days both of our prosperity and 
 of our opportunity, and therefore must not 
 be secure in the enjoyment of our prosperity 
 nor slothful in the improvement of our opportunity; 
 years of plenty will end, therefore, 
 Whatever thy hand finds to do do it; 
 and gather in gathering time. <I>The morning 
 cometh and also the night</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:12">Isa. xxi. 12</A>),
 the plenty and also the famine. 
 <I>The seven years 
 of dearth began to come,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.
 See what changes of condition we are liable to in this 
 world, and what need we have to be joyful 
 in a day of prosperity and in a day of adversity 
 to consider,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>.
 This famine, 
 it seems, was not only in Egypt, but in other 
 lands, in <I>all lands,</I> that is, all the neighbouring 
 countries; <I>fruitful lands</I> are soon <I>turned 
 into barrenness for the iniquity of those that 
 dwell therein,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:34">Ps. cvii. 34</A>.
 It is here said 
 that <I>in the land of Egypt there was bread,</I> 
 meaning probably, not only that which Joseph 
 had bought up for the king, but that 
 which private persons, by his example, and 
 
 <A NAME="Page232"> </A>

 upon the public notice of this prediction, as 
 well as by the rules of common prudence, 
 had laid up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The performance of Joseph's trust. 
 He was found faithful to it, as a steward 
 ought to be. 
 
 1. He was diligent in laying 
 up, while the plenty lasted,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>.
 He 
 that thus gathers is a wise son. 
 
 2. He was 
 prudent and careful in giving out, when the 
 famine came, and kept the markets low by 
 furnishing them at reasonable rates out of 
 his stores. The people in distress cried to 
 Pharaoh, as that woman to the king of Israel
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:26">2 Kings vi. 26</A>),
 <I>Help, my lord, O king:</I> he 
 sent them to his treasurer, <I>Go to Joseph.</I> 
 Thus God in the gospel directs those that 
 apply to him for mercy and grace to <I>go to the 
 Lord Jesus,</I> in whom all fulness dwells; and, 
 <I>What he saith to you, do.</I> Joseph, no doubt, 
 with wisdom and justice fixed the price of 
 the corn he sold, so that Pharaoh, whose 
 money had bought it up, might have a reasonable 
 profit, and yet the country might not 
 be oppressed, nor advantage taken of their 
 prevailing necessity; while he that withholdest 
 corn when it is dear, in hopes it will 
 yet grow dearer, though people perish for 
 want of it, has many a curse for so doing 
 (and it is not a curse causeless), <I>blessings 
 shall be upon the head of him that</I> thus <I>selleth 
 it,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:26">Prov. xi. 26</A>.
 And let the price be determined 
 by that golden rule of justice, to do as
 we would be done by.</P>
