 This chapter belongs to "the book of the wars of the Lord," in which it
 is probable it was inserted. It is the history of a holy war, a war
 with Midian. Here is,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
 shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
 yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites,
 and avenge the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of Midian.
 &nbsp; 4 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
 Israel, shall ye send to the war.
 &nbsp; 5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
 thousand of <I>every</I> tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of <I>every</I> tribe,
 them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with
 the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The Lord of hosts gives orders to Moses to make war upon the 
 Midianites, and his commission no doubt justified this war, though it 
 will not serve to justify the like without such commission. The 
 Midianites were the posterity of Abraham by Keturah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:2">Gen. xxv. 2</A>.

 Some of them settled south of Canaan, among whom Jethro lived, and they
 retained the worship of the true God; but these were settled east of 
 Canaan, and had fallen into idolatry, neighbours to, and in confederacy 
 with, the Moabites. Their land was not designed to be given to Israel, 
 nor would Israel have meddled with them if they had not made themselves 
 obnoxious to their resentment by sending their bad women among them to 
 draw them to whoredom and idolatry. This was the provocation, this was 
 the quarrel. For this (says God) <I>avenge Israel of the 
 Midianites,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 1. God would have the Midianites chastised, an inroad made upon that 
 part of their country which lay next to the camp of Israel, and which 
 was probably more concerned in that mischief than the Moabites, who 
 therefore were let alone. God will have us to reckon those our worst 
 enemies that draw us to sin, and to avoid them; and since <I>every man 
 is tempted when he is drawn aside of his own lusts,</I> and these are 
 the Midianites which ensnare us with their wiles, on them we should 
 avenge ourselves, not only make no league with them, but make war upon 
 them by living a life of mortification. God had taken vengeance on his 
 own people for yielding to the Midianites' temptations; now the 
 Midianites, that gave the temptation, must be reckoned with, for <I>the 
 deceived and the deceiver are his</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:16">Job xii. 16</A>),

 both accountable to his tribunal; and, though <I>judgment begin at the
 house of God,</I> it shall not end there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1 Pet. iv. 17</A>.

 There is a day coming when vengeance will be taken on those that have
 introduced errors and corruptions into the church, and the devil that 
 deceived men will be <I>cast into the lake of fire.</I> Israel's 
 quarrel with Amalek, that fought against them, was not avenged till 
 long after: but their quarrel with Midian, that debauched them, was 
 speedily avenged, for they were looked upon as much more the dangerous 
 and malicious enemies.

 2. God would have it done by Moses, in his life-time, that he who had
 so deeply resented that injury might have the satisfaction of seeing it 
 avenged. "See this execution done upon the enemies of God and Israel, 
 and <I>afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.</I>" This was 
 the only piece of service of this kind that Moses must further do, and 
 then he has accomplished, as a hireling, his day, and shall have his 
 <I>quietus--enter into rest:</I> hitherto his usefulness must come, and
 no further; the wars of Canaan must be carried on by another hand.
 Note, God sometimes removes useful men when we think they can be ill 
 spared; but this ought to satisfy us, that they are never removed till 
 they have done the work which was appointed them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses gives orders to the people to prepare for this expedition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He would not have the whole body of the camp to stir, but they must 
 <I>arm some of themselves to the war,</I> such as were either most fit 
 or most forward, and <I>avenge the Lord of Midian.</I> God said, 
 <I>Avenge Israel;</I> Moses says, <I>Avenge the Lord;</I> for the 
 interests of God and Israel are united, and the cause of both is one 
 and the same. And if God, in what he does, shows himself jealous for 
 the honour of Israel, surely Israel, in what they do, ought to show 
 themselves jealous for the glory of God. Then only we can justify the 
 avenging of ourselves when it is the vengeance of the Lord that we 
 engage in. Nay, for this reason we are forbidden to avenge ourselves, 
 because God has said, <I>Vengeance is mine, I will repay.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A detachment is drawn out accordingly for this service, 1000 
 <I>out of every tribe,</I> 12,000 in all, a small number in comparison 
 with what they could have sent, and it is probable small in comparison 
 with the number of the enemies they were sent against. But God would 
 teach them that it is all one to him <I>to save by many or by few,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:6">1 Sam. xiv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Phinehas the son of Eleazar is sent along with them. It is strange 
 that no mention is made of Joshua in this great action. If he was 
 general of these forces, who do we not find him leading them out? If he 
 tarried at home, why do we not find him meeting them with Moses at 
 their return? It is probable, each tribe having a captain of its own 
 thousand, there was no general, but they proceeded in the order of 
 their march through the wilderness, Judah first, and the rest in their 
 posts, under the command of their respective captains, spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 But, the war being a holy war, Phinehas was their common head, not to 
 supply the place of a general, but, by the oracle of God, to determine 
 the resolves of their counsels of war, in which the captains of 
 thousands would all acquiesce, and according to which they would act in 
 conjunction. He therefore took with him the holy instruments or 
 vessels, probably the breast-plate of judgment, by which God might he 
 consulted in any emergency. Though he was not yet the high priest, yet 
 he might be delegated <I>pro hac vice--for this particular occasion,</I>
 to bear the urim and thummim, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:6">1 Sam. xxiii. 6</A>.

 And there was a particular reason for sending Phinehas to preside in
 this expedition; he has already signalized himself for his zeal against 
 the Midianites and their cursed arts to ensnare Israel when he slew 
 Cozbi, a daughter of a chief house in Midian, for her impudence in the 
 matter of Peor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:15"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 15</A>.

 He that had so well used the sword of justice against a particular
 criminal was best qualified to guide the sword of war against the whole 
 nation. <I>Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee 
 ruler over many things.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 Moses; and they slew all the males.
 &nbsp; 8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
 that were slain; <I>namely,</I> Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
 Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew
 with the sword.
 &nbsp; 9 And the children of Israel took <I>all</I> the women of Midian
 captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their
 cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
 &nbsp; 10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
 their goodly castles, with fire.
 &nbsp; 11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, <I>both</I> of men
 and of beasts.
 &nbsp; 12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
 unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of
 the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab,
 which <I>are</I> by Jordan <I>near</I> Jericho.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The descent which this little army of Israelites made, under the 
 divine commission, conduct, and command, upon the country of Midian. 
 They <I>warred against the Midianites.</I> It is very probable that 
 they first published their manifesto, showing the reasons of the war, 
 and requiring them to give up the ringleaders of the mischief to 
 justice; for such afterwards was the <I>law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10">Deut. xx. 10</A>),

 and such the <I>practice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:12,13">Judg. xx. 12, 13</A>.

 But the Midianites justifying what they had done, and standing by those
 that had done it, the Israelites attacked them with fire and sword, and 
 all the pious fury with which their zeal for God and their people 
 inspired them.

 2. The execution (the military execution) they did in this descent.

 (1.) <I>They slew all the males</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, all they met with as far as they went; they put them all to 
 the sword, and gave no quarter. But that they did not slay all the 
 males of the nation is certain, for we find the Midianites a powerful 
 and formidable enemy to Israel in the days of Gideon; and they were the 
 Midianites of this country, for they are reckoned with the <I>children 
 of the east,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:3">Judg. vi. 3</A>.

 (2.) They <I>slew the kings of Midian</I> the same that are called
 <I>elders of Midian</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:4"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 4</A>),

 and the <I>dukes of Sihon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:21">Josh. xiii. 21</A>.

 Five of these princes are here named, one of whom is <I>Zur,</I>
 probably the same Zur whose daughter Cosbi was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:15"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 15</A>.

 (3.) They slew Balaam. Many conjectures there are as to what brought
 Balaam among the Midianites at this time; it is probable that the 
 Midianites, having intelligence of the march of this army of Israelites 
 against them, hired Balaam to come and assist them with his 
 enchantments, that if he could not prevail to act offensively in their 
 favour, by cursing the armies of Israel, yet he might act defensively, 
 by blessing the country of Midian. Whatever was the occasion of his 
 being there, God's overruling providence brought him thither, and there 
 his just vengeance found him. Had he himself believed what he said of 
 the happy state of Israel, he would not have herded thus with the 
 enemies of Israel; but justly does he die the death of the wicked 
 (though he pretended to desire that of the righteous), and go <I>down 
 slain to the pit with the uncircumcised,</I> who rebelled thus against 
 the convictions of his own conscience. The Midianites' wiles were 
 Balaam's projects, it was therefore just that he should perish with 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:5">Hos. iv. 5</A>.

 Now was <I>his</I> folly made manifest to all men, who foretold the
 fate of others, but foresaw not his own.

 (4.) They took all the <I>women and children captives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (5.) They <I>burnt their cities and goodly castles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 not designing to inhabit them themselves (that country was out of their 
 line), but they thus prevented those who had made their escape from 
 sheltering themselves in their own country and settling there again.  
 Some understand it of their idol-temples; it was fit that they should 
 share in this vengeance.

 (6.) They plundered the country, and carried off all the cattle and
 valuable goods, and so returned to the camp of Israel laden with a very 
 rich booty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:9,11,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 11, 12</A>.

 Thus (as when they came out of Egypt) they were enriched with the 
 spoils of their enemies, and furnished with stock for the good land 
 into which God was bringing them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of
 the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
 &nbsp; 14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, <I>with</I>
 the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
 came from the battle.
 &nbsp; 15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
 &nbsp; 16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
 counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the
 matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and
 kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
 &nbsp; 18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by
 lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
 &nbsp; 19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
 killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify
 <I>both</I> yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the
 seventh day.
 &nbsp; 20 And purify all <I>your</I> raiment, and all that is made of
 skins, and all work of goats' <I>hair,</I> and all things made of
 wood.
 &nbsp; 21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went
 to the battle, This <I>is</I> the ordinance of the law which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded Moses;
 &nbsp; 22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
 and the lead,
 &nbsp; 23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make <I>it</I> go
 through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be
 purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not
 the fire ye shall make go through the water.
 &nbsp; 24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
 shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the triumphant return of the army of Israel from the war 
 with Midian, and here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They were met with great respect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Moses himself, notwithstanding his age and gravity, walked out of the 
 camp to congratulate them on their victory, and to grace the solemnity 
 of their triumphs. Public successes should be publicly acknowledged, to 
 the glory of God, and the encouragement of those that have jeoparded 
 their lives in their country's cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They were severely reproved for saving the women alive. It is very 
 probable that Moses had commanded them to kill the women, at least this 
 was implied in the general order to avenge Israel of the Midianites; 
 the execution having reference to that crime, their drawing them in to 
 the worship of Peor, it was easy to conclude that the women, who were 
 the principal criminals, must not be spared. What! says Moses, <I>have 
 you saved the women alive?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He was moved with a holy indignation at the sight of them. <I>These 
 were those that caused the children of Israel to commit this 
 trespass;</I> and therefore,

 1. It is just that they should die. The law in case of whoredom was,
 <I>The adulterer and adulteress should surely be put to death.</I> God 
 had put to death the adulterers of Israel by the plague, and now it was 
 fit that the adulteresses of Midian, especially since they had been the 
 tempters, should be put to death by the sword. 

 2. "It is dangerous to let them live; they will be still tempting the
 Israelites to uncleanness, and so your captives will be your conquerors 
 and a second time your destroyers." Severe orders are therefore given 
 that all the grown women should be slain in cold blood, and only the 
 female children spared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They were obliged to purify themselves, according to the ceremony 
 of the law, and to abide without the camp seven days, till their 
 purification was accomplished. For, 

 1. They had imbrued their hands in blood, by which though they had not 
 contracted any moral guilt, the war being just and lawful, yet they 
 were brought under a ceremonial uncleanness, which rendered them unfit 
 to come near the tabernacle till they were purified. Thus God would 
 preserve in their minds a dread and detestation of murder. David must 
 not build the temple because he had been a <I>man of war, and had shed 
 blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:3">1 Chron. xxviii. 3</A>.

 2. They could not but have touched dead bodies, by which they were
 polluted, and that required they should be purified with the water of 
 separation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:19,20,24"><I>v.</I> 19, 20, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They must likewise purify the spoil they had taken, the captives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and all the goods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>.

 What would bear the fire must pass through the fire, and what would not 
 must be washed with water. These things had been use by Midianites, 
 and, having now come into the possession of Israelites, it was fit that 
 they should be sanctified to the service of that holy nation and the 
 honour of their holy God. To us now every thing is sanctified by the 
 word and prayer, if we are sanctified by the Spirit, who is compared 
 both to fire and water. <I>To the pure all things are pure.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 26 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, <I>both</I> of man and
 of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
 the congregation:
 &nbsp; 27 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took
 the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
 congregation:
 &nbsp; 28 And levy a tribute unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of the men of war which
 went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, <I>both</I> of the
 persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
 &nbsp; 29 Take <I>it</I> of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the
 priest, <I>for</I> an heave offering of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
 portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
 and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
 the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 Moses.

 war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
 five thousand sheep,
 &nbsp; 33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
 &nbsp; 34 And threescore and one thousand asses,
 &nbsp; 35 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that
 had not known man by lying with him.
 &nbsp; 36 And the half, <I>which was</I> the portion of them that went out
 to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
 thousand and five hundred sheep:
 &nbsp; 37 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
 threescore and fifteen.
 &nbsp; 38 And the beeves <I>were</I> thirty and six thousand; of which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s tribute <I>was</I> threescore and twelve.
 &nbsp; 39 And the asses <I>were</I> thirty thousand and five hundred; of
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s tribute <I>was</I> threescore and one.
 &nbsp; 40 And the persons <I>were</I> sixteen thousand; of which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 tribute <I>was</I> thirty and two persons.
 &nbsp; 41 And Moses gave the tribute, <I>which was</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s heave
 offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 42 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided
 from the men that warred,
 &nbsp; 43 (Now the half <I>that pertained unto</I> the congregation was
 three hundred thousand and thirty thousand <I>and</I> seven thousand
 and five hundred sheep,
 &nbsp; 44 And thirty and six thousand beeves,
 &nbsp; 45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
 &nbsp; 46 And sixteen thousand persons;)
 &nbsp; 47 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one
 portion of fifty, <I>both</I> of man and of beast, and gave them unto
 the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the distribution of the spoil which was taken in this 
 expedition against Midian. God himself directed how it should be 
 distributed, and Moses and Eleazar did according to the directions, and 
 thus unhappy contests among themselves were prevented and the victory 
 was made to turn to the common benefit. It was fit that he who gave 
 them the prey should order the disposal of it. All we have is from God, 
 and therefore must be subject to his will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prey is ordered to be divided into two parts, one for the 12,000 
 men that undertook the war, and the other for the congregation. The 
 prey that was divided seems to have been only the captives and the 
 cattle; as for the plate, and jewels, and other goods, every man kept 
 what he took, as is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:50-53"><I>v.</I> 50-53</A>.

 That only was distributed which would be of use for the stocking of 
 that good land into which they were going. Now observe,

 1. That the one half of the prey was given to the whole congregation, 
 Moses allotting to each tribe its share, and then leaving it to the 
 heads of the tribes to divide their respective shares among themselves, 
 according to their families. The war was undertaken on the behalf of 
 the whole congregation; they would all have been ready to <I>go to the 
 help of the Lord against the mighty,</I> if they had been so ordered, 
 and they did help, it is likely, by their prayers; and therefore God 
 appoints that those that <I>tarried at home should divide the 
 spoil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:12">Ps. lxviii. 12</A>.

 David, in his time, made it a <I>statute and an ordinance for
 Israel,</I> that, as his part is that <I>goes down to the battle, so 
 shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:24,25">1 Sam. xxx. 24, 25</A>.

 Those that are employed in public trusts must not think to benefit
 themselves only by their toils and hazards, but must aim at the 
 advantage of the community.

 2. That yet the 12,000 that went to the battle had as much for their
 share as the whole congregation (which were fifty times as many) had 
 for theirs; so that the particular persons of the soldiery had a much 
 better share than any of their brethren that tarried at home: and good 
 reason they should. The greater pains we take, and the greater hazards 
 we run, in the service of God and our generation, the greater will our 
 recompence be at last; for <I>God is not unrighteous to forget the work 
 and labour of love.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God was to have a tribute out of it, as an acknowledgment of his 
 sovereignty over them in general, and that he was their king to whom 
 <I>tribute was due,</I> and particularly of his interest in this war 
 and the gains of it, he having given them their success; and that the 
 priests, the Lord's receivers, might have something added to the 
 provision made for their maintenance. Note, Whatever we have, God must 
 have his dues out of it. And here (as before) the soldiers are favoured 
 above the rest of the congregation, for out of the people's share God 
 required one in fifty, but out of the soldier's share only one in 500, 
 because the people got theirs easily, without any peril or fatigue. The 
 less opportunity we have of honouring God with our personal services 
 the more it is expected we should honour him with our substance. The 
 tribute out of the soldiers' half was given to the priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 that out of the people's half was given to the Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 For the priests were taken from among the Levites, as these soldiers 
 from among the people, for special and hazardous service, and their pay 
 was proportioned accordingly.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>48 And the officers which <I>were</I> over thousands of the host,
 the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
 unto Moses:
 &nbsp; 49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
 the men of war which <I>are</I> under our charge, and there lacketh
 not one man of us.
 &nbsp; 50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, what
 every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
 rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,
 <I>even</I> all wrought jewels.
 &nbsp; 52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
 hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
 &nbsp; 53 (<I>For</I> the men of war had taken spoil, every man for
 himself.)
 &nbsp; 54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the
 captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
 tabernacle of the congregation, <I>for</I> a memorial for the children
 of Israel before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a great example of piety and devotion in the officers of the 
 army, the colonels, that are called <I>captains of thousands,</I> and 
 the inferior officers that were <I>captains of hundreds;</I> they came 
 to Moses as their general and commander-in-chief, and, though he was 
 now going off the stage they very humbly and respectfully addressed 
 themselves to him, calling themselves his <I>servants;</I> the honours 
 they had won did not puff them up, so as to make them forget their duty 
 to him. Observe in their address to them, 

 1. The pious notice they take of God's wonderful goodness to them in 
 this late expedition, in preserving not only their own lives, but the 
 lives of all the men of war that they had under their charge; so that, 
 upon the review of their muster-roll, it appeared there was not one 
 missing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 This was very extraordinary, and perhaps cannot be paralleled in any 
 history. So many thousands of lives jeoparded in the high places of the 
 field, and not one lost, either by the sword of the enemy or by any 
 disease or disaster. This was <I>the Lord's doing,</I> and cannot but 
 be marvellous in the eyes of those that consider how the lives of all 
 men, especially soldiers, are continually in their hands.  It is an 
 evidence of the tender feeling which these commanders had for their 
 soldiers, and that their lives were very precious to them, that they 
 looked upon it as a mercy to themselves that none of those under their 
 charge miscarried. <I>Of all that were given them they had lost 
 none;</I> so precious also is the blood of Christ's subjects and 
 soldiers to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 2. The pious acknowledgment they make for this favour: <I>Therefore we
 have brought an oblation to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 The oblation they brought was out of that which <I>every man had 
 gotten,</I> and it was gotten honestly by a divine warrant. Thus every 
 man should lay by <I>according as God has prospered him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 For where God sows plentifully in the gifts of his bounty he expects to
 reap accordingly in the fruits of our piety and charity. The tabernacle 
 first, and the temple afterwards, were beautified and enriched with the 
 spoils taken from the enemies of Israel; as by David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:11,12">2 Sam. viii. 11, 12</A>),

 and his captains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+26:26,27">1 Chron. xxvi. 26, 27</A>.

 We should never take any thing to ourselves, in war or trade, which we
 cannot in faith consecrate a part of to God, who <I>hates robbery for 
 burnt-offerings;</I> but, when God has remarkably preserved and 
 prospered us, he expects that we should make some particular return of 
 gratitude to him. As to this oblation,

 (1.) The captains offered it to <I>make an atonement for their
 souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 Instead of coming to Moses to demand a recompence for the good service 
 they had done in <I>avenging the Lord of Midian,</I> or to set up 
 trophies of their victory for the immortalizing of their own names, 
 they bring an oblation to <I>make atonement for their souls,</I> being 
 conscious to themselves, as the best men must be even in their best 
 services, that they had been defective in their duty, not only in that 
 instance for which they were reproved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but in many others; <I>for there is not a just man upon the earth that 
 doeth good and sinneth not.</I>

 (2.) Moses accepted it, and laid it up in the tabernacle <I>as a
 memorial for the children of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 that is, a monument of God's goodness to them, that they might be 
 encouraged to trust in him in their further wars, and a monument of 
 their gratitude to God (sacrifices are said to be memorials), that he, 
 being well pleased with this thankful acknowledgment of favours 
 bestowed, might continue and repeat his mercies to them.</P>
