 Moses, in this chapter, proceeds in the rehearsal of God's providences 
 concerning Israel in their way to Canaan, yet preserves not the record 
 of any thing that happened during their tedious march back to the Red 
 Sea, in which they wore out almost thirty-eight years, but passes that 
 over in silence as a dark time, and makes his narrative to begin again 
 when they faced about towards Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),

 and drew towards the countries that were inhabited, concerning which
 God here gives them direction, 

 I.  What nations they must not give any disturbance to.

 1.  Not to the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 2. Not to the Moabites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9">ver. 9</A>),

 of the antiquities of whose country, with that of the Edomites, he
 gives some account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>. 

 And here comes in an account of their passing the river Zered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>. 

 3. Not to the Ammonites, of whose country here is some account given,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:17-23">ver. 17-23</A>. 

 II. What nations they should attack and conquer. They must begin with
 Sihon, king of the Amorites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.
 
 And accordingly,

 1. They had a fair occasion of quarrelling with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:26-32">ver. 26-32</A>.

 2.  God gave them a complete victory over him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:33-37">ver. 33</A>,
 
 &c.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
 the way of the Red sea, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto me: and we
 compassed mount Seir many days.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
 northward.
 &nbsp; 4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye <I>are</I> to pass through
 the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in
 Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto
 yourselves therefore:
 &nbsp; 5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
 no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
 Seir unto Esau <I>for</I> a possession.
 &nbsp; 6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
 shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
 &nbsp; 7 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of
 thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
 these forty years the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>hath been</I> with thee; thou
 hast lacked nothing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A short account of the long stay of Israel in the wilderness: <I>We 
 compassed Mount Seir many days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Nearly <I>thirty-eight</I> years they wandered in the deserts of Seir; 
 probably in some of their rests they staid several years, and never 
 stirred; God by this not only chastised them for their murmuring and 
 unbelief, but,

 1. Prepared them for Canaan, by humbling them for sin, teaching them to
 mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. 
 It is a work of time to make souls meet for heaven, and it must be done 
 by a long train of exercises. 

 2. He prepared the Canaanites for destruction. All this time the 
 measure of their iniquity was filling up; and, though it might have 
 been improved by them as a space to repent in, it was abused by them to 
 the hardening of their hearts. Now that the host of Israel was once 
 repulsed, and after that was so long entangled and seemingly lost in 
 the wilderness, they were secure, and thought the danger was over from 
 that quarter, which would make the next attempt of Israel upon them the 
 more dreadful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Orders given them to turn towards Canaan. Though God contend long, 
 he will not contend for ever. Though Israel may be long kept waiting 
 for deliverance or enlargement, it will come at last: <I>The vision is 
 for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak, and not 
 lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A charge given them not to annoy the Edomites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must not offer any hostility to them as enemies: <I>Meddle not 
 with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 (1.) They must not improve the advantage they had against them, by the
 fright they would be put into upon Israel's approach: "<I>They shall be 
 afraid of you,</I> knowing your strength and numbers, and the power of 
 God engaged for you; but think not that, because their fears make them 
 an easy prey, you may therefore prey upon them; no, <I>take heed to 
 yourselves.</I>" There is need of great caution and a strict government 
 of our own spirits, to keep ourselves from injuring those against whom 
 we have an advantage. Or this caution is given to the princes; they 
 must not only not meddle with the Edomites themselves, but not permit 
 any of the soldiers to meddle with them.

 (2.) They must not avenge upon the Edomites the affront they gave them 
 in refusing them passage through their country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:21">Num. xx. 21</A>.

 Thus, before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he 
 taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom.

 (3.) They must not expect to have any part of their land given them for
 a possession: Mount Seir was already settled upon the Edomites, and 
 they must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to 
 seize for themselves all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not 
 founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not 
 expect to be <I>placed alone in the midst of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:8">Isa. v. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must trade with them as neighbours, buy meat and water of them, 
 and pay for what they bought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. The reason given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 is, "God hath blessed thee, and hitherto thou hast lacked nothing; and 
 therefore,"

 (1.) "Thou needest not beg; scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou
 hast a God all-sufficient to depend upon. Thou hast wherewithal to pay 
 for what thou callest for (thanks to the divine blessing!); use 
 therefore what thou hast, use it cheerfully, and do not sponge upon the 
 Edomites."

 (2.) "Therefore thou must not steal. Thou hast experienced the care of
 the divine providence concerning thee, in confidence of which for the 
 future, and in a firm belief of its sufficiency, never use any indirect 
 methods for thy supply. Live by the faith and not by thy sword."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
 which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and
 from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
 wilderness of Moab.
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
 contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
 land <I>for</I> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
 children of Lot <I>for</I> a possession.
 &nbsp; 10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
 many, and tall, as the Anakims;
 &nbsp; 11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
 Moabites call them Emims.
 &nbsp; 12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children
 of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
 them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
 his possession, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave unto them.
 &nbsp; 13 Now rise up, <I>said I,</I> and get you over the brook Zered. And
 we went over the brook Zered.
 &nbsp; 14 And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we
 were come over the brook Zered, <I>was</I> thirty and eight years;
 until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from
 among the host, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto them.
 &nbsp; 15 For indeed the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was against them, to destroy
 them from among the host, until they were consumed.
 &nbsp; 16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed
 and dead from among the people,
 &nbsp; 17 That the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto me, saying,
 &nbsp; 18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this
 day:
 &nbsp; 19 And <I>when</I> thou comest nigh over against the children of
 Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not
 give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <I>any</I> possession;
 because I have given it unto the children of Lot <I>for</I> a
 possession.
 &nbsp; 20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
 therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
 &nbsp; 21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
 dwelt in their stead:
 &nbsp; 22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
 he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
 them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
 &nbsp; 23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <I>even</I> unto Azzah, the
 Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and
 dwelt in their stead.)
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is observable here that Moses, speaking of the Edomites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 calls them, "<I>our brethren, the children of Esau.</I>" Though they 
 had been unkind to Israel, in refusing them a peaceable passage through 
 their country, yet he calls them brethren.  For, though our relations 
 fail in their duty to us, we must retain a sense of the relation, and 
 not be wanting in our duty to them, as there is occasion. Now in these 
 verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account which Moses gives of the origin of the nations of which 
 he had here occasion to speak, the Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites. 
 We know very well, from other parts of his history, whose posterity 
 they were; but here he tells us how they came to those countries in 
 which Israel found them; they were not the <I>aborigines,</I> or first 
 planters. But, 

 1. The Moabites dwelt in a country which had belonged to a numerous
 race of giants, called <I>Emim</I> (that is, <I>terrible ones</I>), as 
 tall as the Anakim, and perhaps more fierce, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 2. The Edomites in like manner dispossessed the Horim from Mount Seir, 
 and took their country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 of which we read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:20">Gen. xxxvi. 20</A>.

 3. The Ammonites likewise got possession of a country that had formerly
 been inhabited by giants, called <I>Zamzummim, crafty men,</I> or 
 <I>wicked men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),
 
 probably the same that are called <I>Zuzim,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:5">Gen. xiv. 5</A>.

 He illustrates these remarks by an instance older than any of these;
 the Caphtorim (who were akin to the Philistines,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:14">Gen. x. 14</A>)

 drove the Avim out of their country, and took possession of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The learned bishop Patrick supposes these Avites, being expelled hence,
 to have settled in Assyria, and to be the same people we read of under 
 that name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:31">2 Kings xvii. 31</A>.

 Now these revolutions are recorded, 

 (1.) To show how soon the world was peopled after the flood, so well
 peopled that, when a family grew numerous, they could not find a place 
 to settle in, at least in that part of the world, but they must drive 
 out those that were already settled.

 (2.) To show that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
 strong.  Giants were expelled by those of ordinary stature; for 
 probably these giants, like those before the flood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:4">Gen. vi. 4</A>),
 
 were notorious for impiety and oppression, which brought the judgments 
 of God upon them, against which their great strength would be on 
 defence.

 (3.) To show what uncertain things worldly possessions are, and how
 often they change their owners; it was so of old, and ever will be so. 
 Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families 
 that increase; so little constancy or continuance is there in these 
 things.  

 (4.) To encourage the children of Israel, who were now going to take 
 possession of Canaan, against the difficulties they would meet with, 
 and to show the unbelief of those that were afraid of the sons of Anak, 
 to whom the giants, here said to be conquered, are compared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:11,21"><I>v.</I>  11, 21</A>.

 If the providence of God had done this for the Moabites and Ammonites, 
 much more would his promise do it for Israel his peculiar people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The advances which Israel made towards Canaan. They <I>passed by 
 the way of the wilderness of Moab</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and then went over the brook or vale of Zered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and there Moses takes notice of the fulfilling of the word which God 
 had spoken concerning them, that none of those that were numbered at 
 Mount Sinai should see the land that God had promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:23">Num. xiv. 23</A>.

 According to that sentence, now that they began to set their faces
 towards Canaan, and to have it in their eye, notice is taken of their 
 being all destroyed and consumed, and not a man of them left, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Common providence, we may observe, in about thirty-eight years,
 ordinarily raises a new generation, so that in that time few remain of 
 the old one; but here it was entirely new, and none at all remained but 
 Caleb and Joshua: <I>for indeed the hand of the Lord was against 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Those cannot but waste, until they were consumed, who have the hand of
 God against them. Observe, Israel is not called to engage with the 
 Canaanites till all the men of war, the veteran regiments, that had 
 been used to hardship, and had learned the art of war from the 
 Egyptians, <I>were consumed and dead from among the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that the conquest of Canaan, being effected by a host of new-raised 
 men, trained up in a wilderness, the excellency of the power might the 
 more plainly appear to be <I>of God and not of men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The caution given them not to meddle with the Moabites or 
 Ammonites, whom they must not disseize, nor so much as disturb in their 
 possessions: <I>Distress them not, nor contend with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Though the Moabites aimed to ruin Israel
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:6">Num. xxii. 6</A>),

 yet Israel must not aim to ruin them. If others design us a mischief, 
 this will not justify us in designing them a mischief. But why must not 
 the Moabites and Ammonites be meddled with?

 1. Because they were the <I>children of Lot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9,19"><I>v.</I> 9, 19</A>),
 
 righteous Lot, who kept his integrity in Sodom.  Note, Children often 
 fare the better in this world for the piety of their ancestors: the 
 seed of the upright, though they degenerate, yet are blessed with 
 temporal good things. 

 2. Because the land they were possessed of was what God had given them, 
 and he did not design it for Israel. Even wicked men have a right to 
 their worldly possessions, and must not be wronged. The tares are 
 allowed their place in the field, and must not be rooted out until the 
 harvest.  God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men, to 
 show that these are not the best things, but he has better in store for 
 his own children.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river
 Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite,
 king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <I>it,</I> and contend
 with him in battle.
 &nbsp; 25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear
 of thee upon the nations <I>that are</I> under the whole heaven, who
 shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish
 because of thee.
 &nbsp; 26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
 Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
 &nbsp; 27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high
 way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
 &nbsp; 28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give
 me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
 my feet;
 &nbsp; 29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the
 Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
 Jordan into the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God giveth us.
 &nbsp; 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
 obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
 <I>appeareth</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 31 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give
 Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou
 mayest inherit his land.
 &nbsp; 32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
 fight at Jahaz.
 &nbsp; 33 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God delivered him before us; and we smote
 him, and his sons, and all his people.
 &nbsp; 34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly
 destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every
 city, we left none to remain:
 &nbsp; 35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
 spoil of the cities which we took.
 &nbsp; 36 From Aroer, which <I>is</I> by the brink of the river of Arnon,
 and <I>from</I> the city that <I>is</I> by the river, even unto Gilead,
 there was not one city too strong for us: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God
 delivered all unto us:
 &nbsp; 37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
 <I>nor</I> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
 the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God forbad us. 
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God having tried the self-denial of his people in forbidding them to 
 meddle with the Moabites and Ammonites, and they having quietly passed 
 by those rich countries, and, though superior in number, not made any 
 attack upon them, here he recompenses them for their obedience by 
 giving them possession of the country of Sihon king of the Amorites. If 
 we forbear what God forbids, we shall receive what he promises, and 
 shall be no losers at last by our obedience, though it may seem for the 
 present to be to our loss. Wrong not others, and God shall right 
 thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God gives them commission to seize upon the country of Sihon king of 
 Heshbon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 This was then God's way of disposing of kingdoms, but such particular
 grants are not now either to be expected or pretended. In this 
 commission observe,

 1.  Though God assured them that the land should be their own, yet they
 must bestir themselves, and contend in battle with the enemy. What God 
 gives we must endeavour to get. 

 2. God promises that when they fight he will fight for them. Do you 
 <I>begin to possess it, and I will begin to put the dread of you</I> 
 upon them. God would dispirit the enemy and so destroy them, would 
 magnify Israel and so terrify all those against whom they were 
 commissioned. See

 II. Moses sends to Sihon a message of peace, and only begs a passage 
 through his land, with a promise to give his country no disturbance, 
 but the advantage of trading for ready money with so great a body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:26-29"><I>v.</I> 26-29</A>.

 Moses herein did neither disobey God, who bade him contend with Sihon,
 nor dissemble with Sihon; but doubtless it was by divine direction that 
 he did it, that Sihon might be left inexcusable, though God hardened 
 his heart. This may illustrate the method of God's dealing with those 
 to whom he gives his gospel, but does not give grace to believe it.</P>

 III. Sihon began the war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 God having <I>made his heart obstinate,</I> and hidden from his eyes 
 the thing that belonged to his peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 that he might deliver him into the hand of Israel. Those that meddle 
 with the people of God meddle to their own hurt; and God sometimes 
 ruins his enemies by their own resolves. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11-13,Re+16:14">Mic. iv. 11-13; Rev. xvi. 14</A>.</P>

 IV. Israel was victorious. 

 1. They put all the Amorites to the sword, men, women, and children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>);

 this they did as the executioners of God's wrath; now the measure of 
 the Amorites' iniquity was full 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:16">Gen. xv. 16</A>),

 and the longer it was in the filling the sorer was the reckoning at 
 last. This was one of the devoted nations. They died, not as Israel's 
 enemies, but as sacrifices to divine justice, in the offering of which 
 sacrifices Israel was employed, as a kingdom of priests. The case being 
 therefore extraordinary, it ought not to be drawn into a precedent for 
 military executions, which make no distinction and give no quarter: 
 those will have <I>judgment without mercy that show no mercy.</I>

 2. They took possession of all they had; their cities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),
 
 their goods
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:35"><I>v.</I>  35</A>),

 and their land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. What a new world did
 Israel now come into! Most of them were born, and had lived all their 
 days, in a vast howling wilderness, where they knew not what either 
 fields or cities were, had no houses to dwell in, and neither sowed nor 
 reaped; and now of a sudden to become masters of a country so well 
 built, so well husbanded, this made them amends for their long waiting, 
 and yet it was but the earnest of a great deal more. Much more joyful 
 will the change be which holy souls will experience when they remove 
 out of the wilderness of this world to the <I>better country, that is, 
 the heavenly, to the city that has foundations.</I></P>
