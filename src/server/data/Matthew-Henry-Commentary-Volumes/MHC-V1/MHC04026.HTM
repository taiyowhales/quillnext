 This book is called Numbers, from the numberings of the children of
 Israel, of which it gives an account. Once they were numbered at Mount
 Sinai, in the first year after they came out of Egypt, which we had an
 account of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:1-2:34"><I>ch.</I> i. and ii.</A>.

 And now a second time they were numbered in the plains of Moab, just
 before they entered Canaan, and of this we have an account in this
 chapter. We have, 
 
 I. Orders given for the doing of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. A register of the families and numbers of each tribe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:5-50">ver. 5-50</A>),

 and the sum total, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:51">ver. 51</A>.

 III. Direction given to divide the land among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:52-56">ver. 52-56</A>.

 IV.  The families and numbers of the Levites by themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:57-62">ver. 57-62</A>.

 V.  Notice taken of the fulfilling of the threatening in the death of
 all those that were first numbered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:63-65">ver.  63-65</A>),

 and to this there seems to have been a special regard in the taking and
 keeping of this account.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake
 unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
 Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
 fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the
 plains of Moab by Jordan <I>near</I> Jericho, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 <I>Take the sum of the people,</I> from twenty years old and
 upward; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses and the children of Israel,
 which went forth out of the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. That Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him.
 David in his time did it without a command, and paid dearly for it. God 
 was Israel's king, and he would not have this act of authority done but 
 by his express orders.  Moses, perhaps, by this time, had heard of the 
 blessing with which Balaam was constrained, sorely against his will, to 
 bless Israel, and particularly the notice he took of their numbers; and 
 he was sufficiently pleased with that general testimony borne to this 
 instance of their strength and honour by an adversary, though he knew 
 not their numbers exactly, till God now appointed him to take the sum 
 of them. 

 2. Eleazar was joined in commission with him, as Aaron had been before,
 by which God honoured Eleazar before the elders of his people, and 
 confirmed his succession.  

 3. It was presently after the plague that this account was ordered to
 be taken, to show that though God had in justice contended with them by 
 that sweeping pestilence, yet he had not made a full end, nor would he 
 utterly cast them off. God's Israel shall not be ruined, though it be 
 severely rebuked. 

 4. They were now to go by the same rule that they had gone by in the 
 former numbering, counting those only that were able to go forth to 
 war, for this was the service now before them.</P>

 This is the register of the tribes as they were now enrolled, in the 
 same order that they were numbered in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:1-54"><I>ch.</I> i</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account that is here kept of the families of each tribe, which 
 must not be understood of such as we call families, those that live in 
 a house together, but such as were the descendants of the several sons 
 of the patriarchs, by whose names, in honour of them, their posterity 
 distinguished themselves and one another. The families of the twelve 
 tribes are thus numbered:--Of Dan but one, for Dan had but one son, and
 yet that tribe was the most numerous of all except Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>.
 
 Its beginning was small, but its latter end greatly increased. Zebulun 
 was divided into three families, Ephraim into four, Issachar into four, 
 Naphtali into four, and Reuben into four; Judah, Simeon, and Asher, had 
 five families apiece, Gad and Benjamin seven apiece, and Manasseh 
 eight. Benjamin brought ten sons into Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:21">Gen. xlvi. 21</A>),

 but three of them, it seems either died childless or their families
 were extinct, for here we find seven only of those names preserved, and 
 that whole tribe none of the most numerous; for Providence, in the 
 building up of families and nations, does not tie itself to 
 probabilities. <I>The barren hath borne seven, and she that hath many 
 children has waxed feeble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The numbers of each tribe. And here our best entertainment will be 
 to compare these numbers with those when they were numbered at Mount 
 Sinai. The sum total was nearly the same; they were now 1820 fewer than 
 they were then; yet seven of the tribes had increased in number. Judah 
 had increased 1900, Issachar 9900, Zebulun 3100, Manasseh 20, 500, 
 Benjamin 10,200, Dan 1700, and Asher 11,900. But the other five had 
 decreased more than to balance that increase. Reuben had decreased 
 2770, Simeon 37,100, Gad 5150, Ephraim 8000, and Naphtali 8000. In this 
 account we may observe, 

 1. That all the three tribes that were encamped under the standard of
 Judah, who was the ancestor of Christ, had increased, for his church 
 shall be edified and multiplied. 

 2. That none of the tribes had increased so much as that of Manasseh, 
 which in the former account was the smallest of all the tribes, only 
 32,200, while here it is one of the most considerable; and that of his 
 brother Ephraim, which there was numerous, is here one of the least. 
 Jacob had crossed hands upon their heads, and had preferred Ephraim 
 before Manasseh, which perhaps the Ephraimites had prided themselves 
 too much in, and had trampled upon their brethren the Manassites; but, 
 when the Lord saw that Manasseh was despised, he thus multiplied him 
 exceedingly, for it is his glory to help the weakest, and raise up 
 those that are cast down. 

 3. That none of the tribes decreased so much as Simeon did; from
 59,300, it such to 22,200, little more than a third part of what it 
 was. One whole family of that tribe (namely Ohad, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:15">Exod. vi. 15</A>)

 was extinct in the wilderness. Hence Simeon is not mentioned in Moses's
 blessing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:1-29">Deut. xxxiii.</A>),

 and the lot of that tribe in Canaan was inconsiderable, only a canton
 out of Judah's lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:9">Josh. xix. 9</A>.

 Some conjecture that most of those 24,000 who were cut off by the
 plague for the iniquity of Peor were of that tribe; for Zimri, who was 
 a ringleader in that iniquity, was a prince of that tribe, many of whom 
 therefore were influenced by his example to <I>follow his pernicious 
 ways.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the account of the tribe of Reuben mention is made of the 
 rebellion of Dathan and Abiram, who were of that tribe, in confederacy 
 with Korah a Levite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 Though the story had been largely related but a few chapters before, 
 yet here it comes in again, as fit to be had in remembrance and thought 
 of by posterity, whenever they looked into their pedigree and pleased 
 themselves with the antiquity of their families and the glory of their 
 ancestors, that they might call themselves a seed of evil doers. Two 
 things are here said of them:--

 1.  That they had been <I>famous in the congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Probably they were remarkable for their ingenuity, activity, and 
 fitness for business:--<I>That Dathan and Abiram</I> that might have 
 been advanced in due time under God and Moses; but their ambitious 
 spirits put them upon striving against God and Moses, and when they 
 quarrelled with the one they quarrelled with the other. And what was 
 the issue? 

 2. Those that might have been famous were made infamous: they <I>became 
 a sign,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They were made monuments of divine justice; God, in their ruin, showed 
 himself glorious in holiness, and so they were set up for a warning to 
 all others, in all ages, to take heed of treading in the steps of their 
 pride and rebellion. Notice is here taken of the preservation of the 
 <I>children of Korah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>);

 they <I>died not,</I> as the children of Dathan and Abiram did, 
 doubtless because they kept themselves pure from the infection, and 
 would not join, no, not with their own father, in rebellion. If we 
 partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their 
 plagues. These sons of Korah were afterwards, in their posterity, 
 eminently serviceable to the church, being employed by David as singers 
 in the house of the Lord; hence many psalms are said to be for <I>the 
 sons of Korah:</I> and perhaps they were made to bear his name so long 
 after, rather than the name of any other of their ancestors, for 
 warning to themselves, and as an instance of the power of God, which 
 brought those choice fruits even out of that bitter root. The children 
 of families that have been stigmatized should endeavour, by their 
 eminent virtues, to roll away the reproach of their fathers.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>52 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 53 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance
 according to the number of names.
 &nbsp; 54 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few
 thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
 inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
 him.
 &nbsp; 55 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according
 to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.
 &nbsp; 56 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
 between many and few.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If any ask why such a particular account is kept of the tribes, and 
 families, and numbers, of the people of Israel, here is an answer for 
 them; as they were multiplied, so they were portioned, not by common 
 providence, but by promise; and, for the support of the honour of 
 divine revelation, God will have the fulfilling of the promise taken 
 notice of both in their increase and in their inheritance. When Moses 
 had numbered the people God did not say, <I>By these shall the land be 
 conquered;</I> but, taking that for granted, he tells him, <I>Unto 
 these shall the land be divided.</I> "These that are now registered as 
 the sons of Israel shall be admitted (as it were by copy of court-roll) 
 heirs of the land of Canaan." Now, in the distributing, or quartering, 
 of these tribes, 

 1. The general rule of equity is here prescribed to Moses, that to many
 he should give more, and to few he should give less 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>);

 yet, alas! <I>he</I> was so far from giving any to others that he must
 not have any himself, but this direction given to him was intended for 
 Joshua his successor.

 2. The application of this general rule was to be determined <I>by 
 lot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>);

 notwithstanding it seems thus to be left to the prudence of their
 prince, yet the matter must be finally reserved to the providence of 
 their God, in which they must all acquiesce, how much soever it 
 contradicted their policies or inclination: <I>According to the lot 
 shall the possession be divided.</I> As the God of nations, so the God 
 of Israel in particular, reserves it to himself to <I>appoint the 
 bounds of our habitation.</I> And thus Christ, our Joshua, when he was 
 urged to appoint one of his disciples <I>to his right hand,</I> another 
 <I>to his left</I> in his kingdom, acknowledged the sovereignty of his 
 Father in the disposal: <I>It is not mine to give.</I> Joshua must not 
 dispose of inheritances in Canaan according to his own mind.  <I>But it 
 shall be given to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.</I></P>

 Levi was God's tribe, a tribe that was to have no inheritance with the 
 rest in the land of Canaan, and therefore was not numbered with the 
 rest, but by itself; so it had been numbered in the beginning of this 
 book at Mount Sinai, and therefore came not under the sentence passed 
 upon all that were then numbered, that none of them should enter Canaan 
 but Caleb and Joshua; for of the Levites that were not numbered with 
 them, nor were to go forth to war, Eleazar and Ithamar, and perhaps 
 others who were above twenty years old then (as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:16,28"><I>ch.</I> iv. 16, 28</A>),

 entered Canaan; and yet this tribe, now at its second numbering, had
 increased but 1000, and was still one of the smallest tribes. Mention 
 is made here of the death of Nadab and Abihu for offering strange fire, 
 as before of the sin and punishment of Korah, because <I>these things 
 happened to them for ensamples.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>63 These <I>are</I> they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
 priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab
 by Jordan <I>near</I> Jericho.
 &nbsp; 64 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
 Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
 Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

 wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the
 son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

 That which is observable in this conclusion of the account is the 
 execution of the sentence passed upon the murmurers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:29"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 29</A>),

 that not one of those who <I>were numbered from twenty years old and
 upwards</I> (and that the Levites were not, but either from a month old 
 or from thirty years old to fifty) should enter Canaan, except Caleb 
 and Joshua. In the muster now made particular directions, no doubt, 
 were given to those of each tribe that were employed in taking the 
 account, to compare these rolls with the former, and to observe whether 
 there were any now left of those that were numbered at Mount Sinai, and 
 it appeared that there was not one man numbered now that was numbered 
 then except Caleb and Joshua,

 Herein appeared,

 1. The righteousness of God, and his faithfulness to his threatenings,
 when once the <I>decree has gone forth.</I> He <I>swore in his 
 wrath,</I> and what he had sworn he performed. Better all those 
 carcasses, had they been ten times as many, should fall to the ground, 
 than the word of God. Though the rising generation was mixed with the, 
 and many of the guilty and condemned criminals long survived the 
 sentence, even to the last year of the forty, yet they were cut off by 
 some means or other before this muster was made.  Those whom God has 
 condemned cannot escape either by losing themselves in a crowd or by 
 the delay of execution. 

 2. The goodness of God to this people, notwithstanding their 
 provocations. Though that murmuring race was cut off, yet God raised up 
 another generation, which was as numerous as they, that, though they 
 perished, yet the name of Israel might not be cut off, lest the 
 inheritance of the promise should be lost for want of heirs. And, 
 though the number fell a little short what it was at Mount Sinai, yet 
 those now numbered had this advantage, that they were all middle-aged 
 men, between twenty and sixty, in the prime of their time for service; 
 and during the thirty-eight years of their wandering and wasting in the 
 wilderness they had an opportunity of acquainting themselves with the 
 laws and ordinances of God, having no business, civil or military, to 
 divert them from those sacred studies, and having Moses and Aaron to 
 instruct them, and God's good Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20">Neh. ix. 20</A>.

 3.  The truth of God, in performing his promise made to Caleb and
 Joshua.  They were to be preserved from falling in this common ruin, 
 and they were so. The arrows of death, though they fly in the dark, do 
 not fly at random, even when they fly thickest, but are directed to the 
 mark intended, and no other. All that are written among the living 
 shall have their lives given them for a prey, in the most dangerous 
 times.  Thousands may fall on their right hand, and ten thousands on 
 their left, but they shall escape.</P>
