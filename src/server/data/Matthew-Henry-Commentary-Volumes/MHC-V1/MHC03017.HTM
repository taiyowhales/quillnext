 After the law concerning the atonement to be made for all Israel by the 
 high priest, at the tabernacle, with the blood of bulls and goats, in 
 this chapter we have two prohibitions necessary for the preservation of 
 the honour of that atonement. 

 I. That no sacrifice should be offered by any other than the priests,
 nor any where but at the door of the tabernacle, and this upon pain of 
 death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. That no blood should be eaten, and this under the same penalty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:10-16">ver. 10</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the
 children of Israel, and say unto them; This <I>is</I> the thing which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 What man soever <I>there be</I> of the house of Israel, that
 killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth
 <I>it</I> out of the camp,
 &nbsp; 4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, to offer an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before the
 tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he
 hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his
 people:
 &nbsp; 5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
 sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
 may bring them unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, unto the door of the tabernacle of
 the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them <I>for</I> peace
 offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
 after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for
 ever unto them throughout their generations.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man <I>there be</I> of
 the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
 that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,
 &nbsp; 9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation, to offer it unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; even that man shall be
 cut off from among his people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This statute obliged all the people of Israel to bring all their 
 sacrifices to God's altar, to be offered there. And as to this matter 
 we must consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How it stood before. 

 1. It was allowed to all people to build altars, and offer sacrifices
 to God, where they pleased. Wherever Abraham had a tent he built an 
 altar, and every master of a family was a priest to his own family, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">Job i. 5</A>.

 2. This liberty had been an occasion of idolatry. When every man was
 his own priest, and had an altar of his own, by degrees, as they became 
 vain in their imaginations, they invented gods of their own, <I>and 
 offered their sacrifices unto demons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The word signifies <I>rough</I> or <I>hairy goats,</I> because it is 
 probable that in the shape the evil spirits often appeared to them, to 
 invite their sacrifices and to signify their acceptance of them. For 
 the devil, ever since he became a revolter from God and a rebel against 
 him, has set up for a rival with him, and coveted to have divine 
 honours paid him: he had the impudence to solicit our blessed Saviour 
 to <I>fall down and worship him.</I> The Israelites themselves had 
 learned in Egypt to sacrifice to demons. And some of them, it should 
 seem, practised it even since the God of Israel had so gloriously 
 appeared for them, and with them. They are said to <I>go a whoring 
 after</I> these demons; for it was such a breach of their covenant with 
 God as adultery is of the marriage covenant: and they were as strongly 
 addicted to their idolatrous worships, and as hard to be reclaimed from 
 them, as those that have given themselves over to fornication, to 
 <I>work all uncleanness with greediness;</I> and therefore it is with 
 reference to this that God calls himself <I>a jealous God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How this law settled it. 

 1. Some think that the children of Israel were by this law forbidden,
 while they were in the wilderness, to kill any beef, or mutton, or 
 veal, or lamb, or goat, even for their common eating, but at the 
 <I>door of the tabernacle,</I> where the blood and the fat were to be 
 offered to God upon the altar, and the flesh to be returned back to the 
 offerer to be eaten as a peace-offering, according to the law. And the 
 statute is so worded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>)

 as to favour this opinion, for it speaks generally of killing any ox, 
 or lamb, or goat. The learned Dr.  Cudworth puts this sense upon it, 
 and thinks that while they had their tabernacle so near them in the 
 midst of their camp they ate no flesh but what had first been offered 
 to God, but that when they were entering Canaan this constitution was 
 altered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:21">Deut. xii. 21</A>), 

 and they were allowed to kill their beasts of the flock and herd at
 home, as well as the roebuck and the hart; only thrice a year they were 
 to see God at his tabernacle, and to eat and drink before him there. 
 And it is probable that in the wilderness they did not eat much flesh 
 but that of their peace-offerings, preserving what cattle they had, for 
 breed, against they came to Canaan; therefore they murmured for flesh, 
 being weary of manna; and Moses on that occasion speaks as if they were 
 very sparing of the <I>flocks and the herds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4,22">Num. xi. 4, 22</A>.

 Yet it is hard to construe this as a temporary law, when it is
 expressly said to be a <I>statute for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);
 
 and therefore,

 2. It should seem rather to forbid only the killing of beasts for
 sacrifice any where but at God's altar. They must not offer sacrifice, 
 as they had done, <I>in the open field</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 no, not to the true God, but it must be brought to the priest, to be 
 offered on the altar of the Lord: and the solemnity they had lately 
 witnessed, of consecrating both the priests and the altar, would serve 
 for a good reason why they should confine themselves to both these that 
 God had so signally appointed and owned. This law obliged not only the 
 Israelites themselves, but the proselytes or strangers that were 
 circumcised and sojourned among them, who were in danger of retaining 
 an affection to their old ways of worship. If any should transgress 
 this law, and offer sacrifice any where but at the tabernacle,

 (1.) The guilt was great: <I>Blood shall be imputed to that man; he
 hath shed blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Though it was but a beast he had killed, yet, killing it otherwise than 
 God had appointed, he was looked upon as a murderer. It is by the 
 divine grant that we have the liberty to kill the inferior creatures, 
 to the benefit of which we are not entitled, unless we submit to the 
 limitations of it, which are that it be not done either with cruelty or 
 with superstition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:3,4">Gen. ix. 3, 4</A>.

 Nor was there ever any greater abuse done to the inferior creatures
 than when they were made either false gods or sacrifices to false gods, 
 to which the apostle perhaps has special reference when he speaks of 
 the vanity and bondage of corruption to which the creature was made 
 subject,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20,21">Rom. viii. 20, 21</A>,

 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:23,25"><I>ch.</I> i. 23, 25</A>.

 Idolatrous sacrifices were looked upon, not only as adultery, but as
 murder: he that <I>offereth them is as if he slew a man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:3">Isa. lxvi. 3</A>.

 (2.) The punishment should be severe: <I>That man shall be cut off from
 among his people.</I> Either the magistrate must do it if it were 
 manifest and notorious, or, if not, God would take the work into his 
 own hands, and the offender should be cut off by some immediate stroke 
 of divine justice. The reasons why God thus strictly ordered all their 
 sacrifices to be offered at one place were,

 [1.] For the preventing of idolatry and superstition. That sacrifices
 might be offered to God, and according to the rule, and without 
 innovations, they must always be offered by the hands of the priests, 
 who were servants in God's house, and under the eye of the high priest, 
 who was ruler of the house, and took care to see every thing done 
 according to God's ordinance. 

 [2.] For the securing of the honour of God's temple and altar, the
 peculiar dignity of which would be endangered if they might offer their 
 sacrifices any where else as well as there. 

 [3.] For the preserving of unity and brotherly love among the
 Israelites, that meeting all at one altar, as all the children of the 
 family meet daily at one table, they might live and love as brethren, 
 and be as one man, of one mind in the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How this law was observed. 

 1. While the Israelites kept their integrity they had a tender and very
 jealous regard to this law, as appears by their zeal against the altar 
 which was erected by the two tribes and a half, which they would by no 
 means have left standing if they had not been satisfied that it was 
 never designed, nor should ever be used, for sacrifice or offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:12">Josh. xxii. 12</A>, &c.

 2. The breach of this law was for many ages the scandalous and
 incurable corruption of the Jewish church, witness that complaint which 
 so often occurs in the history even of the good kings, <I>Howbeit the 
 high places were not taken away;</I> and it was an inlet to the 
 grossest idolatries. 

 3. Yet this law was, in extraordinary cases, dispensed with. Gideon's
 sacrifice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:26">Judg. vi. 26</A>),

 Manoah's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19">Judg. xiii. 19</A>),

 Samuel's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:9,9:13,11:15">1 Sam. vii. 9; ix. 13; xi. 15</A>),

 David's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:18">2 Sam. xxiv. 18</A>),

 and Elijah's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:23">1 Kings xviii. 23</A>), 

 were accepted, though not offered at the usual place: but these were
 all either ordered by angels or offered by prophets; and some think 
 that after the desolation of Shiloh, and before the building of the 
 temple, while the ark and altar were unsettled, it was more allowable 
 to offer sacrifice elsewhere.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How the matter stands now, and what use we are to make of this law. 
 
 1. It is certain that the spiritual sacrifices we are now to offer are
 not confined to any one place. Our Saviour has made this clear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21">John iv. 21</A>),

 and the apostle
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8">1 Tim. ii. 8</A>),

 according to the prophecy, that <I>in every place incense should be
 offered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>.

 We have now no temple nor altar that sanctifies the gift, nor does the
 gospel unity lie in one place, but in one heart, and the <I>unity of 
 the spirit.</I>

 2. Christ is our altar, and the <I>true tabernacle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:2,13:10">Heb. viii. 2; xiii. 10</A>);

 in him God dwells among us, and it is in him that our sacrifices are
 acceptable to God, and in him only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 To set up other mediators, or other altars, or other expiatory
 sacrifices, is, in effect, to set up other gods. He is the centre of 
 unity, in whom all God's Israel meet.

 3. Yet we are to have respect to the public worship of God, not
 <I>forsaking the assemblies of</I> his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:25">Heb. x. 25</A>.

 The Lord loves <I>the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
 Jacob,</I> and so should we; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:40">Ezek. xx. 40</A>.

 Though God will graciously accept our family offerings, we must not
 therefore neglect the door of the tabernacle.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And whatsoever man <I>there be</I> of the house of Israel, or of
 the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
 blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
 blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
 &nbsp; 11 For the life of the flesh <I>is</I> in the blood: and I have
 given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your
 souls: for it <I>is</I> the blood <I>that</I> maketh an atonement for the
 soul.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
 shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among
 you eat blood.
 &nbsp; 13 And whatsoever man <I>there be</I> of the children of Israel, or
 of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
 catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour
 out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
 &nbsp; 14 For <I>it is</I> the life of all flesh; the blood of it <I>is</I> for
 the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel,
 Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
 flesh <I>is</I> the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
 off.
 &nbsp; 15 And every soul that eateth that which died <I>of itself,</I> or
 that which was torn <I>with beasts, whether it be</I> one of your own
 country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe
 <I>himself</I> in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he
 be clean.
 &nbsp; 16 But if he wash <I>them</I> not, nor bathe his flesh; then he
 shall bear his iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. A repetition and confirmation of the law against eating blood. We 
 have met with this prohibition twice before in the levitical law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:17,7:26"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17; vii. 26</A>),

 besides the place it had in the precepts of Noah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4">Gen. ix. 4</A>.

 But here,

 1. The prohibition is repeated again and again, and reference had to
 the former laws to this purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat 
 blood;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>You shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh.</I> A great stress is 
 laid upon it, as a law which has more in it than at first view one 
 would think.

 2. It is made binding, not only on the <I>house of Israel,</I> but on
 <I>the strangers that sojourned among them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 which perhaps was one reason why it was thought advisable, for a time, 
 to forbid blood to the Gentile converts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:29">Acts xv. 29</A>.

 3. The penalty annexed to this law is very severe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood,</I> if 
 he do it presumptuously, and <I>will cut him off;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>He shall be cut off.</I> Note, God's wrath will be the sinner's 
 ruin. Write that man undone, for ever undone, against whom God sets his 
 face; for what creature is able to confront the Creator?

 4. A reason is given for this law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 because <I>it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul;</I> and 
 <I>therefore</I> it was appointed to make atonement with, because 
 <I>the life of the flesh is the blood.</I> The sinner deserved to die; 
 therefore the sacrifice must die. Now, the blood being so the life that 
 ordinarily beasts were killed for man's use by the drawing out of all 
 their blood, God appointed the sprinkling or pouring out of the blood 
 of the sacrifice upon the altar to signify that the life of the 
 sacrifice was given to God instead of the sinner's life, and as a 
 ransom or counter-price for it; therefore <I>without shedding of blood 
 there was no remission,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.

 For this reason they must eat no blood, and,

 (1.) It was then a very good reason; for God would by this means
 preserve the honour of that way of atonement which he had instituted, 
 and keep up in the minds of the people a reverent regard to it. The 
 blood of the covenant being then a sensible object, no blood must be 
 either eaten or trodden under foot as a common thing, as they must have 
 no ointment nor perfume like that which God ordered them to make for 
 himself. But, 

 (2.) This reason is now superseded, which intimates that the law itself
 was ceremonial, and is now no longer in force: the blood of Christ who 
 has come (and we are to look for no other) is that alone which makes 
 atonement for the soul, and of which the blood of the sacrifices was an 
 imperfect type: the coming of the substance supersedes the shadow. The 
 blood of beasts is no longer the ransom, but Christ's blood only; and 
 therefore there is not now that reason for abstaining from blood which 
 there was then, and we cannot suppose it was the will of God that the 
 law should survive the reason of it. The blood, provided it be so 
 prepared as not to be unwholesome, is now allowed for the nourishment 
 of our bodies, because it is no longer appointed to make an atonement 
 for the soul. 

 (3.) Yet it has still useful significancy. The life is in the blood; it
 is the vehicle of the animal spirits, and God would have his people to 
 regard the life even of their beasts, and not to be cruel and 
 hard-hearted, not to take delight in any thing that is barbarous. They
 must not be a blood-thirsty people. The blood then made atonement 
 figuratively, now the blood of Christ makes atonement really and 
 effectually; to this therefore we must have a reverent regard, and not 
 use it as <I>a common thing,</I> for he will set his face against those 
 that do so, and they shall be cut off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb. x. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some other precepts are here given as appendages to this law, and 
 hedges about it, 

 1. They must cover the blood of that which they <I>took in hunting,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They must not only not eat it, but must give it a decent burial, in 
 token of some mystery which they must believe lay hidden in this
 constitution. The Jews look upon this as a very weighty precept and
 appoint that the blood should be covered with these words, <I>Blessed
 be he that hath sanctified us by his precepts, and commanded us to 
 cover blood.</I>

 2. They must not eat that which <I>died of itself</I> or was <I>torn of
 beasts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 for the blood was either not at all, or not regularly, drawn out of 
 them. God would have them to be curious in their diet, not with the 
 curiosity that gratifies the sensual appetite, but with that which 
 checks and restrains it. God would not have his children to eat every 
 thing that came in their way with greediness, but to consider 
 diligently what was before them, that they might learn in other things 
 to ask questions for conscience' sake. Those that <I>flew upon the 
 spoiled</I> sinned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:32,33">1 Sam. xiv. 32, 33</A>.

 If a man did, through ignorance or inconsideration, eat the flesh of
 any beast not duly slain, he must <I>wash himself and his clothes,</I> 
 else he <I>bore his iniquity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 The pollution was ceremonial, so was the purification from it; but if a 
 man slighted the prescribed method of cleansing, or would not submit, 
 he thereby contracted moral guilt. See the nature of a remedial law: he 
 that obeys it has the benefit of it; he that does not, not only remains 
 under his former guilt, but adds to that guilt of contemning the 
 provisions made by divine grace for his relief, and sins against the 
 remedy.</P>
