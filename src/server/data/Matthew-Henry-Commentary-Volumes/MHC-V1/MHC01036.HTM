 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have an account of the posterity of Esau, who, 
 from him, were called Edomites, that Esau who sold his birthright, 
 and lost his blessing, and was not loved of God as Jacob 
 was. Here is a brief register kept of his family for some generations. 
 
 1. Because he was the son of Isaac, for whose sake this 
 honour is put upon him. 
 
 2. Because the Edomites were neighbours 
 to Israel, and their genealogy would be of use to give light 
 to the following stories of what passed between them. 
 
 3. It is to 
 show the performance of the promise to Abraham, that he should 
 be "the father of many nations," and of that answer which 
 Rebekah had from the oracle she consulted, "Two nations are 
 in thy womb," and of the blessing of Isaac, "Thy dwelling 
 shall be the fatness of the earth." We have here, 
 
 I. Esau's wives,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. His remove to mount Seir,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.
 
 III. The names of his sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.
 
 IV. The dukes who descended 
 of his sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.
 
 V. The dukes of the Horites,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:20-30">ver. 20-30</A>.
 
 VI. The kings and dukes of Edom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:31-43">ver. 31-43</A>.
 Little more is
 recorded than their names, because the history of those that
 were out of the church (though perhaps it might have been serviceable
 in politics) would have been of little use in divinity. It
 is in the church that the memorable instances are found of
 special grace, and special providence; for that is the enclosure,
 the rest is common. This chapter is abridged,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now these <I>are</I> the generations of 
 Esau, who <I>is</I> Edom.
 &nbsp; 2 Esau 
 took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; 
 Adah the daughter of Elon the 
 Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter 
 of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the 
 Hivite;
 &nbsp; 3 And Bashemath Ishmael's 
 daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and 
 Bashemath bare Reuel;
 &nbsp; 5 And Aholibamah 
 bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and 
 Korah: these <I>are</I> the sons of Esau, 
 which were born unto him in the land 
 of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 6 And Esau took his 
 wives, and his sons, and his daughters, 
 and all the persons of his house, and 
 his cattle, and all his beasts, and all 
 his substance, which he had got in the 
 land of Canaan; and went into the 
 country from the face of his brother 
 Jacob.
 &nbsp; 7 For their riches were more 
 than that they might dwell together; 
 and the land wherein they were 
 strangers could not bear them because 
 of their cattle.
 &nbsp; 8 Thus dwelt Esau 
 in mount Seir: Esau <I>is</I> Edom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 1. Concerning Esau himself,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 He is called <I>Edom</I> (and again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 that name by which was perpetuated 
 the remembrance of the foolish bargain he 
 made, when he sold his birthright for <I>that red, 
 that red pottage.</I> The very mention of that 
 name is enough to intimate the reason why 
 his family is turned off with such a short 
 account. Note, If men do a wrong thing 
 they must thank themselves, when it is, long 
 afterwards, remembered against them to their 
 reproach. 
 
 2. Concerning his wives, and the 
 children they bore him in the land of Canaan. 
 He had three wives, and, by them all, but five 
 sons: many a one has more by one wife. 
 God in his providence often disappoints those 
 who take indirect courses to build up a family; 
 yet here the promise prevailed, and 
 Esau's family was built up. 
 
 3. Concerning 
 his removal to mount Seir, which was the 
 country God had given him for a possession, 
 when he reserved Canaan for the seed of Jacob. 
 God owns it, long afterwards: <I>I gave 
 to Esau mount Seir</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:5,Jos+24:4">Deut. ii. 5; Josh. xxiv. 4</A>),
 which was the reason why the Edomites must
 not be disturbed in their possession. Those
 that have not a right by promise, such as
 Jacob had, to Canaan, may have a very good
 title by providence to their estates, such as
 Esau had to mount Seir. Esau had begun
 to settle among his wives' relations, in Seir,
 before Jacob came from Padan-aram,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:3"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 3</A>.
 Isaac, it is likely, had sent him 
 thither (as Abraham in his life-time had sent 
 the sons of the concubines from Isaac his son 
 into the east country,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:6"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 6</A>),
 that Jacob 
 might have the clearer way made for him to 
 the possession of the promised land. During 
 the life of Isaac, however, Esau had probably 
 still some effects remaining in Canaan; but, 
 after his death, he wholly withdrew to mount 
 Seir, took with him what came to his share 
 of his father's personal estate, and left Canaan 
 to Jacob, not only because he had the promise 
 of it, but because Esau perceived that if they 
 should continue to thrive as they had begun 
 there would not be room for both. <I>Thus 
 dwelt Esau in Mount Seir,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Note, Whatever 
 opposition may be made, God's word
 will be accomplished, and even those that
 have opposed it will see themselves, some
 time or other, under a necessity of yielding
 to it, and acquiescing in it. Esau had
 struggled for Canaan, but now he tamely 
 retires to mount Seir; for God's counsels shall 

 <A NAME="Page210"> </A>
 
 certainly stand, concerning the times before 
 appointed, and the bounds of our habitation.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here,

 1. That only the names of
 Esau's sons and grandsons are recorded,
 only their names, not their history; for it is
 the church that Moses preserves the records
 of, not the record of those that are without.
 Those elders that lived by faith alone obtained
 a good report. It is Sion that produces the
 men of renown, not Seir,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:5">Ps. lxxxvii. 5</A>.
 Nor does the genealogy go any further than 
 the third and fourth generation; the very 
 names of all after are buried in oblivion. It 
 is only the pedigree of the Israelites, who 
 were to be the heirs of Canaan, and of whom 
 were to come the promised seed, and the 
 holy seed, that is drawn out to any length, 
 as far as there was occasion for it, even of 
 all the tribes till Canaan was divided among 
 them, and of the royal line till Christ came. 
 
 2. That these sons and grandsons of Esau 
 are called <I>dukes,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:15-19"><I>v.</I> 15-19</A>.
 Probably they 
 were military commanders, dukes, or captains, 
 that had soldiers under them; for Esau 
 and his family lived <I>by the sword,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:40"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 40</A>.
 Note, Titles of honour have been more 
 ancient out of the church than in it. Esau's 
 sons were dukes when Jacob's sons were but 
 plain shepherds,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:3"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 3</A>.
 This is not a 
 reason why such titles should not be used 
 among Christians; but it is a reason why 
 men should not overvalue themselves, or 
 others, for the sake of them. There is an 
 honour that comes from God, and a name in 
 his house that is infinitely more valuable. 
 Edomites may be dukes with men, but 
 Israelites indeed are made to our God 
 kings and priests. 
 
 3. We may suppose those 
 dukes had numerous families of children and 
 servants that were their dukedoms. God 
 promised to multiply Jacob, and to enrich 
 him; yet Esau increases, and is enriched 
 first. Note, It is no new thing for the men 
 of this world to be full of children, and to 
 have their bellies too <I>filled with hidden treasures,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.
 God's promise to Jacob
 began to work late, but the effect of it remained 
 longer, and it had its complete accomplishment 
 in the spiritual Israel.</P>

 <A NAME="Page211"> </A>

 Hori, among their dukes in the land 
 of Seir.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the midst of this genealogy of the Edomites 
 here is inserted the genealogy of the 
 Horites, those Canaanites, or Hittites (compare
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:34"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 34</A>),
 that were the natives of 
 Mount Seir. Mention is made of them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:6"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 6</A>,
 and of their interest in Mount Seir, 
 before the Edomites took possession of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:12,22">Deut. ii. 12, 22</A>.
 This comes in here, not 
 only to give light to the story, but to be a 
 standing reflection upon the Edomites for 
 intermarrying with them, by which, it is 
 probable, they learned their way, and corrupted 
 themselves. Esau having sold his 
 birthright, and lost his blessing, and entered 
 into alliance with the Hittites, his posterity 
 and the sons of Seir are here reckoned 
 together. Note, Those that treacherously 
 desert God's church are justly numbered 
 with those that were never in it; apostate 
 Edomites stand on the same ground with 
 accursed Horites. Particular notice is taken 
 of one Anah who fed the asses of Zibeon his 
 father
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 and yet is called <I>duke Anah,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 Note, Those that expect to rise high 
 should begin low. An honourable descent 
 should not keep men from an honest employment, 
 nor a mean employment hinder any 
 man's preferment. This Anah was not only 
 industrious in his business, but ingenious 
 too, and successful; for he found <I>mules,</I> or 
 (as some read it) <I>waters, hot-baths,</I> in the 
 wilderness. Those that are diligent in their 
 business sometimes find more advantages 
 than they expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By degrees, it seems, the Edomites wormed 
 out the Horites, obtained full possession of 
 the country, and had a government of their 
 own. 
 
 1. They were ruled by kings, who 
 governed the whole country, and seem to 
 have come to the throne by election, and not
 by lineal descent; so bishop Patrick observes. 
 These kings reigned in <I>Edom before there 
 reigned any king over the children of Israel,</I> 
 that is, before Moses's time, for <I>he was king 
 in Jeshurun,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:5">Deut. xxxiii. 5</A>.
 God had lately promised
 <I>Jacob that kings should come out of his loins</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:11"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 11</A>),
 yet Esau's blood becomes 
 royal long before any of Jacob's did. Note, 
 In external prosperity and honour, the children 
 of the covenant are often cast behind, 
 and those that are out of covenant get the 
 start. The triumphing of the wicked may 
 be quick, but it is short; soon ripe, and as 
 soon rotten: but the products of the promise, 
 though they are slow, are sure and lasting; 
 <I>at the end it shall speak, and not lie.</I> We may 
 suppose it was a great trial to the faith of God's 
 Israel to hear of the pomp and power of the 
 kings of Edom, while they were bond-slaves in 
 Egypt; but those that look for great things 
 from God must be content to wait for them; 
 God's time is the best time. 
 
 2. They were 
 afterwards governed by dukes, again here 
 named, who, I suppose, ruled all at the same 
 time in several places in the country. Either 
 they set up this form of government in conformity 
 to the Horites, who had used it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>), 
 or God's providence reduced them to it, 
 as some conjecture, to correct them for their 
 unkindness to Israel, in refusing them a 
 passage though their country, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:18">Num. xx. 18</A>.
 Note, When power is abused, it is just with 
 God to weaken it, by turning it into divers 
 channels. <I>For the transgression of a land, 
 many are the princes thereof.</I> Sin brought 
 Edom from kings to dukes, from crowns to 
 coronets. We read of the dukes of Edom
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:15">Exod. xv: 15</A>),
 yet, long afterwards, of their 
 kings again. 
 
 3. Mount Seir is called <I>the land 
 of their possession,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.
 While the Israelites 
 dwelt in the house of bondage, and their 
 Canaan was only the land of promise, the 
 Edomites dwelt in their own habitations, and 
 Seir was in their possession. Note, The 
 children of this world have their all in hand, 
 and nothing in hope
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>);
 while 

 <A NAME="Page212"> </A>

 the children of God have their all in hope, 
 and next to nothing in hand. But, all things 
 considered, it is better to have Canaan in 
 promise than mount Seir in possession.</P>
