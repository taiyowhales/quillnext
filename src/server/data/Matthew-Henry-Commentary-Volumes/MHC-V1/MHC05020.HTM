 This chapter settles the militia, and establishes the laws and
 ordinances of war, 
 
 I. Relating to the soldiers.

 1. Those must be encouraged that were drawn up to battle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. Those must be dismissed and sent back again whose private affairs
 called for their attendance at home 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>),

 or whose weakness and timidity unfitted them for service in the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 II. Relating to the enemies they made war with. 

 1. The treaties they must make with the cities that were far off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 2.  The destruction they must make of the people into whose land they
 were going,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 3. The care they must take, in besieging cities, not to destroy the
 fruit-trees,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and
 seest horses, and chariots, <I>and</I> a people more than thou, be not
 afraid of them: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God <I>is</I> with thee, which
 brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
 the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
 &nbsp; 3 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
 unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear
 not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
 &nbsp; 4 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God <I>is</I> he that goeth with you, to fight
 for you against your enemies, to save you.
 &nbsp; 5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What
 man <I>is there</I> that hath built a new house, and hath not
 dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in
 the battle, and another man dedicate it.
 &nbsp; 6 And what man <I>is he</I> that hath planted a vineyard, and hath
 not <I>yet</I> eaten of it? let him <I>also</I> go and return unto his
 house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
 &nbsp; 7 And what man <I>is there</I> that hath betrothed a wife, and hath
 not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
 in the battle, and another man take her.
 &nbsp; 8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and
 they shall say, What man <I>is there that is</I> fearful and
 fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his
 brethren's heart faint as well as his heart.
 &nbsp; 9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
 speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the
 armies to lead the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Israel was at this time to be considered rather as a camp than as a 
 kingdom, entering upon an enemy's country, and not yet settled in a 
 country of their own; and, besides the war they were now entering upon 
 in order to their settlement, even after their settlement they could 
 neither protect nor enlarge their coast without hearing the alarms of 
 war. It was therefore needful that they should have directions given 
 them in their military affairs; and in these verses they are directed 
 in managing, marshalling, and drawing up their own forces. And it is 
 observable that the discipline of war here prescribed is so far from 
 having any thing in it harsh or severe, as is usual in martial law, 
 that the intent of the whole is, on the contrary, to encourage the 
 soldiers, and to make their service easy to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Those that were disposed to fight must be encouraged and animated 
 against their fears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Moses here gives a general encouragement, which the leaders and 
 commanders in the war must take to themselves: "<I>Be not afraid of 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though the enemy have ever so much the advantage by their numbers
 (being more than thou), and by their cavalry (their armies being much 
 made up of horses and chariots, which thou art not allowed to 
 multiply), yet decline not coming to a battle with them, dread not the 
 issue, nor doubt of success." Two things they must encourage themselves 
 with in their wars, provided they kept close to their God and their 
 religion, otherwise they forfeited these encouragements:--

 (1.) The presence of God with them: "<I>The Lord thy God is with
 thee,</I> and therefore thou art not in danger, nor needest thou be 
 afraid." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:10">Isa. xli. 10</A>.

 (2.) The experience they and their fathers had had of God's power and
 goodness in <I>bringing them out of the land of Egypt,</I> in defiance 
 of Pharaoh and all his hosts, which was not only in general a proof of 
 the divine omnipotence, but to them in particular a pledge of what God 
 would do further for them. He that saved them from those greater 
 enemies would not suffer them to be run down by those that were every 
 way less considerable, and thus to have all he had done for them undone 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This encouragement must be particularly addressed to the common 
 soldiers by a priest appointed, and, the Jews say, anointed, for that 
 purpose, whom they call <I>the anointed of the war,</I> a very proper 
 title for our anointed Redeemer, the captain of our salvation: This 
 priest, in God's name, was to animate the people; and who so fit to do 
 that as he whose office it was as priest to pray for them? For the best 
 encouragements arise from the precious promises made to the prayer of 
 faith. This priest must, 
 
 (1.) Charge them not to be afraid
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 for nothing weakens the hands so much as that which makes the heart
 tremble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There is need of precept upon precept to this purport, as there is
 here: <I>Let not your hearts be tender</I> (so the word is), to receive 
 all the impressions of fear, but let a believing confidence in the 
 power and promise of God harden them. <I>Fear not, and do not make 
 haste</I> (so the word is), for he that believeth doth not make more 
 haste than good speed. "Do not make haste either rashly to anticipate 
 your advantages or basely to fly off upon every disadvantage."

 (2.) He must assure them of the presence of God with them, to own and
 plead their righteous cause, and not only to save them from their 
 enemies, but to give them victory over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, Those have no reason to fear that have God with them. The giving
 of this encouragement by a priest, one of the Lord's ministers, 
 intimates,

 [1.] That it is very fit that armies should have chaplains, not only to
 pray for them, but to preach to them, both to reprove that which would 
 hinder their success and to raise their hopes of it. 

 [2.] That it is the work of Christ's ministers to encourage his good
 soldiers in their spiritual conflict with the world and the flesh, and 
 to assure them of a conquest, yea, more than a conquest, through Christ 
 that loved us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those that were indisposed to fight must be discharged, whether the 
 indisposition did arise,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the circumstances of a man's outward condition; as, 

 (1.) If he had lately built or purchased a new house, and had not taken
 possession of it, had not dedicated it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, made a solemn festival for the entertainment of his friends,
 that came to him to welcome him to his house; let him go home and take 
 the comfort of that which God had blessed him with, till, by enjoying 
 it for some time, he become less fond of it, and consequently less 
 disturbed in the war by the thoughts of it, and more willing to lie and 
 leave it. For this is the nature of all our worldly enjoyments, that 
 they please us best at first; after a while we see the vanity of them. 
 Some think that this dedication of their houses was a religious act, 
 and that they took possession of them with prayers and praises, with a 
 solemn devoting of themselves and all their enjoyments to the service 
 and honour of God. David penned the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:1-12">30th Psalm</A>

 on such an occasion, as appears by the title. Note, He that has a house
 of his own should dedicate it to God by setting up and keeping up the 
 fear and worship of God in it, that he may have a church in his house; 
 and nothing should be suffered to divert a man from this.  Or,

 (2.) If a man had been at a great expense to <I>plant a vineyard,</I>
 and longed to <I>eat of the fruit</I> of it, which for the first three 
 years he was forbidden to do by the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:23-25">Lev. xix. 23</A>,

 &c.), let him go home, if he has a mind, and gratify his own humour
 with the fruits of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 See how indulgent God is to his people in innocent things, and how far
 from being a hard Master. Since we naturally covet to eat the labour of 
 our hands, rather than an Israelite should be crossed therein, his 
 service in war shall be dispensed with., Or,

 (3.) If a man had made up his mind to be married, and the marriage were
 not solemnized, he was at liberty to return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 as also to tarry at home for one year after marriage
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:5"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 5</A>),
 
 for the terrors of war would be disagreeable to a man who had just
 welcomed the soft scene of domestic attachment. And God would not be 
 served in his wars by pressed men, that were forced into the army 
 against their will, but they must all be perfectly volunteers. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>,

 <I>Thy people shall be willing.</I> In running the Christian race, and
 fighting the good fight of faith, we must <I>lay aside every 
 weight,</I> and all that which would clog and divert our minds and make 
 us unwilling. The Jewish writers agree that this liberty to return was 
 allowed only in those wars which they made voluntarily (as bishop 
 Patrick expresses it), not those which were made by the divine command 
 against Amalek and the Canaanites, in which every man was bound to 
 fight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. If a man's indisposition to fight arose from the weakness and 
 timidity of his own spirit, he had leave to return from the war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 This proclamation Gideon made to his army, and it detached above
 two-thirds of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:3">Judg. vii. 3</A>.

 Some make the fearfulness and faintheartedness here supposed to arise
 from the terrors of an evil conscience, which would make a man afraid 
 to look death and danger in the face. It was then thought that men of 
 loose and profligate lives would not be good soldiers, but must needs 
 be both cowards in an army and curses to it, the shame and trouble of 
 the camp; and therefore those who were conscious to themselves of 
 notorious guilt were shaken off. But it seems rather to be meant of a 
 natural fearfulness. It was partly in kindness to them that they had 
 their discharge (for, though shamed, they were eased); but much more in 
 kindness to the rest of the army, who were hereby freed from the 
 incumbrance of such as were useless and unserviceable, while the danger 
 of infection from their cowardice and flight was prevented. This is the 
 reason here given: <I>Lest his brethren's heart fail as well as his 
 heart.</I> Fear is catching, and in an army is of most pernicious 
 consequence. We must take heed that we <I>fear not the fear of those 
 that are afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12">Isa. viii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is here ordered that, when all the cowards were dismissed, then 
 captains should be nominated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for it was in a special manner necessary that the leaders and
 commanders should be men of courage.  That reform therefore must be 
 made when the army was first mustered and marshalled. The soldiers of 
 Christ have need of courage, that they may quit themselves like men, 
 and endure hardness like good soldiers, especially the officers of his 
 army.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
 proclaim peace unto it.
 &nbsp; 11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
 unto thee, then it shall be, <I>that</I> all the people <I>that is</I>
 found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall
 serve thee.
 &nbsp; 12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
 against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
 &nbsp; 13 And when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath delivered it into thine
 hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
 sword:
 &nbsp; 14 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
 that is in the city, <I>even</I> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
 take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies,
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath given thee.
 &nbsp; 15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities <I>which are</I> very far
 off from thee, which <I>are</I> not of the cities of these nations.
 &nbsp; 16 But of the cities of these people, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 doth give thee <I>for</I> an inheritance, thou shalt save alive
 nothing that breatheth:
 &nbsp; 17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; <I>namely,</I> the Hittites,
 and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the
 Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath commanded
 thee:
 &nbsp; 18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
 which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
 against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof
 by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and
 thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field <I>is</I>
 man's <I>life</I>) to employ <I>them</I> in the siege:
 &nbsp; 20 Only the trees which thou knowest that they <I>be</I> not trees
 for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
 build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until
 it be subdued.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They are here directed what method to take in dealing with the cities 
 (these only are mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 but doubtless the armies in the field, and the nations they had
 occasion to deal with, are likewise intended) upon which they made war. 
 They must not make a descent upon any of their neighbours till they had 
 first given them fair notice, by a public manifesto, or remonstrance, 
 stating the ground of their quarrel with them. In dealing with the 
 worst of enemies, the laws of justice and honour must be observed; and, 
 as the sword must never be taken in hand without cause, so not without 
 cause shown. War is an appeal, in which the merits of the cause must be 
 set forth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Even to the proclamation of war must be subjoined a tender of peace, 
 if they would accept of it upon reasonable terms. That is (say the 
 Jewish writers), "upon condition that they renounce idolatry, worship 
 the God of Israel, as proselytes of the gate that were not circumcised, 
 pay to their new masters a yearly tribute, and submit to their 
 government:" on these terms the process of war should be stayed, and 
 their conquerors, upon this submission, were to be their protectors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Some think that even the seven nations of Canaan were to have this
 offer of peace made to them; and the offer was no jest or mockery, 
 though <I>it was of the Lord to harden their hearts</I> that they 
 should not accept it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:20">Josh. xi. 20</A>.
 
 Others think that they are excluded
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 not only from the benefit of that law
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 which confines military execution to the males only, but from the
 benefit of this also, which allows not to make war till peace was 
 refused. And I see not how they could proclaim peace to those who by 
 the law were to be utterly rooted out, and to whom they were to show no 
 mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2</A>.

 But for any other nation which they made war upon, for the enlarging of
 their coast, the avenging of any wrong done, or the recovery of any 
 right denied, they must first proclaim peace to the.  Let this show, 

 1.  God's grace in dealing with sinners: though he might most justly
 and easily destroy them, yet, having no pleasure in their ruin, he 
 proclaims peace, and beseeches them to be reconciled; so that those who 
 lie most obnoxious to his justice, and ready to fall as sacrifices to 
 it, if they make him an answer of peace, and open to him, upon 
 condition that they will be tributaries and servants to him, shall not 
 only be saved from ruin, but incorporated with his Israel, as 
 fellow-citizens with the saints. 

 2. Let it show us our duty in dealing with our brethren: if any quarrel
 happen, let us not only be ready to hearken to the proposals of peace, 
 but forward to make such proposals.  We should never make use of the 
 law till we have first tried to accommodate matters in variance 
 amicably, and without expense and vexation. <I>We</I> must be for 
 peace, whoever are for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. If the offers of peace were not accepted, then they must proceed to 
 push on the war. And let those to whom God offers peace know that if 
 they reject the offer, and take not the benefit of it within the time 
 limited, judgment will rejoice against mercy in the execution as much 
 as now mercy rejoices against judgment in the reprieve. In this case, 
 
 1. There is a promise implied that they should be victorious. It is
 taken for granted that <I>the Lord their God would deliver it into 
 their hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:13"><I>v.</I>  13</A>.

 Note, Those enterprises which we undertake by a divine warrant, and
 prosecute by divine direction, we may expect to succeed in. If we take 
 God's method, we shall have his blessing.

 2.  They are ordered, in honour to the public justice, to put all the
 soldiers to the sword, for them I understand by <I>every male</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 all that bore arms (as all then did that were able); but the spoil they
 are allowed to take to themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 in which were reckoned the women and children. Note, A justifiable
 property is acquired in that which is won in lawful war. God himself 
 owns the title: <I>The Lord thy God gives it thee;</I> and therefore he 
 must be owned in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The nations of Canaan are excepted from the merciful provisions 
 made by this law. Remnants might be left of the cities that were very 
 far off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 because by them they were not in so much danger of being infected with
 idolatry, nor was their country so directly and immediately intended in 
 the promise; but of the cities which were given to Israel for an 
 inheritance no remnants must be left of their inhabitants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 for it put a slight upon the promise to admit Canaanites to share with
 them in the peculiar land of promise; and for another reason they must 
 be utterly destroyed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 because, since it could not be expected that they should be cured of
 their idolatry, if they were left with that plague-sore upon them they 
 would be in danger of infecting God's Israel, who were too apt to take 
 the infection: <I>They will teach you to do after their 
 abominations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 to introduce their customs into the worship of the God of Israel, and
 by degrees to forsake him and to worship false gods; for those that 
 dare violate the second commandment will not long keep to the first. 
 Strange worships open the door to strange deities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Care is here taken that in the besieging of cities there should not 
 be any destruction made of fruit-trees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:19-20"><I>v.</I> 19-20</A>.

 In those times, when besiegers forced their way, not as now with bombs
 and cannon-ball, but with battering rams, they had occasion for much 
 timber in carrying on their sieges: now because, in the heat of war, 
 men are not apt to consider, as they ought, the public good, it is 
 expressly provided that fruit-trees should not be used as timber-trees. 
 That reason, <I>for the tree of the field is man's</I> (the word 
 <I>life</I> we supply), all the ancient versions, the Septuagint, 
 Targums, &c., read, <I>For is the tree of the field a man?</I> Or 
 <I>the tree of the field is not a man, that it should come against thee 
 in the siege,</I> or <I>retire from thee into the bulwark.</I> "Do not 
 brutishly vent thy rage against the trees that can do thee no harm." 
 But our translation seems most agreeable to the intent of the law, and 
 it teaches us,

 1. That God is a better friend to man than man is to himself; and God's
 law, which we are apt to complain of as a heavy yoke, consults our 
 interest and comfort, while our own appetites and passions, of which we 
 are so indulgent, are really enemies to our welfare. The intent of many 
 of the divine precepts is to restrain us from destroying that which is 
 our life and food. 

 2. That armies and their commanders are not allowed to make what
 desolation they please in the countries that are the seat of war. 
 Military rage must always be checked and ruled with reason.  War, 
 though carried on with ever so much caution, is destructive enough, and 
 should not be made more so than is absolutely necessary.  Generous 
 spirits will show themselves tender, not only of men's lives, but of 
 their livelihoods; for, though <I>the life is more than meat,</I> yet 
 it will soon be nothing without meat. 

 3. The Jews understand this as a prohibition of all wilful waste upon
 any account whatsoever. No fruit-tree is to be destroyed unless it be 
 barren, and cumber the ground. "Nay," they maintain, "whoso wilfully 
 breaks vessels, tears clothes, stops wells, pulls down buildings, or 
 destroys meat, transgresses this law: <I>Thou shalt not destroy.</I>" 
 Christ took care that the broken meat should be gathered up, that 
 nothing might be lost.  Every creature of God is good, and, as nothing 
 is to be refused, so nothing is to be abused. We may live to want what 
 we carelessly waste.</P>
