 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
 congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness
 of Sin, which <I>is</I> between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day
 of the second month after their departing out of the land of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
 against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
 &nbsp; 3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we
 had died by the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the land of Egypt, when we
 sat by the flesh pots, <I>and</I> when we did eat bread to the full;
 for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
 whole assembly with hunger.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
 heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain
 rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in
 my law, or no.
 &nbsp; 5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
 prepare <I>that</I> which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much
 as they gather daily.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
 even, then ye shall know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath brought you out from
 the land of Egypt:
 &nbsp; 7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 for that he heareth your murmurings against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and what
 <I>are</I> we, that ye murmur against us?
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses said, <I>This shall be,</I> when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall give you
 in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
 full; for that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heareth your murmurings which ye murmur
 against him: and what <I>are</I> we? your murmurings <I>are</I> not against
 us, but against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
 the children of Israel, Come near before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for he hath
 heard your murmurings.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
 congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward
 the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared in
 the cloud.
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
 unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning
 ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The host of Israel, it seems, took along with them out of Egypt, when 
 they came thence on the fifteenth day of the first month, a month's 
 provisions, which, by the fifteenth day of the second month, was all 
 spent; and here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their discontent and murmuring upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 The whole congregation, the greatest part of them, joined in this 
 mutiny; it was not immediately against God that they murmured, but 
 (which was equivalent) against Moses and Aaron, God's vicegerents among 
 them. 

 1.  They count upon being killed in the wilderness--nothing less, at 
 the first appearance of disaster. If the Lord had been pleased to kill 
 them, he could easily have done that in the Red Sea; but then he 
 preserved them, and now could as easily provide for them. It argues 
 great distrust of God, and of his power and goodness, in every distress 
 and appearance of danger to despair of life, and to talk of nothing but 
 being speedily killed. 

 2. They invidiously charge Moses with a design to starve them when he 
 brought them out of Egypt; whereas what he had done was both by order 
 from God and with a design to promote their welfare. Note, It is no new 
 thing for the greatest kindnesses to be misinterpreted and basely 
 represented as the greatest injuries. The worst colours are sometimes 
 put upon the best actions. Nay, 

 3. They so far undervalue their deliverance that they wish they had 
 died in Egypt, nay, and died by the hand of the Lord too, that is, by 
 some of the plagues which cut off the Egyptians, as if it were not the 
 hand of the Lord, but of Moses only, that brought them into this hungry 
 wilderness.  It is common for people to say of that pain, or sickness, 
 or sore, of which they see not the second causes, "It is what pleases 
 God," as if that were not so likewise which comes by the hand of man, 
 or some visible accident.  Prodigious madness! They would rather die by 
 the fleshpots of Egypt, where they found themselves with provision, 
 than live under the guidance of the heavenly pillar in a wilderness and 
 be provided for by the hand of God! they pronounce it better to have 
 fallen in the destruction of God's enemies than to bear the fatherly 
 discipline of his children! We cannot suppose that they had any great 
 plenty in Egypt, how largely soever they now talk of the flesh-pots; 
 nor could they fear dying for want in the wilderness, while they had 
 their flocks and herds with them. But discontent magnifies what is 
 past, and vilifies what is present, without regard to truth or reason.  
 None talk more absurdly than murmurers. Their impatience, ingratitude, 
 and distrust of God, were so much the worse in that they had lately 
 received such miraculous favours, and convincing proofs both that God 
 could help them in the greatest exigencies and that really he had mercy 
 in store for them. See how <I>soon they forgot his works, and provoked 
 him at the sea, even at the Red Sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:7-13">Ps. cvi. 7-13</A>.

 Note, Experiences of God's mercies greatly aggravate our distrusts and
 murmurings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The care God graciously took for their supply. Justly he might have 
 said, "I will rain fire and brimstone upon these murmurers, and consume 
 them;" but, quite contrary, he promises to rain bread upon them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God makes known to Moses his kind intentions, that he might not 
 be uneasy at their murmurings, nor be tempted to wish he had let them 
 alone in Egypt. 

 (1.) He takes notice of the people's complaints: <I>I have heard the
 murmurings of the children of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 As a God of pity, he took cognizance of their necessity, which was the 
 occasion of their murmuring; as a just and holy God, he took cognizance 
 of their base and unworthy reflections upon his servant Moses, and was 
 much displeased with them. Note, When we begin to fret and be uneasy, 
 we ought to consider that God hears all our murmurings, though silent, 
 and only the murmurings of the heart. Princes, parents, masters, do not 
 hear all the murmurs of their inferiors against them, and it is well 
 they do not, for perhaps they could not bear it; but God hears, and yet 
 bears. We must not think, because God does not immediately take 
 vengeance on men for their sins, that therefore he does not take notice 
 of them; no, he hears the murmurings of Israel, and is grieved with 
 this generation, and yet continues his care of them, as the tender 
 parent of the froward child. 

 (2.) He promises them a speedy, sufficient, and constant supply,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Man being made out of the earth, his Maker has wisely ordered him food 
 out of the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:14">Ps. civ. 14</A>.

 But the people of Israel, typifying the church of the first-born that
 are written in heaven, and born from above, and being themselves 
 immediately under the direction and government of heaven, receiving 
 their charters, laws, and commissions, from heaven, from heaven also 
 received their food: their law being given by the disposition of 
 angels, they did also eat angels' food. See what God designed in making 
 this provision for them: <I>That I may prove them, whether they will 
 walk in my law or no.</I> 

 [1.] Thus he tried whether they would trust him, and walk in the law of
 faith or no, whether they could live from hand to mouth, and (though 
 now uneasy because their provisions were spent) could rest satisfied 
 with the bread of the day in its day, and depend upon God for fresh 
 supplies to-morrow. 

 [2.] Thus he tried whether they would serve him, and be always faithful
 to so good a Master, that provided so well for his servants; and hereby 
 he made it appear to all the world, in the issue, what an ungrateful 
 people they were, whom nothing could affect with a sense of obligation. 
 Let <I>favour be shown</I> to them, yet <I>will they not learn 
 righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10">Isa. xxvi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How Moses made known these intentions to Israel, as God ordered him. 
 Here Aaron was his prophet, as he had been to Pharaoh. Moses directed 
 Aaron what to <I>speak to the congregation of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 and some think that, while Aaron was giving a public summons to the 
 congregation to <I>come near before the Lord,</I> Moses retired to 
 pray, and that the appearance of the glory of the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 was in answer to his prayer. They are called to come near, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>,

 <I>Come, and let us reason together.</I> Note, God condescends to give
 even murmurers a fair hearing; and shall we then despise the cause of 
 our inferiors when they contend with us?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13">Job xxxi. 13</A>.

 (1.) He convinces them of the evil of their murmurings. They thought
 they reflected only upon Moses and Aaron, but here they are told that 
 God was struck at through their sides. This is much insisted on

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 "<I>Your murmurings are not against us,</I> then we would have been 
 silent, but <I>against the Lord;</I> it was he that led you into these 
 straits, and not we." Note, When we murmur against those who are 
 instruments of any uneasiness to us, whether justly or unjustly, we 
 should do well to consider how much we reflect upon God by it; men are 
 but God's hand.  Those that quarrel with the reproofs and convictions 
 of the word, and are angry with their ministers when they are touched 
 in a tender part, know not what they do, for therein they strive with 
 their Maker. Let this for ever stop the mouth of murmuring, that it is 
 daring impiety to murmur at God, because he is God; and gross absurdity 
 to murmur at men, because they are but men. 

 (2.) He assures them of the supply of their wants, that since they had
 harped upon the flesh-pots so much they should for once have flesh in 
 abundance that evening, and bread the next morning, and so on every day 
 thenceforward,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:8,12"><I>v.</I> 8, 12</A>.

 Many there are of whom we say that they are better fed than taught; but 
 the Israelites were thus fed, that they might be taught. <I>He led him 
 about, he instructed him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:10">Deut. xxxii. 10</A>);

 and, as to this instance, see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">Deut. viii. 3</A>,

 <I>He fed thee with manna, that thou mightest know that man doth not
 live by bread only.</I> And, besides this, here are two things 
 mentioned, which he intended to teach them by sending them manna:--

 [1.] <I>By this you shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from
 the land of Egypt,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 That they were brought out of Egypt was plain enough; but so strangely 
 sottish and short-sighted were they that they said it was Moses that 
 brought them out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Now God sent them manna, to prove that it was no less than infinite 
 power and goodness that brought them out, and this could perfect what 
 was begun.  If Moses only had brought them out of Egypt, he could not 
 thus have fed them; they must therefore own that that was the Lord's 
 doing, because this was so, and both were marvellous in their eyes; 
 yet, long afterwards, they needed to be told that <I>Moses gave them 
 not this bread from heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32">John vi. 32</A>.

 [2.] <I>By this you shall know that I am the Lord your God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This gave proof of his power as the Lord, and his particular favour to 
 them as their God. When God plagued the Egyptians, it was to make them 
 know that he was the Lord; when he provided for the Israelites, it was 
 to make them know that he was their God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How God himself manifested his glory, to still the murmurings of the 
 people, and to put a reputation upon Moses and Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 While Aaron was speaking, <I>the glory of the Lord appeared in the 
 cloud.</I> The cloud itself, one would think, was enough both to strike 
 an awe upon them and to give encouragement to them; yet, in a few days, 
 it had grown so familiar to them that it made no impression upon them, 
 unless it shone with an unusual brightness. Note, What God's ministers 
 say to us is then likely to do us good when the glory of God shines in 
 with it upon our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
 covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the
 host.
 &nbsp; 14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
 of the wilderness <I>there lay</I> a small round thing, <I>as</I> small as
 the hoar frost on the ground.
 &nbsp; 15 And when the children of Israel saw <I>it,</I> they said one to
 another, It <I>is</I> manna: for they wist not what it <I>was.</I> And
 Moses said unto them, This <I>is</I> the bread which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 given you to eat.
 &nbsp; 16 This <I>is</I> the thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded, Gather of
 it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
 <I>according to</I> the number of your persons; take ye every man for
 <I>them</I> which <I>are</I> in his tents.
 &nbsp; 17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
 some less.
 &nbsp; 18 And when they did mete <I>it</I> with an omer, he that gathered
 much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
 they gathered every man according to his eating.
 &nbsp; 19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
 &nbsp; 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
 them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank:
 and Moses was wroth with them.
 &nbsp; 21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to
 his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now they begin to be provided for by the immediate hand of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He makes them a feast, at night, of delicate fowl, <I>feathered 
 fowl</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:27">Ps. lxxviii. 27</A>),

 therefore not <I>locusts,</I> as some think; quails, or pheasants, or
 some wild fowl, came up, and covered the camp, so tame that they might 
 take up as many of them as they pleased. Note, God gives us of the good 
 things of this life, not only for necessity, but for delight, that we 
 may not only serve him, but serve him cheerfully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Next morning he rained manna upon them, which was to be continued 
 to them for their daily bread. 

 1. That which was provided for them was manna, which descended from the 
 clouds, so that, in some sense, they might be said to live upon the 
 air. It came down in dew that melted, and yet was itself of such a 
 consistency as to serve for nourishing strengthening food, without any 
 thing else. They called it <I>manna, manhu,</I> "What is this?" Either, 
 "What a poor thing this is!" despising it: or, "What a strange thing 
 this is!" admiring it: or, "It is a portion, no matter what it is; it 
 is that which our God has allotted us, and we will take it and be 
 thankful,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 It was pleasant food; the Jews say that it was palatable to all, 
 however varied their tastes. It was wholesome food, light of digestion, 
 and very necessary (Dr. Grew says) to cleanse them from disorders with 
 which he thinks it probable that they were, in the time of their 
 bondage, more or less infected, which disorders a luxurious diet would 
 have made contagious. By this spare and plain diet we are all taught a 
 lesson of temperance, and forbidden to desire dainties and varieties.  
 
 2. They were to gather it every morning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>the portion of a day in his day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Thus they must live upon daily providence, as the fowls of the air, of 
 which it is said, <I>That which thou givest them they gather</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:28">Ps. civ. 28</A>);

 not to-day for to-morrow: <I>let the morrow take thought for the things
 of itself.</I> To this daily raining and gathering of manna our Saviour 
 seems to allude when he teaches us to pray, <I>Give us this day our 
 daily bread.</I> We are hereby taught, 

 (1.) Prudence and diligence in providing food convenient for ourselves
 and our household.  What God graciously gives we must industriously 
 gather; with quietness working, and eating our own bread, not the bread 
 either of idleness or deceit.  God's bounty leaves room for man's duty; 
 it did so even when manna was rained: they must not eat till they have 
 gathered. 

 (2.) Contentment and satisfaction with a sufficiency. They must gather,
 <I>every man according to his eating;</I> enough is as good as a feast, 
 and more than enough is as bad as a surfeit. Those that have most have, 
 for themselves, but food, and raiment, and mirth; and those that have 
 least generally have these: so that <I>he who gathers much has nothing 
 over, and he who gathers little has no lack.</I> There is not so great 
 a disproportion between one and another in the comforts and enjoyments 
 of the things of this life as there is in the property and possession 
 of the things themselves. 

 (3.) Dependence upon Providence: <I>Let no man leave till morning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 but let them learn to go to bed and sleep quietly, though they have not 
 a bit of bread in their tent, nor in all their camp, trusting that God, 
 with the following day, will bring them their daily bread." It was 
 surer and safer in God's store-house than in their own, and would 
 thence come to them sweeter and fresher. Read with this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>,

 <I>Take no thought for your life,</I> &c. See here the folly of 
 hoarding. The manna that was laid up by some (who thought themselves 
 wiser and better managers than their neighbours, and who would provide 
 in case it should fail next day), putrefied, and bred worms, and became 
 good for nothing. Note, That proves to be most wasted which is 
 covetously and distrustfully spared.  Those riches are corrupted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:2,3">James v. 2, 3</A>.

 Let us set ourselves to think, 

 [1.] Of that great power of God which fed Israel in the wilderness, and
 made miracles their daily bread. What cannot this God do, who prepared 
 a table in the wilderness, and furnished it richly even for those who 
 questioned whether he could or no?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19,20">Ps. lxxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 Never was there such a market of provisions as this, where so many
 hundred thousand men were daily furnished, without money and without 
 price. Never was there such an open house kept as God kept in the 
 wilderness for forty years together, nor such free and plentiful 
 entertainment given. The feast which Ahasuerus made, to show the 
 <I>riches of his kingdom,</I> and the <I>honour of his majesty,</I> was 
 nothing to this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:4">Esth. i. 4</A>.

 It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>When the sun waxed hot, it melted;</I> as if what was left were 
 drawn up by the heat of the sun into the air to be the seed of the next 
 day's harvest, and so from day to day. 

 [2.] Of that constant providence of God which <I>gives food to all
 flesh, for his mercy endures for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:25">Ps. cxxxvi. 25</A>.

 He is a great house-keeper that provides for all the creatures.  The
 same wisdom, power, and goodness that now brought food daily out of the 
 clouds, are employed in the constant course of nature, bringing food 
 yearly out of the earth, and giving us all things richly to enjoy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And it came to pass, <I>that</I> on the sixth day they gathered
 twice as much bread, two omers for one <I>man:</I> and all the rulers
 of the congregation came and told Moses.
 &nbsp; 23 And he said unto them, This <I>is that</I> which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 said, To morrow <I>is</I> the rest of the holy sabbath unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 bake <I>that</I> which ye will bake <I>to day,</I> and seethe that ye will
 seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept
 until the morning.
 &nbsp; 24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
 did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
 &nbsp; 25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day <I>is</I> a sabbath
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: to day ye shall not find it in the field.
 &nbsp; 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, <I>which
 is</I> the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
 &nbsp; 27 And it came to pass, <I>that</I> there went out <I>some</I> of the
 people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
 &nbsp; 28 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
 commandments and my laws?
 &nbsp; 29 See, for that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given you the sabbath, therefore
 he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
 every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
 seventh day.
 &nbsp; 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
 &nbsp; 31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and
 it <I>was</I> like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it <I>was</I>
 like wafers <I>made</I> with honey.
 </FONT></P>

 We have here, 

 1. A plain intimation of the observing of a <I>seventh day sabbath,</I> 
 not only before the giving of the law upon Mount Sinai, but before the 
 bringing of Israel out of Egypt, and therefore, <I>from the 
 beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:3">Gen. ii. 3</A>.

 If the sabbath had now been first instituted, how could Moses have
 understood what God said to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 concerning a double portion to be gathered on the sixth day, without 
 making any express mention of the sabbath? And how could the people so 
 readily take the hint 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 even to the surprise of the rulers, before Moses had declared that it 
 was done with a regard to the sabbath, if they had not had some 
 knowledge of the sabbath before? The setting apart of one day in seven 
 for holy work, and, in order to that, for holy rest, was a divine 
 appointment ever since God created man upon the earth, and the most 
 ancient of positive laws. The way of sabbath-sanctification is the good 
 old way. 

 2. The double provision which God made for the Israelites, and which 
 they were to make for themselves, on the sixth day: God gave them <I>on 
 the sixth day the bread of two days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Appointing them to rest on the seventh day, he took care that they 
 should be no losers by it; and none ever will be losers by serving God. 
 On that day they were to fetch in enough for two days, and to prepare 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The law was very strict, that they must bake and seeth, the day before, 
 and not on the sabbath day.  This does not now make it unlawful for us 
 to dress meat on the Lord's day, but directs us to contrive our family 
 affairs so that they may hinder us as little as possible in the work of 
 the sabbath. Works of necessity, no doubt, are to be done on that day; 
 but it is desirable to have as little as may be to do of things 
 necessary to the life that now is, that we may apply ourselves the more 
 closely to the one thing needful. That which they kept of for their 
 food on the sabbath day did not putrefy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 When they kept it in opposition to a command

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 it stank; when they kept it in obedience to a command it was sweet and 
 good; for every thing is sanctified by the <I>word of God and 
 prayer.</I> 

 3. The intermission of the manna on the seventh day. God did not send 
 it then, and therefore they must not expect it, nor go out to gather,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 This showed that it was not produced by natural causes, and that it was 
 designed for a confirmation of the divine authority of the law which 
 was to be given by Moses. Thus God took an effectual course to make 
 them <I>remember the sabbath day;</I> they could not forget it, nor the 
 day of preparation for it.  Some, it seems, went out on the seventh 
 day, expecting to find manna

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 but they found none, for those that will find must seek in the 
 appointed time: seek the Lord <I>while he may be found.</I> God, upon 
 this occasion, said to Moses, <I>How long refuse you to keep my 
 commandments?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Why did he say this to Moses? He was not disobedient. No, but he was 
 the ruler of a disobedient people, and God charges it upon him that he 
 might the more warmly charge it upon them, and might take care that 
 their disobedience should not be through any neglect or default of his.  
 It was for going out to seek for manna on he seventh day that they were 
 thus reproved. Note, 

 (1.) Disobedience, even in a small matter, is very provoking. 

 (2.) God is jealous for the honour of his sabbaths. If walking out on
 the sabbath to seek for food was thus reproved, walking out on that day 
 purely to find our own pleasure cannot be justified.</P>

 commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;
 that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the
 wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full
 of manna therein, and lay it up before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to be kept for
 your generations.
 &nbsp; 34 As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
 Testimony, to be kept.
 &nbsp; 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
 they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
 came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 36 Now an omer <I>is</I> the tenth <I>part</I> of an ephah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God having provided manna to be his people's food in the wilderness, 
 and to be to them a continual feast, we are here told, 

 1. How the memory of it was preserved. An omer of this manna was laid 
 up in <I>a golden pot,</I> as we are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:4">Heb. ix. 4</A>),

 and kept <I>before the testimony,</I> or the ark, when it was
 afterwards made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:32-34"><I>v.</I> 32-34</A>.

 The preservation of this manna from waste and corruption was a standing 
 miracle, and therefore the more proper memorial of this miraculous 
 food. "Posterity shall <I>see the bread,</I>" says God, "<I>wherewith I 
 have fed you in the wilderness,</I>" see what sort of food it was, and 
 how much each man's daily proportion of it was, that it may appear they 
 were neither kept to hard fare nor to short allowance, and then judge 
 between God and Israel, whether they had any cause given them to murmur 
 and find fault with their provisions, and whether they and their seed 
 after them had not a great deal of reason gratefully to won God's 
 goodness to them. Note, Eaten bread must not be forgotten. God's 
 miracles and mercies are to be had in everlasting remembrance, for our 
 encouragement to trust in him at all times. 

 2. How the mercy of it was continued as long as they had occasion for 
 it. The manna never ceased till they came to the borders of Canaan, 
 where there was bread enough and to spare,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 See how constant the care of Providence is; seedtime and harvest fail 
 not, while the earth remains. Israel was very provoking in the 
 wilderness, yet the manna never failed them: thus still God causes his 
 rain to fall on the just and unjust. The manna is called <I>spiritual 
 meat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:3">1 Cor. x. 3</A>),

 because it was typical of spiritual blessings in heavenly things.
 Christ himself is the true manna, the bread of life, of which this was 
 a figure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:49-51">John vi. 49-51</A>.

 The word of God is the manna by which our souls are nourished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4">Matt. iv. 4</A>.

 The comforts of the Spirit are hidden manna, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:17">Rev. ii. 17</A>.

 These come from heaven, as the manna did, and are the support and
 comfort of the divine life in the soul, while we are in the wilderness 
 of this world. It is food for <I>Israelites,</I> for those only that 
 follow the pillar of cloud and fire. It is to be <I>gathered;</I> 
 Christ in the word is to be applied to the soul, and the means of grace 
 are to be used. We must every one of us gather for ourselves, and 
 gather in the morning of our opportunities, which if we let slip, it 
 may be too late to gather. The manna they gathered must not be hoarded 
 up, but eaten; those that have received Christ must by faith live upon 
 him, and not receive his grace in vain. There was manna enough for all, 
 enough for each, and none had too much; so in Christ there is a 
 complete sufficiency, and no superfluity. But those that did eat manna 
 hungered again, died at last, and with many of them God was not 
 well-pleased; whereas those that feed on Christ by faith shall never 
 hunger, and shall die no more, and with them God will be for ever well 
 pleased. The Lord evermore give us this bread!</P>
