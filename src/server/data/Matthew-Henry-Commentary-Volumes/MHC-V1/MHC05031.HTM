 In this chapter Moses, having finished his sermon, 

 I. Encourages both the people who were now to enter Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and Joshua who was to lead them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:7,8,23">ver. 7, 8, 23</A>.

 And, 

 II. He takes care for the keeping of these things always in their
 remembrance after his decease, 
 
 1. By the book of the law which was,
 
 (1.) Written. 
 
 (2.) Delivered into the custody of the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:9,24-27">ver. 9, and 24-27</A>.

 (3.) Ordered to be publicly read every seventh year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 2. By a song which God orders Moses to prepare for their instruction
 and admonition. 

 (1.) He calls Moses and Joshua to the door of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 (2.) He foretels the apostasy of Israel in process of time, and the
 judgments they would thereby bring upon themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 (3.) He prescribes the following song to be a witness against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 (4.) Moses wrote it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:22">ver. 22</A>.

 And delivered it to Israel, with an intimation of the design of it, as
 he had received it from the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:28-30">ver. 28</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto them, I <I>am</I> a hundred and twenty years old
 this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
 &nbsp; 3 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, he will go over before thee, <I>and</I> he will
 destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
 them: <I>and</I> Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath said.
 &nbsp; 4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
 kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall give them up before your face, that ye may
 do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
 commanded you.
 &nbsp; 6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
 them: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, he <I>it is</I> that doth go with thee; he
 will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
 &nbsp; 7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
 of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go
 with this people unto the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sworn unto
 their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit
 it.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he <I>it is</I> that doth go before thee; he will be
 with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not,
 neither be dismayed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Loth to part</I> (we say) <I>bids oft farewell.</I> Moses does so to 
 the children of Israel: not because he was loth to go to God, but 
 because he was loth to leave them, fearing that when he had left them 
 they would leave God. He had finished what he had to say to them by way 
 of counsel and exhortation: here he calls them together to give them a 
 word of encouragement, especially with reference to the wars of Canaan, 
 in which they were now to engage. It was a discouragement to them that 
 Moses was to be removed at a time when he could so ill be spared: 
 though Joshua was continued to fight for them in the valley, they would 
 want Moses to intercede for them on the hill, as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:10">Exod. xvii. 10</A>.

 But there is no remedy: <I>Moses can no more go out and come in,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Not that he was disabled by any decay either of body or mind; for his
 <I>natural force was not abated,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:7"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 7</A>.

 But he cannot any longer discharge his office; for, 

 1. He is 120 <I>years old,</I> and it is time for him to think of
 resigning his honour and returning to his rest. He that had arrived at 
 so great an age then, when seventy or eighty was the ordinary stint, as 
 appears by the prayer of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>),

 might well think that he had accomplished as a hireling his day. 

 2. He is under a divine sentence: <I>Thou shalt not go over Jordan.</I>
 Thus a full stop was put to his usefulness; hitherto he must go, 
 hitherto he must serve, but no further. So God had appointed it and 
 Moses acquiesces: for I know not why we should any of us desire to live 
 a day longer than while God has work for us to do; nor shall we be 
 accountable for more time than is allotted us. But, though Moses must 
 not go over himself, he is anxious to encourage those that must.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He encourages the people; and never could any general animate his 
 soldiers upon such good grounds as those on which Moses here encourages 
 Israel. 
 
 1. He assures them of the constant presence of God with them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The Lord thy God.</I> that has led thee and kept thee hitherto
 <I>will go over before thee;</I> and those might follow boldly who were 
 sure that they had God for their leader. He repeats it again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 with an emphasis: "<I>The Lord thy God,</I> the great Jehovah, who is
 thine in covenant, <I>he it is,</I> he and no less, he and no other, 
 <I>that goes before thee;</I> not only who by his promise has assured 
 thee that he <I>will go before thee;</I> but by his ark, the visible 
 token of his presence, shows thee that he <I>does</I> actually <I>go 
 before thee.</I>" And he repeats it with enlargement: "Not only he goes 
 over before thee at first, to bring thee in, but he will continue with 
 thee all along, with thee and thine; <I>he will not fail thee nor 
 forsake thee;</I> he will not disappoint thy expectations in any 
 strait, nor will he ever desert thy interest; be constant to him, and 
 he will be so to thee." This is applied by the apostle to all God's 
 spiritual Israel, for the encouragement of their faith and hope; unto 
 us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them <I>He will never fail 
 thee, nor forsake thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5">Heb. xiii. 5</A>.

 2. He commends Joshua to them for a leader: <I>Joshua, he shall go over
 before thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 One whose conduct, and courage, and sincere affection to their
 interest, they had had long experience of; and one whom God had 
 ordained and appointed to be their leader, and therefore, no doubt, 
 would own and bless, and make a blessing to them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:18">Num. xxvii. 18</A>.
 
 Note, It is a great encouragement to a people when, instead of some
 useful instruments that are removed, God raises up others to carry on 
 his work.

 3. He ensures their success. The greatest generals, supported with the
 greatest advantages, must yet own the issues of war to be doubtful and 
 uncertain; the battle is not always to the strong nor to the bold; an 
 ill accident unthought of may turn the scale against the highest hopes.
 But Moses had warrant from God to assure Israel that, notwithstanding 
 the disadvantages they laboured under, they should certainly be 
 victorious. A coward will fight when he is sure to be a conqueror. God 
 undertakes to do the work--<I>he will destroy these nations;</I> and 
 Israel shall do little else than divide the spoil--<I>thou shalt 
 possess them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Two things might encourage their hopes of this:--

 (1.) The victories they had already obtained over Sihon and Og

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 from which they might infer both the power of God, that he could do
 what he had done, and the purpose of God, that he would finish what he 
 had begun to do. Thus must we improve our experience.

 (2.) The command God had given them to destroy the Canaanites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2,12:2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2; xii. 2</A>),

 to which he refers here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 that you <I>may do unto them according to all which I have commanded
 you</I>), and from which they might infer that, if God had commanded
 them to destroy the Canaanites, no doubt he would put it into the power 
 of their hands to do it. Note, What God has made our duty we have 
 reason to expect opportunity and assistance from him for the doing of. 
 So that from all this he had reason enough to bid them <I>be strong and 
 of a good courage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 While they had the power of God engaged for them they had no reason to
 fear all the powers of Canaan engaged against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages Joshua, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. Though Joshua was an experienced general, and a man of approved
 gallantry and resolution, who had already signalized himself in many 
 brave actions, yet Moses saw cause to bid him <I>be of good 
 courage,</I> now that he was entering upon a new scene of action; and 
 Joshua was far from taking it as an affront, or as a tacit questioning 
 of his courage, to be thus charged, as sometimes we find proud and 
 peevish spirits invidiously taking exhortations and admonitions for 
 reproaches and reflections. Joshua himself is very well pleased to be 
 admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. 

 2. He gives him this charge <I>in the sight of all Israel,</I> that
 they might be the more observant of him whom they saw thus solemnly 
 inaugurated, and that he might set himself the more to be an example of 
 courage to the people who were witnesses to this charge here given to 
 him as well as to themselves. 

 3. He gives him the same assurances of the divine presence, and
 consequently of a glorious success, that he had given the people. God
 would be with him, would not forsake him, and therefore he should 
 certainly accomplish the glorious enterprise to which he was called and 
 commissioned: <I>Thou shalt cause them to inherit the land</I> of 
 promise. Note, Those shall speed well that have God with them; and 
 therefore they ought to <I>be of good courage.</I> Through God let us 
 do valiantly, for through him we shall do victoriously; if we resist 
 the devil, he shall flee, and God shall <I>shortly tread him under our 
 feet.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
 the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and unto all the elders of Israel.
 &nbsp; 10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of <I>every</I>
 seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the
 feast of tabernacles,
 &nbsp; 11 When all Israel is come to appear before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in
 the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before
 all Israel in their hearing.
 &nbsp; 12 Gather the people together, men, and women, and children,
 and thy stranger that <I>is</I> within thy gates, that they may hear,
 and that they may learn, and fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and observe
 to do all the words of this law:
 &nbsp; 13 And <I>that</I> their children, which have not known <I>any thing,</I>
 may hear, and learn to fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, as long as ye live
 in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The law was given by Moses; so it is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:17">John i. 17</A>.

 He was not only entrusted to deliver it to that generation, but to
 transmit it to the generations to come; and here it appears that he was 
 faithful to that trust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Moses wrote this law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The learned bishop Patrick understands this of all the five books of
 Moses, which are often called the <I>law;</I> he supposes that though 
 Moses had written most of the Pentateuch before, yet he did not finish 
 it till now; now he put his last hand to that sacred volume. Many think 
 that the law here (especially since it is called <I>this law,</I> this 
 grand abridgment of the law) is to be understood of this book of 
 Deuteronomy; all those discourses to the people which have taken up 
 this whole book, he, being in them divinely inspired, wrote them as the 
 word of God. He wrote this law,

 1. That those who had heard it might often review it themselves, and
 call it to mind. 

 2. That it might be the more safely handed down to posterity. Note, The
 church has received abundance of advantage from the writing, as well as 
 from the preaching, of divine things; faith comes not only by hearing, 
 but by reading. The same care that was taken of the law, thanks be to 
 God, is taken of the gospel too; soon after it was preached it was 
 written, that it might reach to those on whom the ends of the world 
 shall come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having written it, he committed it to the care and custody of the 
 priests and elders. He delivered one authentic copy to the priests, to 
 be laid up by the ark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 there to remain as a standard by which all other copies must be tried.
 And it is supposed that he gave another copy to the elders of each 
 tribe, to be transcribed by all of that tribe that were so disposed. 
 Some observe that the elders, as well as the priests, were entrusted 
 with the law, to intimate that magistrates by the power, as well as 
 ministers by their doctrine, are to maintain religion, and to take care 
 that the law be not broken nor lost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He appointed the public reading of this law in a general assembly 
 of all Israel every seventh year. The pious Jews (it is very probable) 
 read the laws daily in their families, and <I>Moses of old time was 
 read in the synagogue every sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:21">Acts xv. 21</A>.

 But once in seven years, that the law might be the more magnified and
 made honourable, it must be read in a general assembly. Though we read 
 the word in private, we must not think it needless to hear it read in 
 public. Now here he give direction,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When this solemn reading of the law must be, that the time might add 
 to the solemnity; it must be done, 

 (1.) In the year of release. In that year the land rested, so that they
 could the better spare time to attend this service. Servants who were 
 then discharged, and poor debtors who were then acquitted from their 
 debts, must know that, having the benefit of the law, it was justly 
 expected they should yield obedience to it, and therefore give up 
 themselves to be God's servants, because he had loosed their bonds. The 
 year of release was typical of gospel grace, which therefore is called 
 the <I>acceptable year of the Lord;</I> for our remission and liberty 
 by Christ engage us to keep his commandments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 (2.) At the feast of tabernacles in that year. In that feast they were
 particularly required to <I>rejoice before God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40">Lev. xxiii. 40</A>.
 
 Therefore then they must read the law, both to qualify their mirth and
 keep it in due bounds, and to sanctify their mirth, that they might 
 make the law of God the matter of their rejoicing, and might read it 
 with pleasure and not as a task.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To whom it must be read: To <I>all Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>men, women, and children, and the strangers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The women and children were not obliged to go up to the other feasts,
 but to this only in which the law was read. Note, It is the will of God 
 that all people should acquaint themselves with his word. It is a rule 
 to all, and therefore should be read to all. It is supposed that, since 
 all Israel could not possibly meet in one place, nor could one man's 
 voice reach them all, as many as the courts of the Lord's house would 
 hold met there, and the rest at the same time in their synagogues. The 
 Jewish doctors say that the hearers were bound to <I>prepare their 
 hearts,</I> and to hear <I>with fear and reverence, and with joy and 
 trembling,</I> as in the day <I>when the law was given on Mount 
 Sinai;</I> and, though there were <I>great and wise men who knew the 
 whole law very well,</I> yet they were bound to <I>hear with great 
 attention;</I> for he that <I>reads is the messenger of the 
 congregation to cause the words of God to be heard.</I> I wish those 
 that hear the gospel read and preached would consider this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. By whom it must be read: <I>Thou shalt read it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 "Thou, O Israel," by a proper person appointed for that purpose; or,
 "Thou, O Joshua," their chief ruler; accordingly we find that he did 
 read the law himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:34,35">Josh. viii. 34, 35</A>.
 
 So did Josiah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:30">2 Chron. xxxiv. 30</A>,
 
 and Ezra, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:3">Neh. viii. 3</A>.

 And the Jews say that the king himself (when they had one) was the
 person that read in the courts of the temple, that a pulpit was set up 
 for that purpose in the midst of the court, in which the king stood, 
 that the book of the law was delivered to him by the high priest, that 
 he stood up to receive it, uttered a prayer (as every one did that was 
 to read the law in public) before he read; and then, if he pleased, he 
 might sit down and read. But if he read standing it was thought the 
 more commendable, as (they say) king Agrippa did. Here let me offer it
 as a conjecture that Solomon is called the <I>preacher,</I> in his 
 Ecclesiastes, because he delivered the substance of that book in a 
 discourse to the people, after his public reading of the law in the 
 feast of tabernacles, according to this appointment here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. For what end it must be thus solemnly read. 

 (1.) That the present generation might hereby keep up their
 acquaintance with the law of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They must hear, that they may learn, and <I>fear God, and observe to do
 their duty.</I> See here what we are to aim at in hearing the word; we 
 must hear, that we may learn and grow in knowledge; and every time we 
 read the scriptures we shall find that there is still more and more to 
 be learned out of them. We must learn, that we may fear God, that is, 
 that we may be duly affected with divine things; and must fear God, 
 that we may <I>observe and do the words of his law;</I> for in vain do 
 we pretend to fear him if we do not obey him.

 (2.) That the rising generation might betimes be leavened with religion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 not only that those who know something may thus know more, but that
 <I>the children who have not known any thing</I> may betimes know this, 
 how much it is their interest as well as duty to fear God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
 thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
 tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And
 Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle
 of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a

 tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
 thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after
 the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go <I>to be</I>
 among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I
 have made with them.
 &nbsp; 17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and
 I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
 shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them;
 so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon
 us, because our God <I>is</I> not among us?
 &nbsp; 18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
 which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other
 gods.
 &nbsp; 19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
 children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be
 a witness for me against the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
 sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and
 they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
 will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me,
 and break my covenant.
 &nbsp; 21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
 befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
 witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their
 seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now,
 before I have brought them into the land which I sware.

 Here, 
 
 I. Moses and Joshua are summoned to attend the divine majesty at 
 the door of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Moses is told again that he must shortly die; even those that are most
 ready and willing to die have need to be often reminded of the approach 
 of death. In consideration of this, he must come himself to meet God; 
 for whatever improves our communion with God furthers our preparation 
 for death. He must also bring Joshua with him to be presented to God 
 for a successor, and to receive his commission and charge. Moses 
 readily obeys the summons, for he was not one of those that look with 
 an evil eye upon their successors, but, on the contrary, rejoiced in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God graciously gives them the meeting: <I>He appeared in the 
 tabernacle</I> (as the shechinah used to appear) <I>in a pillar of a 
 cloud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is the only time in all this book that we read of the glory of God
 appearing, whereas we often read of it in the three foregoing books, 
 which perhaps signifies that in the latter days, under the evangelical 
 law, such visible appearances as these of the divine glory are not to 
 be expected, but we must take heed to the more sure word of 
 prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He tells Moses that, after his death, the covenant which he had 
 taken so much pains to make between Israel and their God would 
 certainly be broken. 

 1. That Israel would <I>forsake God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And we may be sure that if the covenant between God and man be broken
 the blame must lie on man, it is he that breaks it; we have often 
 observed it, That God never leaves any till they first leave him.
 Worshipping the gods of the Canaanites (who had been the natives, but 
 henceforward were to be looked upon as the strangers of that land) 
 would undoubtedly be counted a deserting of God, and, like adultery, a 
 violation of the covenant. Thus still those are revolters from Christ,
 and will be so adjudged, who either make a god of their money by 
 reigning covetousness or a god of their belly by reigning sensuality.
 Those that <I>turn to other gods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 forsake their own mercies. This apostasy of theirs is foretold to be
 the effect of their prosperity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They shall have eaten and filled themselves;</I> this is all they
 will aim at in eating, to gratify their own appetites, and then they 
 will wax fat, grow secure and sensual; their security will take off 
 their dread of God and his judgments; and their sensuality will incline 
 them to the idolatries of the heathen, which <I>made provision for the 
 flesh to fulfil the lusts of it.</I> Note, God has a clear and 
 infallible foresight of all the wickedness of the wicked, and has often 
 covenanted with those who <I>he knew would deal very treacherously</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>),

 and conferred many favours on those who he knew would deal very
 ungratefully. 

 2. That then God would forsake Israel; and justly does he cast those
 off who had so unjustly cast him off

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>My anger shall be kindled against them, and I will forsake them.</I>
 His providence would forsake them, no longer to protect and prosper 
 them, and then they would become a prey to all their neighbours. His 
 spirit and grace would forsake them, no longer to teach and guide them, 
 and then they would be more and more bigoted, besotted, and hardened in 
 their idolatries. Thus <I>many evils and troubles would befal them.</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:17,21"><I>v.</I> 17, 21</A>),

 which would be such manifest indications of God's displeasure against
 them that they themselves would be constrained to own it: <I>Have not 
 these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?</I> Those 
 that have sinned away their God will find that thereby they pull all 
 mischiefs upon their own heads. But that which completed their misery 
 was that God would <I>hide his face from them in that day,</I> that day 
 of their trouble and distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Whatever outward troubles we are in, if we have but the light of God's
 countenance, we may be easy. But, if God hide his face from us and our 
 prayers, we are undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He directs Moses to deliver them a song, in the composing of which
 he should be divinely inspired, and which should remain a standing 
 testimony for God as faithful to them in giving them warning, and 
 against them as persons false to themselves in not taking the warning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The written word in general, as well as this song in particular, is a
 witness for God against all those that break covenant with him. It 
 shall be for a testimony,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14">Matt. xxiv. 14</A>.

 The wisdom of man has devised many ways of conveying the knowledge of
 good and evil, by laws, histories, prophecies, proverbs, and, among the 
 rest, by songs; each has its advantages. And the wisdom of God has in 
 the scripture made use of them all, that ignorant and careless men 
 might be left inexcusable.

 1. This song, if rightly improved, might be a means to prevent their
 apostasy; for in the inditing of it God had an eye to their present 
 imagination, now, <I>before they were brought into the land of 
 promise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 God knew very well that there were in their hearts such gross conceits
 of the deity, and such inclinations of idolatry, that they would be 
 tinder to the sparks of that temptation; and therefore in this song he 
 gives them warning of their danger that way. Note, The word of God is a 
 <I>discerner of the thoughts and intents of men's hearts,</I> and meets 
 with them strangely by its reproofs and corrections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:25">1 Cor. xiv. 25</A>.

 Ministers who preach the word know not the imaginations men go about,
 but God, whose word it is, knows perfectly. 

 2. If this song did not prevent their apostasy, yet it might help to
 bring them to repentance, and to recover them from their apostasy. When 
 their troubles come upon them, this <I>song shall not be forgotten,</I> 
 but may serve as a glass to show them their own faces, that they may 
 humble themselves, and return to him from whom they have revolted. 
 Note, Those for whom God has mercy in store he may leave to fall, yet 
 he will provide means for their recovery. Medicines are prepared 
 before-hand for their cure.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
 the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
 strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children
 of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be
 with thee.
 &nbsp; 24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing
 the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
 &nbsp; 25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
 covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
 of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, that it may be there for a
 witness against thee.
 &nbsp; 27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while
 I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and how much more after my death?
 &nbsp; 28 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
 officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
 heaven and earth to record against them.
 &nbsp; 29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
 <I>yourselves,</I> and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
 you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will
 do evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to provoke him to anger through
 the work of your hands.
 &nbsp; 30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of
 Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. The charge is given to Joshua, which God has said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 he would give him. The same in effect that Moses had given him. The
 same in effect that Moses had given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Be strong and of a good courage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Joshua had now heard from God so much of the wickedness of the people
 whom he was to have the conduct of as could not but be a discouragement 
 to him: "Nay," says God, "how bad soever they are, thou shalt go 
 through thy understanding, for <I>I will be with thee.</I> Thou shalt 
 put them into possession of Canaan. If they afterwards by their sin 
 throw themselves out of it again, that will be no fault of thine, nor 
 any dishonour to thee, therefore <I>be of good courage.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemn delivery of the book of the law to the Levites, to be 
 deposited in the side of the ark, is here again related 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>),

 of which before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Only they are here directed where to treasure up this precious
 original, not in the ark (there only the two tables were preserved), 
 but in another box <I>by the side of the ark.</I> It is probable that 
 this was the very book that was found in the house of the Lord (having 
 been somehow or other misplaced) in the days of Josiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:14">2 Chron. xxxiv. 14</A>),

 and so perhaps the following words here, <I>that it may be a witness
 against thee,</I> may particularly point at that event, which happened 
 so long after; for the finding of this very book occasioned the public 
 reading of it by Josiah himself, for a witness against a people who 
 were then almost ripe for their ruin by the Babylonians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The song which follows in the next chapter is here delivered to 
 Moses, and by him to the people. He wrote it first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 as the Spirit of God indited it, and then <I>spoke it in the ears of
 all the congregation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 
 and taught it to them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 that is, gave out copies of it, and ordered the people to learn it by
 heart. It was delivered by word of mouth first, and afterwards in 
 writing, to the elders and officers, as the representatives of their 
 respective tribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 by them to be transmitted to their several families and households. It
 was delivered to them with a solemn appeal to heaven and earth 
 concerning the fair warning which was given them by it of the fatal 
 consequences of their apostasy from God, and with a declaration of the 
 little joy and little hope Moses had in and concerning them. 

 1. He declares what little joy he had had of them while he was with
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It is not in a passion that he says, <I>I know thy rebellion</I> (as
 once he said unadvisedly, <I>Hear now, you rebels</I>), but it is the
 result of a long acquaintance with them: <I>you have been rebellious 
 against the Lord.</I> Their rebellions against himself he makes no 
 mention of: these he had long since forgiven and forgotten; but they 
 must be made to hear of their rebellions against God, that they may be 
 ever repented of and never repeated.

 2. What little hopes he had of them now that he was leaving them. From
 what God had now said to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 more than from his own experience of them, though that was discouraging
 enough, he tells them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 <I>I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves.</I>
 Many a sad thought, no doubt, it occasioned to this good man, to 
 foresee the apostasy and ruin of a people he had taken so much pains 
 with, in order to them good and make them happy; but this was his 
 comfort, that he had done his duty, and that God would be glorified, if 
 not in their settlement, yet in their dispersion. Thus our Lord Jesus, 
 a little before his death, foretold the rise of false Christs and false 
 prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24">Matt. xxiv. 24</A>),
 
 notwithstanding which, and all the apostasies of the latter times, we
 may be confident that <I>the gates of hell shall not prevail against 
 the church,</I> for the <I>foundation of God stands sure.</I></P>
