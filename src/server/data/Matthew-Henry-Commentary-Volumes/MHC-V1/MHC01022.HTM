 We have here the famous story of Abraham's offering up his son 
 Isaac, that is, his offering to offer him, which is justly looked 
 upon as one of the wonders of the church. Here is, 
 
 I. The strange 
 command which God gave to Abraham concerning it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II. Abraham's strange obedience to this command,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:3-10">ver. 3-10</A>.
 
 III. The strange issue of this trial. 
 
 1. The sacrificing of Isaac 
 was countermanded,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.
 
 2. Another sacrifice was provided,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.
 
 3. The covenant was renewed with Abraham 
 hereupon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.
 Lastly, an account of some of Abraham's
 relations,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass after these 
 things, that God did tempt Abraham, 
 and said unto him, Abraham: 
 and he said, Behold, <I>here</I> I <I>am.</I>
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine 
 only <I>son</I> Isaac, whom thou lovest, and 
 get thee into the land of Moriah; and 
 offer him there for a burnt offering 
 upon one of the mountains which I 
 will tell thee of.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the trial of Abraham's faith, whether 
 it continued so strong, so vigorous, so 
 victorious, after a long settlement in communion 
 with God, as it was at first, when by 
 it he left his country: then it was made to 
 appear that he loved God better than his father; 
 now that he loved him better than his 
 son. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when Abraham was thus tried
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 <I>After these things,</I> after all the other 
 exercises he had had, all the hardships and 
 difficulties he had gone through. Now, perhaps, 
 he was beginning to think the storms 
 had all blown over; but, after all, this encounter 
 comes, which is sharper than any yet. 
 Note, Many former trials will not supersede 
 nor secure us from further trials; we have not 
 yet put off the harness, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:11">1 Kings xx. 11</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:6,7">Ps. xxx. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The author of the trial: <I>God</I> tempted 
 him, not to draw him to sin, so Satan tempts 
 (if Abraham had sacrificed Isaac, he would 
 not have sinned, his orders would have justified 
 him, and borne him out), but to discover 
 his graces, how strong they were, that 
 they might be <I>found to praise, and honour, 
 and glory,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.
 Thus God tempted 
 Job, that he might appear not only a good 
 man, but a great man. <I>God did tempt Abraham;</I> 
 he did <I>lift up Abraham,</I> so some read 
 it; as a scholar that improves well is lifted 
 up, when he is put into a higher form. Note, 
 Strong faith is often exercised with strong 
 trials and put upon hard services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The trial itself. God appeared to him 
 as he had formerly done, called him by name, 
 <I>Abraham,</I> that name which had been given 
 him in ratification of the promise. Abraham, 
 like a good servant, readily answered, "<I>Here
 am I;</I> what says my Lord unto his servant?" 
 Probably he expected some renewed promise 
 like those,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1"><I>ch.</I> xv. 1</A>,
 and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1</A>.
 But, to his
 great amazement, that which God has to say
 to him is, in short, <I>Abraham, Go kill thy son;</I>
 and this command is given him in such aggravating 
 language as makes the temptation 
 abundantly more grievous. When God 
 speaks, Abraham, no doubt, takes notice of 
 every word, and listens attentively to it; and 
 every word here is a sword in his bones: the 
 trial is steeled with trying phrases. Is it any 
 pleasure to the Almighty that he should 
 afflict? No, it is not; yet, when Abraham's 
 faith is to be tried, God seems to take pleasure 
 in the aggravation of the trial,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The person to be offered. 
 
 (1.) "<I>Take
 thy son,</I> not thy bullocks and thy lambs;" 
 how willingly would Abraham have parted 
 with them by thousands to redeem Isaac! 
 
 <A NAME="Page137"> </A>

 "No, <I>I will take no bullock out of thy house,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:9">Ps. l. 9</A>.
 I must have thy son: not thy servant, 
 no, not the steward of thy house, that 
 shall not serve the turn; I must have thy 
 son." Jephthah, in pursuance of a vow, 
 offered a daughter; but Abraham must offer 
 his son, in whom the family was to be built up. 
 "Lord, let it be an adopted son;" "No, 
 
 (2.) <I>Thy only son;</I> thy only son by <I>Sarah.</I>" Ishmael 
 was lately cast out, to the grief of Abraham; 
 and now Isaac only was left, and must 
 he go too? Yes, 
 
 (3.) "Take <I>Isaac,</I> him, 
 by name, <I>thy laughter,</I> that <I>son indeed,</I>"
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:19"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 19</A>.
 Not "Send for Ishmael back, and 
 offer him;" no, it must be Isaac. "But, 
 Lord, I love Isaac, he is to me as my own 
 soul. Ishmael is not, and wilt thou take Isaac 
 also? All this is against me:" Yea, 
 
 (4.) That 
 son <I>whom thou lovest.</I> It was a trial of Abraham's 
 love to God, and therefore it must be 
 in a beloved son, and that string must be 
 touched most upon: in the Hebrew it is 
 expressed more emphatically, and, I think, 
 might very well be read thus: <I>Take now that 
 son of thine, that only one of thine, whom thou 
 lovest, that Isaac.</I> God's command must 
 overrule all these considerations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The place: <I>In the land of Moriah,</I> three 
 days' journey off; so that he might have 
 time to consider it, and, if he did it, must do 
 it deliberately, that it might be a service the 
 more reasonable and the more honourable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The manner: <I>Offer him for a burnt-offering.</I> 
 He must not only kill his son, but 
 kill him as a sacrifice, kill him devoutly, kill him 
 by rule, kill him with all that pomp and 
 ceremony, with all that sedateness and composure 
 of mind, with which he used to offer 
 his burnt-offerings.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And Abraham rose up early in the 
 morning, and saddled his ass, and took 
 two of his young men with him, and 
 Isaac his son, and clave the wood for 
 the burnt offering, and rose up, and 
 went unto the place of which God had 
 told him.
 &nbsp; 4 Then on the third day 
 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw 
 the place afar off.
 &nbsp; 5 And Abraham 
 said unto his young men, Abide ye 
 here with the ass; and I and the lad 
 will go yonder and worship, and come 
 again to you.
 &nbsp; 6 And Abraham took 
 the wood of the burnt offering, and 
 laid <I>it</I> upon Isaac his son; and he took 
 the fire in his hand, and a knife; and 
 they went both of them together.
 &nbsp; 7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his 
 father, and said, My father: and he 
 said, Here <I>am</I> I, my son. And he said, 
 Behold the fire and the wood: but 
 where <I>is</I> the lamb for a burnt offering?
 &nbsp; 8 And Abraham said, My son, 
 God will provide himself a lamb for
 a burnt offering: so they went both 
 of them together.
 &nbsp; 9 And they came 
 to the place which God had told him 
 of; and Abraham built an altar there, 
 and laid the wood in order, and bound 
 Isaac his son, and laid him on the 
 altar upon the wood.
 &nbsp; 10 And Abraham 
 stretched forth his hand, and 
 took the knife to slay his son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Abraham's obedience to this 
 severe command. <I>Being tried, he offered up 
 Isaac,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:17">Heb. xi. 17</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The difficulties which he broke through 
 in this act of obedience. Much might have 
 been objected against it; as, 1. It seemed 
 directly against an antecedent law of God, 
 which forbids murder, under a severe penalty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:5,6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 5, 6</A>.
 Now can the unchangeable God 
 contradict himself? He that hates robbery 
 for burnt-offering 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:8">Isa. lxi. 8</A>)
 cannot delight 
 in murder for it. 
 
 2. How would it consist 
 with natural affection to his own son? It 
 would be not only murder, but the worst of 
 murders. Cannot Abraham be obedient but 
 he must be unnatural? If God insist upon 
 a human sacrifice, is there none but Isaac to 
 be the offering, and none but Abraham to be 
 the offerer? Must the father of the faithful 
 be the monster of all fathers? 
 
 3. God gave 
 him no reason for it. When Ishmael was to 
 be cast out, a just cause was assigned, which 
 satisfied Abraham; but here Isaac must die, 
 and Abraham must kill him, and neither the 
 one nor the other must know why or wherefore. 
 If Isaac had been to die a martyr for 
 the truth, or his life had been the ransom of 
 some other life more precious, it would have 
 been another matter; or if he had died as a
 criminal, a rebel against God or his parents, 
 as in the case of the idolater 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:8,9">Deut. xiii. 8, 9</A>),
 or the stubborn son 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:18,19">Deut. xxi. 18, 19</A>),
 it might have passed as a sacrifice to justice. 
 But the case is not so: he is dutiful, obedient, 
 hopeful, son. "Lord, what profit is 
 there in his blood?" 
 
 4. How would this 
 consist with the promise? Was it not said 
 that in <I>Isaac shall thy seed be called?</I> But 
 what comes of that seed, if this pregnant bud 
 be broken off so soon? 
 
 5. How should he 
 ever look Sarah in the face again? With 
 what face can he return to her and his family 
 with the blood of Isaac sprinkled on his 
 garments and staining all his raiment? 
 "<I>Surely a bloody husband hast thou been to
 me</I>" would Sarah say (as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:25,26">Exod. iv. 25, 26</A>),
 and it would be likely to alienate her affections 
 for ever both from him and from his 
 God. 
 
 6. What would the Egyptians say, 
 and the Canaanites and the Perizzites who 
 dwelt then in the land? It would be an 
 eternal reproach to Abraham, and to his 
 altars. "Welcome nature, if this be grace." 
 These and many similar objection might 
 have been made; but he was infallibly assured 
 
 <A NAME="Page138"> </A>

 that it was indeed a command of God and 
 not a delusion, and this was sufficient to 
 answer them all. Note, God's commands 
 must not be disputed, but obeyed; we must 
 not consult with flesh and blood about them 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15,16">Gal. i. 15, 16</A>),
 but with a gracious obstinacy 
 persist in our obedience to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The several steps of obedience, all 
 which help to magnify it, and to show that 
 he was guided by prudence, and governed by 
 faith, in the whole transaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He rises early,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Probably the command 
 was given in the visions of the night, 
 and early the next morning he set himself 
 about the execution of it--did not delay, did 
 not demur, did not take time to deliberate; 
 for the command was peremptory, and would 
 not admit a debate. Note, Those that do 
 the will of God heartily will do it speedily; 
 while we delay, time is lost and the heart 
 hardened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gets things ready for a sacrifice, 
 and, as if he himself had been a Gibeonite, 
 it should seem, with his own hands he cleaves 
 the wood for the burnt-offering, that it might 
 not be to seek when the sacrifice was to be 
 offered. Spiritual sacrifices must thus be 
 prepared for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is very probable that he said nothing 
 about it to Sarah. This is a journey which she 
 must know nothing of, lest she prevent it. 
 There is so much in our own hearts to hinder 
 our progress in duty that we have need, as 
 much as may be, to keep out of the way of 
 other hindrances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He carefully looked about him, to discover 
 the place appointed for this sacrifice, 
 to which God had promised by some sign to 
 direct him. Probably the direction was given 
 by an appearance of the divine glory in the 
 place, some pillar of fire reaching from heaven 
 to earth, visible at a distance, and to which 
 he pointed when he said
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 "We will go 
 yonder, where you see the light, and worship."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He left his servants at some distance 
 off
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 lest they should interpose, and 
 create him some disturbance in his strange 
 oblation; for Isaac was, no doubt, the 
 darling of the whole family. Thus, when 
 Christ was entering upon his agony in the 
 garden, he took only three of his disciples 
 with him, and left the rest at the garden 
 door. Note, It is our wisdom and duty, 
 when we are going to worship God, to lay 
 aside all those thoughts and cares which may 
 divert us from the service, leave them at the 
 bottom of the hill, that we may attend on the 
 Lord without distraction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He obliged Isaac to carry the wood 
 (both to try his obedience in a smaller matter 
 first, and that he might typify Christ, who 
 carried his own cross, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:17">John xix. 17</A>),
 while he himself, though he knew what he did, 
 with a steady and undaunted resolution carried 
 the fatal knife and fire,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Note, 
 Those that through grace are resolved upon 
 the substance of any service or suffering for 
 God must overlook the little circumstances 
 which make it doubly difficult to flesh and 
 blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Without any ruffle or disorder, he talks 
 it over with Isaac, as if it had been but a 
 common sacrifice that he was going to offer,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was a very affecting question that 
 Isaac asked him, as they were going together: 
 <I>My father,</I> said Isaac; it was a 
 melting word, which, one would think, 
 would strike deeper into the breast of Abraham 
 than his knife could into the breast of
 Isaac. He might have said, or thought, at 
 least, "Call me not thy father who am now 
 to be thy murderer; can a father be so barbarous, 
 so perfectly lost to all the tenderness 
 of a father?" Yet he keeps his temper, and 
 keeps his countenance, to admiration; he 
 calmly waits for his son's question, and this 
 is it: <I>Behold the fire and the wood, but where 
 is the lamb?</I> See how expert Isaac was in 
 the law and custom of sacrifices. This it is 
 to be well-catechised: this is, 
 
 [1.] A trying 
 question to Abraham. How could he endure 
 to think that Isaac was himself the lamb? 
 So it is, but Abraham, as yet, dares not tell 
 him so. Where God knows the faith to be 
 armour of proof, he will laugh at <I>the trial of 
 the innocent,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:23">Job ix. 23</A>.

 [2.] It is a teaching 
 question to us all, that, when we are going 
 to worship God, we should seriously consider 
 whether we have every thing ready, especially 
 the lamb for a burnt-offering. Behold, 
 the fire is ready, the Spirit's assistance and 
 God's acceptance; the wood is ready, the instituted 
 ordinances designed to kindle our 
 affections (which indeed, without the Spirit, 
 are but like wood without fire, but the Spirit 
 works by them); <I>all things are now ready,</I> 
 but where is the lamb? Where is the heart? 
 Is that ready to be offered up to God, to 
 ascend to him as a burnt-offering?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was a very prudent answer which 
 Abraham gave him: <I>My son, God will provide 
 himself a lamb.</I> This was the language, 
 either, 
 
 [1.] Of his obedience. "We must 
 offer the lamb which God has appointed now 
 to be offered;" thus giving him this general 
 rule of submission to the divine will, to prepare 
 him for the application of it to himself 
 very quickly. Or, 
 
 [2.] Of his faith. Whether 
 he meant it so or not, this proved to be 
 the meaning of it; a sacrifice was provided 
 instead of Isaac. Thus, <I>First,</I> Christ, the 
 great sacrifice of atonement, was of God's 
 providing; when none in heaven or earth 
 could have found a lamb for that burnt-offering, 
 God himself found the ransom, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:20">Ps. lxxxix. 20</A>.
 <I>Secondly,</I> All our sacrifices 
 of acknowledgment are of God's providing 
 too. It is he that prepares the heart, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>.
 The broken and contrite spirit is a 
 sacrifice of God 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:17">Ps. li. 17</A>),
 of his providing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. With the same resolution and composedness 
 of mind, after many thoughts of 
 heart, he applies himself to the completing 
 
 <A NAME="Page139"> </A>

 of this sacrifice,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 He goes on with 
 a holy wilfulness, after many a weary step, 
 and with a heavy heart he arrives at length 
 at the fatal place, builds the altar (an altar 
 of earth, we may suppose, the saddest that 
 ever he built, and he had built many a one), 
 lays the wood in order for his Isaac's funeral 
 pile, and now tells him the amazing news: 
 "Isaac, thou art the lamb which God has 
 provided." Isaac, for aught that appears, is 
 as willing as Abraham; we do not find that 
 he raised any objection against it, that he 
 petitioned for his life, that he attempted to 
 make his escape, much less that he struggled 
 with his aged father, or made any resistance: 
 Abraham does it, God will have it 
 done, and Isaac has learnt to submit to 
 both, Abraham no doubt comforting him 
 with the same hopes with which he himself 
 by faith was comforted. Yet it is necessary 
 that a sacrifice be bound. The great sacrifice, 
 which in the fullness of time was to be 
 offered up, must be bound, and therefore so 
 must Isaac. But with what heart could 
 tender Abraham tie those guiltless hands, 
 which perhaps had often been lifted up to 
 ask his blessing, and stretched out to embrace 
 him, and were now the more straitly 
 bound with the cords of love and duty! 
 However, it must be done. Having bound 
 him, he lays him upon the altar, and his hand 
 upon the head of his sacrifice; and now, we 
 may suppose, with floods of tears, he gives, 
 and takes, the final farewell of a parting 
 kiss: perhaps he takes another for Sarah 
 from her dying son. This being done, he 
 resolutely forgets the bowels of a father, and 
 puts on the awful gravity of a sacrificer. 
 With a fixed heart, and an eye lifted up to 
 heaven, he takes the knife, and stretches out 
 his hand to give a fatal cut to Isaac's 
 throat. Be astonished, O heavens! at this; 
 and wonder, O earth! Here is an act of faith 
 and obedience, which deserves to be a spectacle 
 to God, angels, and men. Abraham's 
 darling, Sarah's laughter, the church's hope, 
 the heir of promise, lies ready to bleed and 
 die by his own father's hand, who never 
 shrinks at the doing of it. Now this obedience 
 of Abraham in offering up Isaac is a 
 lively representation, 
 
 (1.) Of the love of God 
 to us, in delivering up his only-begotten Son 
 to suffer and die for us, as a sacrifice. It 
 <I>pleased the Lord</I> himself to <I>bruise him.</I> See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10,Zec+13:7">Isa. liii. 10; Zech. xiii. 7</A>.
 Abraham was 
 obliged, both in duty and gratitude, to part 
 with Isaac, and parted with him to a friend; 
 but God was under no obligations to us, for 
 we were enemies. 
 
 (2.) Of our duty to God, 
 in return for that love. We must tread in 
 the steps of this faith of Abraham. God, by 
 his word, calls us to part with all for Christ,--all 
 our sins, though they have been as a 
 right hand, or a right eye, or an Isaac--all 
 those things that are competitors and rivals 
 with Christ for the sovereignty of the heart 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>);
 and we must cheerfully let 
 them all go. God, by his providence, which 
 is truly the voice of God, calls us to part 
 with an Isaac sometimes, and we must do it

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called 
 unto him out of heaven, and said, 
 Abraham, Abraham: and he said, 
 Here <I>am</I> I.
 &nbsp; 12 And he said, Lay not 
 thine hand upon the lad, neither do
 thou any thing unto him: for now I 
 know that thou fearest God, seeing 
 thou hast not withheld thy son, thine 
 only <I>son</I> from me.
 &nbsp; 13 And Abraham 
 lifted up his eyes, and looked, and 
 behold behind <I>him</I> a ram caught in a 
 thicket by his horns: and Abraham
 went and took the ram, and offered 
 him up for a burnt offering in the 
 stead of his son.
 &nbsp; 14 And Abraham 
 called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: 
 as it is said <I>to</I> this day, In the 
 mount of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> it shall be seen.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto this story has been very melancholy, 
 and seemed to hasten towards a most 
 tragical period; but here the sky suddenly 
 clears up, the sun breaks out, and a bright 
 and pleasant scene opens. The same hand 
 that had wounded and cast down here heals 
 and lifts up; for, though he cause grief, he 
 will have compassion. <I>The angel of the Lord,</I> 
 that is, God himself, the eternal Word, the 
 angel of the covenant, who was to be the 
 great Redeemer and comforter, he interposed, 
 and gave a happy issue to this trial.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Isaac is rescued,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 The command 
 to offer him was intended only for trial, 
 and it appearing, upon trial, that Abraham 
 did indeed love God better than he loved Isaac, 
 the end of the command was answered; and 
 therefore the order is countermanded, without 
 any reflection at all upon the unchangeableness 
 of the divine counsels: <I>Lay not thy 
 hand upon the lad.</I> Note, 
 
 1. Our creature-comforts
 are most likely to be continued to us when
 we are most willing to resign them up to
 God's will.

 2. God's time to help and relieve 
 his people is when they are brought to 
 the greatest extremity. The more imminent 
 the danger is, and the nearer to be put in 
 execution, the more wonderful and the more 
 welcome is the deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abraham is not only approved, but applauded. 
 He obtains an honourable testimony 
 that he is righteous: <I>Now know I that 
 thou fearest God.</I> God knew it before, but 
 now Abraham had given a most memorable 
 evidence of it. He needed do no more; 
 what he had done was sufficient to prove the 
 religious regard he had to God and his authority. 
 Note, 
 
 1. When God, by his providence, 
 hinders the performance of our sincere 
 intentions in his services, he graciously 
 
 <A NAME="Page140"> </A>

 accepts the will for the deed, and the honest
 endeavour, though it come short of finishing. 
 
 2. The best evidence of our fearing God is 
 our being willing to serve and honour him
 with that which is dearest to us, and to part 
 with all to him or for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another sacrifice is provided instead 
 of Isaac,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Now that the altar was built, 
 and the wood laid in order, it was necessary 
 that something should be offered. For, 
 
 1. God must be acknowledged with thankfulness 
 for the deliverance of Isaac; and the 
 sooner the better, when here is an altar 
 ready. 
 
 2. Abraham's words must be made 
 good: <I>God will provide himself a lamb.</I> God 
 will not disappoint those expectations of his 
 people which are of his own raising; but 
 according to their faith it is to them. <I>Thou 
 shalt decree a thing, and it shall be established.</I> 
 
 3. Reference must be had to the 
 promised Messiah, the blessed seed. 
 
 (1.) Christ was sacrificed in our stead, as this ram 
 instead of Isaac, and his death was our discharge. 
 "<I>Here am I</I> (said he,) <I>let these go
 their way.</I>" 
 
 (2.) Though that blessed seed 
 was lately promised, and now typified by 
 Isaac, yet the offering of him up should be 
 suspended till the latter end of the world: 
 and in the mean time the sacrifice of beasts 
 should be accepted, as this ram was, as a 
 pledge of that expiation which should one 
 day be made by that great sacrifice. And it 
 is observable that the temple, the place of 
 sacrifice, was afterwards built upon this 
 mount Moriah 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:1">2 Chron. iii. 1</A>);
 and mount Calvary, where Christ was crucified, was not 
 far off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A new name is given to the place, to 
 the honour of God, and for the encouragement 
 of all believers, to the end of the world, 
 cheerfully to trust in God in the way of 
 obedience: <I>Jehovah-jireh, The Lord will provide</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 probably alluding to what he had 
 said
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 <I>God will provide himself a lamb.</I> 
 It was not owing to any contrivance of 
 Abraham, nor was it in answer to his prayer, 
 though he was a distinguished intercessor; 
 but it was purely the Lord's doing. Let it 
 be recorded for the generations to come, 
 
 1. That <I>the Lord will see;</I> he will always have 
 his eye upon his people in their straits and 
 distresses, that he may come in with seasonable 
 succour in the critical juncture. 
 
 2. That he will <I>be seen,</I> be seen <I>in the mount,</I> in 
 the greatest perplexities of his people. He 
 will not only manifest, but magnify, his wisdom, 
 power, and goodness, in their deliverance. 
 Where God sees and provides, he 
 should be seen and praised. And, perhaps, 
 it may refer to <I>God manifest in the flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called 
 unto Abraham out of heaven the second 
 time,
 &nbsp; 16 And said, By myself 
 have I sworn, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for because 
 thou hast done this thing, and 
 hast not withheld thy son, thine only 
 <I>son:</I>
 &nbsp; 17 That in blessing I will bless 
 thee, and in multiplying I will multiply 
 thy seed as the stars of the heaven, 
 and as the sand which <I>is</I> upon 
 the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess
 the gate of his enemies;
 &nbsp; 18 And 
 in thy seed shall all the nations of the 
 earth be blessed; because thou hast 
 obeyed my voice.
 &nbsp; 19 So Abraham returned 
 unto his young men, and they 
 rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; 
 and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abraham's obedience was graciously accepted; 
 but this was not all: here we have 
 it recompensed, abundantly recompensed, 
 before he stirred from the place; probably 
 while the ram he had sacrificed was yet burning 
 God sent him this gracious message, renewed 
 and ratified his covenant with him. 
 All covenants were made by sacrifice, so was 
 this by the typical sacrifices of Isaac and the 
 ram. Very high expressions of God's favour 
 to Abraham are employed in this confirmation 
 of the covenant with him, expressions 
 exceeding any he had yet been blessed with. 
 Note, Extraordinary services shall be crowned 
 with extraordinary honours and comforts; 
 and favours in the promise, though not yet 
 performed, ought to be accounted real and 
 valuable recompences. Observe, 1. God is 
 pleased to make mention of Abraham's 
 obedience as the consideration of the covenant; 
 and he speaks of it with an encomium: 
 <I>Because thou hast done this thing, and hast 
 not withheld thy son, thine only son,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 He lays a strong emphasis on this, and 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)
 praises it as an act of obedience: in it 
 thou hast <I>obeyed my voice,</I> and to obey is 
 better than sacrifice. Not that this was a 
 proportionable consideration, but God graciously 
 put this honour upon that by which 
 Abraham had honoured him. 
 
 2. God now 
 confirmed the promise with an oath. It was 
 said and sealed before; but now it is sworn: 
 <I>By myself have I sworn;</I> for he could swear 
 by no greater, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:13">Heb. vi. 13</A>.
 Thus he interposed 
 himself by an oath, as the apostle expresses 
 it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17">Heb. vi. 17</A>.
 He did (to speak 
 with reverence) even pawn his own life and 
 being upon it (<I>As I live,</I>) that by all those 
 immutable things, in which it was impossible 
 for God to lie, he and his might have strong 
 consolation. Note, If we exercise faith, God 
 will encourage it. Improve the promises, 
 and God will ratify them. 
 
 3. The particular 
 promise here renewed is that of a numerous 
 offspring: <I>Multiplying, I will multiply thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 Note, Those that are willing to part 
 with any thing for God shall have it made up 
 to them with unspeakable advantage. Abraham 
 has but one son, and is willing to part 
 
 <A NAME="Page141"> </A>

 with that one, in obedience to God. "Well," 
 said God, "thou shalt be recompensed with 
 thousands and millions." What a figure 
 does the seed of Abraham make in history! 
 How numerous, how illustrious, were his 
 known descendants, who, to this day, triumph 
 in this, that they have Abraham to their 
 father! Thus he received a thousand-fold in 
 this life, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:29">Matt. xix. 29</A>.

 4. The promise, 
 doubtless, points at the Messiah, and the 
 grace of the gospel. This is the oath sworn 
 to our father Abraham, which Zacharias refers 
 to, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:73-75">Luke i. 73</A>,
 &c. And so here is a 
 promise, 
 
 (1.) Of the great blessing of the 
 Spirit: <I>In blessing, I will bless thee,</I> namely, 
 with that best of blessings the gift of the 
 Holy Ghost; the promise of the Spirit was 
 that blessing of Abraham which was to come 
 upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.

 (2.) Of the increase of the church, 
 that believers, his spiritual seed, should be 
 numerous as the stars of heaven. 
 
 (3.) Of 
 spiritual victories: <I>Thy seed shall possess the 
 gate of his enemies.</I> Believers, by their faith, 
 overcome the world, and triumph over all the 
 powers of darkness, and are more than conquerors. 
 Probably Zacharias refers to this 
 part of the oath 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74">Luke i. 74</A>),
 <I>That we, being 
 delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might 
 serve him without fear.</I> But the crown of all 
 is the last promise. 
 
 (4.) Of the incarnation 
 of Christ: <I>In thy seed,</I> one particular person 
 that shall descend from thee (for he speaks 
 not of many, but of one, as the apostle observes, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16">Gal. iii. 16</A>),
 <I>shall all the nations of 
 the earth be blessed,</I> or shall <I>bless themselves,</I> 
 as the phrase is, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:16">Isa. lxv. 16</A>.
 In him all 
 may be happy if they will, and all that belong 
 to him shall be so, and shall think 
 themselves so. Christ is the great blessing 
 of the world. Abraham was ready to give 
 up his son for a sacrifice to the honour of 
 God, and, on that occasion, God promised 
 to give his Son a sacrifice for the salvation 
 of man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And it came to pass after these 
 things, that it was told Abraham, 
 saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also 
 born children unto thy brother Nahor;
 &nbsp; 21 Huz his first born, and Buz 
 his brother, and Kemuel the father of 
 Aram,
 &nbsp; 22 And Chesed, and Hazo, 
 and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
 &nbsp; 23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these 
 eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's 
 brother.
 &nbsp; 24 And his concubine, 
 whose name <I>was</I> Reumah, she 
 bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and 
 Thahash, and Maachah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is recorded here, 
 
 1. To show that 
 though Abraham saw his own family highly 
 dignified with peculiar privileges, admitted 
 into covenant, and blessed with the entail of 
 the promise, yet he did not look with contempt 
 and disdain upon his relations, but 
 was glad to hear of the increase and prosperity 
 of their families. 
 
 2. To make way for 
 the following story of the marriage of Isaac 
 to Rebekah, a daughter of this family.</P>
