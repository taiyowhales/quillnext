 M<FONT SIZE=-1>OSES</FONT> (the <I>servant of the Lord</I> in writing for 
 him as well as in acting for him--with the pen of
 God as well as with the rod of God in his hand) 
 having, in the first book of his history, preserved 
 and transmitted the records of the church, while 
 it existed in private families, comes, in this 
 second book, to give us an account of its growth 
 into a great nation; and, as the former furnishes 
 us with the best economics, so this with 
 the best politics. The beginning of the former 
 book shows us how God formed the world for 
 himself; the beginning of this shows us how he 
 formed Israel for himself, and both to show 
 forth his praise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:21">Isa. xliii. 21</A>.
 There we have the 
 creation of the world in history, here the redemption 
 of the world in type. The Greek translators 
 called this book <I>Exodus</I> (which signifies 
 a <I>departure</I> or <I>going out</I>) because it begins with 
 the story of the going out of the children of 
 Israel from Egypt. Some allude to the names of 
 this and the foregoing book, and observe that 
 immediately after <I>Genesis,</I> which signifies the 
 <I>beginning</I> or <I>original,</I> follows <I>Exodus,</I> which 
 signifies <I>a departure;</I> for a time to be born is 
 immediately succeeded by a time to die. No 
 sooner have we made our entrance into the world 
 than we must think of making our exit, and 
 going out of the world. When we begin to live 
 we begin to die. The forming of Israel into 
 a people was a new creation. As the earth was, 
 in the beginning, first fetched from under water, 
 and then beautified and replenished, so Israel 
 was first by an almighty power made to emerge 
 out of Egyptian slavery, and then enriched with 
 God's law and tabernacle. This book gives us, 
 
 I. The accomplishment of the promises made 
 before to Abraham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:1-19:25"><I>ch.</I> i.-xix.</A>),
 and then,
 
 II. The establishment of the ordinances which 
 were afterwards observed by Israel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:1-40:38"><I>ch.</I> xx.-xl.</A>
 Moses, in this book, begins, like C&aelig;sar, 
 to write his own Commentaries; nay, a greater, 
 a far greater, than C&aelig;sar is here. But henceforward 
 the penman is himself the hero, and 
 gives us the history of those things of which he 
 was himself an eye and ear-witness, <I>et quorum pars 
 magna fuit--and in which he bore a conspicuous 
 part.</I> There are more types of Christ 
 in this book than perhaps in any other book of
 the Old Testament; for Moses wrote of him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:46">John v. 46</A>.
 The way of man's reconciliation to 
 God, and coming into covenant and communion 
 with him by a Mediator, is here variously represented; 
 and it is of great use to us for the illustration 
 of the New Testament, now that we have 
 that to assist us in the explication of the Old.</P>
