 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Marriages and funerals are the changes of families, and the common
 news among the inhabitants of the villages. In the foregoing 
 chapter we had Abraham burying his wife, here we have him 
 marrying his son. These stories concerning his family, with 
 their minute circumstances, are largely related, while the histories 
 of the kingdoms of the world then in being, with their revolutions, 
 are buried in silence; for the Lord knows those that are 
 his. The subjoining of Isaac's marriage to Sarah's funeral (with 
 a particular reference to  it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:67">ver. 67</A>)
 shows us that as "one generation 
 passes away another generation comes;" and thus the 
 entail both of the human nature, and of the covenant, is preserved. 
 Here is, 
 
 I. Abraham's care about the marrying of his 
 son, and the charge he gave to his servant about it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.
 
 II. His servant's journey into Abraham's country, to seek a wife 
 for his young master among his own relations,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.
 
 III. The kind providence which brought him acquainted with Rebekah, 
 whose father was Isaac's cousin-german,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:15-28">ver. 15-28</A>.
 
 IV. The treaty of marriage with her relations,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:29-49">ver. 29-49</A>.
 
 V. Their 
 consent obtained,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:50-60">ver. 50-60</A>.
 
 VI. The happy meeting and marriage 
 between Isaac and Rebekah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:61-67">ver. 61</A>,
 &c.).</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Abraham was old, <I>and</I> well 
 stricken in age: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 had blessed Abraham in all things.
 &nbsp; 2 And Abraham said unto his eldest 
 servant of his house, that ruled over 
 all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy 
 hand under my thigh:
 &nbsp; 3 And I will 
 make thee swear by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the 
 God of heaven, and the God of the 
 earth, that thou shalt not take a wife 
 unto my son of the daughters of the 
 Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
 &nbsp; 4 But thou shalt go unto my country, 
 and to my kindred, and take a wife 
 unto my son Isaac.
 &nbsp; 5 And the servant 
 said unto him, Peradventure the 
 woman will not be willing to follow 
 me unto this land: must I needs bring
 thy son again unto the land from 
 whence thou camest?
 &nbsp; 6 And Abraham 
 said unto him, Beware thou that 
 thou bring not my son thither again.
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of heaven, which 
 took me from my father's house, and 
 from the land of my kindred, and 
 which spake unto me, and that sware 
 unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will 
 I give this land; he shall send his 
 angel before thee, and thou shalt take 
 a wife unto my son from thence.
 &nbsp; 8 And if the woman will not be willing 
 to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear 
 from this my oath: only bring not 
 my son thither again.
 &nbsp; 9 And the servant 
 put his hand under the thigh of 
 Abraham his master, and sware to 
 him concerning that matter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things we may observe here concerning 
 Abraham:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The care he took of a good son, to get 
 him married, well married. It was high time 
 to think of it now, for Isaac was about forty 
 years old, and it had been customary with his 
 ancestors to marry at thirty, or sooner,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:14,18,22,24"><I>ch.</I> xi. 14, 18, 22, 24</A>.
 Abraham believed the promise 
 of the building up of his family, and 
 therefore did not make haste; not more haste 
 than good speed. Two considerations moved 
 him to think of it now
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):--

 1. That he 
 himself was likely to leave the world quickly, 
 for he was <I>old, and well-stricken in age,</I> and 
 it would be a satisfaction to him to see his 
 son settled before he died; and, 
 
 2. That he 
 
 <A NAME="Page145"> </A>

 had a good estate to leave behind him, for 
 <I>the Lord had blessed him in all things;</I> and 
 the blessing of the Lord makes rich. See
 how much religion and piety befriend outward 
 prosperity. Now Abraham's pious care 
 concerning his son was, 
 
 (1.) That he should 
 not marry a daughter of Canaan, but one of 
 his kindred. He saw that the Canaanites 
 were degenerating into great wickedness, and 
 knew by revelation that they were designed 
 for ruin, and therefore he would not marry 
 his son among them, lest they should be 
 either a snare to his soul, or at least a blot to 
 his name. 
 
 (2.) That yet he should not leave 
 the land of Canaan, to go himself among his 
 kindred, not even for the purpose of choosing 
 a wife, lest he should be tempted to settle 
 there. This caution is given
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,
 and repeated,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 "<I>Bring not my son thither
 again,</I> whatever comes of it. Let him rather 
 want a wife than expose himself to that 
 temptation." Note, Parents in disposing of 
 their children, should carefully consult the 
 welfare of their souls, and their furtherance 
 in the way to heaven. Those who through 
 grace have escaped the corruption that is in 
 the world through lust, and have brought up 
 their children accordingly, should take heed 
 of doing any thing by which they may be 
 again entangled therein and overcome, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:20">2 Pet. ii. 20</A>.
 Beware that you bring them not 
 thither again, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:15">Heb. xi. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The charge he gave to a good servant, 
 probably Eliezer of Damascus, one of whose 
 conduct, fidelity, and affection to him and his 
 family, he had had long experience. He 
 trusted him with this great affair, and not 
 Isaac himself, because he would not have 
 Isaac go at all into that country, but marry 
 there by proxy; and no proxy so fit as this 
 <I>steward of his house.</I> This matter is settled 
 between the master and the servant with a 
 great deal of care and solemnity. 
 
 1. The 
 servant must be bound by an oath to do his 
 utmost to get a wife for Isaac from among 
 his relations,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 Abraham swears him 
 to it, both for his own satisfaction and for 
 the engagement of his servant to all possible 
 care and diligence in this matter. Thus God 
 swears his servants to their work, that, having 
 sworn, they may perform it. Honour is here 
 done to the eternal God; for he it is that 
 is sworn by, to whom alone these appeals 
 ought to be made. And some think honour 
 is done to the covenant of circumcision by 
 the ceremony here used of <I>putting his hand 
 under his thigh.</I> Note, Swearing being an 
 ordinance not peculiar to the church, but 
 common to mankind, is to be performed by 
 such signs as are the appointments and common 
 usages of our country, for binding the 
 person sworn. 
 
 2. He must be clear of this 
 oath if, when he had done his utmost, he 
 could not prevail. This proviso the servant 
 prudently inserted
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 putting the case 
 that the woman would not follow him; and 
 Abraham allowed the exception,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Note, 
 Oaths are to be taken with great caution, and 
 the matter sworn to should be rightly understood 
 and limited, because it is a <I>snare to 
 devour that which is holy, and, after vows, to 
 make the enquiry</I> which should have been 
 made before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The confidence he put in a good God, 
 who, he doubts not, will give his servant success 
 in this undertaking,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 He remembers 
 that God had wonderfully brought him
 out of the land of his nativity, by the effectual 
 call of his grace; and therefore doubts not 
 but he will succeed him in his care not to 
 bring his son thither again. He remembers 
 also the promise God had made and confirmed 
 to him that he would give Canaan to his 
 seed, and thence infers that God would own 
 him in his endeavours to match his son, not 
 among those devoted nations, but to one that 
 was fit to be the mother of such a seed. 
 "Fear not therefore; he shall send his angel 
 before thee to make thy way prosperous." 
 Note, 
 
 1. Those that carefully keep in the 
 way of duty, and govern themselves by the 
 principles of their religion in their designs 
 and undertakings, have good reason to expect 
 prosperity and success in them. God 
 will cause that to issue in our comfort in 
 which we sincerely aim at his glory. 
 
 2. God's promises, and our own experiences, 
 are sufficient to encourage our dependence 
 upon God, and our expectations from him, 
 in all the affairs of this life. 
 
 3. God's angels 
 are ministering spirits, sent forth, not only 
 for the protection, but for the guidance, of 
 the heirs of promise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb. i. 14</A>.
 "<I>He shall
 send his angel before thee,</I> and then thou wilt 
 speed well."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the servant took ten camels 
 of the camels of his master, and departed; 
 for all the goods of his master 
 <I>were</I> in his hand: and he arose, and 
 went to Mesopotamia, unto the city 
 of Nahor.
 &nbsp; 11 And he made his camels 
 to kneel down without the city by a
 well of water at the time of the evening, 
 <I>even</I> the time that women go out 
 to draw <I>water.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And he said, O 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my master Abraham, I 
 pray thee, send me good speed this 
 day, and show kindness unto my master
 Abraham.
 &nbsp; 13 Behold, I stand 
 <I>here</I> by the well of water; and the
 daughters of the men of the city come 
 out to draw water:
 &nbsp; 14 And let it come 
 to pass, that the damsel to whom 
 I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I 
 pray thee, that I may drink; and she
 shall say, Drink, and I will give thy 
 camels drink also: <I>let the same be</I> she 
 <I>that</I> thou hast appointed for thy servant 
 
 <A NAME="Page146"> </A>

 Isaac; and thereby shall I know 
 that thou hast showed kindness unto
 my master.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, 
 before he had done speaking, that,
 behold, Rebekah came out, who was 
 born to Bethuel, son of Milcah,
 the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, 
 with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
 &nbsp; 16 And the damsel <I>was</I> very fair to 
 look upon, a virgin, neither had any 
 man known her: and she went down 
 to the well, and filled her pitcher, and 
 came up.
 &nbsp; 17 And the servant ran 
 to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
 thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
 &nbsp; 18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and 
 she hasted, and let down her pitcher 
 upon her hand, and gave him drink.
 &nbsp; 19 And when she had done giving 
 him drink, she said, I will draw <I>water</I> 
 for thy camels also, until they have 
 done drinking.
 &nbsp; 20 And she hasted, 
 and emptied her pitcher into the 
 trough, and ran again unto the well to 
 draw <I>water,</I> and drew for all his camels.
 &nbsp; 21 And the man wondering at her held 
 his peace, to wit whether the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 had made his journey prosperous or 
 not.
 &nbsp; 22 And it came to pass, as the 
 camels had done drinking, that the man 
 took a golden earring of half a shekel 
 weight, and two bracelets for her hands 
 of ten <I>shekels</I> weight of gold;
 &nbsp; 23 And 
 said, Whose daughter <I>art</I> thou? tell 
 me, I pray thee: is there room <I>in</I> 
 thy father's house for us to lodge in?
 &nbsp; 24 And she said unto him, I <I>am</I> the 
 daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, 
 which she bare unto Nahor.
 &nbsp; 25 She 
 said moreover unto him, We have 
 both straw and provender enough, and 
 room to lodge in.
 &nbsp; 26 And the man 
 bowed down his head, and worshipped 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27 And he said, Blessed 
 <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my master Abraham,
 who hath not left destitute my 
 master of his mercy and his truth: I 
 <I>being</I> in the way, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> led me to 
 the house of my master's brethren.
 &nbsp; 28 And the damsel ran, and told <I>them 
 of</I> her mother's house these things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abraham's servant now begins to make a 
 figure in this story; and, though he is not 
 named, yet much is here recorded to his 
 honour, and for an example to all servants, 
 who shall be honoured if, by faithfully serving 
 God and their masters, they adorn the
 doctrine of Christ (compare 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:18,Tit+2:10">Prov. xxvii. 18 with Titus ii. 10</A>);
 for there is no respect of persons with God,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:24,25">Col. iii. 24, 25</A>.
 A good 
 servant that makes conscience of the duty of 
 his place, and does it in the fear of God, 
 though he make not a figure in the world nor 
 have praise of men, yet shall be owned and 
 accepted of God and have praise of him. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How faithful Abraham's servant approved 
 himself to his master. Having received 
 his charge, he with all expedition set 
 out on his journey, with an equipage suitable 
 to the object of his negotiation
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 <I>and he had all the goods of his master,</I> that is, a 
 schedule or particular account of them, <I>in 
 his hand,</I> to show to those with whom he was 
 to treat; for, from first to last, he consulted 
 his master's honour. Isaac being a type of 
 Christ, some make this fetching of a wife for 
 him to signify the espousing of the church by 
 the agency of his servants the ministers. The 
 church is the bride, the Lamb's wife, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:9">Rev. xxi. 9</A>.
 Christ is the bridegroom, and ministers 
 are the friends of the bridegroom 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>),
 whose work it is to persuade souls to
 consent to him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:2">2 Cor. xi. 2</A>.
 The spouse of 
 Christ must not be of the Canaanites, but of 
 his own kindred, born again from above. 
 Ministers, like Abraham's servant, must lay 
 out themselves with the utmost wisdom and 
 care to serve their master's interest herein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How devoutly he acknowledged God 
 in this affair, like one of that happy household 
 which Abraham had <I>commanded to keep 
 the way of the Lord,</I> &c.,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 19</A>.
 He arrived early in the evening (after many days' 
 journeying) at the place of his destination, 
 and reposed himself by a well of water, to 
 consider how he might manage his business 
 for the best. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He acknowledges God by a particular 
 prayer
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>),
 wherein, 
 
 (1.) He petitions 
 for prosperity and good success in this affair: 
 <I>Send me good speed, this day.</I> Note, We 
 have leave to be particular in recommending 
 our affairs to the conduct and care of the 
 divine Providence. Those that would have 
 good speed must pray for it. <I>This day, in 
 this affair;</I> thus we must, in all our ways, 
 acknowledge God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:6">Prov. iii. 6</A>.
 And, if we 
 thus look up to God in every undertaking 
 which we are in care about, we shall have the 
 comfort of having done our duty, whatever 
 the issue be. 
 
 (2.) He pleads God's covenant 
 with his master Abraham: <I>O God of my 
 master Abraham, show kindness to him.</I> Note, 
 As the children of good parents, so the servants 
 of good masters, have peculiar encouragement 
 in the prayers they offer to God 
 for prosperity and success. 
 
 (3.) He proposes a sign
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 not by it to limit God, nor with 
 a design to proceed no further if he were not 
 gratified in it; but it is a prayer, 
 
 [1.] That 
 God would provide a good wife for his young 
 
 <A NAME="Page147"> </A>

 master, and this was a good prayer. He 
 knew that <I>a prudent wife is from the Lord</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:14">Prov. xix. 14</A>),
 and therefore that for this 
 he will be enquired of. He desires that his 
 master's wife might be a humble and industrious
 woman, bred up to care and labour, 
 and willing to put her hand to any work that 
 was to be done; and that she might be of 
 a courteous disposition, and charitable to 
 strangers. When he came to seek a wife for 
 his master, he did not go to the playhouse or 
 the park, and pray that he might meet one 
 there, but to <I>the well of water,</I> expecting to 
 find one there well employed. 
 
 [2.] That he 
 would please to make his way, in this matter, 
 plain and clear before him, by the concurrence 
 of minute circumstances in his favour. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> It is the comfort, as well as the belief, 
 of a good man, that God's providence extends 
 itself to the smallest occurrences and admirably 
 serves its own purposes by them. Our 
 times are in God's hand; not only events 
 themselves, but the times of them. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 It is our wisdom, in all our affairs, to follow 
 Providence, and folly to force it. <I>Thirdly,</I> It 
 is very desirable, and that which we may 
 lawfully pray for, while in the general we set 
 God's will before us as our rule, that he will, 
 by hints of providence, direct us in the way 
 of our duty, and give us indications what his 
 mind is. Thus he guides his people with
 his eye 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps. xxxii. 8</A>),
 and leads them in a 
 plain path, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:11">Ps. xxvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God owns him by a particular providence. 
 He decreed the thing, and it was 
 established to him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:28">Job xxii. 28</A>.
 According 
 to his faith, so was it unto him. The answer 
 to this prayer was, 
 
 (1.) Speedy--<I>before he 
 had made an end of speaking</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 as it is 
 written 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>), 
 <I>While they are yet 
 speaking, I will hear.</I> Though we are backward 
 to pray, God is forward to hear prayer. 
 
 (2.) Satisfactory: the first that came to draw 
 water was, and did, in every thing, according 
 to his own heart. 
 
 [1.] She was so well 
 qualified that in all respects she answered 
 the characters he wished for in the woman 
 that was to be his master's wife, handsome 
 and healthful, humble and industrious, very 
 courteous and obliging to a stranger, and 
 having all the marks of a good disposition. 
 When she came to the well
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 she went 
 down and <I>filled her pitcher, and came up</I> to 
 go home with it. She did not stand to gaze 
 upon the strange man and his camels, but 
 minded her business, and would not have 
 been diverted from it but by an opportunity 
 of doing good. She did not curiously nor 
 confidently enter into discourse with him, 
 but modestly answered him, with all the decorum 
 that became her sex. What a degenerate 
 age do we live in, in which appear all the 
 instances of pride, luxury, and laziness, the 
 reverse of Rebekah's character, whose daughters 
 few are! Those instances of goodness 
 which were then in honour are now in contempt. 
 
 [2.] Providence so ordered it that 
 she did that which exactly answered to his 
 sign, and was wonderfully the counterpart of 
 his proposal: she not only gave him drink, 
 but, which was more than could have been 
 expected, she offered her services to give his 
 camels drink, which was the very sign he 
 proposed. Note, <I>First,</I> God, in his providence, 
 does sometimes wonderfully own the 
 prayer of faith, and gratify the innocent desires 
 of his praying people, even in little 
 things, that he may show the extent of his 
 care, and may encourage them at all times to 
 seek to him and trust in him; yet we must 
 take heed of being over-bold in prescribing 
 to God, lest the event should weaken our 
 faith rather than strengthen it. <I>Secondly,</I> It 
 is good to take all opportunities of showing 
 a humble, courteous, charitable, disposition, 
 because, some time or other, it may turn more 
 to our honour and benefit than we think of; 
 some hereby have entertained angels, and 
 Rebekah hereby, quite beyond her expectation 
 at this time, was brought into the line 
 of Christ and the covenant. <I>Thirdly,</I> There 
 may be a great deal of obliging kindness in 
 that which costs but little: our Saviour has 
 promised a reward for a cup of cold water, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:42">Matt. x. 42</A>.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> The concurrence of 
 providences and their minute circumstances, 
 for the furtherance of our success in any 
 business, ought to be particularly observed, 
 with wonder and thankfulness, to the glory 
 of God: <I>The man wondered,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 We have 
 been wanting to ourselves, both in duty and 
 in comfort, by neglecting to observe Providence. 
 
 [3.] Upon enquiry he found, to his 
 great satisfaction, that she was a near relation 
 to his master, and that the family she was of 
 was considerable, and able to give him entertainment,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.
 Note, Providence sometimes 
 wonderfully directs those that by faith 
 and prayer seek direction from heaven in the 
 choice of suitable yoke-fellows: happy marriages 
 those are likely to be that are made in 
 the fear of God; and these, we are sure, are 
 made in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He acknowledges God in a particular 
 thanksgiving. He first paid his respects to 
 Rebekah, in gratitude for her civility
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 obliging her with such ornaments and attire 
 as a maid, especially a bride, cannot forget 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:32">Jer. ii. 32</A>),
 which yet, we should think, ill
 suited the <I>pitcher of water;</I> but the ear-rings
 and bracelets she sometimes wore did not 
 make her think herself above the labours of 
 a virtuous woman 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:13">Prov. xxxi. 13</A>),
 who <I>works 
 willingly with her hands;</I> nor the services of 
 a child, who, while <I>under age, differs nothing 
 from a servant,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1">Gal. iv. 1</A>.
 Having done 
 this, he turns his wonder
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)
 into worshipping: <I>Blessed be the Lord God of my 
 master Abraham,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 Observe here, 
 
 (1.) He had prayed for good speed
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>), 
 and now that he had sped well he gives 
 thanks. Note, What we win by prayer we 
 must wear with praise; for mercies in answer 
 to prayer lay us under particular obligations. 
 
 <A NAME="Page148"> </A>

 (2.) He had as yet but a comfortable prospect 
 of mercy, and was not certain what the 
 issue might prove; yet he gives thanks. 
 Note, When God's favours are coming towards 
 us we must meet them with our praises. 
 
 (3.) He blesses God for success when he was 
 negotiating for his master. Note, We should 
 be thankful for our friend's mercies as for 
 our own. 
 
 (4.) He gives thanks that, being 
 in the way, at a loss what course to steer, the 
 Lord had led him. Note, In doubtful cases, 
 it is very comfortable to see God leading us, 
 as he led Israel in the wilderness by the pillar 
 of cloud and fire. 
 
 (5.) He thinks himself 
 very happy, and owns God in it, that he was 
 led to the <I>house of his master's brethren,</I> those 
 of them that had come out of Ur of the Chaldees, 
 though they had not come to Canaan, 
 but remained in Haran. They were not 
 idolaters, but worshippers of the true God, 
 and inclinable to the religion of Abraham's 
 family. Note, God is to be acknowledged 
 in providing suitable yoke-fellows, especially 
 such as are agreeable in religion. 
 
 (6.) He 
 acknowledges that God, herein, had not left 
 his master <I>destitute of his mercy and truth.</I> 
 God had promised to build up Abraham's 
 family, yet it seemed destitute of the benefit 
 of that promise; but now Providence is working 
 towards the accomplishing of it. Note, 
 
 [1.] God's faithful ones, how destitute soever 
 they may be of worldly comforts, shall never 
 be left destitute of God's mercy and truth; 
 for God's mercy is an inexhaustible fountain, 
 and his truth an inviolable foundation. 
 
 [2.] It adds much to the comfort of any blessing 
 to see in it the continuance of God's mercy 
 and truth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And Rebekah had a brother, and 
 his name <I>was</I> Laban: and Laban ran 
 out unto the man, unto the well.
 &nbsp; 30 And it came to pass, when he saw 
 the earring and bracelets upon his 
 sister's hands, and when he heard the 
 words of Rebekah his sister, saying, 
 Thus spake the man unto me; that 
 he came unto the man; and, behold, 
 he stood by the camels at the well.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed 
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; wherefore standest thou 
 without? for I have prepared the 
 house, and room for the camels.
 &nbsp; 32 And the man came into the house: 
 and he ungirded his camels, and gave 
 straw and provender for the camels, 
 and water to wash his feet, and the 
 men's feet that <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 33 And there was set <I>meat</I> before him to 
 eat: but he said, I will not eat, until 
 I have told mine errand. And he 
 said, Speak on.
 &nbsp; 34 And he said, I 
 <I>am</I> Abraham's servant.
 &nbsp; 35 And the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath blessed my master greatly; 
 and he is become great: and he hath 
 given him flocks, and herds, and silver, 
 and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, 
 and camels, and asses.
 &nbsp; 36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son 
 to my master when she was old: and 
 unto him hath he given all that he 
 hath.
 &nbsp; 37 And my master made me 
 swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
 wife to my son of the daughters of 
 the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
 &nbsp; 38 But thou shalt go unto my father's 
 house, and to my kindred, and take a 
 wife unto my son.
 &nbsp; 39 And I said unto 
 my master, Peradventure the woman 
 will not follow me.
 &nbsp; 40 And he said 
 unto me, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, before whom I 
 walk, will send his angel with thee, 
 and prosper thy way; and thou shalt 
 take a wife for my son of my kindred, 
 and of my father's house:
 &nbsp; 41 Then 
 shalt thou be clear from <I>this</I> my oath, 
 when thou comest to my kindred; 
 and if they give not thee <I>one,</I> thou 
 shalt be clear from my oath.
 &nbsp; 42 And 
 I came this day unto the well, and said, 
 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my master Abraham, 
 if now thou do prosper my way which 
 I go:
 &nbsp; 43 Behold, I stand by the well 
 of water; and it shall come to pass, 
 that when the virgin cometh forth to 
 draw <I>water,</I> and I say to her, Give 
 me, I pray thee, a little water of thy 
 pitcher to drink;
 &nbsp; 44 And she say to 
 me, Both drink thou, and I will also 
 draw for thy camels: <I>let</I> the same <I>be</I> 
 the woman whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath appointed 
 out for my master's son.
 &nbsp; 45 And before I had done speaking in 
 mine heart, behold, Rebekah came 
 forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; 
 and she went down unto the well, and 
 drew <I>water</I>: and I said unto her, Let 
 me drink, I pray thee.
 &nbsp; 46 And she 
 made haste, and let down her pitcher 
 from her <I>shoulder,</I> and said, Drink, 
 and I will give thy camels drink also: 
 so I drank, and she made the camels 
 drink also.
 &nbsp; 47 And I asked her, and 
 said, Whose daughter <I>art</I> thou? And
 she said, The daughter of Bethuel, 
 Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto 
 him: and I put the earring upon her 
 face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

 <A NAME="Page148"> </A>

 &nbsp; 48 And I bowed down my head, and 
 worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and blessed 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my master Abraham, 
 which had led me in the right 
 way to take my master's brother's 
 daughter unto his son.
 &nbsp; 49 And now 
 if ye will deal kindly and truly with 
 my master, tell me: and if not, tell 
 me; that I may turn to the right 
 hand, or to the left.
 &nbsp; 50 Then Laban 
 and Bethuel answered and said, The 
 thing proceedeth from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: we 
 cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
 &nbsp; 51 Behold, Rebekah <I>is</I> before thee, 
 take <I>her,</I> and go, and let her be thy 
 master's son's wife, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath 
 spoken.
 &nbsp; 52 And it came to pass, that, 
 when Abraham's servant heard their 
 words, he worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, 
 <I>bowing himself</I> to the earth.
 &nbsp; 53 And 
 the servant brought forth jewels of 
 silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, 
 and gave <I>them</I> to Rebekah: he gave 
 also to her brother and to her mother 
 precious things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the making up of the 
 marriage between Isaac and Rebekah. It is 
 related very largely and particularly, even to 
 the minute circumstances, which, we should 
 think, might have been spared, while other 
 things of great moment and mystery (as the
 story of Melchizedek) are related in few words. 
 Thus God conceals that which is curious 
 from the wise and prudent, reveals to babes 
 that which is common and level to their capacity
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25">Matt. xi. 25</A>),
 and rules and <I>saves the 
 world by the foolishness of preaching,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21">1 Cor. i. 21</A>.
 Thus also we are directed to take notice 
 of God's providence in the little common 
 occurrences of human life, and in them also 
 to exercise our own prudence and other 
 graces; for the scripture was not intended 
 for the use of philosophers and statesmen 
 only, but to make us all wise and virtuous 
 in the conduct of ourselves and families. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The very kind reception given to Abraham's 
 servant by Rebekah's relations. Her 
 brother Laban went to invite and conduct 
 him in, but not till he saw the <I>ear-rings and 
 the bracelets upon his sister's hands,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 "O," thinks Laban, "here is a man that 
 there is something to be got by, a man that 
 is rich and generous; we will be sure to 
 bid him welcome!" We know so much of 
 Laban's character, by the following story, as 
 to think that he would not have been so free 
 of his entertainment if he had not hoped to 
 be well paid for it, as he was,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.
 Note, 
 <I>A man's gift maketh room for him</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:16">Prov. xviii. 16</A>),
 <I>which way soever it turneth, it prospereth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:8">Prov. xvii. 8</A>.

 1. The invitation was kind: 
 <I>Come in, thou blessed of the Lord,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 They saw he was rich, and therefore pronounced 
 him <I>blessed of the Lord;</I> or, perhaps, 
 because they heard from Rebekah
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)
 of the gracious words which proceeded out of 
 his mouth, they concluded him a good man, 
 and therefore <I>blessed of the Lord.</I> Note, 
 Those that are blessed of God should be 
 welcome to us. It is good owning those 
 whom God owns. 
 
 2. The entertainment was kind,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.
 Both the house and stable 
 were well furnished, and Abraham's servant 
 was invited to the free use of both. Particular 
 care was taken of the camels; for a <I>good man 
 regardeth the life of his beast,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:10">Prov. xii. 10</A>.
 If the ox knows his owner to serve him, the 
 owner should know his ox to provide for him 
 that which is fitting for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The full account which he gave them 
 of his errand, and the court he made to them 
 for their consent respecting Rebekah. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How intent he was upon his business; 
 though he had come off a journey, and come 
 to a good house, he would <I>not eat, till he had 
 told his errand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 Note, The doing of 
 our work, and the fulfilling of our trusts, 
 either for God or man, should be preferred 
 by us before our necessary food: it was our 
 Saviour's meat and drink, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34">John iv. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How ingenious he was in the management 
 of it; he approved himself, in this 
 matter, both a prudent man and a man of 
 integrity, faithful to his master by whom he 
 was trusted, and just to those with whom he 
 now treated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gives a short account of the state 
 of his master's family,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:34-36"><I>v.</I> 34-36</A>.
 He was 
 welcome before, but we may suppose him 
 doubly welcome when he said, <I>I am Abraham's 
 servant.</I> Abraham's name, no doubt, 
 was well known among them and respected, 
 and we might suppose them not altogether 
 ignorant of his state, for Abraham knew 
 theirs,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:20-24"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 20-24</A>.
 Two things he 
 suggests, to recommend his proposal:--
 
 [1.] That his master Abraham, through the blessing 
 of God, had a very good estate; and, 
 
 [2.] That he had settled it all upon Isaac, for 
 whom he was now a suitor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He tells them the charge his master 
 had given him, to fetch a wife for his son 
 from among his kindred, with the reason of 
 it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.
 Thus he insinuates a pleasing 
 hint, that, though Abraham had removed to 
 a country at so great a distance, yet he still 
 retained the remembrance of his relations 
 that he had left behind, and a respect for 
 them. The highest degrees of divine affection 
 must not divest us of natural affection. 
 He likewise obviates an objection, That, if 
 Isaac were deserving, he needed not send so 
 far off for a wife: why did he not marry 
 nearer home? "For a good reason," says 
 he; "my master's son must not match with 
 a Canaanite." He further recommends his 
 
 <A NAME="Page150"> </A>

 proposal, 
 
 [1.] From the faith his master had 
 that it would succeed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 Abraham took 
 encouragement from the testimony of his 
 conscience that he <I>walked before God</I> in a 
 regular course of holy living, and thence inferred 
 that God would prosper him; probably 
 he refers to that covenant which God had 
 made with him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1</A>),
 <I>I am God, all-sufficient, 
 walk before me.</I> Therefore, says 
 he <I>the God before whom I walk will send his 
 angel.</I> Note, While we make conscience of 
 our part of the covenant, we may take the 
 comfort of God's part of it; and we should 
 learn to apply general promises of particular 
 cases, as there is occasion. 
 
 [2.] From the 
 care he himself had taken to preserve their 
 liberty of giving or refusing their consent, as 
 they should see cause, without incurring the 
 guilt of perjury
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:39-41"><I>v.</I> 39-41</A>),
 which showed 
 him, in general, to be a cautious man, and 
 particularly careful that their consent might 
 not be forced, but be either free or not at all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He relates to them the wonderful concurrence 
 of providences, to countenance and 
 further the proposal, plainly showing the 
 finger of God in it. 
 
 [1.] He tells them how he 
 had prayed for direction by a sign,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:42-44"><I>v.</I> 42-44</A>.
 Note, It is good dealing with those who by 
 prayer take God along with them in their 
 dealings. 
 
 [2.] How God had answered his 
 prayer in the very letter of it. Though he 
 did but <I>speak in his heart</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),
 which perhaps 
 he mentions, lest it should be suspected 
 that Rebekah had overheard his prayer and 
 designedly humoured it. "No," says he, 
 "I spoke <I>it in my heart,</I> so that none heard 
 it but God, to whom thoughts are word, and
 from him the answer came,"
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>.
 
 [3.] How he had immediately acknowledged God's 
 goodness to him therein, <I>leading him,</I> as he 
 here expresses it, <I>in the right way.</I> Note, 
 God's way is always the <I>right way</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:7">Ps. cvii. 7</A>),
 and those are well led whom he leads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He fairly refers the matter to their 
 consideration, and waits their decision
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):
 "<I>If you will deal kindly and truly with
 my master,</I> well and good: if you will be sincerely 
 kind, you will accept the proposal, 
 and I have what I came for; if not, do not 
 hold me in suspense." Note, Those who 
 deal fairly have reason to expect fair dealing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) They freely and cheerfully close with 
 the proposal upon a very good principle
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):
 "<I>The thing proceedeth from the Lord,</I>
 Providence smiles upon it, and we have 
 nothing to say against it." They do not 
 object distance of place, Abraham's forsaking 
 them, or his having no land in possession, 
 but personal estate only: they do not question 
 the truth of what this man said; but, 
 [1.] They trust much to his integrity. It were 
 well if honesty did so universally prevail 
 among men that it might be as much an 
 act of prudence as it is of good nature to 
 take a man's word. 
 
 [2.] They trust more to 
 God's providence, and therefore by silence 
 give consent, because it appears to be directed 
 and disposed by Infinite Wisdom. Note, A 
 marriage is then likely to be comfortable 
 when it appears to proceed from the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Abraham's servant makes a thankful 
 acknowledgment of the good success he had 
 met with, 
 
 [1.] To God: <I>He worshipped the 
 Lord,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.
 Observe, <I>First,</I> As his good 
 success went on, he went on to bless God. 
 Those that <I>pray without ceasing</I> should <I>in 
 every thing give thanks,</I> and own God in every 
 step of mercy. <I>Secondly,</I> God sent his angel 
 before him, and so gave him success,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:7,40"><I>v.</I> 7, 40</A>.
 But when he has the desired success, he worships 
 God, not the angel. Whatever benefit 
 we have by the ministration of angels, all the 
 glory must be given to the Lord of the 
 angels, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:9">Rev. xxii. 9</A>.
 
 [2.] He pays his respects 
 to the family also, and particularly to 
 the bride,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.
 He presented her, and her 
 mother, and brother, with many precious 
 things, both to give a real proof of his 
 master's riches and generosity and in gratitude 
 for their civility to him, and further to 
 ingratiate himself with them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>54 And they did eat and drink, he 
 and the men that <I>were</I> with him, and 
 tarried all night; and they rose up in 
 the morning, and he said, Send me 
 away unto my master.
 &nbsp; 55 And her 
 brother and her mother said, Let the 
 damsel abide with us <I>a few</I> days, at 
 the least ten; after that she shall go.
 &nbsp; 56 And he said unto them, Hinder 
 me not, seeing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath prospered 
 my way; send me away that I 
 may go to my master.
 &nbsp; 57 And they 
 said, We will call the damsel, and 
 enquire at her mouth.
 &nbsp; 58 And they 
 called Rebekah, and said unto her, 
 Wilt thou go with this man? And 
 she said, I will go.
 &nbsp; 59 And they sent 
 away Rebekah their sister, and her 
 nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his 
 men.
 &nbsp; 60 And they blessed Rebekah, 
 and said unto her, Thou <I>art</I> our sister, 
 be thou <I>the mother</I> of thousands 
 of millions, and let thy seed possess 
 the gate of those which hate them.
 &nbsp; 61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, 
 and they rode upon the camels, 
 and followed the man: and the servant 
 took Rebekah, and went his way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Rebekah is here taking leave of her father's 
 house; and 
 
 1. Abraham's servant presses for 
 a dismission. Though he and his company 
 were very welcome, and very cheerful there, 
 yet he said, <I>Send me away</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),
 and again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.
 He knew his master would expect 
 him home with some impatience; he had 
 business to do at home which wanted him, 
 
 <A NAME="Page151"> </A>

 and therefore, as one that preferred his work 
 before his pleasure, he was for hastening 
 home. Note, Lingering and loitering no way 
 become a wise and good man; when we have 
 despatched our business abroad we must not 
 delay our return to our business at home, 
 nor be longer from it than needs must; for 
 as a bird that <I>wanders from her nest so is he 
 that wanders from his place,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:8">Prov. xxvii. 8</A>.

 2. Rebekah's relations, from natural affection 
 and according to the usual expression of 
 kindness in that case, solicit for her stay 
 some time among them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.
 They could 
 not think of parting with her on a sudden, 
 especially as she was about to remove so far
 off and it was not likely that they would ever
 see one another again: <I>Let her stay a few
 days, at least ten,</I> which makes it as reasonable 
 a request as the reading in the margin 
 seems to make it unreasonable, <I>a year,</I> or <I>at 
 least ten months.</I> They had consented to the 
 marriage, and yet were loth to part with her. 
 Note, It is an instance of the vanity of this 
 world that there is nothing in it so agreeable 
 but it has its alloy. <I>Nulla est sincera voluptas--There 
 is no unmingled pleasure.</I> They 
 were pleased that they had matched a daughter 
 of their family so well, and yet, when it 
 came to the last, it was with great reluctance 
 that they sent her away. 
 
 3. Rebekah herself 
 determined the matter. To her they appealed, 
 as it was fit they should
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):
 <I>Call 
 the damsel</I> (who had retired to her apartment 
 with a modest silence) and <I>enquire at her 
 mouth.</I> Note, As children ought not to 
 marry without their parents' consent, so parents 
 ought not to marry them without their 
 own. Before the matter is resolved on, 
 "Ask at the damsel's mouth;" she is a 
 party principally concerned, and therefore 
 ought to be principally consulted. Rebekah 
 consented, not only to go, but to go immediately: 
 <I>I will go,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.
 We may hope that 
 the notice she had taken of the servant's 
 piety and devotion gave her such an idea of 
 the prevalence of religion and godliness in 
 the family she was to go to made her desirous 
 to hasten thither, and willing to forget 
 her own people and her father's house, where 
 religion had not so much the ascendant. 
 
 4. Hereupon she is sent away with Abraham's 
 servant; not, we may suppose, the very next 
 day after, but very quickly: her friends see 
 that she has a good heart on it, and so they 
 dismiss her, 
 
 (1.) With suitable attendants--her
 <I>nurse</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>),
 her <I>damsels,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.
 It seems, 
 then, that when she went to the well for 
 water it was not because she had not servants 
 at command, but because she took a pleasure 
 in works of humble industry. Now that she 
 was going among strangers, it was fit she 
 should take those with her with whom she 
 was acquainted. Here is nothing said of her 
 portion. Her personal merits were a portion 
 in her, she needed none with her, nor did that 
 ever come into the treaty of marriage. 
 
 (2.) With hearty good wishes: <I>They blessed Rebekah,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.
 Note, When our relations are 
 entering into a new condition, we ought by 
 prayer to recommend them to the blessing 
 and grace of God. Now that she was going 
 to be a wife, they prayed that she might be 
 a mother both of a numerous and of a victorious 
 progeny. Perhaps Abraham's servant 
 had told them of the promise God had 
 lately made to his master, which it is likely, 
 Abraham acquainted his household with, that 
 God <I>would multiply his seed as the stars of 
 heaven, and that they should possess the gate 
 of their enemies</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 17</A>),
 to which promise 
 they had an eye in this blessing, <I>Be 
 thou the mother</I> of that seed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>62 And Isaac came from the way 
 of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in 
 the south country.
 &nbsp; 63 And Isaac 
 went out to meditate in the field at 
 the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, 
 and saw, and, behold, the camels <I>were</I> 
 coming.
 &nbsp; 64 And Rebekah lifted up 
 her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
 lighted off the camel.
 &nbsp; 65 For she <I>had</I> 
 said unto the servant, What man <I>is</I> 
 this that walketh in the field to meet 
 us? And the servant <I>had</I> said, It <I>is</I> 
 my master: therefore she took a veil, 
 and covered herself.
 &nbsp; 66 And the servant 
 told Isaac all things that he had 
 done.
 &nbsp; 67 And Isaac brought her into 
 his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, 
 and she became his wife; and 
 he loved her: and Isaac was comforted 
 after his mother's <I>death.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Isaac and Rebekah are, at length, happily 
 brought together. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Isaac was well employed when he met 
 Rebekah: <I>He went out to meditate,</I> or pray, 
 <I>in the field, at the even-tide,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:62,63"><I>v.</I> 62, 63</A>.
 Some 
 think he expected the return of his servants 
 about this time, and went out on purpose to 
 meet them. But, it should seem, he went 
 out on another errand, to take the advantage of 
 a silent evening and a solitary field for meditation 
 and prayer, those divine exercises 
 by which we converse with God and our 
 own hearts. Note, 
 
 1. Holy souls love retirement. 
 It will do us good to be often left 
 alone, walking alone and sitting alone; and, 
 if we have the art of improving solitude, we 
 shall find we are never less alone than when 
 alone. 
 
 2. Meditation and prayer ought to 
 be both our business and our delight when 
 we are alone; while we have a God, a Christ, 
 and a heaven, to acquaint ourselves with, and 
 to secure our interest in, we need not want 
 matter either for meditation or prayer, which, 
 if they go together, will mutually befriend 
 each other. 
 
 3. Our walks in the field are
 then truly pleasant when in them we apply 
 ourselves to meditation and prayer. We 
 
 <A NAME="Page152"> </A>

 there have a free and open prospect of the 
 heavens above us and the earth around us, 
 and the host and riches of both, by the view 
 of which we should be led to the contemplation 
 of the Maker and owner of all. 
 
 4. The exercises 
 of devotion should be the refreshment 
 and entertainment of the evening, to 
 relieve us from the fatigue occasioned by the 
 care and business of the day, and to prepare 
 us for the repose and sleep of the night. 
 
 5. Merciful providences are then doubly comfortable 
 when they find us well employed and 
 in the way of our duty. Some think Isaac 
 was now praying for good success in this 
 affair that was depending, and meditating 
 upon that which was proper to encourage his 
 hope in God concerning it; and now, when 
 he sets himself, as it were, upon his watch-tower, 
 to see what God would answer him, 
 as the prophet 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>),
 <I>he sees the camels 
 coming.</I> Sometimes God sends in the mercy 
 prayed for immediately, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12">Acts xii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Rebekah behaved herself very becomingly, 
 when she met Isaac: understanding 
 who he was, she <I>alighted off her camel</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>),
 and <I>took a veil, and covered herself</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>),
 in token of humility, modesty, and subjection. 
 She did not reproach Isaac for not 
 coming himself to fetch her, or, at least, to 
 meet her a day's journey or two, did not 
 complain of the tediousness of her journey, 
 or the difficulty of leaving her relations, to 
 come into a strange place; but, having seen 
 Providence going before her in the affair, she 
 accommodates herself with cheerfulness to 
 her new relation. Those that by faith are 
 espoused to Christ, and would be presented 
 as chaste virgins to him, must, in conformity 
 to his example, humble themselves, as Rebekah, 
 who alighted when she saw Isaac on 
 foot, and must put themselves into subjection 
 to him who is their head 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:24">Eph. v. 24</A>),
 as Rebekah, signifying it by the veil she put 
 on, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:10">1 Cor. xi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They were brought together (probably 
 after some further acquaintance), to their 
 mutual comfort,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>.
 Observe here, 
 
 1. What an affectionate son he was to his 
 mother: it was about three years since her 
 death, and yet he was not, till now, comforted 
 concerning it; the wound which that 
 affliction gave to his tender spirit bled so 
 long, and was never healed till God brought 
 him into this new relation. Thus crosses and 
 comforts are balances to each other 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>), 
 and help to keep the scale even.
 
 2. What an affectionate husband he was to his 
 wife. Note, Those that have approved themselves 
 well in one relation, it may be hoped, 
 will do so in another: <I>She became his wife, 
 and he loved her;</I> there was all the reason in 
 the world why he should, for so <I>ought men to 
 love their wives even an themselves.</I> The duty 
 of the relation is then done, and the comfort 
 of the relation is then enjoyed, when mutual 
 love governs; for <I>there the Lord commands 
 the blessing.</I></P>
