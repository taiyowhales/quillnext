 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God having set up house (as it were) in the midst of the camp of 
 Israel, the princes of Israel here come a visiting with their presents, 
 as tenants to their landlord, in the name of their respective tribes.
 
 I. They brought presents, 

 1. Upon the dedication of the tabernacle, for the service of that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 2. Upon the dedication of the altar, for the use of that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:10-88">ver. 10-88</A>.

 And, 

 II. God graciously signified his acceptance of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:89">ver. 89</A>.

 The two foregoing chapters were the records of additional laws which
 God gave to Israel, this is the history of the additional services 
 which Israel performed to God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up
 the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
 the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
 thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;
 &nbsp; 2 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
 fathers, who <I>were</I> the princes of the tribes, and were over them
 that were numbered, offered:
 &nbsp; 3 And they brought their offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, six covered
 waggons, and twelve oxen; a waggon for two of the princes, and for
 each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 5 Take <I>it</I> of them, that they may be to do the service of the
 tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the
 Levites, to every man according to his service.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses took the waggons and the oxen, and gave them unto
 the Levites.
 &nbsp; 7 Two waggons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
 according to their service:
 &nbsp; 8 And four waggons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
 Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar
 the son of Aaron the priest.
 &nbsp; 9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
 of the sanctuary belonging unto them <I>was that</I> they should bear
 upon their shoulders.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the offering of the princes to the service of the tabernacle.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When it was; not till it was <I>fully set up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 When all things were done both about the tabernacle itself, and the 
 camp of Israel which surrounded it, according to the directions given, 
 then they began their presents, probably about the eighth day of the 
 second month. Note, Necessary observances must always take place of 
 free-will offerings: first those, and then these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Who it was that offered: <I>The princes of Israel, heads of the 
 house of their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, Those that are above others in power and dignity ought to go 
 before others, and endeavour to go beyond them, in every thing that is 
 good. The more any are advanced the more is expected from them, on 
 account of the greater opportunity they have of serving God and their 
 generation. What are wealth and authority good for, but as they enable 
 a man to do so much the more good in the world?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was offered: six wagons, with each of them a yoke of oxen to 
 draw them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Doubtless these wagons were agreeable to the rest of the furniture of 
 the tabernacle and its appurtenances, the best of the kind, like the 
 carriages which great princes use when they go in procession. Some 
 think that God, by Moses, intimated to them what they should bring, or 
 their own consideration perhaps suggested to them to make this present. 
 Though God's wisdom had ordained all the essentials of the tabernacle, 
 yet it seems these accidental conveniences were left to be provided by 
 their own discretion, which was to set in order that which was wanting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit. i. 5</A>),

 and these wagons were not refused, though no pattern of them was shown
 to Moses in the mount. Note, It must not be expected that the divine
 institution of ordinances should descend to all those circumstances 
 which are determinable, and are fit to be left alterable, by human 
 prudence, that wisdom which is profitable to direct. Observe, No sooner 
 is the tabernacle fully set up than this provision is made for the 
 removal of it. Note, Even when we are but just settled in the world, 
 and think we are beginning to take root, we must be preparing for 
 changes and removes, especially for the great change. While we are here 
 in this world, every thing must be accommodated to a militant and 
 movable state. When the tabernacle was framing, the princes were very 
 generous in their offerings, for then they brought <I>precious stones, 
 and stones to be set</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:27">Exod. xxxv. 27</A>), 

 yet now they bring more presents. Note, Those that have done good
 should study to abound therein yet more and more, and not be <I>weary 
 of well-doing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How the offering was disposed of, and what use was made of it: the
 wagons and oxen were given to the Levites, to be used in carrying the 
 tabernacle, both for their ease (for God would not have any of his 
 servants overburdened with work), and for the more safe and right 
 conveyance of the several parts of the tabernacle, which would be best 
 kept together, and sheltered from the weather, in wagons. 

 1. The Gershonites, that had the light carriage, the curtains and
 hangings, had but two wagons, and two yoke of oxen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 when they had loaded these, they must carry the rest, if any remained, 
 upon their shoulders.

 2. The Merarites, that had the heavy carriage, and that which was most
 unwieldy, the boards, pillars, sockets, &c., had four wagons, and four 
 yoke of oxen allotted them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 and yet, if they had not more wagons of their own, they would be 
 obliged to carry a great deal upon their backs too, for the silver 
 sockets alone weighed 100 talents, which was above four tons, and that 
 was enough to load four wagons that were drawn but by one yoke of oxen 
 a-piece. But each socket being a talent weight, which is about a man's 
 burden (as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:23">2 Kings v. 23</A>)

 probably they carried those on their backs, and put the boards and
 pillars into the wagons. Observe here, How God wisely and graciously
 ordered the most strength to those that had the most work. Each had
 wagons <I>according to their service.</I> Whatever burden God in his 
 providence lays upon us, he will by his sufficient grace proportion the 
 strength to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.

 3. The Kohathites, that had the most sacred carriage, had no wagons at
 all, because they were to carry their charge upon their shoulders 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 with a particular care and veneration. When in David's time they 
 carried the ark in a cart, God made them to know to their terror, by 
 the death of Uzza, that they did not <I>seek him in the due order.</I>

 &nbsp; 78 On the twelfth day Ahira the son of Enan, prince of the

 &nbsp; 86 The golden spoons <I>were</I> twelve, full of incense, <I>weighing</I>
 ten <I>shekels</I> apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary: all the
 gold of the spoons <I>was</I> an hundred and twenty <I>shekels.</I>
 &nbsp; 87 All the oxen for the burnt offering <I>were</I> twelve bullocks,
 the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their
 meat offering: and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve.
 &nbsp; 88 And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings
 <I>were</I> twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats
 sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. This <I>was</I> the

 &nbsp; 89 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the
 congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
 speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that <I>was</I> upon the ark
 of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the great solemnity of dedicating the 
 altars, both that of burnt-offerings and that of incense; they had been 
 sanctified before, when they were anointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:10,11">Lev. viii. 10, 11</A>),

 but now they were handselled, as it were, by the princes, with their
 free-will offerings. They began the use of them with rich presents, 
 great expressions of joy and gladness, and extraordinary respect to 
 those tokens of God's presence with them. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the princes and great men were first and forwardest in the 
 service of God. Those that are entitled to precedency should go before 
 in good works, and that is true honour. Here is an example to the 
 nobility and gentry, those that are in authority and of the first rank 
 in their country; they ought to improve their honour and power, their 
 estate and interest, for the promoting of religion, and the service of 
 God, in the places where they live. It is justly expected that those 
 who have more than others should do more good than others with what 
 they have, else they are unfaithful stewards, and will not make up 
 their <I>account with joy.</I> Nay, great men must not only with their 
 wealth and power assist and protect those that serve God, but they must 
 make conscience of being devout and religious themselves, and employing 
 themselves in the exercises of piety, which will greatly redound to the 
 honour of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:4,5">Ps. cxxxviii. 4, 5</A>),

 and have a good influence upon others, who will be the more easily
 persuaded to acts of devotion when they see them thus brought into 
 reputation. It is certain that the greatest of men is less than the 
 least of the ordinances of God; nor are the meanest services of 
 religion any disparagement to those that make the greatest figure in 
 the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offerings they brought were very rich and valuable, so rich 
 that some think there was not so great a difference in estate between 
 them and others as that they were able to bear the expense of them 
 themselves, but that the heads of each tribe contributed to the 
 offering which their prince brought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They brought some things to remain for standing service, twelve 
 large silver dishes, each about sixty ounces weight, as many large 
 silver cups, or bowls, of about thirty-five ounces--the former to be
 used for the meat-offerings, the latter for the drink-offerings--the
 former for the flesh of the sacrifices, the latter for the blood. The 
 latter was God's table (as it were), and it was fit that so great a 
 King should be served in plate. The golden spoons being filled with 
 incense were intended, it is probable, for the service of the golden 
 altar, for both the altars were anointed at the same time. Note, In 
 works of piety and charity we ought to be generous according as our 
 ability is. He that is the best should be served with the best we have. 
 The Israelites indeed might well afford to part with their gold and 
 silver in abundance to the service of the sanctuary, for they needed it 
 not to buy meat and victual their camp, being daily fed with bread from 
 heaven; nor did they need it to buy land, or pay their army, for they 
 were shortly to be put in possession of Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They brought some things to be used immediately, offerings of each 
 sort, burnt-offerings, sin-offerings, and a great many peace-offerings 
 (on part of which they were to feast with their friends), and the 
 meat-offerings that were to be annexed to them. Hereby they signified 
 their thankful acceptance of, and cheerful submission to, all those 
 laws concerning the sacrifices which God had lately by Moses delivered 
 to them. And, though it was a time of joy and rejoicing, yet it is 
 observable that still in the midst of their sacrifices we find a 
 <I>sin-offering.</I> Since in our best services we are conscious to 
 ourselves that there is a mixture of sin, it is fit that there should 
 be even in our most joyful services a mixture of repentance. In all our 
 approaches to God, we must by faith have an eye to Christ as the great 
 sin-offering, and make mention of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They brought their offerings each on a separate day, in the order 
 that they had been lately put into, so that the solemnity lasted twelve 
 days. So God appointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>They shall bring their offering, each prince on his day,</I> and so 
 they did. One sabbath must needs fall within the twelve days, if not 
 two, but it should seem they did not intermit on the sabbath, for it 
 was holy work, proper enough for a holy day. God appointed that it 
 should thus be done on several days,

 (1.) That solemnity might be prolonged, and so might be universally
 taken notice of by all Israel, and the remembrance of it more 
 effectually preserved. 

 (2.) That an equal honour might thereby be put upon each tribe 
 respectively; in Aaron's breast-plate each had his precious stone, so 
 in this offering each had his day.

 (3.) Thus it would be done more decently and in order; God's work
 should not be done confusedly, and in a hurry; take time, and we shall 
 have done the sooner, or at least we shall have done the better.

 (4.) God hereby signified how much pleased he is, and how much pleased
 we should be, with the exercises of piety and devotion. The repetition 
 of them should be a continual pleasure to us, and we must not be weary 
 of well doing. If extraordinary service be required to be done for
 twelve days together, we must not shrink from it, nor call it a task 
 and a burden.

 (5.) The priests and Levites, having this occasion to offer the same
 sacrifices, and those some of every sort, every day, for so many days 
 together, would have their hands well set in, and would be well versed 
 in the laws concerning them. 

 (6.) The peace-offerings were all to be eaten the same day they were
 offered, and two oxen, five rams, five he-goats, and five lambs, were 
 enough for one day's festival; had there been more, especially if all 
 had been brought on one day, there might have been danger of excess. 
 The virtue of temperance must not be left, under pretence of the 
 religion of feasting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. All their offerings were exactly the same, without any variation, 
 though it is probable that neither the princes nor the tribes were all 
 alike rich; but thus it was intimated that all the tribes of Israel had 
 an equal share in the altar, and an equal interest in the sacrifices 
 that were offered upon it. Though one tribe was posted more honourably 
 in the camp than another, yet they and their services were all alike 
 acceptable to God. Nor must we have faith of our Lord Jesus Christ 
 <I>with respect to persons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1">Jam. ii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Nahshon, the prince of the tribe of Judah, offered first, because 
 God had given that tribe the first post of honour in the camp; and the 
 rest of the tribes acquiesced, and offered in the same order in which 
 God had appointed them to encamp. Judah, of which tribe Christ came, 
 first, and then the rest; thus, in the dedication of souls to God, 
 every man is presented in his own order, <I>Christ the 
 first-fruits,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:23">1 Cor. xv. 23</A>.

 Some observe that Nahshon is the only one that is not expressly called
 a prince

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which the Jews give this account of: he is not called a prince, that he 
 might not be puffed up because he offered first; and all the others are 
 called princes because they (though some of them of the elder house) 
 submitted, and offered after him. Or, because the title of prince of 
 Judah did more properly belong to Christ, for <I>unto him shall the 
 gathering of the people be.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Though the offerings were all the same, yet the account of them is 
 repeated at large for each tribe, in the same words. We are sure there 
 are no vain repetitions in scripture; what then shall we make of these 
 repetitions? Might it not have served to say of this noble jury that 
 the same offering which their foreman brought each on his day brought 
 likewise? No, God would have it specified for each tribe: and why so? 
 
 (1.) It was for the encouragement of these princes, and of their
 respective tribes, that each of their offerings being recorded at large 
 no slight might seem to be put upon them; for rich and poor meet 
 together before God. 

 (2.) It was for the encouragement of all generous acts of piety and
 charity, by letting us know that what is so given is lent to the Lord, 
 and he carefully records it, with every one's name prefixed to his 
 gift, because what is so given he will pay again, and even a <I>cup of 
 cold water</I> shall have its <I>reward.</I> He is not unrighteous, to 
 forget either the cost or the <I>labour of love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.

 We find Christ taking particular notice of what was cast into the
 treasury,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:41">Mark xii. 41</A>.

 Though what is offered be but little, though it be a contribution to
 the charity of others, yet if it be according to our ability it shall 
 be recorded, that it may be recompensed in the resurrection of the 
 just.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The sum total is added at the foot of the account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:84-88"><I>v.</I> 84-88</A>),

 to show how much God was pleased with the mention of his 
 freewill-offerings, and what a great deal they amounted to in the 
 whole, when every prince brought in his quota! How greatly would the 
 sanctuary of God be enriched and beautified if all would in their 
 places do their part towards it, by exemplary purity and devotion, 
 extensive charity, and universal usefulness!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. God signified his gracious acceptance of these presents that were 
 brought him, by speaking familiarly to Moses, as a man speaks to his 
 friend, from off the mercy-seat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:89,12:8"><I>v.</I> 89, <I>ch.</I> xii. 8</A>);

 and in speaking to him he did in effect speak to all Israel, showing 
 them this token for good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:7">Ps. ciii. 7</A>.

 Note, By this we may know that God hears and accepts our prayers if he
 gives us grace to hear and receive his word, for thus our communion 
 with him is maintained and kept up. I know not why we may not suppose 
 that upon each of the days on which these offerings were brought 
 (probably while the priests and offerers were feasting upon the 
 peace-offerings) Moses was in the tabernacle, receiving some of those 
 laws and orders which we have already met with in this and the 
 foregoing book. And here the excellent bishop Patrick observes that 
 God's speaking to Moses thus by an audible articulate voice, as if he 
 had been clothed with a holy body, might be looked upon as an earnest 
 of the incarnation of the Son of God in the fulness of time, when the 
 Word should be made flesh, and speak in the language of the sons of 
 men. For, however God <I>at sundry times and in divers manners spoke 
 unto the fathers, he has in these last days spoken unto us by his 
 Son.</I> And that he who now spoke to Moses, as the <I>shechinah</I> or 
 divine Majesty, from between the cherubim, was the eternal Word, the 
 second person in the Trinity, was the pious conjecture of many of the 
 ancients; for all God's communion with man is by his Son, by whom he 
 made the world, and rules the church, and who <I>is the same yesterday, 
 to-day, and for ever.</I></P>
