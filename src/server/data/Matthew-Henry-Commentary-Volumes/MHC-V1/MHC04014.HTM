 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter gives us an account of that fatal quarrel between God and 
 Israel upon which, for their murmuring and unbelief, he swore in his 
 wrath that they should not enter into his rest. Here is, 

 I. The mutiny and rebellion of Israel against God, upon the report of
 the evil spies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>. 

 II. The fruitless endeavour of Moses and Aaron, Caleb and Joshua, to
 still the tumult, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:5-10">ver. 5-10</A>. 

 III. Their utter ruin justly threatened by an offended God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>. 

 IV. The humble intercession of Moses for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:13-19">ver. 13-19</A>. 

 V.  A mitigation of the sentence in answer to the prayer of Moses; they
 shall not all be cut off, but the decree goes forth ratified with an 
 oath, published to the people, again and again repeated, that this 
 whole congregation should perish in the wilderness, and none of them 
 enter Canaan but Caleb and Joshua only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:20-35">ver. 20-35</A>.  

 VI. The present death of the evil spies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:36-39">ver. 36-39</A>.

 VII. The rebuke given to those who attempted to go forward
 notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:40-45">ver. 40-45</A>.

 And this is written for our admonition, that we "fall not after the
 same example of unbelief."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;
 and the people wept that night.
 &nbsp; 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
 against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would
 God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had
 died in this wilderness!
 &nbsp; 3 And wherefore hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought us unto this land, to
 fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
 prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
 &nbsp; 4 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
 us return into Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see what mischief the evil spies made by their unfair 
 representation. We may suppose that these twelve that were impanelled 
 to enquire concerning Canaan had talked it over among themselves before 
 they brought in their report in public; and Caleb and Joshua, it is 
 likely, had done their utmost to bring the rest over to be of their 
 mind, and if they would but have agreed that Caleb, according to his 
 pose, should have spoken for them all, as their foreman, all had been 
 well; but the evil spies, it should seem, wilfully designed to raise 
 this mutiny, purely in opposition to Moses and Aaron, though they could 
 not propose any advantage to themselves by it, unless they hoped to be 
 captains and commanders of the retreat into Egypt they were now 
 meditating. But what came of it? Here in these verses we find those 
 whom they studied to humour put into a vexation, and, before the end of 
 the chapter, brought to ruin.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the people fretted themselves: <I>They lifted up their voices 
 and cried</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 giving credit to the report of the spies rather than to the word of 
 God, and imagining their condition desperate, they laid the reins on 
 the neck of their passions, and could keep no manner of temper. Like 
 foolish froward children, they fall a crying, yet know not what they 
 cry for. It would have been time enough to cry out when the enemy had 
 beaten up their quarters, and they had seen the sons of Anak at the 
 gate of their camp; but those that cried when nothing hurt them 
 deserved to have something given them to cry for. And, as if all had 
 been already gone, they sat down and <I>wept that night.</I> Note, 
 Unbelief, or distrust of God, is a sin that is its own punishment.  
 Those that do not trust God are continually vexing themselves. The 
 world's mourners are more than God's, and the <I>sorrow of the world 
 worketh death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they flew in the face of their governors--<I>murmured against
 Moses and Aaron,</I> and in them reproached the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 The congregation of elders began the discontent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but the contagion soon spread through the whole camp, for <I>the 
 children of Israel murmured.</I> Jealousies and discontents spread like 
 wildfire among the unthinking multitude, who are easily taught to 
 <I>despise dominions, and to speak evil of dignities.</I> 

 1. They look back with a causeless discontent. They wish that they had
 died in Egypt with the first-born that were slain there, or in the 
 wilderness with those that lately died of the plague for lusting. See 
 the prodigious madness of unbridled passions, which make men prodigal 
 even of that which nature accounts most dear, life itself. Never were 
 so many months spent so pleasantly as these which they had spent since 
 they came out of Egypt, loaded with honours, compassed with favours, 
 and continually entertained with something or other that was 
 surprising; and yet, as if all these things had not made it worth their 
 while to live, they wished they had died in Egypt. And such a light 
 opinion they had of God's tremendous judgments executed on their 
 neighbours for their sin that they wished they had shared with them in 
 their plagues, rather than run the hazard of making a descent upon 
 Canaan. They wish rather to die criminals under God's justice than live 
 conquerors in his favour. Some read it, <I>O that we had died in Egypt, 
 or in the wilderness! O that we might die!</I> They wish to die, for 
 fear of dying; and have not sense enough to reason as the poor lepers, 
 when rather than die upon the spot they ventured into an enemy's camp, 
 <I>If they kill us, we shall but die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:4">2 Kings vii. 4</A>.

 How base were the spirits of these degenerate Israelites, who, rather
 than die (if it come to the worst) like soldiers on the bed of honour, 
 with their swords in their hands, desire to die like rotten sheep in 
 the wilderness.

 2. They look forward with a groundless despair, taking it for granted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 that if they went on they must fall by the sword, and pretend to lay 
 the cause of their fear upon the great care they had for their wives 
 and children, who, they conclude, will be a prey to the Canaanites. And 
 here is a most wicked blasphemous reflection upon God himself, as if he 
 had brought them hither on purpose that they might fall by the sword, 
 and that their wives and children, those poor innocents, should be a 
 prey. Thus do they, in effect, charge that God who is love itself with 
 the worst of malice, and eternal Truth with the basest hypocrisy, 
 suggesting that all the kind things he had said to them, and done for 
 them, hitherto, were intended only to decoy them into a snare, and to 
 cover a secret design carried on all along to ruin them. Daring 
 impudence! But what will not that tongue speak against heaven that is 
 set on fire of hell? The devil keeps up his interest in the hearts of 
 men by insinuating to them ill thoughts of God, as if he desired the 
 death of sinners, and delighted in the hardships and sufferings of his 
 own servants, whereas he knows his thoughts to us-ward (whether we know 
 them so or no) to be <I>thoughts of good, and not of evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How they came at last to this desperate resolve, that, instead of 
 going forward to Canaan, they would go back again to Egypt. The motion 
 is first made by way of query only 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</I> But the ferment 
 being high, and the spirits of the people being disposed to entertain 
 any thing that was perverse, it soon ripened to a resolution, without a 
 debate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Let us make a captain and return to Egypt;</I> and it is lamented 
 long after 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:17">Neh. ix. 17</A>)

 that <I>in their rebellion they appointed a captain to return to their
 bondage;</I> for they knew Moses would not be their captain in this 
 retreat. Now,

 1. It was the greatest folly in the world to wish themselves in Egypt,
 or to think that if they were there it would be better with them than 
 it was.  If they durst not go forward to Canaan, yet better be as they 
 were than go back to Egypt.  What did they want? What had they to 
 complain of?  They had plenty, and peace, and rest, were under a good 
 government, had good company, had the tokens of God's presence with 
 them, and enough to make them easy even in the wilderness, if they had 
 but hearts to be content. But whither were they thus eager to go to 
 better themselves?  To Egypt! Had they so soon forgotten the sore 
 bondage they were in there? Would they be again under the tyranny of 
 their taskmasters, and at the drudgery of making brick? And, after all 
 the plagues which Egypt had suffered for their sakes, could they expect 
 any better treatment there than they had formerly, and not rather much 
 worse? In how little time (not a year and a half) have they forgotten 
 all the sighs of their bondage, and all the songs of their deliverance! 
 Like brute-beasts, they mind only what is present, and their memories, 
 with the other powers of reason, are sacrificed to their passions. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:7">Ps. cvi. 7</A>.

 We find it threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">Deut. xxviii. 68</A>),

 as the completing of their misery, that they should be brought into
 Egypt again, and yet this is what they here wish for.  Sinners are 
 enemies to themselves; and those that walk not in God's counsels 
 consult their own mischief and ruin.

 2.  It was a most senseless ridiculous thing to talk of returning
 thither through the wilderness. Could they expect that God's cloud 
 would lead them or his manna attend them? And, if they did not, the 
 thousands of Israel must unavoidably be lost and perish in the 
 wilderness. Suppose the difficulties of conquering Canaan were as great 
 as they imagined, those of returning to Egypt were much greater. In 
 this let us see,

 (1.) The folly of discontent and impatience under the crosses of our
 outward condition. We are uneasy at that which is, complain of our 
 place and lot, and we would shift; but is there any place or condition 
 in this world that has not something in it to make us uneasy if we are 
 disposed to be so? The way to better our condition is to get our 
 spirits into a better frame; and instead of asking, "Were it not better 
 to go to Egypt?" ask, "Were it not better to be content, and make the 
 best of that which is?"

 (2.) The folly of apostasy from the ways of God. Heaven is the Canaan
 set before us, a land flowing with milk and honey; those that bring up 
 ever so ill a report of it cannot but say that it is indeed a good 
 land, only it is hard to get to it. Strict and serious godliness is 
 looked upon as an impracticable thing, and this deters many who began 
 well from going on; rather than undergo the imaginary hardships of a 
 religious life, they run themselves upon the certain fatal consequences 
 of a sinful course; and so they transcribe the folly of Israel, who, 
 when they were within a step of Canaan, would make a captain, and 
 return to Egypt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
 assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
 <I>which were</I> of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
 &nbsp; 7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of
 Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it,
 <I>is</I> an exceeding good land.
 &nbsp; 8 If the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delight in us, then he will bring us into this
 land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
 &nbsp; 9 Only rebel not ye against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, neither fear ye the
 people of the land; for they <I>are</I> bread for us: their defence is
 departed from them, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> with us: fear them not.
 &nbsp; 10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And
 the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared in the tabernacle of the
 congregation before all the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The friends of Israel here interpose to save them if possible from 
 ruining themselves, but in vain. The physicians of their state would 
 have healed them, but they would not be healed; their watchmen gave 
 them warning, but they would not take warning, and so their blood is 
 upon their own heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The best endeavours were used to still the tumult, and, if now at 
 last they would have understood the things that belonged to their 
 peace, all the following mischief would have been prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Moses and Aaron did their part, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though it was against them that they murmured

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 yet they bravely overlooked the affront and injury done them, and 
 approved themselves faithful friends to those who were outrageous 
 enemies to them. The clamour and noise of the people were so great that 
 Moses and Aaron could not be heard; should they order any of their 
 servants to proclaim silence, the angry multitude would perhaps be the 
 more clamorous; and therefore, to gain audience in the sight of all the 
 assembly, they fell on their faces, thus expressing,

 (1.) Their humble prayers to God to still the noise of this sea, the 
 noise of its waves, even the tumult of the people.

 (2.) The great trouble and concern of their own spirits. They fell down 
 as men astonished and even thunder-struck, amazed to see a people throw 
 away their own mercies: to see those so ill-humoured who were so well 
 taught. And,

 (3.) Their great earnestness with the people to cease their murmurings;
 they hoped to work upon them by this humble posture, and to prevail 
 with them not to persist in their rebellion; Moses and Aaron beseech 
 them, as though by them God himself did beseech them, to be reconciled 
 unto God. What they said to the people Moses relates in the repetition 
 of this story. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:29,30">Deut. i. 29, 30</A>,

 <I>Be not afraid; the Lord your God shall fight for you.</I> Note,
 Those that are zealous friends to precious souls will stoop to any 
 thing for their salvation. Moses and Aaron, notwithstanding the posts 
 of honour they are in, prostrate themselves to the people to beg of 
 them not to ruin themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Caleb and Joshua did their part: they rent their clothes in a holy 
 indignation at the sin of the people, and a holy dread of the wrath of 
 God, which they saw ready to break out against them. it was the greater 
 trouble to these good men because the tumult was occasioned by those 
 spies with whom they had been joined in commission; and therefore they 
 thought themselves obliged to do what they could to still the storm 
 which their fellows had raised. No reasoning could be more pertinent 
 and pathetic than theirs was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>),

 and they spoke as with authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They assured them of the goodness of the land they had surveyed, 
 and that it was really worth venturing for, and not a land that <I>ate 
 up the inhabitants,</I> as the evil spies had represented it. It is an 
 <I>exceedingly good land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 it is <I>very, very good,</I> so the word is; so that they had no 
 reason to <I>despise this pleasant land.</I> Note, If men were but 
 thoroughly convinced of the desirableness of the gains of religion, 
 they would not stick at the services of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They made nothing of the difficulties that seemed to lie in the 
 way of their gaining the possession of it: "<I>Fear not the people of 
 the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Whatever formidable ideas have been given you of them, the lion is not 
 so fierce as he is painted. <I>They are bread for us,</I>" that is, 
 "they are set before us rather to be fed upon than to be fought with, 
 so easily, so pleasantly, and with so much advantage to ourselves shall 
 we master them." Pharaoh is said to have been given them for meat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>),

 and the Canaanites will be so too. They show that, whatever was
 suggested to the contrary, the advantage was clear on Israel's side. 
 For,

 [1.] Though the Canaanites dwell in walled cities, they are naked:
 <I>Their defence has departed from them;</I> that common providence 
 which preserves the rights of nations has abandoned them, and will be 
 no shelter nor protection to them. The other spies took notice of their 
 strength, but these of their wickedness, and thence inferred that God 
 had forsaken them, and therefore <I>their defence had departed.</I> No 
 people can be safe when they have provoked God to leave them. 

 [2.] Though Israel dwell in tents they are fortified: <I>The Lord is
 with us,</I> and his name is a strong tower; <I>fear them not.</I> 
 Note, While we have the presence of God with us, we need not fear the 
 most powerful force against us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They showed them plainly that all the danger they were in was from 
 their own discontents, and that they would succeed against all their 
 enemies if they did not make God their enemy. On this point alone the 
 cause would turn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>If the Lord delight in us,</I> as certainly he does, and will if we 
 do not provoke him, <I>he will bring us into this good land;</I> we 
 shall without fail get it in possession by his favour, and the light of 
 his countenance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>),

 if we do not forfeit his favour and by our own follies turn away our
 own mercies." It has come to this issue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Only rebel not you against the Lord.</I> Note, Nothing can ruin 
 sinners but their own rebellion. If God leave them, it is because they 
 drive him from them; and they die because they will die.  None are 
 excluded the heavenly Canaan but those that exclude themselves. And, 
 now, could the case have been made more plain? could it have been urged 
 more closely? But what was the effect?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was all to no purpose; they were deaf to this fair reasoning; 
 nay, they were exasperated by it, and grew more outrageous: <I>All the 
 congregation bade stone them with stones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The rulers of the congregation, and the great men (so bishop Patrick), 
 ordered the common people to fall upon them, and knock their brains 
 out. Their case was sad indeed when their leaders thus <I>caused them 
 to err.</I> Note, It is common for those whose hearts are <I>fully set 
 in them to do evil</I> to rage at those who give them good counsel. 
 Those who hate to be reformed hate those that would reform them, and 
 count them their enemies because they tell them the truth. Thus early 
 did Israel begin to misuse the prophets, and <I>stone those that were 
 sent to them,</I> and it was this that filled the measure of their sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 <I>Stone them with stones!</I> Why, what evil have they done? No crime
 can be laid to their charge; but the truth is <I>these two witnesses 
 tormented those</I> that were obstinate in their infidelity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 Caleb and Joshua had but just said, <I>The Lord is with us; fear them
 not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 and, if Israel will not apply those encouraging words to their own 
 fears, those that uttered them know how to encourage themselves with 
 them against this enraged multitude that spoke of stoning them, as 
 David in a like cause, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:6">1 Sam. xxx. 6</A>.

 Those that cannot prevail to edify others with their counsels and
 comforts should endeavour at least to edify themselves. Caleb and 
 Joshua knew they appeared for God and his glory, and therefore doubted 
 not but God would appear for them and their safety. And they were not 
 disappointed, for immediately <I>the glory of the Lord appeared,</I> to 
 the terror and confusion of those that were for stoning the servants of 
 God. When they reflected upon God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 his glory appeared not to silence their blasphemies; but, when they 
 threatened Caleb and Joshua, they touched the apple of his eye, and his 
 glory appeared immediately. Note, Those who faithfully expose 
 themselves for God are sure to be taken under his special protection, 
 and shall be hidden from the rage of men, either under heaven or in 
 heaven.</P>

 &nbsp; 15 Now <I>if</I> thou shalt kill <I>all</I> this people as one man, then
 the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
 &nbsp; 16 Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was not able to bring this people into the
 land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
 the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
 according as thou hast spoken, saying,
 &nbsp; 18 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
 iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing <I>the
 guilty,</I> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
 unto the third and fourth <I>generation.</I>
 &nbsp; 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people
 according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast
 forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The righteous sentence which God gave against Israel for their 
 murmuring and unbelief, which, though afterwards mitigated, showed what 
 was the desert of their sin and the demand of injured justice, and what 
 would have been done if Moses had not interposed.  When the glory of 
 the Lord <I>appeared in the tabernacle</I> we may suppose that Moses 
 took it for a call to him immediately to come and attend there, as 
 before the tabernacle was erected he went up to the mount in a similar 
 case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:30">Exod. xxxii. 30</A>.

 Thus, while the people were studying to disgrace him, God publicly put
 honour upon him, as the man of his counsel. Now here we are told what 
 God said to him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He showed him the great evil of the people's sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 What passed between God and Israel went through the hands of Moses: 
 when they were displeased with God they told Moses of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 when God was displeased with them he told Moses too, <I>revealing his 
 secret to his servant the prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:7">Amos iii. 7</A>.

 Two things God justly complains of to Moses:--

 (1.) Their sin. They <I>provoke me,</I> or (as the word signifies) they 
 <I>reject, reproach, despise</I> me, for <I>they will not believe 
 me.</I> This was the bitter root which bore the gall and wormwood. It 
 was their unbelief that made this a day of provocation in the 
 wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:8">Heb. iii. 8</A>.

 Note, Distrust of God, of his power and promise, is itself a very great
 provocation, and at the bottom of many other provocations. Unbelief is 
 a great sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:10">1 John v. 10</A>),

 and a root sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:12">Heb. iii. 12</A>.

 (2.) Their continuance in it: <I>How long will they do so?</I> Note, 
 The God of heaven keeps an account how long sinners persist in their 
 provocations; and the longer they persist the more he is displeased. 
 The aggravations of their sin were, 

 [1.] Their relation to God: <I>This people,</I> a peculiar people, a
 professing people. The nearer any are to God in name and profession, 
 the more he is provoked by their sins, especially their unbelief. 

 [2.] The experience they had had of God's power and goodness, in <I>all
 the signs</I> which he <I>had shown among them,</I> by which, one would 
 think, he had effectually obliged them to trust him and follow him. The 
 more God has done for us the greater is the provocation if we distrust 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He showed him the sentence which justice passed upon them for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "What remains now but that I should make a full end of them? It will 
 soon be done. <I>I will smite them with the pestilence,</I> not leave a 
 man of them alive, but wholly blot out their name and race, and so 
 disinherit them, and be no more troubled with them. <I>Ah, I will ease 
 me of my adversaries.</I> They wish to die; and let them die, and 
 neither root nor branch be left of them. Such rebellious children 
 deserve to be disinherited." And if it be asked, "What will become of 
 God's covenant with Abraham then?" here is an answer, "I shall be 
 preserved in the family of Moses: <I>I will make of thee a greater 
 nation.</I>" Thus,

 (1.) God would try Moses, whether he still continued that affection for 
 Israel which he formerly expressed upon a like occasion, in preferring 
 their interests before the advancement of his own family; and it is 
 proved that Moses was still of the same public spirit, and could not 
 bear the thought of raising his own name upon the ruin of the name of 
 Israel.

 (2.) God would teach us that he will not be a loser by the ruin of 
 sinners. If Adam and Eve had been cut off and disinherited, he could 
 have made another Adam and another Eve, and have glorified his mercy in 
 them, as here he could have glorified his mercy in Moses, though Israel 
 had been ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The humble intercession Moses made for them. Their sin had made a 
 fatal breach in the wall of their defence, at which destruction would 
 certainly have entered if Moses had not seasonably stepped in and made 
 it good. Here he was a type of Christ, who interceded for his 
 persecutors, and <I>prayed for those</I> that <I>despitefully used</I> 
 him, leaving us an example to his own rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44">Matt. v. 44</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prayer of his petition is, in one word, <I>Pardon, I beseech 
 thee, the iniquity of this people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that is, "Do not bring upon them the ruin they deserve." This was 
 Christ's prayer for those that crucified him, <I>Father forgive 
 them.</I> The pardon of a national sin, as such, consists in the 
 turning away of the national punishment; and that is it for which Moses 
 is here so earnest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The pleas are many, and strongly urged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He insists most upon the plea that is taken from the glory of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>.

 With this he begins, and somewhat abruptly, taking occasion from that 
 dreadful word, <I>I will disinherit them. Lord</I> (says he), <I>then 
 the Egyptians shall hear it.</I> God's honour lay nearer to his heart 
 than any interests of his own. Observe how he <I>orders this cause</I> 
 before God. He pleads, 

 [1.] That the eyes both of Egypt and Canaan were upon them, and great
 expectations were raised concerning them. They could not but have heard 
 <I>that thou, Lord, art among this people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The neighbouring countries rang of it, how much this people were the 
 particular care of heaven, so as never any people under the sun were. 
 
 [2.] That if they should be cut off great notice would be taken of it.
 "The <I>Egyptians will hear it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for they have their spies among us, and they will <I>tell it to the 
 inhabitants of the land</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 for there was great correspondence between Egypt and Canaan, although 
 not by the way of this wilderness. "If this people that have made so 
 great a noise be all consumed, if their mighty pretensions come to 
 nothing, and their light go out in a snuff, it will be told with 
 pleasure in Gath, and published in the streets of Askelon; and what 
 construction will the heathen put upon it? It will be impossible to 
 make them understand it as an act of God's justice, and as such 
 redounding to God's honour; <I>brutish men know not this</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:6">Ps. xcii. 6</A>):

 but they will impute it to the failing of God's power, and so turn it
 to his reproach,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They will say, He slew them in the wilderness because he was not able 
 to bring them to Canaan, his arm being shortened, and his stock of 
 miracles being spent. Now, Lord, let not one attribute be glorified at 
 the expense of another; rather let mercy <I>rejoice against 
 judgment</I> than that almighty power should be impeached." Note, The 
 best pleas in prayer are those that are taken from God's honour; for 
 they agree with the first petition of the Lord's Prayer, <I>Hallowed be 
 thy name. Do not disgrace the throne of thy glory.</I> God pleads it 
 with himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:27">Deut. xxxii. 27</A>),

 <I>I feareth the wrath of the enemy;</I> and we should use it as an
 argument with ourselves to walk so in every thing as to give no 
 occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:1">1 Tim. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He pleads God's proclamation of his name at Horeb 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):
 
 <I>Let the power of the Lord be great.</I> Power is here put for 
 pardoning mercy; it is his power over his own anger. If he should 
 destroy them, God's power would be questioned; if he should continue 
 and complete their salvation, notwithstanding the difficulties that 
 arose, not only from the strength of their enemies, but from their own 
 provocations, this would greatly magnify the divine power: what cannot 
 he do who could make so weak a people conquerors and such an unworthy 
 people favourites? The more danger there is of others reproaching God's 
 power the more desirous we should be to see it glorified. To enforce 
 this petition, he refers to the word which God had spoken: <I>The Lord 
 is long-suffering and of great mercy.</I> God's goodness had there been 
 spoken of as his glory; God gloried in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 Now here he prays that upon this occasion he would glorify it. Note, We
 must take our encouragement in prayer from the word of God, upon which 
 he has <I>caused us to hope,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:49">Ps. cxix. 49</A>.

 "Lord, be and do <I>according as
 thou hast spoken;</I> for hast thou spoken, and wilt thou not make it 
 good?" Three things God had solemnly made a declaration of, which Moses 
 here fastens upon, and improves for the enforcing of his petition:--

 [1.] The goodness of God's nature in general, that he is
 long-suffering, or slow to anger, and of great mercy; not soon 
 provoked, but tender and compassionate towards offenders. 

 [2.] His readiness in particular to pardon sin: <I>Forgiving iniquity
 and transgression,</I> sins of all sorts. 

 [3.] His unwillingness to proceed to extremity, even when he does
 punish. For in this sense the following words may be read: <I>That will 
 by no means make quite desolate, in visiting the iniquity of the 
 fathers upon the children.</I> God had indeed said in the second 
 commandment that he would thus visit, but here he promises not to make 
 a full end of families, churches, and nations, at once; and so it is 
 very applicable to this occasion, for Moses cannot beg that God would 
 not at all punish this sin (it would be too great an encouragement to 
 rebellion if he should set no mark of his displeasure upon it), but 
 that he would not <I>kill all this people as one man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He does not ask that they may not be corrected, but that they may not 
 be disinherited. And this proclamation of God's name was the more 
 apposite to his purpose because it was made upon occasion of the 
 pardoning of their sin in making the golden calf. This sin which they 
 had now fallen into was bad enough, but it was not idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He pleads past experience: <I>As thou hast forgiven this people 
 from Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This seemed to make against him. Why should those be forgiven any more 
 who, after they had been so often forgiven, revolted yet more and more, 
 and seemed hardened and encouraged in their rebellion by the lenity and 
 patience of their God, and the frequent pardons they had obtained? 
 Among men it would have been thought impolitic to take notice of such a 
 circumstance in a request of this nature, as it might operate to the 
 prejudice of the petitioner: but, as in other things so in pardoning 
 sin, God's thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:9">Isa. lv. 9</A>.

 Moses looks upon it as a good plea, <I>Lord, forgive, as thou hast
 forgiven.</I> It will be no more a reproach to thy justice, nor any 
 less the praise of thy mercy, to forgive now, than it has been 
 formerly. Therefore the <I>sons of Jacob are not consumed,</I> because 
 they have to do with a <I>God that changes not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:6">Mal. iii. 6</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
 &nbsp; 21 But <I>as</I> truly <I>as</I> I live, all the earth shall be filled

 &nbsp; 22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
 miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
 tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
 voice;
 &nbsp; 23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
 fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

 which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of

 &nbsp; 31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
 will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
 despised.
 &nbsp; 32 But <I>as for</I> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
 wilderness.
 &nbsp; 33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty
 years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in
 the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
 <I>even</I> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
 iniquities, <I>even</I> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
 promise.
 &nbsp; 35 I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
 congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
 wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here God's answer to the prayer of Moses, which sings both of 
 mercy and judgment. It is given privately to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:20-25"><I>v.</I> 20-25</A>),

 and then directed to be made public to the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:26-35"><I>v.</I> 26-35</A>.

 The frequent repetitions of the same things in it speak these resolves 
 to be unalterable. Let us see the particulars.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The extremity of the sentence is receded from 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>I have pardoned,</I> so as not to cut them all off at once, and 
 disinherit them." See the power of prayer, and the delight God takes in 
 putting an honour upon it. He designed a pardon, but Moses shall have 
 the praise of obtaining it by prayer: it shall be done <I>according to 
 thy word;</I> thus, as a prince, he has power with God, and prevails. 
 See what countenance and encouragement God gives to our intercessions 
 for others, that we may be public-spirited in prayer. Here is a whole 
 nation rescued from ruin by the effectual fervent prayer of one 
 righteous man. See how ready God is to forgive sin, and how easy to be 
 entreated: <I>Pardon,</I> says Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>I have pardoned,</I> says God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 David found him thus swift to show mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>.

 <I>He deals not with us after our sins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:10">Ps. ciii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The glorifying of God's name is, in the general, resolved upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is said, it is sworn, <I>All the earth shall be filled with the 
 glory of the Lord.</I> Moses in his prayer had shown a great concern 
 for the glory of God. "Let me alone," says God, "to secure that 
 effectually, and to advance it, by this dispensation." All the world 
 shall see how God hates sin even in his own people, and will reckon for 
 it, and yet how gracious and merciful he is, and how slow to anger.  
 Thus when our Saviour prayed, <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> he was 
 immediately answered, <I>I have glorified it, and will glorify it yet 
 again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28">John xii. 28</A>.

 Note, Those that sincerely seek God's glory may be sure of what they
 seek. God having turned this prayer for the glorifying of himself into 
 a promise, we may turn it into praise, in concert with the angels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa. vi. 3</A>,

 <I>The earth is full of his glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sin of this people which provoked God to proceed against them 
 is here aggravated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:22,27"><I>v.</I> 22, 27</A>.

 It is not made worse than really it was, but is shown to be exceedingly 
 sinful. It was an evil congregation, each bad, but altogether in 
 congregation, very bad. 

 1. They tempted God--tempted his power, whether he could help them in
 their straits--his goodness, whether he would--and his faithfulness, 
 whether his promise would be performed.  They tempted his justice, 
 whether he would resent their provocations and punish them or no. They 
 dared him, and in effect challenged him, as God does the idols 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:23">Isa. xli. 23</A>),

 to do <I>good,</I> or do <I>evil.</I>

 2. They murmured against him. This is much insisted on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 As they questioned what he would do, so they quarrelled with him for 
 every thing he did or had done, continually fretting and finding fault. 
 It does not appear that they murmured at any of the laws or ordinances 
 that God gave them (though they proved a heavy yoke), but they murmured 
 at the conduct they were under, and the provision made for them. Note, 
 It is much easier to bring ourselves to the external services of 
 religion, and observe all the formalities of devotion, than to live a 
 life of dependence upon, and submission to, the divine Providence in 
 the course of our conversation. 

 3. They did this after they had seen God's miracles in Egypt and in the
 wilderness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They would not believe their own eyes, which were witnesses for God 
 that he was in the midst of them of a truth. 

 4. They had repeated the provocations ten times, that is, very often:
 the Jewish writers reckon this exactly the tenth time that the body of 
 the congregation had provoked God. First, at the Red Sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11">Exod. xiv. 11</A>.

 In Marah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:23,24">Exod. xv. 23, 24</A>.

 In the wilderness of Sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:2">Exod. xvi. 2</A>.

 At Rephidim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:1,2">Exod. xvii. 1, 2</A>.

 The golden calf,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:1-35">Exod. xxxii</A>.

 Then at Taberah. Then at Kibroth-Hattaavah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1-35"><I>ch.</I> xi</A>.

 And so this was the tenth. Note, God keeps an account how often we
 repeat our provocations, and will sooner or later set them in order 
 before us. 

 5. They had not hearkened to his voice, though he had again and again
 admonished them of their sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The sentence passed upon them for this sin. 

 1. That they should not see the promised land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 nor <I>come into it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>He swore in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:11">Ps.  xcv. 11</A>.

 Note, Disbelief of the promise is a forfeiture of the benefit of it.
 Those that despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The 
 promise of God should be fulfilled to their posterity, but not to them.

 2. That they should immediately <I>turn back into the wilderness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Their next remove should be a retreat. They must face about, and 
 instead of going forward to Canaan, on the very borders of which they 
 now were, they must withdraw towards the Red Sea again.  <I>To-morrow 
 turn you;</I> that is, "Very shortly you shall be brought back to that 
 vast howling wilderness which you are so weary of.  And it is time to 
 shift for your own safety, for <I>the Amalekites lie in wait in the 
 valley,</I> ready to attack you if you march forward." Of them they had 
 been distrustfully afraid 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:29"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 29</A>),

 and now with them God justly frightened them. <I>The fear of the wicked
 shall come upon him.</I>

 3. That all those who had now grown up to men's estate should die in
 the wilderness, not all at once, but by degrees. They wished that they 
 might die in the wilderness, and God said <I>Amen</I> to their 
 passionate wish, and made their sin their ruin, <I>snared them</I> in 
 the <I>words of their mouth,</I> and <I>caused their own tongue to fall 
 upon them,</I> took them at their word, and determined that their 
 <I>carcases should fall in the wilderness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>,

 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:32,35"><I>v.</I> 32, 35</A>.

 See with what contempt they are spoken of, now that they had by their 
 sin made themselves vile; the mighty men of valour were but carcases, 
 when the Spirit of the Lord had departed from them. They were all as 
 dead men. Their fathers had such a value for Canaan that they desired 
 to have their dead bodies carried thither to be buried, in token of 
 their dependence upon God's promise that they should have that land for 
 a possession: but these, having despised that good land and disbelieved 
 the promise of it, shall not have the honour to be buried in it, but 
 shall have their graves in the wilderness. 

 4.  That in pursuance of this sentence they should wander to and fro in
 the wilderness, like travellers that have lost themselves, for forty 
 years; that is, so long as to make it full forty years from their 
 coming out of Egypt to their entrance into Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.
 
 Thus long they were kept wandering,

 (1.) To answer the number of the days in which the spies were searching
 the land. They were content to wait forty days for the testimony of 
 men, because they could not take God's word; and therefore justly are 
 they kept forty years waiting for the performance of God's promise.

 (2.) That hereby they might be brought to repentance, and find mercy 
 with God in the other world, whatever became of them in this. Now they 
 had time to bethink themselves, and to consider their ways; and the 
 inconveniences of the wilderness would help to humble them and prove 
 them, and <I>show them what was in their heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:2">Deut. viii. 2</A>.

 Thus long they <I>bore their iniquities,</I> feeling the weight of
 God's wrath in the punishment. They were made to groan under the burden 
 of their own sin that brought it upon them, which was <I>too heavy for 
 them to bear.</I>

 (3.) That they might sensibly feel what a dangerous thing it is for
 God's covenant-people to break with him: "<I>You shall know my breach 
 of promise,</I> both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin" 
 (for God never leaves any till they first leave him), "and the 
 consequences of it, that it will produce your ruin; you are quite 
 undone when you are thrown out of covenant."

 (4.) That a new generation might in this time be raised up, which could
 not be done all of a sudden. And the children, being brought up under 
 the tokens of God's displeasure against their fathers, and so 
 <I>bearing their whoredoms</I> (that is, the punishment of their sins, 
 especially their idolatry about the golden calf, which God now 
 remembered against them), might take warning not to tread in the steps 
 of their fathers' disobedience. And their wandering so long in the 
 wilderness would make Canaan at last the more welcome to them. It 
 should seem that upon occasion of this sentence Moses penned the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1-17">ninetieth Psalm</A>,

 which is very apposite to the present state of Israel, and wherein they
 are taught to pray that since this sentence could not be reversed it 
 might be sanctified, and they might learn to <I>apply their hearts unto 
 wisdom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The mercy that was mixed with this severe sentence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Mercy to Caleb and Joshua, that though they should wander with the 
 rest in the wilderness, yet they, and only they of all that were now 
 above twenty years old, should survive the years of banishment, and 
 live to enter Canaan. Caleb only is spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and a particular mark of honour put upon him, both,

 (1.) In the character given of him: he had <I>another spirit,</I>
 different from the rest of the spies, an <I>after-spirit,</I> which 
 furnished him with second thoughts, and he <I>followed the Lord 
 fully,</I> kept close to his duty, and went through with it, though 
 deserted and threatened; and,

 (2.) In the recompence promised to him: <I>Him will I bring in due time
 into the land whereinto he went.</I> Note, 

 [1.] It ought to be the great care and endeavour of every one of us to
 follow the Lord fully.  We must, in a course of obedience to God's will 
 and of service to his honour, follow him universally, without 
 dividing,--uprightly, without dissembling,--cheerfully, without 
 disputing,--and constantly, without declining; and this is following 
 him fully. 

 [2.] Those that would follow God fully must have another spirit,
 another from the spirit of the world, and another from what their own 
 spirit has been. They must have the spirit of Caleb. 

 [3.] Those that follow God fully in times of general apostasy God will
 own and honour by singular preservations in times of general calamity. 
 The heavenly Canaan shall be the everlasting inheritance of those that 
 follow the Lord fully. When Caleb is again mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:30"><I>v.</I>  30</A>)

 Joshua stands with him, compassed with the same favours and crowned 
 with the same honours, having stood with him in the same services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Mercy to the children even of these rebels. They should have a seed 
 preserved, and Canaan secured to that seed: <I>Your little ones,</I> 
 now under twenty years old, <I>which you,</I> in your unbelief, <I>said 
 should be a prey, them will I bring in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They had invidiously charged God with a design to ruin their children, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 But God will let them know that he can put a difference between the 
 guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their 
 children. Thus the promise made to Abraham, though it seemed to fail 
 for a time, was kept from failing for evermore; and, though God 
 chastened their transgressions with a rod, yet his <I>loving kindness 
 he would not utterly take away.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
 returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by
 bringing up a slander upon the land,
 &nbsp; 37 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
 land, died by the plague before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
 <I>which were</I> of the men that went to search the land, lived
 <I>still.</I>
 &nbsp; 39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of
 Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
 &nbsp; 40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
 the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we <I>be here,</I> and will go up
 unto the place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath promised: for we have sinned.
 &nbsp; 41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the
 commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? but it shall not prosper.
 &nbsp; 42 Go not up, for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> not among you; that ye be not

 the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and Moses, departed not out
 of the camp.
 &nbsp; 45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which
 dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, <I>even</I>
 unto Hormah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The sudden death of the ten evil spies. While the sentence was 
 passing upon the people, before it was published, they <I>died of the 
 plague before the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God hereby showed his particular displeasure against those who 
 <I>sinned and made Israel to sin.</I> 

 (1.) They sinned themselves, in bringing up a slander upon the land of
 promise. Note, Those greatly provoke God who misrepresent religion, 
 cast reproach upon it, and raise prejudices in men's minds against it, 
 or give occasion to those to do so who seek occasion. Those that 
 represent the service of God as mean and despicable, melancholy and 
 uncomfortable, hard and impracticable, needless and unprofitable, bring 
 up an <I>evil report</I> upon the good land, <I>pervert the right ways 
 of the Lord,</I> and in effect give him the lie.

 (2.) They <I>made Israel to sin.</I> They designedly <I>made all the
 congregation murmur</I> against God. Note, Ring-leaders in sin may 
 expect to fall under particular marks of the wrath of God, who will 
 severely reckon for the blood of souls, which is thus spilt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God hereby showed what he could have done with the whole 
 congregation, and gave an earnest of the execution of the sentence now 
 passed upon them. He that thus cut off one of a tribe could have cut 
 off their whole tribes suddenly, and would do it gradually. Note, The 
 remarkable deaths of notorious sinners are earnests of the final 
 perdition of ungodly men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5,6">2 Pet. ii. 5, 6</A>.

 Thus the wrath of God is revealed, that sinners may hear and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The special preservation of Caleb and Joshua: <I>They lived 
 still,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 It is probable that all the twelve spies stood together, for the eyes 
 of all Israel were now upon them; and therefore it is taken notice of 
 as very remarkable, and which could not but be affecting to the whole 
 congregation, that when the ten evil spies fell down dead of the 
 plague, a malignant infectious distemper, yet these two that stood 
 among them lived, and were well. God hereby confirmed their testimony, 
 and put those to confusion that spoke of stoning them.  He likewise 
 gave them an assurance of their continued preservation in the 
 wilderness, when thousands should fall on their right hand and on their 
 left, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:7">Ps. xci. 7</A>.

 Death never misses his mark, nor takes any by oversight that were
 designed for life, though in the midst of those that were to die.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The publication of the sentence to all the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 He told them all what the decree was which had gone forth concerning 
 them, and which could not be reversed, that they must all die in the 
 wilderness, and Canaan must be reserved for the next generation. It was 
 a very great disappointment, we may well think, to Moses himself, who 
 longed to be in Canaan, as well as to all the people; yet he 
 acquiesced, but they wept and mourned greatly. The assurance which 
 Moses had of God's being glorified by this sentence gave him 
 satisfaction, while the consciousness of their own guilt, and their 
 having procured it to themselves, gave them the greatest vexation. They 
 wept for nothing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and now they have cause given them to weep; so justly are murmurers 
 made mourners. If they had mourned for the sin when they were 
 faithfully reproved for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 the sentence would have been prevented; but now that they mourned for 
 the judgment only their grief came too late, and did them no service; 
 they <I>found no place for repentance, though they sought it carefully 
 with tears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:17">Heb. xii. 17</A>.

 Such mourning as this there is in hell, but the tears will not quench
 the flames, no, nor cool the tongue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The foolish fruitless attempts of some of the Israelites to enter 
 Canaan, notwithstanding the sentence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were now eager to go forward towards Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 They were up early, mustered all their force, got together in a body, 
 and begged of Moses to lead them on against the enemy, and now there is 
 no more talk among them of making a captain to return into Egypt. They 
 confess their fault: <I>We have sinned;</I> they profess reformation: 
 <I>Lo, we be here, and will go up.</I> They now desire the land which 
 they had despised, and put a confidence in the promise which they had 
 distrusted. Thus when God judges he will overcome, and, first or last, 
 will convince sinners of the evil of all their ungodly deeds, and hard 
 speeches, and force them to recall their own words. But, though God was 
 glorified by this recantation of theirs, they were not benefited by it, 
 because it came too late. The decree had gone forth, the consumption 
 was determined; they did not seek the Lord while he might be found, and 
 now he would not be found. O, if men would but be as earnest for heaven 
 while their day of grace lasts as they will be when it is over, would 
 be as solicitous to provide themselves with oil while the bridegroom 
 tarries as they will be when the bridegroom comes, how well were it for 
 them!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses utterly disallows their motion, and forbids the expedition 
 they were meditating: <I>Go not up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:41-43"><I>v.</I> 41-43</A>.

 (1.) He gives them warning of the sin; it is <I>transgressing the
 commandment of the Lord,</I> who had expressly ordered them, when they 
 did move, to move back towards the Red Sea. Note, That which has been 
 duty, in its season, when it comes to be mistimed may be turned into 
 sin. It is true the command he refers to was in the nature of a 
 punishment, but he that has not obeyed the law is obliged to submit to 
 the penalty, for the Lord is our Judge as well as Lawgiver.

 (2.) He gives them this warning of the danger: "<I>It shall not
 prosper,</I> never expect it." Note, It is folly to promise ourselves 
 success in that which we undertake contrary to the mind of God. "<I>The 
 Canaanites are before you</I> to attack you, and <I>the Lord is not 
 among you</I> to protect you and fight for you, and therefore look to 
 yourselves <I>that you be not smitten before your enemies.</I>" Those 
 that are out of the way of their duty are from under God's protection, 
 and go at their peril. It is dangerous going where we cannot expect God 
 should go along with us.  Nay, he plainly foresees and foretels their 
 defeat: <I>You shall fall by the sword</I> of the Amalekites and 
 Canaanites (who were to have fallen by their sword); <I>Because you are 
 turned away from the Lord,</I> from following the guidance of his 
 precept and promise, <I>therefore the Lord will not be with you.</I> 
 Note, God will certainly leave those that leave him; and those that are 
 left of him lie exposed to all misery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They venture notwithstanding. Never was people so perverse and so 
 desperately resolved in every thing to walk contrary to God. God bade 
 them go, and they would not; he forbade them, and they would. Thus is 
 the <I>carnal mind enmity to God: They presumed to go up unto the 
 hill-top,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.
 
 Here,

 (1.) They struggled against the sentence of divine justice, and would
 press on in defiance of it.

 (2.) They slighted the tokens of God's presence, for they would go 
 though they left Moses and the ark of the covenant behind them. They 
 had distrusted God's strength, and now they presume upon their own 
 without his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The expedition speeds accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 The enemy had posted themselves upon the top of the hill, to make good 
 that pass against the invaders, and, being informed by their scouts of 
 their approach, sallied out upon them, and defeated them, and it is 
 probable that many of the Israelites were killed. Now the sentence 
 began to be executed that their <I>carcases should fall in the 
 wilderness.</I> Note, That affair can never end well that begins with 
 sin. The way to obtain peace with our friends, and success against our 
 enemies, is to make God our friend, and keep ourselves in his love. The 
 Jews, like these their ancestors, when they had rejected Christ's 
 righteousness, attempted to establish their own, and it sped as 
 this.</P>
