 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOUGH</FONT> it is most my concern, that I be able to 
 give a good account to God and my own conscience,
 yet, perhaps, it will be expected that I give the world 
 also some account of this bold undertaking; which 
 I shall endeavour to do with all plainness, and as one 
 who believes, that if men must be reckoned with in 
 the great day, for every vain and idle word they speak, 
 much more for every vain and idle line they write. 
 And it may be of use, in the first place, to lay down 
 those great and sacred principles which I go upon, and 
 am governed by, in this endeavour to explain and improve 
 these portions of holy writ; which endeavour 
 I humbly offer to the service of those (and to those only 
 I expect it will be acceptable) who agree with me 
 in these six principles:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That <I>religion is the one thing useful;</I> and to know, 
 and love, and fear God our Maker, and in all the 
 instances both of devout affection, and of good 
 conversation, to <I>keep his commandments,</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:13">Eccles. xii. 13</A>)
 is, without doubt, <I>the whole of man;</I> it is all in all to 
 him. This the wisest of men, after a close and copious 
 argument in his <I>Ecclesiastes,</I> lays down as the conclusion 
 of his whole matter (the <I>Quod erat demonstrandum</I> 
 of his whole discourse); and therefore I may be 
 allowed to lay it down as a <I>postulatum,</I> and the foundation 
 of this whole matter. It is necessary to mankind 
 in general, that there should be religion in the world, 
 absolutely necessary for the preservation of the honour 
 of the human nature, and no less so for the preservation 
 of the order of human societies. It is necessary 
 to each of us in particular, that we be religious; 
 we cannot otherwise answer the end of our creation, 
 obtain the favour of our Creator, make ourselves easy 
 now, or happy forever. A man that is endued with the
 powers of reason, by which he is capable of knowing, 
 serving, glorifying, and enjoying his Maker, and yet 
 <I>lives without God in the world,</I> is certainly the most 
 despicable and the most miserable animal under the sun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That <I>divine revelation is necessary to true religion,</I> 
 to the being and support of it. That faith without 
 which <I>it is impossible to please God,</I> cannot come to 
 any perfection by seeing the works of God, but it must 
 come by <I>hearing the word of God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:17">Rom. x. 17</A>.
 The rational soul, since it received that fatal shock by the
 fall, cannot have or maintain that just regard to the
 great author of its being, that observance of him, and
 expectation from him, which are both its duty and
 felicity, without some supernatural discovery made by
 himself of himself, and of his mind and will. Natural
 light, no doubt, is of excellent use, as far as it goes;
 but it is necessary that there be a divine revelation, to
 rectify its mistakes, and make up its deficiencies, to
 help us out where the light of nature leaves us quite
 at a loss, especially in the way and method of man's
 recovery from his lapsed state, and his restoration to
 his Maker's favour; which he cannot but be conscious
 to himself of the loss of, finding, by sad experience,
 his own present state to be sinful and miserable. Our 
 own reason shows us the wound, but nothing short of 
 a divine revelation can discover to us a remedy to 
 be confided in. The case and character of those nations 
 of the earth which had no other guide in their devotions 
 than that of natural light, with some remains 
 of the divine institution of sacrifices received by tradition 
 from their fathers, plainly show how necessary 
 divine revelation is to the subsistence of religion; for 
 those that had not the word of God, soon lost God 
 himself, became vain in their imaginations concerning 
 him, and prodigiously vile and absurd in their worships 
 and divinations. It is true, the Jews, who had the 
 benefit of divine revelation, lapsed sometimes into idolatry, 
 and admitted very gross corruptions; yet, with 
 the help of the law and the prophets, they recovered 
 and reformed: whereas the best and most admired 
 philosophy of the heathen could never do any thing 
 toward the cure of the vulgar idolatry, or so much as 
 offered to remove any of those barbarous and ridiculous 
 rites of their religion, which were the scandal and 
 reproach of the human nature. Let men therefore pretend 
 what they will, deists are, or will be, atheists; and 
 those that, under colour of admiring the oracles of reason, 
 set aside as useless the oracles of God, undermine 
 the foundations of all religion, and do what they can 
 to cut off all communication between man and his 
 Maker, and to set that noble creature on a level with 
 the beasts that perish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That <I>divine revelation is not now to be found nor 
 expected any where but in the scriptures of the Old 
 and New Testament;</I> and there it is. It is true, there 
 were religion and divine revelation before there was 
 any written word; but to argue from thence, that the 
 scriptures are not now necessary, it as absurd as it 
 would be to argue that the world might do well enough 
 without the sun, because in the creation the world 
 had light three days before the sun was made. Divine
 revelations, when first given, were confirmed by visions, 
 miracles, and prophecy; but they were to be transmitted
 to distant regions and future ages, with their 
 proofs and evidences, by writing, the surest way of 
 conveyance, and by which the knowledge of other memorable
 things is preserved and propagated. We have reason 
 to think that even the ten commandments, though 
 spoken with such solemnity at Mount Sinai, would have 
 been, long before this, lost and forgotten, if they 
 had been handed down by tradition only, and never had 
 been put in writing: it is that which is written, that
 remains. The scripture indeed is not compiled as a
 methodical system or body of divinity, <I>secundum artem--according
 to the rules of art,</I> but several ways of writing,
 (histories, laws, prophecies, songs, epistles, and
 even proverbs,) at several times, and by several hands,
 as Infinite Wisdom saw fit. The end is effectually obtained;
 such things are plainly supposed and taken for
 granted, and such things are expressly revealed and
 made known, as, being all put together, sufficiently
 inform us of all the truths and laws of the holy religion
 we are to believe, and be governed by. That <I>all scripture
 is given by inspiration of God,</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16">2 Tim. iii. 16</A>)
 and that <I>holy men spake and wrote as they were moved by
 the Holy Ghost,</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2 Pet. i. 21</A>)
 we are sure; but who
 dare pretend to describe that inspiration? None <I>knows the
 way of the Spirit,</I> nor how the thoughts were formed 
 in the heart of him that was inspired, any more than 
 we know the way of the soul into the body, or <I>how 
 the bones are formed in the womb or her that is with child,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5">Eccles. xi. 5</A>. But we may be sure that the blessed
 Spirit did not only habitually prepare and qualify the
 penmen of scripture for that service, and put it into
 their hearts to write, but did likewise assist their
 understandings and memories in recording those things
 which they themselves had the knowledge of, and
 effectually secure them from error and mistake; and what
 they could not know but by revelation, (as for instance,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:1-31">Gen. i.</A> and
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1-18">John i.</A>)
 the same blessed Spirit gave
 them clear and satisfactory information of. And no
 doubt, as far as was necessary to the end designed, they
 were directed by he Spirit, even in the language and
 expression; for there were <I>words which the Holy Ghost
 taught;</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1 Cor. ii. 13</A>)
 and God saith to the prophet,
 <I>Thou shalt speak with my words,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:4">Ezek. iii. 4</A>.
 However, it is not material to us, who drew up the statute, nor
 what liberty he took in using his own words: when 
 it is ratified, it is become the legislator's act, and binds 
 the subject to observe the true intent and meaning 
 of it. The scripture proves its divine authority and 
 original both to the wise and to the unwise. Even to the 
 unwise and least thinking part of mankind, it is abundantly 
 proved by the many incontestable miracles wrought 
 by Moses and the prophets, Christ and his apostles, for 
 the confirmation of its truths and laws: it would be 
 an intolerable reproach to eternal Truth, to suppose 
 this divine seal affixed to a lie. Beside this, to the more 
 wise and thinking, to the more considerate and 
 contemplative it recommends itself by those innate excellences 
 which are self-evident characteristics of its divine 
 original. If we look carefully, we shall soon be aware 
 of God's image and superscription upon it. A mind 
 rightly disposed by a humble, sincere subjection to its 
 Maker, will easily discover the image of God's wisdom 
 in the awful depth of its mysteries; the image of his
 sovereignty in the commanding majesty of its style; 
 the image of his unity in the wonderful harmony and 
 symmetry of all its parts; the image of his holiness in 
 the unspotted purity of its precepts; and the image 
 of his goodness in the manifest tendency of the whole to 
 the welfare and happiness of mankind in both worlds; 
 in short, it is a work that fathers itself. And as atheists, 
 so deists, notwithstanding their vain-glorious pretensions 
 to reason, as if wisdom must die with them, 
 run themselves upon the grossest and most dishonourable 
 absurdities imaginable; for, if the scriptures 
 be not the word of God, then there is no divine revelation 
 now in the world, no discovery at all of God's 
 mind concerning our duty and happiness: so that,
 let a man be ever so desirous and solicitous to do his 
 Maker's will, he must, without remedy, perish in the 
 ignorance of it, since there is no book but this that will 
 undertake to tell him what it is, a consequence which 
 can by no means be reconciled to the idea we have 
 of the divine goodness. And (which is no less an absurdity), 
 if the scriptures be not really a divine revelation, 
 they are certainly as great a cheat as ever was 
 put upon the world: but we have no reason to think 
 them so; for bad men would never write so good a 
 book, nor would Satan have so little subtlety as to 
 help to cast out Satan; and good men would never do 
 so wicked a thing as to counterfeit the broad seal of 
 heaven and affix it to a patent of their own framing,
 though in itself ever so just. No, <I>there are not the 
 words of him that hath a devil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the <I>scriptures of the Old and New Testament 
 were purposely designed for our learning.</I> They might 
 have been a divine revelation to those into whose hands 
 they were first put, and yet we, at this distance,
 have been no way concerned in them; but it is certain 
 that they were intended to be of universal and perpetual 
 use and obligation to all persons, in all places 
 and all ages, that have the knowledge of them, even 
 unto us <I>upon whom the ends of the world have come.</I> 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:4">Rom. xv. 4</A>.
 Though we are not under the law
 as a covenant of innocency (for then, being guilty, we
 should unavoidable perish under its curse), yet it is
 not therefore an antiquated statute, but a standing
 declaration of the will of God concerning good and evil,
 sin and duty, and its claim to obedience is in as full
 force and virtue as ever: and <I>unto us is the gospel</I> of
 the ceremonial law <I>preached, as well as unto those</I> to
 whom it was first delivered, and much more plainly,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb. iv. 2</A>.
 The histories of the Old Testament were
 written for our admonition and direction 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>),
 and not barely for the information and entertainment
 of the curious. The prophets, though long since dead, 
 prophesy again by their writings, <I>before peoples and 
 nations</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:11">Rev. x. 11</A>),
 and Solomon's exhortation speaketh
 unto us as unto sons. The subject of the holy scripture
 is universal and perpetual, and therefore of common
 concern.  It is intended, 1. To revive the universal
 and perpetual law of nature, the very remains of 
 which (or ruins rather) in natural conscience, give us 
 hints that we must look somewhere else for a fairer 
 copy. 2. To reveal the universal and perpetual law of 
 grace, which God's common beneficence to the children 
 of men, such as puts them into a better state than 
 that of devils, gives us some ground to expect. The 
 divine authority likewise, which in this book commands 
 our belief and obedience, is universal and perpetual, 
 and knows no limits, either of time or place; it follows,
 therefore, that every nation and every age to which 
 these sacred writings are transmitted are bound to receive 
 them with the same veneration and pious regard 
 that they commanded at their first entrance. Though 
 God hath, in these last days, <I>spoken to us by his Son,</I> 
 yet we are not therefore to think that what he spoke 
 <I>at sundry times and in divers manners to the fathers</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb. i. 1</A>)
 is of no use to us, or that the Old Testament
 is an almanac out of date; no, we are <I>built upon
 the foundation of the prophets,</I> as well as of <I>the apostles,
 Christ himself being the corner-stone</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20">Eph. ii. 20</A>),
 in whom both these sides of this blessed building meet
 and are united: they were those ancient records of
 the Jewish church which Christ and his apostles so oft
 referred to, so oft appealed to, and commanded us
 to search and to take heed to. The preachers of the gospel,
 like Jehoshaphat's judges, wherever they went, 
 had this book of the law with them, and found it a 
 great advantage to them to speak to those <I>that knew
 the law,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:1">Rom. vii. 1</A>.
 That celebrated translation of the Old 
 Testament in the Greek tongue by the Seventy, between 
 200 and 300 years before the birth of Christ, 
 was to the nations a happy preparative for the entertainment 
 of the gospel, by spreading the knowledge 
 of the law; for as the New Testament expounds and 
 completes the Old, and thereby makes it more serviceable 
 to us now than it was to the Jewish church, so 
 the Old Testament confirms and illustrates the New, and 
 shows us Jesus Christ the same yesterday that he 
 is to-day and will be for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That <I>the holy scriptures were not only designed 
 for our learning, but are the settled standing rule of 
 our faith and practice,</I> by which we must be governed 
 now and judged shortly: it is not only a book of general 
 use (so the writings of good and wise men may be), 
 but it is of sovereign and commanding authority, 
 the statute-book of God's kingdom, which our oath of 
 allegiance to him, as our supreme Lord, binds us to 
 the observance of. <I>Whether we will hear or whether we 
 will forbear,</I> we must be told that this is the oracle 
 
 we are to consult and to be determined by, the touchstone
 we are to appeal to and try doctrines by, the 
 rule we are to have an eye to, by which we must in every 
 thing order our affections and conversations, and
 from which we must always take our measures. This is 
 the <I>testimony,</I> this is the <I>law</I> which is bound up and 
 sealed among the disciples, that word according to which 
 if we do not speak, it is because <I>there is no light 
 in us,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:16,20">Isa. viii. 16, 20</A>.
 The making of the <I>light within</I> our
 rule, which by nature is darkness, and by grace is 
 but a copy of, and conformable to, the written work, 
 is setting the judge above the law; and the making 
 of the traditions of the church rivals with the scriptures 
 is no better: it is making the clock, which every 
 one concerned puts backward or forward at pleasure, 
 to correct the sun, that faithful measurer of time and
 days. These are absurdities which, being once granted, 
 thousands follow, as we see by sad experience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That therefore <I>it is the duty of all Christians diligently 
 to search the scriptures, and it is the office of 
 ministers to guide and assist them therein.</I> How useful 
 soever this book of books is in itself, it will be of no 
 use to us if we do not acquaint ourselves with it, by 
 reading it daily, and meditating upon it, that we may 
 understand the mind of God in it, and may apply what 
 we understand to ourselves for our direction, rebuke, 
 and comfort, as there is occasion. It is the character 
 of the holy and happy man that <I>his delight is in the 
 law of the Lord;</I> and, as an evidence thereof, he converses
 with it as his constant companion, and advises 
 with it as his most wise and trusty counsellor, for 
 <I>in that law doth he meditate day and night,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:2">Ps. i. 2</A>.
 It concerns us to be ready in the scriptures, and to make
 ourselves so by constant reading and careful observation,
 and especially by earnest prayer to God for
 the promised gift of the Holy Ghost, whose office it
 is to <I>bring things to our remembrance</I> which Christ
 hath said to us
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>)
 that thus we may have 
 some good word or other at hand for our use in our 
 addresses to God and in our converse with men, in 
 our resistance of Satan and in communing with our own 
 hearts, and may be able, with the good householder,
 to bring out of this treasury <I>things new and old,</I> for the 
 entertainment and edification both of ourselves and 
 others. If any thing will <I>make a man of God perfect</I> in 
 this world, will complete both a Christian and a minister, 
 and <I>thoroughly furnish him for every good work,</I> 
 it must be this. 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:17">2 Tim. iii. 17</A>.
 It concerns us also to 
 be <I>mighty in the scriptures,</I> as Apollos was
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24">Acts xviii. 24</A>),
 that is, to be thoroughly acquainted with the true
 intent and meaning of them, that we may understand
 what we read, and may not misinterpret or misapply
 it, but by the conduct of the blessed Spirit may be
 <I>led into all truth</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:13">John xvi. 13</A>),
 and may hold it fast <I>in 
 faith and love,</I> and put every part of scripture to that 
 use for which it was intended.  The letter, either of 
 law or gospel, profits little without the Spirit. The ministers 
 of Christ are herein ministers to the Spirit for 
 the good of the church; their business is to open and apply 
 the scriptures; thence they must fetch their knowledge, 
 thence their doctrines, devotions, directions, and 
 admonitions, and thence their very language and 
 expression. Expounding the scriptures was the most 
 usual way of preaching in the first and purest ages of 
 the church. What have the Levites to do but to teach Jacob the law 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:10">Deut. xxxiii. 10</A>);
 not only to read it, but 
 to <I>give the sense, and cause them to understand the reading?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:8">Neh. viii. 8</A>.
 <I>How shall they do this except some 
 man guide them?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:31">Acts viii. 31</A>.
 As ministers would hardly 
 be believed without Bibles to back them, so Bibles 
 would hardly be understood without ministers to explain 
 them; but if, having both, we perish in ignorance 
 and unbelief, our blood will be upon our own head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Being fully persuaded therefore of these things, I conclude 
 that whatever help is offered to good Christians 
 in searching the scriptures is real service done to the 
 glory of God, and to the interests of his kingdom among
 men; and it is this that hath drawn me into this undertaking, 
 which I have gone about in weakness, and 
 in fear, and in much trembling
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:3">1 Cor. ii. 3</A>),
 lest I should 
 be found exercising myself in things to high for me, 
 and so laudable an undertaking should suffer damage 
 by an unskilful management. If any desire to know 
 how so mean and obscure a person as I am, who in 
 learning, judgment, felicity of expression, and all advantages 
 for such a service, am <I>less than the least</I> of all 
 my Master's servants, came to venture upon so great
 a work, I can give no other account of it than this: It 
 has long been my practice, what little time I had to 
 spare in my study from the constant preparations for 
 the pulpit, to spend it in drawing up expositions upon 
 some parts of the New Testament, not so much for my 
 own use as purely for my entertainment, because 
 I knew not now to employ my thoughts and time more 
 to my satisfaction.  <I>Trahit sua quemque voluptas--Every 
 man that studies hath some beloved study, which 
 is his delight above any other;</I> and this is mine. It 
 is that learning which it was my happiness from a child 
 to be trained up in, by my ever honoured father, 
 whose memory must always be very dear and precious 
 to me: he often reminded me that a good textuary 
 is a good divine; and that I should read other books 
 with this in my eye, that I might be the better able 
 to understand and apply the scripture. While I was thus
 employing myself came out Mr. Burkitt's Exposition, 
 of the Gospels first, and afterwards of the Act and the 
 Epistles, which met with very good acceptance among 
 serious people, and no doubt, by the blessing of God, 
 will continue to do great service to the church. Soon 
 after he had finished that work, it pleased God to call 
 him to his rest, upon which I was urged, by some 
 of my friends, and was myself inclined, to attempt the 
 like upon the Old Testament, in the strength of the 
 grace of Christ. This upon the <I>Pentateuch</I> is humbly
 offered as a specimen; if it find favour, and be found 
 any way useful, it is my present purpose, in dependence 
 upon divine aids, to go on, so long as God shall 
 continue my life and health, and as my other work will 
 permit. Many helps, I know, we have of this kind 
 in our own language, which we have a great deal of 
 reason to value, and to be very thankful to God for: 
 but the scripture is a subject that can never be exhausted.  
 <I>Semper habet aliquid relegentibus--However 
 frequently we read it, we shall always meet with something 
 new.</I> When David had amassed a vast treasure 
 for the building of the temple, yet saith he to Solomon, 
 <I>Thou mayest add thereto,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14">1 Chron. xxii. 14</A>.
 Such a 
 treasure is scripture-knowledge; it is still capable of
 increase, till we all come to the perfect man. The scripture 
 is a field or vineyard which finds work for variety 
 of hands, and about which may be employed a great 
 <I>diversity of gifts and operations,</I> but all from <I>the same Spirit</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4,6">1 Cor. xii. 4, 6</A>)
 and for the glory of <I>the same Lord.</I> 
 The learned in the languages and in ancient usages 
 have been very serviceable to the church (the 
 blessed occupant of this field), by their curious and 
 elaborate searches into its various products, their anatomies 
 of its plants, and the entertaining lectures they 
 have read upon them. The philology of the critics 
 has been of much more advantage to religion, and lent 
 more light to sacred truth, than the philosophy of the 

 school-divines. The learned also in the arts of war
 have done great service in defending this garden of
 the Lord against the violent attacks of the powers of
 darkness, success fully pleading the cause of the sacred
 writings against the spiteful cavils of atheists, deists, 
 and the profane scoffers of these latter days.  Such as 
 these stand in the posts of honour, and their praise is in 
 all the churches: yet the labours of the vine-dressers 
 and the husbandmen
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:12">2 Kings xxv. 12</A>),
 though they are
 the poor of the land who till this ground, and gather
 in the fruits of it, are no less necessary in their place,
 and beneficial to the household of God, that out of
 these precious fruits every one may have his <I>portion of
 meat in due season.</I> These are the labours to which,
 according to my ability, I have here set my hand. And
 as the plain and practical expositors would not, for
 a world, say of the learned critics, <I>There is no
 need of them; </I> so, it is hoped, those eyes and heads will not
 say to the hands and feet, <I>There is no need of you,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The learned have of late received very great advantage 
 in their searches into this part of holy writ, and 
 the books that follow (and still hope for more), by the 
 excellent and most valuable labours of that great and 
 good man bishop <I>Patrick,</I> whom, for vast reading, solid 
 judgment, and a most happy application to these 
 best of studies, even in his advanced years and honours, 
 succeeding ages no doubt will rank among the first 
 three of commentators, and bless God for him. Mr. <I>Pool's</I> 
 English Annotations (which, having had so many 
 impressions, we may suppose, have got into most hands) 
 are of admirable use, especially for the explaining 
 of scripture-phrases, opening the sense, referring to
 parallel scriptures, and the clearing of difficulties that 
 occur. I have therefore all along been brief upon that 
 which is there most largely discussed, and have industriously 
 declined, as much as I could, what is to be 
 found there; for I would not <I>actum agere--do what 
 is done;</I> nor (if I may be allowed to borrow the apostle's 
 words) <I>boast of things made ready to our hand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:16">2 Cor. x. 16</A>.
 These and other annotations which are 
 referred to the particular words and clauses they are 
 designed to explain are most easy to be consulted upon 
 occasion; but the exposition which (like this) is put 
 into a continued discourse, digested under proper heads,
 is much more easy and ready to be read through 
 for one's own or others' instruction. And, I think, the 
 observing of the connection of each chapter (if there 
 be occasion) with that which goes before, and the general 
 scope of it, with the thread of the history or discourse, 
 and the collecting of the several parts of it, to 
 be seen at one view, will contribute very much to 
 the understanding of it, and will give the mind abundant 
 satisfaction in the general intention, though there 
 may be here and there a difficult word or expression 
 which the best critics cannot easily account for. This, 
 therefore, I have here attempted. But we are concerned 
 not only to understand what we read, but to improve 
 it to some good purpose, and, in order thereunto, to be
 affected with it, and to receive the impressions of 
 it. The word of God is designed to be not only a <I>light 
 to our eyes,</I> the entertaining subject of our contemplation,
 but a <I>light to our feet</I> and a <I>lamp to our paths</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:105">Ps. cxix. 105</A>),
 to direct us in the way of our duty, 
 and to prevent our turning aside into any by-way: we
 must therefore, in searching the scriptures, enquire, 
 not only <I>What is this?</I> but, <I>What is this to us?</I> What use 
 may we make of it? How may we accommodate 
 it to some of the purposes of that divine and heavenly 
 life which, by the grace of God, we are resolved to 
 live? Enquiries of this kind I have here aimed to answer. 
 When the stone is rolled from the well's mouth 
 by a critical explication of the text, still there are those 
 who would both drink themselves and water their
 flocks? but they complain that the <I>well is deep,</I> and 
 <I>they have nothing to draw with;</I> how then shall they 
 <I>come by this living water?</I> Some such may, perhaps, 
 find a bucket here, or water drawn to their hands; and 
 pleased enough shall I be with this office of the Gibeonites, 
 to <I>draw water for the congregation of the Lord</I> 
 out of these wells of salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That which I aim at in the exposition is to give what 
 I thought the genuine sense, and to make it as plain 
 as I could to ordinary capacities, not troubling my readers 
 with the different sentiments of expositors, which 
 would have been to transcribe Mr. <I>Pool's</I> Latin Synopsis, 
 where this is done abundantly to our satisfaction 
 and advantage. As to the practical observations, I have 
 not obliged myself to raise doctrines out of every 
 verse or paragraph, but only have endeavoured to mix 
 with the exposition such hints or remarks as I thought 
 profitable <I>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
 instruction in righteousness,</I> aiming in all to promote 
 practical godliness, and carefully avoiding matters of 
 doubtful disputation and strifes of words. It is only the 
 prevalency of the power of religion in the hearts and lives 
 of Christians that will redress our grievances, and 
 turn our wilderness into a fruitful field. And since our 
 Lord Jesus Christ is the true <I>treasure hidden in the 
 field</I> of the Old Testament, and was the <I>Lamb slain from 
 the foundation of the world,</I> I have been careful 
 to observe what Moses wrote of him, to which he himself 
 oft appealed. In the writings of the prophets we 
 meet with more of the plain and express promises of 
 the Messiah, and the grace of the gospel; but here, 
 in the books of Moses, we find more of the types, both
 real and personal figures of him that was to come--shadows, 
 of which the substance is Christ,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14">Rom. v. 14</A>.
 Those to whom <I>to live is Christ</I> will find in these 
 that which is very instructive and affecting, and which 
 will give great assistance to their faith, and love, and 
 holy joy. This, in a particular manner, we search the 
 scriptures for--to find what they testify of Christ and 
 eternal life,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:39">John v. 39</A>.
 Nor is it any objection against the 
 application of the ceremonial institutions to Christ
 and his grace that those to whom they were given could 
 not discern this sense or use of them; but it is rather
 a reason why we should be very thankful that the veil 
 which was upon their minds in the reading of the 
 Old Testament is <I>done away in Christ,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13,14,18">2 Cor. iii. 13, 14, 18</A>.
 Though they then <I>could not stedfastly look to the
 end of that which is abolished,</I> it does not therefore 
 follow but that we who are happily furnished with a 
 key to these mysteries may in them, <I>as in a glass, behold 
 the glory of the Lord Jesus.</I> And yet, perhaps, the 
 pious Jews saw more of the gospel in their ritual than 
 we think they did; they had at least a general expectation 
 of <I>good things to come,</I> by faith in the promises 
 made to the fathers, as we have of the happiness 
 of heaven, though they could not of that world to come, 
 any more than we can of this, form any distinct 
 or certain idea. Our conceptions of the future state, perhaps, 
 are as dark and confused, as short of the truth 
 and as wide from it, as theirs then were of the kingdom 
 of the Messiah: but God requires faith only according
 to the revelation he gives.  They then were accountable 
 for no more light than they had; and we now are 
 accountable for that greater light which we have in 
 the gospel, by the help of which we may find much 
 more of Christ in the Old Testament than they could. 
 If any think our observations sometimes take rise from 
 
 that which to them seems too minute, let them remember 
 that maxim of the Rabbin, <I>Non est in lege vel 
 una litera &agrave; qu&acirc; non pendent magni montes--The
 law contains not a letter but what bears the weight of 
 mountains.</I> We are sure there is not an idle word in
 the Bible. I would desire the reader not only to read 
 the text entire, before he reads the exposition, but, as 
 the several verses are referred to in the exposition, 
 to cast his eye upon them again, and then he will the 
 better understand what he reads. And, if he have leisure, 
 he will find it of use to him to turn to the scriptures 
 which are sometimes only referred to for brevity's 
 sake, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the declared purpose of the Eternal Mind, in all 
 the operations both of providence and grace, to <I>magnify 
 the law and to make it honourable</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:21">Isa. xlii. 21</A>),
 nay to <I>magnify his word above all his name</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:2">Ps. cxxxviii. 2</A>),
 so that when we pray, <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> we mean 
 this, among other things, Father, magnify the holy 
 Scriptures; and to that prayer, made in faith, we may 
 be sure of that answer which was given to our blessed 
 Saviour when he prayed it, with particular respect to 
 the fulfilling of the scriptures in his own sufferings, 
 <I>I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it yet again,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28">John xii. 28</A>.
 To this great design I humbly desire to
 be some way serviceable, in the strength of that grace 
 by which I am what I am, hoping that what may 
 help to make the reading of the scripture more easy,
 pleasant, and profitable, will be graciously accepted 
 by him that smiled on the widow's two mites cast into 
 the treasury, as an intention to magnify it and make 
 it honourable; and if I can but gain that point, in any 
 measure, with some, I shall think my endeavours abundantly 
 recompensed, however, by others, I and my 
 performances may be vilified and made contemptible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I have now nothing more to add than to recommend 
 myself to the prayers of my friends, and them to 
 the grace of the Lord Jesus; and so rest an unworthy 
 dependent upon that grace, and, through that, an expectant 
 of the <I>glory to be revealed.</I></P>
