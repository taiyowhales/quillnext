 In the former chapter an account was taken of the whole tribe of Levi, 
 in this we have an account of those of that tribe who were in the prime 
 of their time for service, betwixt thirty and fifty years old. 

 I. The serviceable men of the Kohathites are ordered to be numbered, 
 and their charges are given them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
 Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
 &nbsp; 3 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
 all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of
 the congregation.
 &nbsp; 4 This <I>shall be</I> the service of the sons of Kohath in the
 tabernacle of the congregation, <I>about</I> the most holy things:
 &nbsp; 5 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
 sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the
 ark of testimony with it:
 &nbsp; 6 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
 shall spread over <I>it</I> a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
 the staves thereof.
 &nbsp; 7 And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of
 blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls,
 and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be
 thereon:
 &nbsp; 8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
 the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the
 staves thereof.
 &nbsp; 9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the
 candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
 snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
 minister unto it:
 &nbsp; 10 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
 covering of badgers' skins, and shall put <I>it</I> upon a bar.
 &nbsp; 11 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
 and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to
 the staves thereof:
 &nbsp; 12 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry,
 wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put <I>them</I> in a
 cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins,
 and shall put <I>them</I> on a bar:
 &nbsp; 13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and
 spread a purple cloth thereon:
 &nbsp; 14 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof,
 wherewith they minister about it, <I>even</I> the censers, the
 fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of
 the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers'
 skins, and put to the staves of it.
 &nbsp; 15 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
 sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is
 to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear
 <I>it:</I> but they shall not touch <I>any</I> holy thing, lest they die.
 These <I>things are</I> the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
 tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 16 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
 <I>pertaineth</I> the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
 the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, <I>and</I> the
 oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein <I>is,</I> in
 the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.
 &nbsp; 17 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 18 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
 from among the Levites:
 &nbsp; 19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
 they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall
 go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his
 burden:
 &nbsp; 20 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
 covered, lest they die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a second muster of the tribe of Levi. As that tribe was 
 taken out of all Israel to be God's peculiar, so the middle-aged men of 
 that tribe were taken from among the rest to be actually employed in 
 the service of the tabernacle. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who were to be taken into this number. All the males from thirty 
 years old to fifty. Of the other tribes, those that were numbered to go 
 forth to war were from twenty years old and upward, but of the Levites 
 only from thirty to fifty; for the service of God requires the best of 
 our strength, and the prime of our time, which cannot be better spent 
 than to the honour of him who is the first and best. And a man may make 
 a good soldier much sooner than a good minister.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were not to be employed till they were thirty years old, 
 because till then they were in danger of retaining something childish 
 and youthful and had not gravity enough to do the service, and wear the 
 honour, of a Levite. They were entered as probationers at twenty-five 
 years old, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:24"><I>ch.</I> viii. 24</A>),

 and in David's time, when there was more work to be done, at twenty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:24">1 Chron. xxiii. 24</A>,

 and so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8">Ezra iii. 8</A>);

 but they must be five years learning and waiting, and so fitting
 themselves for service; nay, in David's time they were ten years in 
 preparation, from twenty to thirty. John Baptist began his public 
 ministry, and Christ his, at thirty years old. This is not in the 
 letter of it obligatory on gospel ministers now, as if they must either 
 not begin their work till thirty years old or must leave off at fifty; 
 but it gives us two good rules:--

 (1.) That ministers must not be novices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:6">1 Tim. iii. 6</A>.

 It is a work that requires ripeness of judgment and great steadiness,
 and therefore those are very unfit for it who are but babes in 
 knowledge and have not put away childish things.

 (2.) That they must learn before they teach, serve before they rule,
 and must <I>first be proved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:10">1 Tim. iii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were discharged at fifty years old from the toilsome part of 
 the service, particularly that of carrying the tabernacle; for that is 
 the special service to which they are here ordained, and which there 
 was most occasion for while they were in the wilderness. When they 
 began to enter upon old age, they were dismissed, 

 (1.) In favour to them, that they might no be over-toiled when their
 strength began to decay. Twenty years' good service was thought pretty 
 well for one man.

 (2.) In honour to the work, that it might not be done by those who,
 through the infirmities of age, were slow and heavy. The service of God 
 should be done when we are in the most lively active frame. Those do 
 not consider this who put off their repentance to old age, and so leave 
 the best work to be done in the worst time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How their work is described. They are said to <I>enter into the 
 host,</I> or warfare, <I>to do the work in the tabernacle.</I> The 
 ministry is <I>a good work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:1">1 Tim. iii. 1</A>):

 ministers are not ordained to the honour only, but to the labour, not
 only to have the wages, but to do the work. It is also a <I>good 
 warfare,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:18">1 Tim. i. 18</A>.

 Those that enter into the ministry must look upon themselves as entered
 into the <I>host,</I> and approve themselves <I>good soldiers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:3">2 Tim. ii. 3</A>.

 Now, as to the sons of Kohath in particular, here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their service appointed them, in the removes of the tabernacle. 
 Afterwards, when the tabernacle was fixed, they had other work assigned 
 them; but this was the work of the day, which was to be done in its 
 day. Observe, Wherever the camp of Israel went, the tabernacle of the 
 Lord went with them, and care must be taken for the carriage of it. 
 Note, Wherever we go, we must see to it that we take our religion along 
 with us, and not forget that or any part of it. Now the Kohathites 
 were to carry all the holy things of the tabernacle. They were charged 
 with those things before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:31"><I>ch.</I> iii. 31</A>),

 but here they have more particular instructions given them.

 (1.) Aaron, and his sons the priests, must pack up the things which the
 Kohathites were to carry, as here directed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 &c. God had before appointed that none should come into the most holy 
 place, but only Aaron once a year with a cloud of incense 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:2">Lev. xvi. 2</A>);

 and yet, the necessity of their unsettled state requiring it, that law
 is here dispensed with; for every time they removed Aaron and his sons 
 went in to take down the ark, and make it up for carriage; for (as the 
 learned bishop Patrick suggests) the <I>shechinah,</I> or display of 
 the divine majesty, which was over the mercy-seat, removed for the 
 present in the pillar of cloud, which was taken up, and then the ark 
 was not dangerous to be approached.

 (2.) All the holy things must be covered, the ark and table with three
 coverings, all the rest with two. Even the ashes of the altar, in which 
 the holy fire was carefully preserved and raked up, must have a purple 
 cloth spread over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Even the brazen altar, though in the court of the sanctuary it stood 
 open to the view of all, yet was covered in the carriage of it. All 
 these coverings were designed,

 [1.] For safety, that these holy things might not be ruffled with the 
 wind, sullied with the rain, nor tarnished with the sun, but that they 
 might be preserved in their beauty; for <I>on all the glory shall be a 
 defence.</I> The coverings of badgers' skins, being thick and strong, 
 would keep out wet; and, while we are in our passage through the 
 wilderness of this world, it concerns us to be fenced <I>for all 
 weathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5,6">Isa. iv. 5, 6</A>.

 [2.] For decency and ornament. Most of these things had a cloth of
 blue, or purple, or scarlet, spread outmost; and the ark was covered 
 with a cloth <I>wholly of blue</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 an emblem (say some) of the azure skies, which are spread like a 
 curtain between us and the Majesty on high, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:9">Job xxvi. 9</A>.

 Those that are faithful to God should endeavour likewise to appear
 beautiful before men, that they may <I>adorn the doctrine of God our 
 Saviour.</I>

 [3.] For concealment. It signified the darkness of that dispensation.
 That which is now brought to light by the gospel, and revealed to 
 babes, was then hidden from the wise and prudent. They saw only the 
 coverings, not the holy things themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>);

 but now Christ has <I>destroyed the face of the covering,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:7">Isa. xxv. 7</A>.

 (3.) When all the holy things were covered, then the Kohathites were to
 carry them on their shoulders.  These things that had staves were 
 carried by their staves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:6,8,11,14"><I>v.</I> 6, 8, 11, 14</A>);

 those that had not were carried upon a bar, or bier, or bearing barrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:10,12"><I>v.</I> 10, 12</A>.

 See how the tokens of God's presence in this world are movable things; 
 but we look for a kingdom that cannot be moved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Eleazar, now the eldest son of Aaron, is appointed overseer of the 
 Kohathites in this service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 he must take care that nothing was forgotten, left behind, or 
 displaced. As a priest he had more honour than the Levites, but then he 
 had more care; and that care was a heavier burden, no doubt, upon his 
 heart, than all the burdens that were laid upon their shoulders. It is 
 much easier to do the work of the tabernacle than to discharge the 
 trusts of it, to obey than to rule.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Great care must be taken to preserve the lives of these Levites, by 
 preventing their unseasonable irreverent approach to the most holy 
 things: <I>Cut you not off the Kohathites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, Those who do not what they can to keep others from sin do what 
 they can to cut them off.

 [1.] The Kohathites must not see the holy things till the priests had 
 covered them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Even those that bore the vessels of the Lord saw not what they bore, so 
 much were even those in the dark concerning the gospel whose office it 
 was to expound the law. And,

 [2.] When the holy things were covered, they might not touch them, at
 least not the ark, called here <I>the holy thing,</I> upon pain of 
 death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>.

 Uzza was struck dead for the breach of this law. Thus were the Lord's 
 ministers themselves then kept in fear, and that was a dispensation of 
 terror, as well as darkness; but now, through Christ, the case is 
 altered; we have <I>seen with our eyes,</I> and our <I>hands have 
 handles, the word of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John  i. 1</A>), 

 and we are encouraged to <I>come boldly to the throne of grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 22 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
 houses of their fathers, by their families;
 &nbsp; 23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
 thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do
 the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 24 This <I>is</I> the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
 serve, and for burdens:
 &nbsp; 25 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
 tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of
 the badgers' skins that <I>is</I> above upon it, and the hanging for
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
 &nbsp; 26 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door
 of the gate of the court, which <I>is</I> by the tabernacle and by the
 altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
 their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
 serve.
 &nbsp; 27 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
 service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and
 in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge
 all their burdens.
 &nbsp; 28 This <I>is</I> the service of the families of the sons of Gershon
 in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge <I>shall
 be</I> under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
 &nbsp; 29 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after
 their families, by the house of their fathers;
 &nbsp; 30 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
 shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service,
 to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 31 And this <I>is</I> the charge of their burden, according to all
 their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards
 of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
 and sockets thereof,
 &nbsp; 32 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
 and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and
 with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
 instruments of the charge of their burden.
 &nbsp; 33 This <I>is</I> the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
 according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
 priest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the charge of the other two families of the Levites, 
 which, though not so honourable as the first, yet was necessary, and 
 was to be done regularly. 

 1. The Gershonites were charged with all the drapery of the tabernacle,
 the curtains, and hangings, and the coverings of badgers' skins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:22-26"><I>v.</I> 22-26</A>.

 These they were to take down when the cloud removed, and the ark and 
 the rest of the holy things were carried away, to pack up and bring 
 with them, and then to set up again, where the cloud rested.  Aaron and 
 his sons allotted to them their respective charge: "You shall take care 
 of such a curtain, and you of such a hanging, that every one may know 
 his work, and there may be no confusion," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Ithamar particularly was to take the oversight of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 2. The Merarites were charged with the heavy carriage, the boards and
 bars, the pillars and sockets, the pins and cords, and these were 
 delivered to them by name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 An inventory was given them of every particular, that it might be 
 forthcoming, and nothing to seek, when the tabernacle was to be set up 
 again. Though these seemed of less importance than the other things 
 pertaining to the sanctuary, yet there was this care taken of them, to 
 teach us with the greatest exactness to preserve pure and entire all 
 divine institutions, and to take care that nothing be lost. It also 
 intimates the care God takes of his church, and every member of it; the 
 good Shepherd <I>calls his own sheep by name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:3">John x. 3</A>.

 Here were thousands of men employed about these services, though a much
 less number would have served for the bearing of those burdens; but it 
 was requisite that the tabernacle should be taken down, and set up, 
 with great expedition, and many hands would make quick work, especially 
 when every one knew his work. They had tents of their own to take care 
 of, and to take along with them, but the young men under thirty, and 
 the old men above fifty, might serve for them; nor is there any mention 
 of them, for God's house must always be preferred before our own. Their 
 care was preposterous who built and ceiled their own houses while God's 
 house lay waste, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:4,9">Hag. i. 4, 9</A>.

 The death of the saints is represented as the taking down of the
 tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1">2 Cor. v. 1</A>),

 and the putting of it off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:14">2 Pet. i. 14</A>.

 The immortal soul, like the most holy things, is first covered and
 taken away, carried by angels, unseen, under the inspection of the Lord 
 Jesus, our Eleazar. Care is also taken of the body--the skin and flesh, 
 which are as the curtains, the bones and sinews which are as the bars 
 and pillars; none of these shall be lost; commandment is given 
 concerning the bones, a covenant made with the dust; these are in safe 
 custody, and shall all be produced in the great day, when this 
 tabernacle shall be set up again, and these vile bodies made like the 
 glorious body of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation
 numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and
 after the house of their fathers,
 &nbsp; 35 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
 every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
 tabernacle of the congregation:
 &nbsp; 36 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
 two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
 &nbsp; 37 These <I>were</I> they that were numbered of the families of the
 Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
 congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the
 commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the hand of Moses.
 &nbsp; 38 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
 throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,
 &nbsp; 39 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
 every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
 tabernacle of the congregation,
 &nbsp; 40 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
 families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and

 sons of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle

 &nbsp; 43 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
 every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the

 were three thousand and two hundred.

 every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
 service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation,
 &nbsp; 48 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand

 We have here a particular account of the numbers of the three families 
 of the Levites respectively, that is, of the effective men, between 
 thirty years old and fifty. Observe, 

 1. The Kohathites were, in all, 8600 from a month old and upwards; but
 of these there were but 2750 serviceable men, not a third part. The 
 Gershonites, in all, 7500, and of them but 2630 serviceable men, little 
 more than a third part. Note, Of the many that add to the numbers of 
 the church, there are comparatively but few that contribute to the 
 service of it. So it has been, and so it is; many have a place in the 
 tabernacle that do but little of the work of the tabernacle,

 2. That the Merarites were but 6200 in all, and yet of these there were
 3200 serviceable men, that is, more than half. The greatest burden lay 
 upon that family, the boards, and pillars, and sockets; and God so 
 ordered it that, though they were the fewest in number, yet they should 
 have the most able men among them; for whatever service God calls men 
 to he will furnish them for it, and give strength in proportion to the 
 work, grace sufficient. 

 3. The whole number of the able men of the tribe of Levi who entered
 into God's host to war his warfare was but 8580, whereas the able men 
 of the other tribes that entered into the host of Israel to war their 
 warfare were many more. The least of the tribes had almost four times 
 as many able men as the Levites, and some of them more than eight times 
 as many; for those that are engaged in the service of this world, and 
 war after the flesh, are many more than those that are devoted to the 
 service of God, and <I>fight the good fight of faith.</I></P>
