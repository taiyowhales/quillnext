 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter shows more particularly what was said in general 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:19"><I>ch.</I> ix. 19</A>),
 concerning the three sons of Noah, that "of them
 was the whole earth overspread;" and the fruit of that blessing 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1,7"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1, 7</A>),
 "replenish the earth." Is is the only certain 
 account extant of the origin of nations; and yet perhaps there is no 
 nation but that of the Jews that can be confident from which of 
 these seventy fountains (for so many there are here) it derives 
 its streams. Through the want of early records, the mixtures of 
 people, the revolutions of nations, and distance of time, the 
 knowledge of the lineal descent of the present inhabitants of 
 the earth is lost; nor were any genealogies preserved but those 
 of the Jews, for the sake of the Messiah, only in this chapter we 
 have a brief account,

 I. Of the posterity of Japheth,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 II. The posterity of Ham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:6-20">ver. 6-20</A>),
 and in this particular notice is taken of Nimrod,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 III. The posterity of Shem,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:21-32">ver. 21</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now these <I>are</I> the generations 
 of the sons of Noah, Shem, 
 Ham, and Japheth: and unto them 
 were sons born after the flood.
 &nbsp; 2 The 
 sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, 
 and Madai, and Javan, and 
 Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
 &nbsp; 3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, 
 and Riphath, and Togarmah.
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 the sons of Javan; Elishah, and 
 Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
 &nbsp; 5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles 
 divided in their lands; every 
 one after his tongue, after their families, 
 in their nations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses begins with Japheth's family, either 
 because he was the eldest, or because his 
 family lay remotest from Israel and had least 
 concern with them at the time when Moses 
 wrote, and therefore he mentions that race 
 very briefly, hastening to give an account of 
 the posterity of Ham, who were Israel's enemies 
 and of Shem, who were Israel's ancestors; 
 for it is the church that the scripture 
 is designed to be the history of, and of the 
 nations of the world only as they were some 
 way or other related to Israel and interested 
 in the affairs of Israel. Observe, 
 
 1. Notice 
 is taken that the sons of Noah had sons born 
 to them after the flood, to repair and rebuild 
 the world of mankind which the flood had 
 ruined. He that had killed now makes alive. 
 
 2. The posterity of Japheth were allotted to 
 the isles of the Gentiles 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 which were 
 solemnly, by lot, after a survey, divided 
 among them, and probably this island of 
 ours among the rest; all places beyond the 
 sea from Judea are called <I>isles</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:22">Jer. xxv. 22</A>),
 and this directs us to understand that promise 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4">Isa. xlii. 4</A>),
 <I>the isles shall wait for his 
 law,</I> of the conversion of the Gentiles to the 
 faith of Christ.</P>

 Nimrod the mighty hunter before the

 &nbsp; 10 And the beginning of his 
 kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
 Accad, and Calneh, in the land of 
 Shinar.
 &nbsp; 11 Out of that land went 
 forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, 
 and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
 &nbsp; 12 And Resen between Nineveh and 
 Calah: the same <I>is</I> a great city.
 &nbsp; 13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and 
 Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
 &nbsp; 14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, 
 (out of whom came Philistim,)
 and Caphtorim.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That which is observable and improvable 
 in these verses is the account here given of 
 Nimrod, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.
 He is here 
 represented as a great man in his day: <I>He began to be a 
 mighty one in the earth,</I> that is, whereas those 
 that went before him were content to stand 
 upon the same level with their neighbours, 
 and though every man bore rule in his own 
 house yet no man pretended any further, 
 Nimrod's aspiring mind could not rest here; 
 he was resolved to tower above his neighbours, 
 not only to be eminent among them, 
 but to lord it over them. The same spirit 
 that actuated the giants before the flood 
 (who became <I>mighty men, and men of renown,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>),
 now revived in him, so soon 
 was that tremendous judgment which the 
 pride and tyranny of those mighty men 
 brought upon the world forgotten. Note, 
 There are some in whom ambition and affectation 
 of dominion seem to be bred in the 
 bone; such there have been and will be, 
 notwithstanding the wrath of God often revealed 
 from heaven against them. Nothing 
 on this side hell will humble and break the 
 proud spirits of some men, in this like Lucifer, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:14,15">Isa. xiv. 14, 15</A>.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nimrod was a great hunter; with this 
 he began, and for this became famous to a 
 proverb. Every great hunter is, in remembrance 
 of him, called a <I>Nimrod.</I> 
 
 1. Some 
 think he did good with his hunting, served 
 his country by ridding it of the wild beasts 
 which infested it, and so insinuated himself 
 into the affections of his neighbours, and 
 got to be their prince. Those that exercise 
 authority either are, or at least would be 
 called, <I>benefactors,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25">Luke xxii. 25</A>.

 2. Others 
 think that under pretence of hunting he 
 gathered men under his command, in pursuit 
 of another game he had to play, which 
 was to make himself master of the country 
 and to bring them into subjection. He was 
 a <I>mighty hunter,</I> that is, he was a violent invader 
 of his neighbours' rights and properties, 
 and a persecutor of innocent men, carrying 
 all before him, and endeavouring to 
 make all his own by force and violence. He 
 thought himself a mighty prince, but <I>before 
 the Lord</I> (that is, in God's account) he was 
 but a <I>mighty hunter.</I> Note, Great conquerors 
 are but great hunters. Alexander 
 and Cesar would not make such a figure in 
 scripture-history as they do in common history; 
 the former is represented in prophecy 
 but as a he-goat pushing, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:5">Dan. viii. 5</A>.
 Nimrod 
 was a mighty hunter <I>against</I> the Lord, 
 so the LXX; that is, (1.) He set up idolatry, 
 as Jeroboam did, for the confirming of his 
 usurped dominion. That he might set up a 
 new government, he set up a new religion 
 upon the ruin of the primitive constitution 
 of both. <I>Babel was the mother of harlots.</I> 
 Or, 
 
 (2.) He carried on his oppression and 
 violence in defiance of God himself, daring 
 Heaven with his impieties, as if he and his 
 huntsmen could out-brave the Almighty, 
 and were a match for the Lord of hosts
 and all his armies. <I>As if it were a small thing to 
 weary men, he thinks to weary my God also,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13">Isa. vii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nimrod was a great ruler: <I>The beginning 
 of his kingdom was Babel,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Some 
 way or other, by arts or arms, he got into 
 power, either being chosen to it or forcing 
 his way to it; and so laid the foundations of 
 a monarchy, which was afterwards a head of 
 gold, and the terror of the mighty, and bade 
 fair to be universal. It does not appear 
 that he had any right to rule by birth; but 
 either his fitness for government recommended 
 him, as some think, to an election, 
 or by power and policy he advanced gradually, 
 and perhaps insensibly, into the 
 throne. See the antiquity of civil government, 
 and particularly that form of it which 
 lodges the sovereignty in a single person. 
 If Nimrod and his neighbours began, other 
 nations soon learned to incorporate under 
 one head for their common safety and welfare, 
 which, however it began, proved so 
 great a blessing to the world that things were 
 reckoned to go ill indeed when there <I>was no 
 king in Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Nimrod was a great builder. Probably 
 he was architect in the building of Babel, and 
 there he began his kingdom; but, when his 
 project to rule all the sons of Noah was 
 baffled by the confusion of tongues, <I>out of 
 that land he went forth into Assyria</I> (so the 
 margin reads it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 <I>and built Nineveh,</I> &c.,
 that, having built these cities, he might command 
 them and rule over them. Observe, 
 in Nimrod, the nature of ambition. 
 
 1. It is 
 boundless. Much would have more, and still 
 cries, <I>Give, give.</I> 
 
 2. It is restless. Nimrod, 
 when he had four cities under his command, 
 could not be content till he had four more. 
 
 3. It is expensive. Nimrod will rather be 
 at the charge of rearing cities than not have 

 <A NAME="Page77"> </A>

 the honour of ruling them. The spirit of 
 building is the common effect of a spirit of 
 pride. 
 
 4. It is daring, and will stick at nothing. 
 Nimrod's name signifies rebellion, 
 which (if indeed he did abuse his power to 
 the oppression of his neighbours) teaches us 
 that tyrants to men are rebels to God, and 
 their <I>rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Canaan begat Sidon his 
 firstborn, and Heth,
 &nbsp; 16 And the 
 Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the 
 Girgasite,
 &nbsp; 17 And the Hivite, and 
 the Arkite, and the Sinite,
 &nbsp; 18 And 
 the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and 
 the Hamathite: and afterward were 
 the families of the Canaanites spread 
 abroad.
 &nbsp; 19 And the border of the 
 Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
 comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou 
 goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, 
 and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto 
 Lasha.
 &nbsp; 20 These <I>are</I> the sons of 
 Ham, after their families, after their 
 tongues, in their countries, <I>and</I> in 
 their nations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 1. The account of the posterity 
 of Canaan, of the families and nations 
 that descended from him, and of the land 
 they possessed, is more particular than of any 
 other in this chapter, because these were the 
 nations that were to be subdued before Israel, 
 and their land was in process of time to 
 become the holy land, <I>Immanuel's land;</I> and 
 this God had an eye to when, in the mean 
 time, he cast the lot of that accursed devoted 
 race in that spot of ground which he had selected 
 for his own people; this Moses takes 
 notice of, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8">Deut. xxxii. 8</A>,
 <I>When the Most 
 High divided to the nations their inheritance, 
 he set the bounds of the people according 
 to the number of the children of Israel.</I> 
 
 2. By this account it appears that the posterity 
 of Canaan were numerous, and rich, and 
 very pleasantly situated; and yet Canaan 
 was under a curse, a divine curse, and not a 
 curse causeless. Note, Those that are under 
 the curse of God may yet perhaps thrive and 
 prosper greatly in this world; for we cannot 
 know love or hatred, the blessing or the 
 curse, by what is before us, but by what is 
 within us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:1">Eccl. ix. 1</A>.
 The curse of God 
 always works really and always terribly: 
 but perhaps it is a secret curse, a curse to 
 the soul, and does not work visibly, or a 
 slow curse, and does not work immediately; 
 but sinners are by it reserved for, and bound 
 over to, a day of wrath. Canaan here has a 
 better land than either Shem or Japheth, 
 and yet they have a better lot, for they inherit 
 the blessing.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 Unto Shem also, the father of 
 all the children of Eber, the brother 
 of Japheth the elder, even to him 
 were <I>children</I> born.
 &nbsp; 22 The children 
 of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, 
 and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
 &nbsp; 23 And the children of Aram; Uz, 
 and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
 &nbsp; 24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and 
 Salah begat Eber.
 &nbsp; 25 And unto 
 Eber were born two sons: the name 
 of one <I>was</I> Peleg; for in his days was 
 the earth divided; and his brother's
 name <I>was</I> Joktan.
 &nbsp; 26 And Joktan 
 begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and 
 Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
 &nbsp; 27 And 
 Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
 &nbsp; 28 And Obal, and Abimael, and 
 Sheba,
 &nbsp; 29 And Ophir, and Havilah, 
 and Jobab: all these <I>were</I> the sons
 of Joktan.
 &nbsp; 30 And their dwelling 
 was from Mesha, as thou goest unto 
 Sephar a mount of the east.
 &nbsp; 31 These <I>are</I> the sons of Shem, after 
 their families, after their tongues, in 
 their lands, after their nations.
 &nbsp; 32 These <I>are</I> the families of the sons of 
 Noah, after their generations, in their 
 nations: and by these were the nations
 divided in the earth after the flood.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things especially are observable in 
 this account of the posterity of Shem:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The description of Shem, <I>v.</I> 21. We 
 have not only his name, <I>Shem,</I> which signifies 
 <I>a name,</I> but two titles to distinguish him by:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was <I>the father of all the children of 
 Eber.</I> Eber was his great grandson; but why 
 should he be called the father of all <I>his</I> children, 
 rather than of all Arphaxad's, or Salah's, 
 &c.? Probably because Abraham and his 
 seed, God's covenant-people, not only descended 
 from Heber, but from him were called 
 <I>Hebrews;</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:13"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 13</A>,
 <I>Abram the Hebrew.</I> 
 Paul looked upon it as his privilege that he 
 was a <I>Hebrew of the Hebrews,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:5">Phil. iii. 5</A>.
 Eber himself, we may suppose, was a man 
 eminent for religion in a time of general 
 apostasy, and a great example of piety to his 
 family; and, the holy tongue being commonly 
 called from him the <I>Hebrew,</I> it is 
 probable that he retained it in his family, 
 in the confusion of Babel, as a special token 
 of God's favour to him; and from him the 
 professors of religion were called <I>the children 
 of Eber.</I> Now, when the inspired penman 
 would give Shem an honourable title, 
 he calls him <I>the father of the Hebrews.</I> 
 Though when Moses wrote this, they were 
 a poor despised people, bond-slaves in Egypt, 
 yet, being God's people, it was an honour to 
 a man to be akin to them. As Ham, though 
 he had many sons, is disowned by being 
 called <I>the father of Canaan,</I> on whose seed 

 <A NAME="Page78"> </A>

 the <I>curse</I> was entailed 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:22"><I>ch.</I> ix. 22</A>),
 so Shem, 
 though he had many sons, is dignified with 
 the title of <I>the father of Eber,</I> on whose seed 
 the blessing was entailed. Note, a family of 
 saints is more truly honourable than a family 
 of nobles, Shem's holy seed than Ham's royal 
 seed, Jacob's twelve patriarchs than Ishmael's 
 twelve princes, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:20"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 20</A>.
 Goodness is true 
 greatness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was <I>the brother of Japheth the elder,</I> 
 by which it appears that, though Shem is commonly 
 put first, he was not Noah's first-born, 
 but Japheth was older. But why should this 
 also be put as part of Shem's title and description, 
 that he <I>was
 the brother of Japheth,</I> 
 since it had been, in effect, said often before? 
 And was he not as much brother to Ham? 
 Probably this was intended to signify the 
 union of the Gentiles with the Jews in the 
 church. The sacred historian had mentioned 
 it as Shem's honour that he was the father 
 of the Hebrews; but, lest Japheth's seed 
 should therefore be looked upon as for ever 
 shut out from the church, he here reminds 
 us that he <I>was the brother of Japheth,</I> not 
 in birth only, but in blessing; for <I>Japheth 
 was to dwell in the tents of Shem.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) Those are brethren in the best manner that 
 are so by grace, and that meet in the covenant 
 of God and in the communion of saints. 
 
 (2.) God, in dispensing his grace, does not go 
 by seniority, but the younger sometimes gets 
 the start of the elder in coming into the church; 
 <I>so the last shall be first and the first last.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reason of the name of Peleg 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 Because <I>in his days</I> (that is, about the 
 time of his birth, when his name was given 
 him), <I>was the earth divided</I> among the children 
 of men that were to inhabit it; either 
 when Noah divided it by an orderly distribution 
 of it, as Joshua divided the land of Canaan 
 by lot, or when, upon their refusal to 
 comply with that division, God, in justice, 
 divided them by the confusion of tongues: 
 whichsoever of these was the occasion, pious 
 Heber saw cause to perpetuate the remembrance 
 of it in the name of his son; and 
 justly may our sons be called by the same 
 name, for in our days, in another sense, is the 
 earth, the church, most wretchedly divided.</P>
