 Orders having been given before for the dividing of the land of Canaan 
 among the lay-tribes (as I may call them), care is here taken for a 
 competent provision for the clergy, the tribe of Levi, which ministered 
 in holy things. 

 I. Forty-eight cities were to be assigned them, with their suburbs, 
 some in every tribe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Six cities out of these were to be for cities of refuge, for any
 man that killed another unawares, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>.

 In the law concerning these observe, 

 1. In what case sanctuary was not allowed, namely, that of wilful
 murder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>.

 2. In what cases it was allowed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.

 3. What was the law concerning those that took shelter in these cities
 of refuge,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
 <I>near</I> Jericho, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
 Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
 in; and ye shall give <I>also</I> unto the Levites suburbs for the
 cities round about them.
 &nbsp; 3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs
 of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
 all their beasts.
 &nbsp; 4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
 Levites, <I>shall reach</I> from the wall of the city and outward a
 thousand cubits round about.
 &nbsp; 5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
 two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits,
 and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side
 two thousand cubits; and the city <I>shall be</I> in the midst: this
 shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
 &nbsp; 6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
 <I>there shall be</I> six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
 for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall
 add forty and two cities.
 &nbsp; 7 <I>So</I> all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites <I>shall
 be</I> forty and eight cities: them <I>shall ye give</I> with their
 suburbs.
 &nbsp; 8 And the cities which ye shall give <I>shall be</I> of the
 possession of the children of Israel: from <I>them that have</I> many
 ye shall give many; but from <I>them that have</I> few ye shall give
 few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites
 according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The laws about the tithes and offerings had provided very plentifully 
 for the maintenance of the Levites, but it was not to be thought, nor 
 indeed was it for the public good, that when they came to Canaan they 
 should all live about the tabernacle, as they had done in the 
 wilderness, and therefore care must be taken to provide habitations for 
 them, in which they might live comfortably and usefully. It is this 
 which is here taken care of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Cities were allotted them, with their suburbs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They were not to have any ground for tillage; they needed not to 
 <I>sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns,</I> for their heavenly Father 
 fed them with the tithe of the increase of other people's labours, that 
 they might the more closely attend to the study of the law, and might 
 have more leisure to teach the people; for they were not fed thus 
 easily that they might live in idleness, but that they might give 
 themselves wholly to the business of their profession, and not be 
 entangled in the affairs of this life. 

 1. Cities were allotted them, that they might live near together, and
 converse with one another about the law, to their mutual edification; 
 and that in doubtful cases they might consult one another, and in all 
 cases strengthen one another's hands. 

 2. These cities had suburbs annexed to them for their cattle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 a thousand cubits from the wall was allowed them for out-houses to keep 
 their cattle in, and then two thousand more for fields to graze their 
 cattle in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Thus was care taken that they should not only live, but live 
 plentifully, and have all desirable conveniences about them, that they 
 might not be looked upon with contempt by their neighbours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. These cities were to be assigned them out of the possessions of 
 each tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. That each tribe might thus make a grateful acknowledgment to God out 
 of their real as well as out of their personal estates (for what was 
 given to the Levites was accepted as given to the Lord) and thus their 
 possessions were sanctified to them.  

 2. That each tribe might have the benefit of the Levites' dwelling
 among them, to <I>teach them the good knowledge of the Lord;</I> thus 
 that light was diffused through all parts of the country, and none were 
 left to sit in darkness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:10">Deut. xxxiii. 10</A>,

 <I>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments.</I> Jacob's curse on Levi's
 anger was, <I>I will scatter them in Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:7">Gen. xlix. 7</A>.

 But that curse was turned into a blessing, and the Levites, by being 
 thus scattered, were put into a capacity of doing so much the more 
 good. It is a great mercy to a country to be replenished in all parts 
 with faithful ministers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The number allotted them was forty-eight in all, four out of each
 of the twelve tribes, one with another. Out of the united tribes of
 Simeon and Judah nine, out of Naphtali three, and four apiece out of
 the rest, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:1-45">Josh. xxi</A>.

 Thus were they blessed with a good
 ministry, and that ministry with a comfortable maintenance, not only in 
 tithes, but in glebe-lands. And, though the gospel is not so particular 
 as the law was in this matter, yet it expressly provides that he that 
 is <I>taught in the word</I> should <I>communicate unto him that 
 teaches in all good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:6">Gal. vi. 6</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
 ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
 &nbsp; 11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
 you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person
 at unawares.
 &nbsp; 12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the
 avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
 congregation in judgment.
 &nbsp; 13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
 have for refuge.
 &nbsp; 14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
 cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, <I>which</I> shall be
 cities of refuge.
 &nbsp; 15 These six cities shall be a refuge, <I>both</I> for the children
 of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
 them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
 thither.
 &nbsp; 16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
 die, he <I>is</I> a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
 death.
 &nbsp; 17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
 die, and he die, he <I>is</I> a murderer: the murderer shall surely be
 put to death.
 &nbsp; 18 Or <I>if</I> he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith
 he may die, and he die, he <I>is</I> a murderer: the murderer shall
 surely be put to death.
 &nbsp; 19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when
 he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
 &nbsp; 20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
 wait, that he die;
 &nbsp; 21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
 smote <I>him</I> shall surely be put to death; <I>for</I> he <I>is</I> a
 murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he
 meeteth him.
 &nbsp; 22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
 upon him any thing without laying of wait,
 &nbsp; 23 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing <I>him</I>
 not, and cast <I>it</I> upon him, that he die, and <I>was</I> not his
 enemy, neither sought his harm:
 &nbsp; 24 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
 revenger of blood according to these judgments:
 &nbsp; 25 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the
 hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
 him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall
 abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed
 with the holy oil.
 &nbsp; 26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border
 of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;
 &nbsp; 27 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of
 the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the
 slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
 &nbsp; 28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
 until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
 high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
 possession.
 &nbsp; 29 So these <I>things</I> shall be for a statute of judgment unto
 you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
 &nbsp; 30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
 by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
 against any person <I>to cause him</I> to die.
 &nbsp; 31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
 murderer, which <I>is</I> guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
 to death.
 &nbsp; 32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to
 the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
 land, until the death of the priest.
 &nbsp; 33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye <I>are:</I> for blood
 it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
 blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
 &nbsp; 34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit,
 wherein I dwell: for I the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> dwell among the children of
 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the orders given concerning the cities of refuge, fitly 
 annexed to what goes before, because they were all Levites' cities. In 
 this part of the constitution there is a great deal both of good law 
 and pure gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a great deal of good law, in the case of murder and 
 manslaughter, a case of which the laws of all nations have taken
 particular cognizance. It is here enacted and provided, consonant to 
 natural equity,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That wilful murder should be punished with death, and in that case 
 no sanctuary should be allowed, no ransom taken, nor any commutation of 
 the punishment accepted: The <I>murderer shall surely be put to 
 death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 It is supposed to be done <I>of hatred</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 or <I>in enmity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 upon a sudden provocation (for our Saviour makes rash anger, as well as 
 malice prepense, to be murder,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21,22">Matt. v. 21, 22</A>),

 whether the person be murdered with an instrument of iron 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 or wood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 or with a stone thrown at him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:17,20"><I>v.</I> 17, 20</A>);

 nay, if he smite him with his hand in enmity, and death ensue, it is 
 murder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>);

 and it was an ancient law, consonant to the law of nature, that 
 <I>whoso sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>.

 Where wrong has been done restitution must be made; and, since the
 murderer cannot restore the life he has wrongfully taken away, his own 
 must be exacted from him in lieu of it, not (as some have fancied) to 
 satisfy the manes or ghost of the person slain, but to satisfy the law 
 and the justice of a nation; and to be a warning to all others not to 
 do likewise. It is here said, and it is well worthy the consideration 
 of all princes and states, <I>that blood defiles</I> not only the 
 conscience of the murderer, who is thereby proved <I>not to have 
 eternal life abiding in him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1 John iii. 15</A>),

 but also the land in which it is shed; so very offensive is it to God 
 and all good men, and the worst of nuisances. And it is added that 
 <I>the land cannot be cleansed</I> from the blood of the murdered, but 
 by the blood of the murderer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 If murderers escape punishment from men, those that suffer them to 
 escape will have a great deal to answer for, and God will nevertheless 
 not suffer them to escape his righteous judgments.  Upon the same 
 principle it is provided that no satisfaction should be taken for the 
 <I>life of a murderer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):
 
 <I>If a man would give all the substance of his house</I> to the 
 judges, to the country, or to the avenger of blood, to atone for his 
 crime, it must <I>utterly be contemned.</I> The redemption of the life 
 is so precious that it cannot be obtained by the <I>multitude of 
 riches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49"6-8">Ps. xlix. 6-8</A>),

 which perhaps may allude to this law. A rule of law comes in here
 (which is a rule of our law in cases of treason only) that no man shall 
 be put to death upon the testimony of one witness, but it was necessary 
 there should be two

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 this law is settled in all capital cases,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:6,19:15">Deut. xvii. 6; xix. 15</A>.

 And, <I>lastly,</I> not only the prosecution, but the execution, of the 
 murderer, is committed to the next of kin, who, as he was to be the 
 redeemer of his kinsman's estate if it were mortgaged, so he was to be 
 the <I>avenger of his blood if he were murdered</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer,</I> if he be
 convicted by the <I>notorious evidence of the fact,</I> and he needed 
 not to have recourse by a judicial process to the court of judgment.  
 But if it were uncertain who the murderer was, and the proof doubtful, 
 we cannot think that his bare suspicion, or surmise, would empower him 
 to do that which the judges themselves could not do but upon the 
 testimony of two witnesses. Only if the fact were plain then the next 
 heir of the person slain might himself, in a just indignation, slay the 
 murderer wherever he met him. Some think this must be understood to be 
 after the lawful judgment of the magistrate, and so the Chaldee says, 
 "He shall slay him, <I>when he shall be condemned unto him by 
 judgment;</I>" but it should seem, by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 that the judges interposed only in a doubtful case, and that if the 
 person on whom he took vengeance was indeed the murderer, and a wilful 
 murderer, the avenger was innocent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 only, if it proved otherwise, it was at his peril. Our law allows an 
 appeal to be brought against a murderer by the widow, or next heir, of 
 the person murdered, yea, though the murderer have been acquitted upon 
 an indictment; and, if the murderer be found guilty upon that appeal, 
 execution shall be awarded at the suit of the appellant, who may 
 properly be called <I>the avenger of blood.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But if the homicide was not voluntary, nor done designedly, if it 
 was <I>without enmity, or lying in wait</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 not <I>seeing</I> the person or not <I>seeking his harm</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which our law calls chance-medley, or homicide <I>per 
 infortunium--through misfortune,</I> in this case there were cities of 
 refuge appointed for the manslayer to flee to. By our law this incurs a 
 forfeiture of goods, but a pardon is granted of course upon the special 
 matter found. Concerning the cities of refuge the law was, 

 (1.) That, if a man killed another, in these cities he was safe, and 
 under the protection of the law, till he had his trial <I>before the 
 congregation,</I> that is, before the judges in open court. If he 
 neglected thus to surrender himself, it was at his peril; if the 
 avenger of blood met him elsewhere, or overtook him loitering in his 
 way to the city of refuge, and slew him, his blood was upon his own 
 head, because he did not make use of the security which God had 
 provided for him.

 (2.) If, upon trial, it were found to be willful murder, the city of
 refuge should no longer be a protection to him; it was already 
 determined: <I>Thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:14">Exod. xxi. 14</A>.

 (3.) But if it were found to be by error or accident, and that the
 stroke was given without any design upon the life of the person slain
 or any other, then the man-slayer should continue safe in <I>the city
 of refuge,</I> and the avenger of blood might not meddle with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 There he was to remain in banishment from his own house and patrimony 
 <I>till the death of the high priest;</I> and, if at any time he went 
 out of that city or the suburbs of it, he put himself out of the 
 protection of the law, and the avenger of blood, if he met him, might 
 slay him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.
 
 Now, 

 [1.] By the preservation of the life of the man-slayer God would teach 
 us that men ought not to suffer for that which is rather their 
 unhappiness than their crime, rather the act of Providence than their 
 own act, for <I>God delivered him into his hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:13">Exod. xxi. 13</A>.

 [2.] By the banishment of the man-slayer from his own city, and his 
 confinement to the city of refuge, where he was in a manner a prisoner, 
 God would teach us to conceive a dread and horror of the guilt of 
 blood, and to be very careful of life, and always afraid lest by 
 oversight or negligence we occasion the death of any. 

 [3.] By the limiting of the time of the offender's banishment to the 
 death of the high priest, an honour was put upon that sacred office. 
 The high priest was to be looked upon as so great a blessing to his 
 country that when he died their sorrow upon that occasion should 
 swallow up all other resentments. The cities of refuge being all of 
 them Levites' cities, and the high priest being the head of that tribe, 
 and consequently having a peculiar dominion over these cites, those 
 that were confined to them might properly be looked upon as his 
 prisoners, and so his death must be their discharge; it was, as it 
 were, at his suit that the delinquent was imprisoned, and therefore at 
 his death it fell. <I>Actio moritur cum persona--The suit expires with 
 the party.</I> Anisworth has another notion of it, That as the high 
 priests, while they lived, by their service and sacrificing made 
 atonement for sin, wherein they prefigured Christ's satisfaction, so, 
 at their death, those were released that had been exiled for casual 
 murder, which typified redemption in Israel. 

 [4.] By the abandoning of the prisoner to the avenger of blood, in case
 he at any time went out of the limits of the city of refuge, they were 
 taught to adhere to the methods which Infinite Wisdom prescribed for 
 their security. It was for the honour of a remedial law that it should 
 be so strictly observed.  How can we expect to be saved if we neglect 
 the salvation, which is indeed a great salvation!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a great deal of good gospel couched under the type and 
 figure of the cities of refuge; and to them the apostle seems to allude 
 when he speaks of our <I>fleeing for refuge to the hope set before 
 is</I>

 and being <I>found in Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9">Phil. iii. 9</A>.

 We never read in the history of the Old Testament of any use made of
 these cities of refuge, any more than of other such institutions, which 
 yet, no doubt, were made use of upon the occasions intended; only we 
 read of those that, in dangerous cases, took hold of <I>the horns of 
 the altar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:50,2:28">1 Kings i. 50; ii. 28</A>);

 for the altar, wherever that stood, was, as it were the capital <I>city
 of refuge.</I> But the law concerning these cities was designed both to 
 raise and to encourage the expectations of those who looked for 
 redemption in Israel, which should be to those who were convinced of 
 sin, and in terror by reason of it, as the cities of refuge were to the 
 man-slayer. Observe, 

 1. There were several cities of refuge, and they were so appointed in
 several parts of the country that the man-slayer, wherever he dwelt in 
 the land of Israel, might in half a day reach one or other of them; so, 
 though there is but one Christ appointed for our refuge, yet, wherever 
 we are, he is a refuge at hand, a very present help, for <I>the word is 
 nigh us</I> and Christ in the word. 

 2. The man-slayer was safe in any of these cities; so in Christ 
 believers that flee to him, and rest in him, are protected from the 
 wrath of God and the curse of the law.  <I>There is no condemnation to 
 those that are in Christ Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1">Rom. viii. 1</A>.

 Who shall condemn those that are thus sheltered?

 3. They were all Levites' cities; it was a kindness to the poor
 prisoner that though he might not go up to the place where the ark was, 
 yet he was in the midst of Levites, who would teach him the good 
 knowledge of the Lord, and instruct him how to improve the providence 
 he was now under. It might also be expected that the Levites would 
 comfort and encourage him, and bid him welcome; so it is the work of 
 gospel ministers to bid poor sinners welcome to Christ, and to assist 
 and counsel those that through grace are in him. 

 4. Even strangers and sojourners, though they were not native
 Israelites, might take the benefit of these cities of refuge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 So in Christ Jesus no difference in made between Greek and Jew; even 
 the <I>sons of the stranger</I> that by faith flee to Christ shall be 
 safe in him. 

 5. Even the suburbs or borders of the city were a sufficient security
 to the offender,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 So there is virtue even in the hem of Christ's garment for the healing 
 and saving of poor sinners. If we cannot reach to a full assurance, we 
 may comfort ourselves in a good hope through grace. 

 6. The protection which the man-slayer found in the city of refuge was 
 not owing to the strength of its walls, or gates, or bars, but purely 
 to the divine appointment; so it is the word of the gospel that gives 
 souls safety in Christ, <I>for him hath God the Father sealed.</I> 

 7.  If the offender was ever caught struggling out of the borders of
 his city of refuge, or stealing home to his house again, he lost the 
 benefit of his protection, and lay exposed to the avenger of blood; so 
 those that are in Christ must abide in Christ, for it is at their peril 
 if they forsake him and wander from him. <I>Drawing back is to 
 perdition.</I></P>
