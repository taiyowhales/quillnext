 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Enough had been done in the chapter before to quash all pretensions of 
 the families of the tribe of Levi that would set up in competition with 
 Aaron, and to make it appear that Aaron was the head of the tribe; but 
 it seems, when that matter was settled, the princes of the rest of the 
 tribes began to murmur. If the head of a tribe must be a priest, why 
 not the head of some other tribe than that of Levi? He that searches 
 the heart knew this thought to be in the breast of some of them, and 
 before it broke out into any overt act graciously anticipated it, to 
 prevent bloodshed; and it is done by miracle in this chapter, not a 
 miracle of wrath, as before, but of grace. 

 I. The matter is put upon trial by the bringing of twelve rods, one for
 each prince, before the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. Upon trial, the matter is determined by the miraculous blossoming
 of Aaron's rod,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 III. The decision of the controversy is registered by the preservation
 of the rod,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 IV. The people acquiesce in it with some reluctance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
 them a rod according to the house of <I>their</I> fathers, of all
 their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
 rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
 one rod <I>shall be</I> for the head of the house of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
 congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
 &nbsp; 5 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> the man's rod, whom I shall
 choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
 murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against
 you.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
 their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
 according to their fathers' houses, <I>even</I> twelve rods: and the
 rod of Aaron <I>was</I> among their rods.
 &nbsp; 7 And Moses laid up the rods before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the tabernacle
 of witness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. Orders given for the bringing in of a rod for every tribe (which was 
 peculiarly significant, for the word here used for a rod sometimes 
 signifies a tribe, as particularly

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 13</A>),

 that God by a miracle, wrought on purpose, might make it known on whom
 he had conferred the honour of the priesthood.

 1. It seems then the priesthood was a preferment worth seeking and
 striving for, even by the princes of the tribes. It is an honour to the 
 greatest of men to be employed in the service of God. Yet perhaps these 
 contended for it rather for the sake of the profit and power that 
 attended the office than for the sake of that in it which was divine 
 and sacred. 

 2. It seems likewise, after all that had been done to settle this
 matter, there were those who would be ready upon any occasion to 
 contest it. They would not acquiesce in the divine appointment, but 
 would make an interest in opposition to it. They strive with God for 
 the dominion; and the question is whose will shall stand. God will 
 rule, but Israel will not be ruled; and this is the quarrel. 

 3. It is an instance of the grace of God that, having wrought divers
 miracles to punish sin, he would work one more on purpose to prevent 
 it. God has effectually provided that the obstinate shall be left 
 inexcusable, and every mouth shall be stopped. Israel were very prone 
 to murmur both against God and against their governors. "Now," said 
 God, "<I>I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>.

 If any thing will convince them, they shall be convinced; and, if this 
 will not convince them, nothing will." This was to be to them, as 
 Christ said the sign of the prophet Jonas (that is, his own 
 resurrection) should be to the men of that generation, the highest 
 proof of his mission that should be given them.  The directions are,

 (1.) That twelve rods or staves should be brought in. It is probable
 that they were not now fresh cut out of a tree, for then the miracle 
 would not have been so great; but that they were the staves which the 
 princes ordinarily used as ensigns of their authority (of which we read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:18"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 18</A>),

 old dry staves, that had no sap in them, and it is probable that they
 were all made of the almond-tree.  It should seem they were but twelve 
 in all, with Aaron's, for, when Levi comes into the account, Ephraim 
 and Manasseh make but one, under the name of Joseph.

 (2.) That the name of each prince should be written upon his rod, that
 every man might know his own, and to prevent contests. Writing is often 
 a good preservative against strife, for what is written may be appealed 
 to.

 (3.) That they should be laid up in the tabernacle, for one night,
 before the testimony, that is, before the ark, which, with its mercy 
 seat, was a symbol, token, or testimony, of God's presence with them.

 (4.) They were to expect, being told it before, that the rod of the
 tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud and 
 blossom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It was requisite that they should be told of it, that it might appear 
 not to be casual, but according to the counsel and will of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparing of the rods accordingly. The princes brought them in, 
 some of them perhaps fondly expecting that the choice would fall upon 
 them, and all of them thinking it honour enough to be competitors with 
 Aaron, and to stand candidates, even for the priesthood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 and <I>Moses laid them up before the Lord.</I> He did not object that 
 the matter was sufficiently settled already, and enough done to 
 convince those that were not invincibly hardened in their prejudices. 
 He did not undertake to determine the controversy himself, though it 
 might easily have been done; nor did he suggest that it would be to no 
 purpose to offer satisfaction to a people that were willingly blind. 
 But, since God will have it so, he did his part, and lodged the case 
 before the Lord, to whom the appeal was made by consent, and left it 
 with him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
 tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
 house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
 blossoms, and yielded almonds.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto
 all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man
 his rod.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
 the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
 thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
 die not.
 &nbsp; 11 And Moses did <I>so:</I> as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded him, so did he.
 &nbsp; 12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
 we die, we perish, we all perish.
 &nbsp; 13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The final determination of the controversy concerning the priesthood 
 by a miracle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 The rods or staves were brought out from the most holy place where they 
 were laid up, and publicly produced before the people; and, while all 
 the rest of the rods remained as they were, Aaron's rod only, of a dry 
 stick, became a living branch, budded, and blossomed, and yielded 
 almonds. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, in others 
 fruit, at the same time. This was miraculous, and took away all 
 suspicion of a fraud, as if in the night Moses had taken away Aaron's 
 rod, and put a living branch of an almond tree in the room of it; for 
 no ordinary branch would have buds, blossoms, and fruits upon it, all 
 at once.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This was a plain indication to the people that Aaron was chosen to 
 the priesthood, and not any other of the princes of the tribes. Thus he 
 was distinguished from them and manifested to be under the special 
 blessing of heaven, which sometimes yields increase where there is 
 neither planting nor watering by the hand of man. Bishop Hall here 
 observes that fruitfulness is the best evidence of a divine call, and 
 that the plants of God's setting, and the boughs cut off from them, 
 will flourish. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:12-14">Ps. xcii. 12-14</A>.

 The trees of the Lord, though they seem dry trees, are full of sap.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was a very proper sign to represent the priesthood itself, which
 was hereby confirmed to Aaron. 

 (1.) That it should be fruitful and serviceable to the church of God.
 It produced not only blossoms, but almonds; for the priesthood was 
 designed, not only for an honour to Aaron, but for a blessing to 
 Israel. Thus Christ ordained his apostles and ministers that they 
 should go and bring forth fruit, and that their <I>fruit should 
 remain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:16">John xv. 16</A>.

 (2.) That there should be a succession of priests.  Here were not only
 almonds for the present, but buds and blossoms promising more 
 hereafter. Thus has Christ provided in his church that a seed should 
 serve him from generation to generation.

 (3.) That yet this priesthood should not be perpetual, but in process
 of time, like the branches and blossoms of a tree, should fail and 
 wither. The flourishing of the almond-tree is mentioned as one of the 
 signs of old age, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:5">Eccl. xii. 5</A>.

 This character was betimes put upon the Mosaic priesthood, which soon
 became old and <I>ready to vanish away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was a type and figure of Christ and his priesthood: for he is 
 <I>the man, the branch,</I> that is to be <I>a priest upon his 
 throne,</I> as it follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12">Zech. vi. 12</A>);

 and he was to <I>grow up before God,</I> as this before the ark,
 <I>like a tender plant, and a root out of a dry ground,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The record of this determination, by the preserving of the rod 
 before the testimony, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--that it might be had
 in perpetual remembrance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 It is probable that the buds, and blossoms, and fruit, continued fresh; 
 the same divine power that produced them in a night preserved them for 
 ages, at least so long as it was necessary for a token against the 
 rebels. So it was a standing miracle, and the continuance of it was an 
 undeniable proof of the truth of it. Even the leaf of God's trees shall 
 not wither,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3">Ps. i. 3</A>.

 This rod was preserved, as the censers were, to <I>take away their
 murmurings, that they die not.</I> Note,

 1. The design of God in all his providences, both mercies and
 judgments, and in the memorials of them, is to take away sin, and to 
 prevent it. These things are done, these things written, <I>that we sin 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1 John ii. 1</A>.

 Christ was <I>manifested to take away sin.</I>
 
 2. What God does for the taking away of sin is done in real kindness to
 us, <I>that we die not.</I> All the bitter potions he gives, and all 
 the sharp methods he uses with us, are for the cure of a disease which 
 otherwise would certainly be fatal.  Bishop Hall observes here that the 
 tables of the law, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod, were preserved 
 together in or about the ark (the apostle takes notice of them all 
 three together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:4">Heb. ix. 4</A>),

 to show to after-ages how the ancient church was taught, and fed, and
 ruled; and he infers how precious the doctrine, sacraments, and 
 government, of the church are to God and should be to us. The rod of 
 Moses was used in working many miracles, yet we do not find that this 
 was preserved, for the keeping of it would serve only to gratify men's 
 curiosity; but the rod of Aaron, which carried its miracle along with 
 it, was carefully preserved, because that would be of standing use to 
 convince men's consciences, to silence all disputes about the 
 priesthood, and to confirm the faith of God's Israel in his 
 institutions. Such is the difference between the sacraments which 
 Christ has appointed for edification and the relics which men have 
 devised for superstition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The outcry of the people hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 <I>Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. Shall we be consumed with 
 dying?</I> This may be considered as the language either,

 1. Of a repining people quarrelling with the judgments of God, which,
 by their own pride and obstinacy, they had brought upon themselves. 
 They seem to speak despairingly, as if God was a hard Master, that 
 sought advantage against them, and took all occasions to pick quarrels 
 with them, so that if they trod every so little awry, if they stepped 
 ever so little beyond their bounds, they must die, they must perish, 
 they must all perish, basely insinuating that God would never be 
 satisfied with their blood and ruin, till he had made an end of them 
 all and they were consumed with dying. Thus they seem to be like a 
 <I>wild bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>),

 fretting that God was too hard for them and that they were forced to
 submit, which they did only because they could not help it.  Note, It 
 is a very wicked thing to fret against God when we are in affliction, 
 and in our distress thus to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, 
 it is owing to ourselves, and the blame will lie upon our own heads. 
 Or,

 2. Of a repenting people. Many interpreters take it as expressing their 
 submission: "Now we see that it is the will of God we should keep our 
 distance, and that it is at our peril if we draw nearer than is 
 appointed. We submit to the divine will in this appointment; we will 
 not contend any more, lest we all perish:" and they engage Moses to 
 intercede for them, that they may not be all consumed with dying.  Thus 
 the point was gained, and in this matter God quite took away their 
 murmurings, and henceforward they acquiesced. Note, When God judges he 
 will over come, and, one way or other, will oblige the most obstinate 
 gainsayers to confess their folly sooner or later, and that wherein 
 they dealt proudly he was above them. <I>Vicisti Galil&aelig;e--O
 Galil&aelig;an, thou hast conquered!</I></P>
