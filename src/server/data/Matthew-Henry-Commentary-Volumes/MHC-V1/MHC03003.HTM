 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the law concerning the peace-offerings, whether
 they were, 
 
 I. Of the heard, a bullock or a heifer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 Or,

 II. Of the flock, either a lamb

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>)

 or a goat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.
 
 The ordinances concerning each of these are much the same, yet they are
 repeated, to show the care we ought to take that all our services be 
 done according to the appointment and the pleasure God takes in the 
 services that are so performed. It is likewise to intimate what need we 
 have of precept upon precept, and line upon line.</P>

 offer <I>it</I> of the herd; whether <I>it be</I> a male or female, he
 shall offer it without blemish before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and

 Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar
 round about.
 &nbsp; 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
 offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; the fat that covereth the

 &nbsp; 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that <I>is</I> on them, which
 <I>is</I> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the
 kidneys, it shall he take away.
 &nbsp; 5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
 sacrifice, which <I>is</I> upon the wood that <I>is</I> on the fire: <I>it

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The burnt-offerings had regard to God as in himself the best of beings, 
 most perfect and excellent; they were purely expressive of adoration, 
 and therefore were wholly burnt. But the peace-offerings had regard to 
 God as a benefactor to his creatures, and the giver of all good things 
 to us; and therefore these were divided between the altar, the priest, 
 and the owner. Peace signifies, 

 1. Reconciliation, concord, and communion. And so these were called
 <I>peace-offerings,</I> because in them God and his people did, as it 
 were, feast together, in token of friendship. The priest, who was 
 ordained for men in things pertaining to God, gave part of this 
 peace-offering to God (that part which he required, and it was fit he 
 should be first served), burning it upon God's altar; part he gave to 
 the offerer, to be eaten by him with his family and friends; and part 
 he took to himself, as the days-man that laid his hand upon them both. 
 They could not thus eat together unless they were agreed; so that it 
 was a symbol of friendship and fellowship between God and man, and a 
 confirmation of the covenant of peace. 

 2. It signifies prosperity and all happiness: <I>Peace be to you</I>
 was as much as, <I>All good</I> be to you; and so the peace-offerings 
 were offered either,

 (1.) By way of supplication or request for some good that was wanted 
 and desired. If a man was in the pursuit or expectation of any mercy, 
 he would back his prayer for it with a peace-offering, and probably put 
 up the prayer when he laid his hand upon the head of his offering. 
 Christ is our peace, our peace-offering; for through him alone it is 
 that we can expect to obtain mercy, and an answer of peace to our 
 prayers; and in him an upright prayer shall be acceptable and 
 successful, though we bring not a peace-offering. The less costly our 
 devotions are the more lively and serious they should be. Or,

 (2.) By way of thanksgiving for some particular mercy received. It is 
 called <I>a peace-offering of thanksgiving,</I> for so it was 
 sometimes; as in other cases <I>a vow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:15,16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 15, 16</A>.

 And some make the original word to signify <I>retribution.</I> When
 they had received any special mercy, and were enquiring what they 
 should render, this they were directed to render to the God of their 
 mercies as a grateful acknowledgment for the benefit done to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12">Ps. cxvi. 12</A>.

 And we must offer to God the sacrifice of praise continually, by Christ 
 our peace; and then this shall please the Lord better than an ox or 
 bullock.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As to the matter of the peace-offering, suppose it was of the herd, 
 it must be <I>without blemish;</I> and, if it was so, it was 
 indifferent whether it was male or female, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 In our spiritual offerings, it is not the sex, but the heart, that God 
 looks at, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As to the management of it. 

 1. The offerer was, by a solemn manumission, to transfer his interest 
 in it to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and, with <I>his hand on the head</I> of the sacrifice, to acknowledge 
 the particular mercies for which he designed this a thank-offering, or, 
 if it was a vow, to make his prayer.

 2. It must be killed; and, although this might be done in any part of
 the court, yet it is said to be <I>at the door of the tabernacle,</I> 
 because the mercies received or expected were acknowledged to come from 
 God, and the prayers or praises were directed to him, and both, as it 
 were, through that door. Our Lord Jesus has said, <I>I am the door,</I> 
 for he is indeed the door of the tabernacle. 

 3. The priest must <I>sprinkle the blood upon the altar,</I> for it was
 the blood that made atonement for the soul; and, though this was not a 
 sin-offering, yet we must be taught that in all our offerings we must 
 have an eye to Christ as the propitiation for sin, as those who know 
 that the best of their services cannot be accepted unless through him 
 their sins be pardoned. Penitent confessions must always go along with 
 our thankful acknowledgments; and, whatever mercy we pray for, in order 
 to it we must pray for the removal of guilt, as that which keeps good 
 things from us. First <I>take away all iniquity,</I> and then 
 <I>receive us graciously,</I> or <I>give good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>.

 4. All the fat of the inwards, that which we call the tallow and suet,
 with the caul that encloses it and the kidneys in the midst of it, were 
 to be taken away, and burnt upon the altar, as an offering <I>made by 
 fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 And this was all that was sacrificed to the Lord out of the 
 peace-offering; how the rest was to be disposed of we shall find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:11-34"><I>ch.</I> vii. 11</A>,

 &c. It is ordered to be burnt upon the burnt-sacrifice, that is, the
 daily burnt-offering, the lamb which was offered every morning before 
 any other sacrifice was offered; so that the fat of the peace-offerings 
 was an addition to that, and a continuation of it. The great sacrifice 
 of peace, that of the Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the 
 world, prepares the altar for our sacrifices of praise, which are not 
 accepted till we are reconciled.  Now the burning of this fat is 
 supposed to signify,

 (1.) The offering up of our good affections to God in all our prayers 
 and praises. God must have the inwards; for we must pour out our souls, 
 and lift up our hearts, in prayer, and must bless his name with all 
 that is within us. It is required that we be inward with God in every 
 thing wherein we have to do with him. The fat denotes the best and 
 choicest, which must always be devoted to God, who has made for us a 
 feast of fat things.

 (2.) The mortifying of our corrupt affections and lusts, and the 
 burning up of them by the fire of divine grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:5">Col. iii. 5</A>.

 Then we are truly thankful for former mercies, and prepared to receive
 further mercy, when we part with our sins, and have our minds cleared 
 from all sensuality by the <I>spirit of judgment</I> and the <I>spirit 
 of burning,</I>

 &nbsp; 6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto

 &nbsp; 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and

 <I>is</I> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the

 Directions are here given concerning the peace-offering, if it was a 
 sheep or a goat. Turtle-doves or young pigeons, which might be brought 
 for whole burnt offerings, were not allowed for peace-offerings, 
 because they have no fat considerable enough to be burnt upon the 
 altar; and they would be next to nothing if they were to be divided 
 according to the law of the peace-offerings. The laws concerning a lamb 
 or goat offered for a peace offering are much the same with those 
 concerning a bullock, and little now occurs here; but, 

 1. The rump of the mutton was to be burnt with the fat of the inwards 
 upon the altar, the <I>whole rump</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 because in those countries it was very fat and large. Some observe from 
 this that, be a thing ever so contemptible, God can make it honourable, 
 by applying it to his service. Thus God is said to give more 
 <I>abundant honour to that part which lacked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12"23,24">1 Cor. xii. 23, 24</A>.

 2. That which was burnt upon the altar is called the <I>food of the
 offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:11,16"><I>v.</I> 11, 16</A>.

 It fed the holy fire; it was acceptable to God as our food is to us; 
 and since in the tabernacle God did, as it were, keep house among them, 
 by the offerings on the altar he kept a good table, as Solomon in his 
 court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:22-28">1 Kings iv. 22</A>, &c.

 3. Here is a general rule laid down, that <I>all the fat is the
 Lord's</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and a law made thereupon, that they <I>should eat neither fat nor 
 blood,</I> no, not in their private houses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) As for the <I>fat,</I> it is not meant of that which is 
 interlarded with the meat (that they might eat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Neh+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>),

 but the fat of the inwards, the suet, which was always God's part out
 of the sacrificed beasts; and therefore they must not eat of it, no, 
 not out of the beasts that they killed for their common use. Thus would 
 God preserve the honour of that which was sacred to himself. They must 
 not only not feed upon that fat which was to be the food of the altar, 
 but not upon any like it, lest the <I>table of the Lord</I> (as the 
 altar is called), if something were not reserved peculiar to it, should 
 become contemptible, and <I>the fruit thereof, even its meat, 
 contemptible,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7,12">Mal. i. 7, 12</A>.

 (2.) The blood was universally forbidden likewise, for the same reason 
 that the fat was, because it was God's part of every sacrifice.  The 
 heathen drank the blood of their sacrifices; hence we read of their 
 <I>drink-offerings of blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:4">Ps. xvi. 4</A>.

 But God would not permit the blood, that made atonement, to be used as
 a common thing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb. x. 29</A>),

 nor will he allow us, though we have the comfort of the atonement made,
 to assume to ourselves any share in the honour of making it. He that 
 glories, let him glory in the Lord, and to his praise let all the blood 
 be poured out.</P>
