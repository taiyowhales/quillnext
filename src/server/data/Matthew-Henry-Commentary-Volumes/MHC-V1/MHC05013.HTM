 Moses is still upon that necessary subject concerning the peril of 
 idolatry. In the close of the foregoing chapter he had cautioned them 
 against the peril that might arise from their predecessors the 
 Canaanites. In this chapter he cautions them against the rise of 
 idolatry from among themselves; they must take heed lest any should 
 draw them to idolatry, 

 1. By the pretence of prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. By the pretence of friendship and relation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 III. By the pretence of numbers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:12-18">ver. 12-18</A>.

 But in all these cases the temptation must be resolutely resisted and
 the tempters punished and cut off.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
 and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,
 &nbsp; 2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake
 unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast
 not known, and let us serve them;
 &nbsp; 3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or
 that dreamer of dreams: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God proveth you, to
 know whether ye love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God with all your heart and
 with all your soul.
 &nbsp; 4 Ye shall walk after the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and fear him, and keep
 his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and
 cleave unto him.
 &nbsp; 5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
 death; because he hath spoken to turn <I>you</I> away from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
 redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of
 the way which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God commanded thee to walk in. So
 shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A very strange supposition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 1. It is strange that there should arise any among themselves,
 especially any pretending to vision and prophecy, who should instigate 
 them to <I>go and serve other gods.</I> Was it possible that any who 
 had so much knowledge of the methods of divine revelation as to be able 
 to personate a prophet should yet have so little knowledge of the 
 divine nature and will as to go himself and entice his neighbours 
 <I>after other gods?</I> Could an Israelite ever be guilty of such 
 impiety? Could a man of sense ever be guilty of such absurdity? We see 
 it in our own day, and therefore may think it the less strange; 
 multitudes that profess both learning and religion yet exciting both 
 themselves and others, not only to worship God by images, but to give 
 divine honour to saints and angels, which is no better than <I>going 
 after other gods to serve them;</I> such is the power of strong 
 delusions. 

 2. It is yet more strange that the sign or wonder given for the
 confirmation of this false doctrine should come to pass. Can it be 
 thought that God himself should give any countenance to such a vile 
 proceeding? Did ever a false prophet work a true miracle?  It is only 
 supposed here for two reasons:--

 (1.) To strengthen the caution here given against hearkening to such a
 one. "Though it were possible that he should work a true miracle, yet 
 you must not believe him if he tell you that you must serve other gods, 
 for the divine law against that is certainly perpetual and 
 unalterable." The supposition is like that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8">Gal. i. 8</A>,

 <I>If we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to
 you</I>--which does not prove it possible that an angel should preach 
 another gospel, but strongly expresses the certainty and perpetuity of 
 that which we have received. So here,

 (2.) It is to fortify them against the danger of impostures and lying 
 wonders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:9">2 Thess. ii. 9</A>):

 "Suppose the credentials he produces be so artfully counterfeited that
 you cannot discern the cheat, nor disprove them, yet, if they are 
 intended to draw you to the service of other gods, that alone is 
 sufficient to disprove them; no evidence can be admitted against so 
 clear a truth as that of the unity of the Godhead, and so plain a law 
 as that of worshipping the <I>one only living and true God.</I>" We 
 cannot suppose that the God of truth should set his seal of miracles to 
 a lie, to so gross a lie as is supposed in that temptation, <I>Let us 
 go after other gods.</I> But if it be asked, Why is this false prophet 
 permitted to counterfeit this broad seal? It is answered here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "<I>The Lord you God proveth you.</I> He suffers you to be set upon by
 such a temptation to try your constancy, that both those that are 
 perfect and those that are false and corrupt may be made manifest. It 
 is to prove you; therefore see that you acquit yourselves well in the 
 trial, and stand your ground."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a very necessary charge given in this case,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Not to yield to the temptation: "<I>Thou shalt not hearken to the 
 worlds of that prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Not only thou shalt not do the thing he tempts thee to, but thou shalt
 not so much as patiently hear the temptation, but reject it with the 
 utmost disdain and detestation. Such a suggestion as this is not to be 
 so much as parleyed with, but the ear must be stopped against it. 
 <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I>" Some temptations are so grossly vile 
 that they will not bear a debate, nor may we so much as give them the 
 hearing. What follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>You shall walk after the Lord,</I> may be looked upon, 

 (1.) As prescribing a preservative from the temptation: "Keep close to
 your duty, and you keep out of harm's way. God never leaves us till we 
 leave him." Or, 

 (2.) As furnishing us with an answer to the temptation; say, "It is
 written, <I>Thou shalt walk after the Lord,</I> and <I>cleave unto 
 him;</I> and therefore what have I to do with idols?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Not to spare the tempter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 That prophet shall be <I>put to death,</I> both to punish him for the
 attempt he has made (the seducer must die, though none were seduced by 
 him--a design upon the crown is treason) and to prevent his doing 
 further mischief. This is called <I>putting away the evil.</I> There is 
 no way of removing the guilt but by removing the guilty; if such a 
 criminal be not punished, those that should punish him make themselves 
 responsible. And thus the <I>mischief must be put away;</I> the 
 infection must be kept from spreading by cutting off the gangrened 
 limb, and putting away the mischief-makers.  such Dangerous diseases as 
 these must be taken in time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
 daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which <I>is</I> as
 thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve
 other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
 &nbsp; 7 <I>Namely,</I> of the gods of the people which <I>are</I> round about
 you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the <I>one</I> end of
 the earth even unto the <I>other</I> end of the earth;
 &nbsp; 8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him;
 neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare,
 neither shalt thou conceal him:
 &nbsp; 9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first
 upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
 people.
 &nbsp; 10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because
 he hath sought to thrust thee away from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which
 brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
 &nbsp; 11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more
 any such wickedness as this is among you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Further provision is made by this branch of the statute against 
 receiving the infection of idolatry from those that are near and dear 
 to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is the policy of the tempter to send his solicitations by the 
 hand of those whom we love, whom we least suspect of any ill design 
 upon us, and whom we are desirous to please and apt to conform 
 ourselves to. The enticement here is supposed to come from a brother or 
 child that are near by nature, from a wife or friend that are near by 
 choice, and are to us <I>as our own souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Satan tempted Adam by Eve and Christ by Peter. We are therefore
 concerned to stand upon our guard against a bad proposal when the 
 person that makes it can pretend to an interest in us, that we many 
 never sin against God in compliment to the best friend we have in the 
 world. The temptation is supposed to be private: he will <I>entice thee 
 secretly,</I> implying that idolatry is a work of darkness, which 
 dreads the light and covets to be concealed, and in which the sinner 
 promises himself, and the tempter promises him, secrecy and security. 
 Concerning the false gods proposed to be served,

 1. The tempter suggests that the worshipping of these gods was the
 common practice of the world; and, if they limited their adorations to 
 an invisible Deity, they were singular, and like nobody, for these gods 
 were the <I>gods of the people round about them,</I> and indeed of all 
 the nations of the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This suggestion draws many away from religion and godliness, that it is
 an unfashionable thing; and they make their court to the world and the 
 flesh because these are the <I>gods of the people that are round about 
 them.</I>

 2.  Moses suggests, in opposition to this, that it had not been the
 practice of their ancestors; they are gods which <I>thou hast not 
 known, thou nor thy fathers.</I> Those that are born of godly parents, 
 and have been educated in pious exercises, when they are enticed to a 
 vain, loose, careless way of living should remember that those are ways 
 which <I>they have not known, they nor their fathers.</I> And will they 
 thus degenerate?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is our duty to prefer God and religion before the best friends 
 we have in the world. 

 1. We must not, in complaisance to our friends, break God's law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt not consent to him.</I> nor go with him to his
 idolatrous worship, no, not for company, or curiosity, or to gain a 
 better interest in is affections." It is a general rule, <I>If sinners 
 entice thee, consent thou not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:10">Prov. i. 10</A>.

 2. We must not, in compassion to our friends, obstruct the course of
 God's justice. He that attempts such a thing must not only be looked 
 upon as an enemy, or dangerous person, whom one should be afraid of, 
 and swear the peace against, but as a criminal or traitor, whom, in 
 zeal for our sovereign Lord, his crown and dignity, we are bound to 
 inform against, and cannot conceal without incurring the guilt of a 
 great misprision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Thou shalt surely kill him.</I> By this law the persons enticed were
 bound to the seducer, and to give evidence against him before the 
 proper judges, that he might suffer the penalty of the law, and that 
 without delay, which the Jews say is here intended in that phrase, as 
 it is in the Hebrew, <I>killing thou shalt kill him.</I> Neither the 
 prosecution nor the execution must be deferred; and he that was first 
 in the former must be first in the latter, to show that he stood to his 
 testimony: "<I>Thy hand shall be first upon him,</I> to mark him out as 
 an anathema, and then the hands of all the people, to put him away as 
 an accursed thing." The death he must die was that which was looked 
 upon among the Jews as the severest of all deaths. He must be stoned: 
 and his accusation written is that he has sought to thrust thee away, 
 by a kind of violence, <I>from the Lord they God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Those are certainly our worst enemies that would <I>thrust us from
 God,</I> our best friend; and whatever draws us to sin, separates 
 between us and God, is a design upon our life, and to be resented 
 accordingly, And, lastly, here is the good effect of this necessary 
 execution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>All Israel shall hear and fear.</I> They <I>ought to hear and
 fear;</I> for the punishment of crimes committed is designed <I>in 
 terrorem--to terrify,</I> and so to prevent their repetition. And it is 
 to be hoped they will hear and fear, and by the severity of the 
 punishment, especially when it is at the prosecution of a father, a 
 brother, or a friend, will be made to conceive a horror of the sin, as 
 exceedingly sinful, and to be afraid of incurring the like punishment 
 themselves. <I>Smite the scorner</I> that sins presumptuously, <I>and 
 the simple,</I> that is in danger of sinning carelessly, <I>will 
 beware.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 If thou shalt hear <I>say</I> in one of thy cities, which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,
 &nbsp; 13 <I>Certain</I> men, the children of Belial, are gone out from
 among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city,
 saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
 &nbsp; 14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask
 diligently; and, behold, <I>if it be</I> truth, <I>and</I> the thing
 certain, <I>that</I> such abomination is wrought among you;
 &nbsp; 15 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with
 the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that <I>is</I>
 therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.
 &nbsp; 16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
 the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
 the spoil thereof every whit, for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God: and it shall
 be a heap for ever; it shall not be built again.
 &nbsp; 17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
 hand: that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
 and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply
 thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;
 &nbsp; 18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to
 keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
 <I>that which is</I> right in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the case is put of a city revolting from its allegiance to the God 
 of Israel, <I>and serving other gods.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The crime is supposed to be committed, 

 1. By one of the cities of Israel, that lay within the jurisdiction of
 their courts. The church then <I>judged those only that were 
 within,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:12,13">1 Cor. v. 12, 13</A>.

 And, even when they were ordered to preserve their religion in the
 first principles of it by fire and sword to propagate it. Those that 
 are born within the allegiance of a prince, if they take up arms 
 against him, are dealt with as traitors, but foreign invaders are not 
 so. The city that is here supposed to have become idolatrous is one 
 that formerly worshipped the true God, but had now withdrawn to other 
 gods, which intimates how great the crime is, and how sore the 
 punishment will be, of those that, <I>after they have known the way of 
 righteousness, turn aside from it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:21">2 Pet. ii. 21</A>.

 2. It is supposed to be committed by the generality of the inhabitants
 of the city, for we may conclude that, if a considerable number did 
 retain their integrity, those only that were guilty were to be 
 destroyed, and the city was to be spared for the sake of the righteous 
 in it; for <I>will not the Judge of all the earth do right?</I> No 
 doubt he will. 

 3. They are supposed to be drawn to idolatry by <I>certain men, the
 children of Belial,</I> men that would endure no yoke (so it 
 signifies), that neither fear God nor regard man, but shake off all 
 restraints of law and conscience, and are perfectly lost to all manner 
 of virtue; these are those that say, "Let us serve other gods," that 
 will not only allow, but will countenance and encourage, our 
 immoralities. Belial is put for <I>the devil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:15">2 Cor. vi. 15</A>),

 and the children of Belial are his children. These withdraw the
 inhabitants of the city; for a little of this old leaven, when it is 
 entertained, soon leavens the whole lump.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cause is ordered to be tried with a great deal of care 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Thou shalt enquire and make search.</I> They must not proceed upon
 common fame, or take the information by hearsay, but must examine the 
 proofs, and not give judgment against them unless the evidence was 
 clear and the charge fully made out. God himself, before he destroyed 
 Sodom, is said to have come down to see whether its crimes were 
 according to the clamour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:21">Gen. xviii. 21</A>.

 In judicial processes it is requisite that time, and care, and pains,
 be taken to find out the truth, and that search be made without any 
 passion, prejudice, or partiality. The Jewish writers say that, though 
 particular persons who were idolaters might be judged by the inferior 
 courts, the defection of a city was to be tried by the great Sanhedrim; 
 and, if it appeared that they were thrust away to idolatry, two learned 
 men were sent to them to admonish and reclaim them. If they repented, 
 all would be well; if not, then all Israel must go up to war against 
 them, to testify their indignation against idolatry and to stop the 
 spreading of the contagion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. If the crime were proved, and the criminals were incorrigible, the 
 city was to be wholly destroyed. If there were a few righteous men in 
 it, no doubt they would remove themselves and their families out of 
 such a dangerous place, and then all the inhabitants, men, women, and 
 children, must be put to the sword 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 all the spoil of the city, both shop-goods and the furniture of houses, 
 must be brought into the marketplace and burned, and the city itself 
 must be laid in ashes and never built again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The soldiers are forbidden, upon pain of death, to convert any of the
 plunder to their own use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It was a devoted thing, and dangerous to meddle with, as we find in the
 case of Achan. Now,

 1. God enjoins this severity of show what a jealous God he is in the
 matters of his worship, and how great a crime it is to serve other 
 gods. Let men know that God will not give his glory to another, nor his 
 praise to graven images. 

 2. He expects that magistrates, having their honour and power from him,
 should be concerned for his honour, and use their power for <I>terror 
 to evil doers,</I> else they bear the sword in vain. 

 3. The faithful worshippers of the true God must take all occasions to
 show their just indignation against idolatry, much more against 
 atheism, infidelity, and irreligion. 

 4. It is here intimated that the best expedient for the turning away of
 God's anger from a land is to execute justice upon the <I>wicked of the 
 land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 that the Lord may <I>turn from the fierceness of his anger,</I> which
 was ready to break out against the whole nation, for the wickedness of 
 that one apostate city. It is promised that, if they would thus root 
 wickedness out of their land, God would multiply them.  They might 
 think it impolitic, and against the interest of their nation, to ruin a 
 whole city for a crime relating purely to religion, and that they 
 should be more sparing of the blood of Israelites: "Fear not the" (says 
 Moses), "God will multiply you the more; the body of your nation will 
 lose nothing by the letting out of this corrupt blood." <I>Lastly,</I> 
 Though we do not find this law put in execution in all the history of 
 the Jewish church (Gibeah was destroyed, not for idolatry, but 
 immorality), yet for the neglect of the execution of it upon the 
 inferior cities that served idols God himself, by the army of the 
 Chaldeans, put it in execution upon Jerusalem, the head city, which, 
 for is apostasy from God, was utterly destroyed and laid waste, and lay 
 in ruins seventy years. Though idolaters may escape punishment from men 
 (nor is this law in the letter of it binding now, under the gospel), 
 yet the Lord our God will not suffer them to escape his righteous 
 judgements. The New Testament speaks of communion with idolaters as a 
 sin which, above any other, <I>provokes the Lord to jealousy,</I> and 
 dares him as if we were <I>stronger than he,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:21,22">1 Cor. x. 21, 22</A>.</P>
