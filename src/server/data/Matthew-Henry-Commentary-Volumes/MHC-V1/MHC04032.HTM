 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
 great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer,
 and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place <I>was</I> a place for
 cattle;
 &nbsp; 2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
 unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
 the congregation, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
 Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
 &nbsp; 4 <I>Even</I> the country which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> smote before the
 congregation of Israel, <I>is</I> a land for cattle, and thy servants
 have cattle:
 &nbsp; 5 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight,
 let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, <I>and</I>
 bring us not over Jordan.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children
 of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
 &nbsp; 7 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
 Israel from going over into the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given
 them?
 &nbsp; 8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to
 see the land.
 &nbsp; 9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
 land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that
 they should not go into the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had given them.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s anger was kindled the same time, and he
 sware, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from
 twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware
 unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
 wholly followed me:
 &nbsp; 12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
 son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
 them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
 generation, that had done evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, was
 consumed.
 &nbsp; 14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
 increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> toward Israel.
 &nbsp; 15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
 them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Israel's tents were now pitched in the plains of Moab, where they 
 continued many months, looking back upon the conquests they had already 
 made of the land of Sihon and Og, and looking forward to Canaan, which 
 they hoped in a little while to make themselves masters of. While they 
 made this stand, and were at a pause, this great affair of the disposal 
 of the conquests they had already made was here concerted and settled, 
 not by any particular order or appointment of God, but at the special 
 instance and request of two of the tribes, to which Moses, after a long 
 debate that arose upon it, consented. For even <I>then,</I> when so 
 much was done by the extraordinary appearances of divine Providence, 
 many things were left to the direction of human prudence; for God, in 
 governing both the world and the church, makes use of the reason of 
 men, and serves his own purposes by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a motion made by the Reubenites and the Gadites, that the 
 land which they had lately possessed themselves of, and which in the 
 right of conquest belonged to Israel in common, might be assigned to 
 them in particular for their inheritance: upon the general idea they 
 had of the land of promise, they supposed this would be about their 
 proportion. Reuben and Gad were encamped under the same standard, and 
 so had the better opportunity of comparing notes, and settling this 
 matter between themselves. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:1">first verse</A>

 the children of Reuben are named first, but afterwards the children of
 Gad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:2,25,31"><I>v.</I> 2, 25, 31</A>),
 
 either because the Gadites made the first motion and were most forward
 for it, or because they were the better spokesmen and had more of the 
 art of management, Reuben's tribe still lying under Jacob's sentence, 
 <I>he shall not excel.</I> Two things common in the world induced these 
 tribes to make this choice and this motion upon it, the <I>lust of the 
 eye</I> and the <I>pride of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16">1 John ii. 16</A>.

 1. The <I>lust of the eye.</I> This land which they coveted was not 
 only beautiful for situation, and pleasant to the eye, but it was good 
 for food, food for cattle; and they had a great multitude of cattle, 
 above the rest of the tribes, it is supposed because they brought more 
 out of Egypt, than the rest did; but that was forty years before, and 
 stocks of cattle increase and decrease in less time than that; 
 therefore I rather think they had been better husbands of their cattle 
 in the wilderness, had tended them better, had taken more care of the 
 breed, and not been so profuse as their neighbours in eating the 
 <I>lambs out of the flock</I> and the <I>calves out of the midst of the 
 stall.</I> Now they, having these large stocks, coveted land 
 proportionable. Many scriptures speak of Bashan and Gilead as places 
 famous for cattle; they had been so already, and therefore these tribes 
 hoped they would be so to them, and whatever comes of it here they 
 desire to take their lot. The judicious Calvin thinks there was much 
 amiss in the principle they went upon, and that they consulted their 
 own private convenience more than the public good, that they had not 
 such regard to the honour and interest of Israel, and the promise made 
 to Abraham of the land of Canaan (strictly so called), as they ought to 
 have had. And still it is too true that many <I>seek their own 
 things</I> more than the <I>things of Jesus Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21">Phil. ii. 21</A>),

 and that many are influenced by their secular interest and advantage to
 take up short of the heavenly Canaan. Their spirits agree too well with 
 this world, and with the things that are seen, that are temporal; and 
 they say, "It is good to be here," and so lose what is hereafter for 
 want of seeking it. Lot thus chose <I>by the sight of the eye,</I> and 
 smarted for his choice. Would we choose our portion aright we must look 
 above the things that are seen.

 2. Perhaps there was something of the <I>pride of life</I> in it.
 Reuben was the first-born of Israel, but he had lost his birthright.
 Several of the tribes, and Judah especially, had risen above him, so 
 that he could not expect the best lot in Canaan; and therefore, to save 
 the shadow of a birthright, when he had forfeited the substance, he 
 here catches at the first lot, though it was out of Canaan, and far off 
 from the tabernacle. Thus Esau sold his birthright, and yet got to be 
 served first with an inheritance in Mount Seir. The tribe of Gad 
 descended from the first-born of Zilpah, and were like pretenders with 
 the Reubenites; and Manasseh too was a first-born, but knew he must be 
 eclipsed by Ephraim his younger brother, and therefore he also coveted 
 to get precedency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses's dislike of this motion, and the severe rebuke he gives to 
 it, as a faithful prince and prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It must be confessed that <I>prima facie--at first sight,</I> the
 thing looked ill, especially the closing words of their petition: 
 <I>Bring us not over Jordan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) It seems to proceed from a bad principle, a contempt of the land
 of promise, which Moses himself was so desirous of a sight of, a 
 distrust too of the power of God to dispossess the Canaanites, as if a 
 lot in a land which they knew, and which was already conquered, was 
 more desirable than a lot in a land they knew not, and which was yet to 
 be conquered: one bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. There 
 seemed also to be covetousness in it; for that which they insisted on 
 was that it was convenient for their cattle. It argued likewise a 
 neglect of their brethren, as if they cared not what became of Israel, 
 while they themselves were well provided for.

 (2.) It might have been of bad consequence. The people might have taken
 improper hints from it, and have suggested that they were few enough, 
 when they had their whole number, to deal with the Canaanites, but how 
 unequal would the match be if they should drop two tribes and a half 
 (above a fifth part of their strength) on this side Jordan. It would 
 likewise be a bad precedent; if they must have the land thus granted 
 them as soon as it was conquered, other tribes might make the same 
 pretensions and claims, and so the regular disposition of the land by 
 lot would be anticipated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses is therefore very warm upon them, which is to be imputed to 
 his pious zeal against sin, and not to any peevishness, the effect of 
 old age, for his meekness abated not, any more than his natural force. 
 
 (1.) He shows them what he apprehended to be evil in this motion, that
 it would discharge the heart of their brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 "What!" (says he, with a holy indignation at their selfishness) 
 "<I>shall your brethren go to war,</I> and expose themselves to all the 
 hardships and hazards of the field, and <I>shall you sit here</I> at 
 your ease? No, do not deceive yourselves, you shall never be indulged 
 by me in this sloth and cowardice." It ill becomes any of God's Israel 
 to sit down unconcerned in the difficult and perilous concernments of 
 their brethren, whether public or personal.

 (2.) He reminds them of the fatal consequences of the unbelief and
 faint-heartedness of their fathers, when they were just ready to enter 
 Canaan, as they themselves now were. He recites the story very
 particularly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:8-13"><I>v.</I> 8-13</A>):

 "<I>Thus did your fathers,</I> whose punishment should be a warning to 
 you to take heed of sinning after the similitude of their 
 transgression."

 (3.) He gives them fair warning of the mischief that would be likely to
 follow upon this separation which they were about to make from the camp 
 of Israel; they would be in danger of bringing wrath upon the whole 
 congregation, and hurrying them all back again into the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):

 "<I>You have risen up in your fathers' stead</I> to despise the 
 pleasant land and reject it as they did, when we hoped you had risen up 
 in their stead to possess it." It was an encouragement to Moses to see 
 what an increase of men there was in these tribes, but a discouragement 
 to see that it was withal an increase of sinful men, treading in the 
 steps of their fathers' impiety. It is sad to see the rising generation 
 in families and countries not only no better, but worse than that which 
 went before it; and what comes of it? Why, <I>it augments the fierce 
 anger of the Lord;</I> not only continues that fire, but increases it, 
 and fills the measure, often till it overflows in a deluge of 
 desolation. Note, If men did but consider as they ought, what would be 
 the end of sin, they would be afraid of the beginnings of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
 sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
 &nbsp; 17 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
 Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
 little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
 inhabitants of the land.
 &nbsp; 18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
 Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
 forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
 Jordan eastward.
 &nbsp; 20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye
 will go armed before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to war,
 &nbsp; 21 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
 &nbsp; 22 And the land be subdued before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: then afterward ye
 shall return, and be guiltless before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and before
 Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and be sure your sin will find you out.
 &nbsp; 24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
 sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
 &nbsp; 25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake
 unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
 &nbsp; 26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
 shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
 &nbsp; 27 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to battle, as my lord saith.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the accommodating of the matter between Moses and the two 
 tribes, about their settlement on this side Jordan. Probably the 
 petitioners withdrew, and considered with themselves what answer they 
 should return to the severe reproof Moses had given them; and, after 
 some consultation, they return with this proposal, that their men of 
 war should go and assist their brethren in the conquest of Canaan, and 
 they would leave their families and flocks behind them in this land: 
 and thus they might have their request, and no harm would be done. Now
 it is uncertain whether they designed this at first when they brought 
 their petition or no. If they did, it is an instance how often that 
 which is honestly meant is unhappily misinterpreted; yet Moses herein 
 was excusable, for he had reason to suspect the worst of them, and the 
 rebuke he gave them was from the abundance of his care to prevent sin. 
 But, if they did not, it is an instance of the good effect of plain 
 dealing; Moses, by showing them their sin, and the danger of it, 
 brought them to their duty without murmuring or disputing. They object 
 not that their brethren were able to contend with the Canaanites 
 without their help, especially since they were sure of God's fighting 
 for them; but engage themselves to stand by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their proposal is very fair and generous, and such as, instead of 
 disheartening, would rather encourage their brethren. 

 1. That their <I>men of war,</I> who were fit for service, would go 
 <I>ready armed before the children of Israel</I> into the land of 
 Canaan. So far would they be from deserting them that, if it were 
 thought fit, they would lead them on, and be foremost is all dangerous 
 enterprises. So far were they from either distrusting or despising the 
 conquest of Canaan that they would assist in it with the utmost 
 readiness and resolution. 

 2. That they would leave behind them their families and cattle (which
 would otherwise be but the incumbrance of their camp), and so they 
 would be the more serviceable to their brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 3. That they would not return to their possessions till the conquest of
 Canaan was completed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Their brethren should have their best help as long as they needed it.

 4. That yet they would not expect any share of the land that was yet to
 be conquered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>We will not desire to inherit with them,</I> nor, under colour of 
 assisting them in the war, put in for a share with them in the land; 
 no, we will be content with our inheritance on this side Jordan, and 
 there will be so much the more on yonder side for them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses thereupon grants their request, upon consideration that they 
 would adhere to their proposals. 

 1. He insists much upon it that they should never lay down their arms 
 till their brethren laid down theirs. They promised to go armed
 <I>before the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 "Nay," says Moses, "you shall go armed <I>before the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 It is God's cause more than your brethren's, and to him you must have 
 an eye, and not to them only." <I>Before the Lord,</I> that is, before 
 the ark of the Lord, the token of his presence, which, it should seem, 
 they carried about with them in the wars of Canaan, and immediately 
 before which these two tribes were posted, as we find in the order of 
 their march, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+2:10,17"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10, 17</A>.

 2. Upon this condition he grants them this land for their possession,
 and tells them they shall be <I>guiltless before the Lord and before 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They should have the land, and neither sin nor blame should cleave to 
 it, neither sin before God nor blame before Israel; and, whatever 
 possessions we have, it is desirable thus to come guiltless to them. 
 But,

 3. He warns them of the danger of breaking their word: "If you fail,
 you <I>sin against the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and not against your brethren only, and <I>be sure your sin will find 
 you out;</I>" that is, "God will certainly reckon with you for it, 
 though you may make a light matter of it." Note, Sin will, without 
 doubt, find out the sinner sooner or later. It concerns us therefore to 
 find our sins out, that we may repent of them and forsake them, lest 
 our sins find us out to our ruin and confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They unanimously agree to the provisos and conditions of the 
 grant, and do, as it were, give bond for performance, by a solemn 
 promise: <I>Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Their brethren had all contributed their assistance to the conquest of 
 this country, which they desired for a possession, and therefore they 
 owned themselves obliged in justice to help them in the conquest of 
 that which was to be their possession. Having received kindness, we 
 ought to return it, though it was not so conditioned when we received 
 it. We may suppose that this promise was understood, on both sides, so 
 as not to oblige all that were numbered of these tribes to go over 
 armed, but those only that were fittest for the expedition, who would 
 be most serviceable, while it was necessary that some should be left to 
 till the ground and guard the country; and accordingly we find that 
 about 40,000 of the two tribes and a half went over armed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:13">Josh. iv. 13</A>),

 whereas their whole number was about 100,000.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
 Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
 children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
 children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
 armed to battle, before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the land shall be subdued
 before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a
 possession:
 &nbsp; 30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall
 have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
 saying, As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.
 &nbsp; 32 We will pass over armed before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> into the land of
 Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
 Jordan <I>may be</I> ours.
 &nbsp; 33 And Moses gave unto them, <I>even</I> to the children of Gad, and
 to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
 the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and
 the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities
 thereof in the coasts, <I>even</I> the cities of the country round
 about.
 &nbsp; 34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
 &nbsp; 35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
 &nbsp; 36 And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for
 sheep.
 &nbsp; 37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
 Kirjathaim,
 &nbsp; 38 And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and
 Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.
 &nbsp; 39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to
 Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which <I>was</I> in
 it.
 &nbsp; 40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and
 he dwelt therein.
 &nbsp; 41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
 thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.
 &nbsp; 42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof,
 and called it Nobah, after his own name.

 1. Moses settles this matter with Eleazar, and with Joshua who was to 
 be his successor, knowing that he himself must not live to see it 
 perfected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.

 He gives them an estate upon condition, leaving it to Joshua, if they 
 fulfilled the condition, to declare the estate absolute: "If <I>they 
 will not go over with you,</I>" he does not say "you shall give them no 
 inheritance at all," but "you shall not give them this inheritance 
 which they covet. If their militia will not come over with you, compel
 the whole tribes to come over, and let them take their lot with their 
 brethren, and fare as they fare; <I>they shall have possessions in 
 Canaan,</I> and let them not expect that the lot will favour them." 
 Hereupon they repeat their promise to adhere to their brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 2. Moses settles them in the land they desired. He gave it to them for
 a possession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Here is the first mention of the half tribe of Manasseh coming in with 
 them for a share; probably they had not joined with them in the 
 petition, but, the land when it came to be apportioned proving to be 
 too much for them, this half tribe had a lot among them, perhaps at 
 their request, or by divine direction, or because they had signalized 
 themselves in the conquest of this country: for the children of Machir, 
 a stout and warlike family, had taken Gilead and dispossessed the 
 Amorites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 "Let them win it and wear it, get it and take it." And, they being
 celebrated for their courage and bravery, it was for the common safety 
 to put them in this frontier-country.  Concerning the settlement of 
 these tribes observe,

 (1.) They built the cities, that is, repaired them, because either they
 had been damaged by the war or the Amorites had suffered them to go to 
 decay. 

 (2.) They changed the names of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 either to show their authority, that the change of the names might 
 signify the change of their owners, or because their names were 
 idolatrous, and carried in them a respect to the dunghill-deities that 
 were there worshipped.  Nebo and Baal were names of their gods, which 
 they were forbidden to make mention of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:13">Exod. xxiii. 13</A>),

 and which, by changing the names of these cities, they endeavoured to
 bury in oblivion; and God promises to take away the names of Baalim out 
 of the mouths of his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:17">Hos. ii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> It is observable that, as these tribes were now first 
 placed before the other tribes, so, long afterwards, they were 
 displaced before the other tribes. We find that they were carried
 captive into Assyria some years before the other tribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2 Kings xv. 29</A>.

 Such a proportion does Providence sometimes observe in balancing
 prosperity and adversity; he sets the one over-against the other.</P>
