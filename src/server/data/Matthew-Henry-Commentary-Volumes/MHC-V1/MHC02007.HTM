 In this chapter,

 I. The dispute between God and Moses finishes, and Moses applies
 himself to the execution of his commission, in obedience to God's
 command,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The dispute between Moses and Pharaoh begins, and a famous trial of 
 skill it was. Moses, in God's name, demands Israel's release; Pharaoh
 denies it. The contest is between the power of the great God and the
 power of a proud prince; and it will be found, in the issue, that when
 God judgeth he will overcome.

 1. Moses confirms the demand he had made to Pharaoh, by a miracle,
 turning his rod into a serpent; but Pharaoh hardens his heart against
 this conviction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 2. He chastises his disobedience by a plague, the first of the ten,
 turning the waters into blood; but Pharaoh hardens his heart against
 this correction,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
 Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
 &nbsp; 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
 brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
 Israel out of his land.
 &nbsp; 3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
 my wonders in the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my
 hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, <I>and</I> my people the
 children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
 &nbsp; 5 And the Egyptians shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when I
 stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of
 Israel from among them.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded them, so did
 they.
 &nbsp; 7 And Moses <I>was</I> fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
 three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God encourages Moses to go to Pharaoh, and at last silences all his 
 discouragements. 
 
 1. He clothes him with great power and authority

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I have made thee a god to Pharaoh;</I> that is, my representative in
 this affair, as magistrates are called <I>gods,</I> because they are 
 God's vicegerents. He was authorized to speak and act in God's name and 
 stead, and, under the divine direction, was endued with a divine power 
 to do that which is above the ordinary power of nature, and invested 
 with a divine authority to demand obedience from a sovereign prince and 
 punish disobedience. Moses was a god, but he was only a <I>made</I> 
 god, not essentially one by nature; he was no god but by commission. He 
 was a god, but he was a god only to Pharaoh; the living and true God is 
 a God to all the world. It is an instance of God's condescension, and 
 an evidence that his thoughts towards us are thoughts of peace, that 
 when he treats with men he treats by men, whose terror shall not make 
 us afraid. 

 2. He again nominates him an assistant, his brother Aaron, who was not 
 a man of uncircumcised lips, but a notable spokesman: "He shall be 
 <I>thy prophet,</I>" that is, "he shall speak from thee to Pharaoh, as 
 prophets do from God to the children of men. Thou shalt, as a god, 
 inflict and remove the plagues, and Aaron, as a prophet, shall denounce 
 them, and threaten Pharaoh with them." 

 3. He tells him the worst of it, that Pharaoh would not hearken to him, 
 and yet the work should be done at last, Israel should be delivered and 
 God therein would be glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 The Egyptians, who would not know the Lord, should be made to know him. 
 Note, It is, and ought to be, satisfaction enough to God's messengers 
 that, whatever contradiction and opposition may be given them, thus far 
 they shall gain their point, that God will be glorified in the success 
 of their embassy, and all his chosen Israel will be saved, and then 
 they have no reason to say that they have laboured in vain. See here, 
 
 (1.) How God glorifies himself; he makes people know that he is
 Jehovah. Israel is made to know it by the performance of his promises 
 to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3"><I>ch.</I> vi. 3</A>),

 and the Egyptians are made to know it by the pouring
 out of his wrath upon them. Thus God's name is exalted both in those 
 that are saved and in those that perish. 

 (2.) What method he takes to do this: he humbles the proud, and exalts 
 the poor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:51,52">Luke i. 51, 52</A>.

 If God stretch out his hand to sinners in vain, he will at last stretch
 out his hand upon them; and who can bear the weight of it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses and Aaron apply themselves to their work without further 
 objection: <I>They did as the Lord commanded them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Their obedience, all things considered, was well worthy to be 
 celebrated, as it is by the Psalmist 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:28">Ps. cv. 28</A>),

 <I>They rebelled not against his word,</I> namely, Moses and Aaron,
 whom he mentions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Thus Jonah, though at first he was very averse, at length went to 
 Nineveh. Notice is taken of the age of Moses and Aaron when they 
 undertook this glorious service. Aaron the elder (and yet the inferior 
 in office) was eighty-three, Moses was eighty; both of them men of 
 great gravity and experience, whose age was venerable, and whose years 
 might teach wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Joseph, who was to be only a servant to Pharaoh, was preferred at 
 thirty years old; but Moses, who was to be a god to Pharaoh, was not so 
 dignified until he was eighty years old. It was fit that he should long 
 wait for such an honour, and be long in preparing for such a 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a miracle for
 you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast <I>it</I>
 before Pharaoh, <I>and</I> it shall become a serpent.
 &nbsp; 10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
 Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
 &nbsp; 11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
 the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
 enchantments.
 &nbsp; 12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
 serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
 &nbsp; 13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
 them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first time that Moses made his application to Pharaoh, he produced 
 his instructions only; now he is directed to produce his credentials, 
 and does accordingly. 

 1. It is taken for granted that Pharaoh would challenge these
 demandants to work a miracle, that, by a performance evidently above 
 the power of nature, they might prove their commission from the God of 
 nature. Pharaoh will say, <I>Show a miracle;</I> not with any desire to 
 be convinced, but with the hope that none will be wrought, and then he 
 would have some colour for his infidelity. 

 2.  Orders are therefore given to turn the rod into a serpent, 
 according to the instructions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3</A>.

 The same rod that was to give the signal of the other miracles is now
 itself the subject of a miracle, to put a reputation upon it. Aaron 
 cast his rod to the ground, and instantly it became a serpent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This was proper, not only to affect Pharaoh with wonder, but to strike 
 a terror upon him. Serpents are hurtful dreadful animals; the very 
 sight of one, thus miraculously produced, might have softened his heart 
 into a fear of that God by whose power it was produced. This first 
 miracle, though it was not a plague, yet amounted to the threatening of 
 a plague. If it made not Pharaoh feel, it made him fear; and this is 
 God's method of dealing with sinners--he comes upon them gradually. 

 3. This miracle, though too plain to be denied, is enervated, and the
 conviction of it taken off, by the magicians' imitation of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Moses had been originally instructed in the learning of the Egyptians, 
 and was suspected to have improved himself in magical arts in his long 
 retirement; the magicians are therefore sent for, to vie with him. And 
 some think those of that profession had a particular spite against the 
 Hebrews ever since Joseph put them all to shame, by interpreting a 
 dream which they could make nothing of, in remembrance of which slur 
 put on their predecessors these magicians withstood Moses, as it is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:8">2 Tim. iii. 8</A>.

 Their rods became serpents, real serpents; some think, by the power of
 God, beyond their intention or expectation, for the hardening of 
 Pharaoh's heart; others think, by the power of evil angels, artfully 
 substituting serpents in the room of the rods, God permitting the 
 delusion to be wrought for wise and holy ends, that those might believe 
 a lie who received not the truth: and herein the Lord was righteous. 
 Yet this might have helped to frighten Pharaoh into a compliance with 
 the demands of Moses, that he might be freed from these dreadful 
 unaccountable phenomena, with which he saw himself on all sides 
 surrounded. But to the seed of the serpent these serpents were no 
 amazement. Note, God suffers the lying spirit to do strange things, 
 that the faith of some may be tried and manifested

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:3,1Co+11:19">Deut. xiii. 3; 1 Cor. xi. 19</A>),

 that the infidelity of others may be confirmed, and that he who is
 filthy may be filthy still, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2 Cor. iv. 4</A>.

 4. Yet, in this contest, Moses plainly gains the victory. The serpent
 which Aaron's rod was turned into swallowed up the others, which was 
 sufficient to have convinced Pharaoh on which side the right lay. Note, 
 Great is the truth, and will prevail. The cause of God will undoubtedly 
 triumph at last over all competition and contradiction, and will reign 
 alone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44">Dan. ii. 44</A>.

 But Pharaoh was not wrought upon by this. The magicians having produced
 serpents, he had this to say, that the case between them and Moses was 
 disputable; and the very appearance of an opposition to truth, and the 
 least head made against it, serve those for a justification of their 
 infidelity who are prejudiced against the light and love of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart <I>is</I> hardened,
 he refuseth to let the people go.
 &nbsp; 15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
 the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he
 come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take
 in thine hand.
 &nbsp; 16 And thou shalt say unto him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of the Hebrews
 hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
 serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest
 not hear.
 &nbsp; 17 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, In this thou shalt know that I <I>am</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: behold, I will smite with the rod that <I>is</I> in mine hand
 upon the waters which <I>are</I> in the river, and they shall be
 turned to blood.
 &nbsp; 18 And the fish that <I>is</I> in the river shall die, and the river
 shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink of the water
 of the river.
 &nbsp; 19 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
 and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their
 streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all
 their pools of water, that they may become blood; and <I>that</I>
 there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in
 <I>vessels of</I> wood, and in <I>vessels of</I> stone.
 &nbsp; 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded; and he
 lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that <I>were</I> in the river,
 in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and
 all the waters that <I>were</I> in the river were turned to blood.
 &nbsp; 21 And the fish that <I>was</I> in the river died; and the river
 stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the
 river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments:
 and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
 them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said.
 &nbsp; 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he
 set his heart to this also.
 &nbsp; 24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
 to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
 &nbsp; 25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 smitten the river.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the first of the ten plagues, the turning of the water into 
 blood, which was, 

 1. A dreadful plague, and very grievous. The very sight of such vast 
 rolling streams of blood, pure blood no doubt, florid and high-colored, 
 could not but strike a horror upon people: much more afflictive were 
 the consequences of it. Nothing more common than water: so wisely has 
 Providence ordered it, and so kindly, that that which is so needful and 
 serviceable to the comfort of human life should be cheap, and almost 
 every where to be had; but now the Egyptians must either drink blood, 
 or die for thirst. Fish was much of their food

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:5">Num. xi. 5</A>),

 but the changing of the waters was the death of the fish; it was a
 pestilence in that element

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The fish died.</I> In the general deluge they escaped, because 
 perhaps they had not then contributed so much to the luxury of man as 
 they have since; but in this particular judgment they perished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:29">Ps. cv. 29</A>):

 <I>He slew their fish;</I> and when another destruction of Egypt, long
 afterwards, is threatened, the disappointment of those that make 
 sluices and ponds for fish is particularly noticed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:10">Isa. xix. 10</A>.

 Egypt was a pleasant land, but the noisome stench of dead fish and
 blood, which by degrees would grow putrid, now rendered it very 
 unpleasant. 

 2. It was a righteous plague, and justly inflicted upon the Egyptians.
 For, 

 (1.) Nilus, the river of Egypt, was their idol; they and their land 
 derived so much benefit from it that they served and worshipped it more 
 than the Creator. The true fountain of the Nile being unknown to them, 
 they paid all their devotions to its streams: here therefore God 
 punished them, and turned that into blood which they had turned into a 
 god. Note, That creature which we idolize God justly removes from us, 
 or embitters to us. He makes that a scourge to us which we make a 
 competitor with him. 

 (2.) They had stained the river with the blood of the Hebrews' 
 children, and now God made that river all bloody. Thus he gave them 
 blood to drink, for they were worthy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:6">Rev. xvi. 6</A>.

 Note, Never any thirsted after blood, but, sooner or later,
 they had enough of it.  

 3. It was a significant plague. Egypt had a great dependence upon their 
 river

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18">Zech. xiv. 18</A>),

 so that in smiting the river they were warned of the destruction of all
 the productions of their country, till it came at last to their 
 firstborn; and this red river proved a direful omen of the ruin of 
 Pharaoh and all his forces in the Red Sea. This plague of Egypt is 
 alluded to in the prediction of the ruin of the enemies of the 
 New-Testament church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:3,4">Rev. xvi. 3, 4</A>.

 But there the sea, as well as the rivers and fountains of water, is
 turned into blood; for spiritual judgments reach further, and strike 
 deeper, than temporal judgments do.  And, <I>lastly,</I> let me observe 
 in general concerning this plague that one of the first miracles Moses 
 wrought was turning water into blood, but one of the first miracles our 
 Lord Jesus wrought was turning water into wine; for the law was given 
 by Moses, and it was a dispensation of death and terror; but grace and 
 truth, which, like wine, make glad the heart, came by Jesus Christ.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Moses is directed to give Pharaoh warning of this plague. "Pharaoh's 
 heart is hardened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 therefore go and try what this will do to soften it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Moses perhaps may not be admitted into Pharaoh's presence-chamber, or 
 the room of state where he used to give audience to ambassadors; and 
 therefore he is directed to meet him by the river's brink, whither God 
 foresaw he would come in the morning, either for the pleasure of a 
 morning's walk or to pay his morning devotions to the river: for thus 
 all people will walk, every one in the name of his god; they will not 
 fail to worship their god every morning. There Moses must be ready to 
 give him a new summons to surrender, and, in case of a refusal, to tell 
 him of the judgment that was coming upon that very river on the banks 
 of which they were now standing. Notice is thus given him of it 
 beforehand, that they might have no colour to say it was a chance, or 
 to attribute it to any other cause, but that it might appear to be done 
 by the power of the God of the Hebrews, and as a punishment upon him 
 for his obstinacy. Moses is expressly ordered to take the rod with him, 
 that Pharaoh might be alarmed at the sight of that rod which had so 
 lately triumphed over the rods of the magicians. Now learn hence, 

 1. That the judgments of God are all known to himself beforehand. He
 knows what he will do in wrath as well as in mercy. Every consumption 
 is a consumption determined,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:23">Isa. x. 23</A>.

 2. That men cannot escape the alarms of God's wrath, because they
 cannot go out of the hearing of their own consciences: he that made 
 their hearts can make his sword to approach them. 

 3. That God warns before he wounds; for he is <I>long-suffering, not 
 willing that any should perish, but that all should come to 
 repentance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Aaron (who carried the mace) is directed to summon the plague by 
 smiting the river with his rod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 It was done in the sight of Pharaoh and his attendants; for God's true 
 miracles were not performed, as Satan's lying wonders were, by those 
 that peeped and muttered: truth seeks no corners. An amazing change was 
 immediately wrought; all the waters, not only in the rivers but in all 
 their ponds, were turned into blood. 

 1. See here the almighty power of God. Every creature is that to us 
 which he makes it to be, water or blood. 

 2. See the mutability of all things under the sun, and what changes we 
 may meet with in them. That which is water to-day may be blood 
 to-morrow; what is always vain may soon become vexatious. A river, at 
 the best, is transient; but divine justice can quickly make it 
 malignant. 

 3. See what mischievous work sin makes. If the things that have been
 our comforts prove our crosses, we must thank ourselves: it is sin that 
 turns our waters into blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Pharaoh endeavours to confront the miracle, because he resolves 
 not to humble himself under the plague. He sends for the magicians, 
 and, by God's permission, they ape the miracle with their enchantments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and this serves Pharaoh for an excuse not to set his heart to this also 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and a pitiful excuse it was. Could they have turned the river of blood 
 into water again, this would have been something to the purpose; then 
 they would have proved their power, and Pharaoh would have been obliged 
 to them as his benefactors. But for them, when there was such scarcity 
 of water, to turn more of it into blood, only to show their art, 
 plainly intimates that the design of the devil is only to delude his 
 devotees and amuse them, not to do them any real kindness, but to keep 
 them from doing a real kindness to themselves by repenting and 
 returning to their God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Egyptians, in the mean time, are seeking for relief against the 
 plague, digging round about the river for water to drink, 
 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Probably they found some, with much ado, God remembering mercy in the 
 midst of wrath; for he is full of compassion, and would not let the 
 subjects smart too much for the obstinacy of their prince.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The plague continued seven days
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and, in all that time, Pharaoh's proud heart would not let him so much 
 as desire Moses to intercede for the removal of it. Thus the hypocrites 
 in heart heap up wrath; <I>they cry not when he binds them</I>
