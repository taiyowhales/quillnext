 Aaron and his sons, having been solemnly consecrated to the priesthood, 
 are in this chapter entering upon the execution of their office, the 
 very next day after their consecration was completed. 

 I. Moses (no doubt by direction from God) appoints a meeting between
 God and his priests, as the representatives of his people, ordering 
 them to attend him, and assuring them that he would appear to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The meeting is held according to the appointment.

 1. Aaron attends on God by sacrifice, offering a sin-offering and
 burnt-offering for himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:8-14">ver. 8-14</A>), 

 and then the offerings for the people, whom he blessed in the name of
 the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 2. God signifies his acceptance,

 (1.) Of their persons, by showing them his glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:23">ver. 23</A>.

 (2.) Of their sacrifices, by consuming them with fire from heaven,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, <I>that</I> Moses called
 Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
 offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
 offer <I>them</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying,
 Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
 lamb, <I>both</I> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
 offering;
 &nbsp; 4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will appear unto you.
 &nbsp; 5 And they brought <I>that</I> which Moses commanded before the
 tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
 near and stood before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses said, This <I>is</I> the thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 that ye should do: and the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall appear unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
 sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for
 thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
 people, and make an atonement for them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Orders are here given for another solemnity upon the eighth day; for 
 the newly-ordained priests were set to work immediately after the days 
 of their consecration were finished, to let them know that they were 
 not ordained to be idle: <I>He that desires the office of a bishop 
 desires a good work,</I> which must be looked at with desire, more than 
 the honour and benefit. The priests had not so much as one day's 
 respite from service allowed them, that they might divert themselves, 
 and receive the compliments of their friends upon their elevation, but 
 were busily employed the very next day; for their consecration was the 
 <I>filling of their hands.</I> God's spiritual priests have constant 
 work cut out for them, which the duty of every day requires; and those 
 that would give up their account with joy must redeem time; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:26,27">Ezek. xliii. 26, 27</A>.

 Now,

 1. Moses raises their expectation of a glorious appearance of God to 
 them this day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>To day the Lord will appear to you</I> that are the priests." And 
 when all the congregation are gathered together, and <I>stand before 
 the Lord,</I> he tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>The glory of the Lord shall appear to you.</I> Though they had 
 reason enough to believe God's acceptance of all that they had done 
 according to his appointment, upon the general assurance we have that 
 he is the <I>rewarder of those that diligently seek him</I> (even if he 
 had not given them any sensible token of it), yet that if possible they 
 and theirs might be effectually obliged to the service and worship of 
 God, and might never turn aside to idols, the glory of God appeared to 
 them, and visibly owned what they had done. We are not now to expect 
 such appearances; we Christians walk more by faith, and less by sight, 
 than they did. But we may be sure that God draws nigh to those who draw 
 nigh to him, and that the offerings of faith are really acceptable to 
 him, though, the sacrifices being spiritual, the tokens of the 
 acceptance are, as it is fit they should be, spiritual likewise. To 
 those who are duly consecrated to God he will undoubtedly manifest 
 himself.

 2. He puts both priests and people upon preparing to receive this 
 favour which God designed them. <I>Aaron and his sons,</I> and <I>the 
 elders of Israel,</I> are all summoned to attend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, God will manifest himself in the solemn assemblies of his people 
 and ministers; and those that would have the benefit and comfort of 
 God's appearances must in them give their attendance.

 (1.) Aaron is ordered to prepare his offerings: <I>A young calf for a
 sin-offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Jewish writers suggest that a <I>calf</I> was appointed for a 
 sin-offering to remind him of his sin in making the golden calf, by 
 which he had rendered himself for ever unworthy of the honour of the 
 priesthood, and which he had reason to reflect upon with sorrow and 
 shame in all the atonements he made.

 (2.) Aaron must direct the people to get theirs ready. Hitherto Moses 
 had told the people what they must do; but now Aaron, as high priest 
 over the house of God, must be their teacher, <I>in things pertaining 
 to God: Unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Now that he was to speak from them to God in the sacrifices (the 
 language of which he that appointed them very well understood) he must 
 speak from God to them in the laws about the sacrifices. Thus Moses 
 would engage the people's respect and obedience to him, as one that was 
 set <I>over them in the Lord, to admonish them.</I>

 (3.) Aaron must offer his own first, and then the people's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Aaron must now <I>go to the altar,</I> Moses having shown him the way 
 to it; and there,

 [1.] He must <I>make an atonement for himself;</I> for the high priest,
 being <I>compassed with infirmity, ought, as for the people, so also 
 for himself, to offer for sins</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2,3">Heb. v. 2, 3</A>),

 and for himself first; for how can we expect to be accepted in our
 prayers for others, if we ourselves be not reconciled to God? Nor is 
 any service pleasing to God till the guilt of sin be removed by our 
 interest in the great propitiation. Those that have the care of the 
 souls of others are also hereby taught to look to their own in the 
 first place; this charity must begin at home, though it must not end 
 there. It is the charge to Timothy, to take care to save himself first, 
 and then those that heard him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:16">1 Tim. iv. 16</A>.

 The high priest made atonement for himself, as one that was joined with
 sinners; but we have a high priest that was separated from sinners, and 
 needed no atonement. When Messiah the prince was cut off as a
 sacrifice, it was not for himself; for he knew no sin.

 [2.] He must <I>make an atonement for the people,</I> by offering their 
 sacrifices. Now that he was made a high priest he must lay to heart
 the concerns of the people, and this as their great concern, their 
 reconciliation to God, and the putting away of sin which had separated 
 between them and God. He must <I>make atonement as the Lord 
 commanded.</I> See here the wonderful condescension of the mercy of 
 God, that he not only allows an atonement to be made, but commands it; 
 not only admits, but requires us to be reconciled to him. No room 
 therefore is left to doubt but that the atonement which is commanded 
 will be accepted.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
 sin offering, which <I>was</I> for himself.
 &nbsp; 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
 dipped his finger in the blood, and put <I>it</I> upon the horns of
 the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
 &nbsp; 10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver
 of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
 camp.
 &nbsp; 12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
 unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
 altar.
 &nbsp; 13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
 pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <I>them</I> upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <I>them</I>
 upon the burnt offering on the altar.
 &nbsp; 15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat,
 which <I>was</I> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and
 offered it for sin, as the first.
 &nbsp; 16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according
 to the manner.
 &nbsp; 17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful
 thereof, and burnt <I>it</I> upon the altar, beside the burnt
 sacrifice of the morning.
 &nbsp; 18 He slew also the bullock and the ram <I>for</I> a sacrifice of
 peace offerings, which <I>was</I> for the people: and Aaron's sons
 presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar
 round about,
 &nbsp; 19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and
 that which covereth <I>the inwards,</I> and the kidneys, and the caul
 <I>above</I> the liver:
 &nbsp; 20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
 upon the altar:
 &nbsp; 21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <I>for</I> a
 wave offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; as Moses commanded.
 &nbsp; 22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
 them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
 burnt offering, and peace offerings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These being the first offerings that ever were offered by the levitical 
 priesthood, according to the newly-enacted law of sacrifices, the 
 manner of offering them is particularly related, that it might appear 
 how exactly they agreed with the institution. 

 1. Aaron with his own hands <I>slew the offering</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and did the work of the inferior priests; for, great as he was, he must 
 not think any service below him which he could do for the honour of 
 God: and, as Moses had shown him how to do this work decently and 
 dexterously, so he showed his sons, that they might do likewise; for 
 this is the best way of teaching, and thus parents should instruct 
 their children by example. Therefore as Moses before, so Aaron now 
 offered some of each of the several sorts of sacrifices that were 
 appointed, whose rites differed, that they might be <I>thoroughly 
 furnished for every good work.</I>

 2. He offered these <I>besides the burnt-sacrifice of the morning,</I> 
 which was every day offered first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, Our accustomed devotions morning and evening, alone and in our 
 families, must not be omitted upon any pretence whatsoever, no, not 
 when extraordinary services are to be performed; whatever is added, 
 these must not be diminished.

 3. It is not clear whether, when it is said that he burnt such and such 
 parts of the sacrifices upon the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:10-20"><I>v.</I> 10-20</A>),

 the meaning is that he burnt them immediately with ordinary fire, as 
 formerly, or that he laid them upon the altar ready to be burnt with 
 the fire from heaven which they expected 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 or whether, as bishop Patrick thinks, he burnt the offerings for 
 himself with ordinary fire, but when they were burnt out he laid the 
 people's sacrifices upon the altar, which were kindled and consumed by 
 the fire of the Lord. I would rather conjecture, because it is said of 
 all these sacrifices that <I>he burnt them</I> (except the 
 burnt-offering for the people, of which it is said that he offered it 
 <I>according to the manner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,

 which seems to be equivalent), that he did not kindle the fire to burn 
 them, but that then the fire from the Lord fastened upon them, put out 
 the fire that he had kindled (as we know a greater fire puts out a 
 less), and suddenly consumed the remainder, which the fire he had 
 kindled would have consumed slowly.

 4. When Aaron had done all that on his part was to be done about the
 sacrifices he <I>lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This was one part of the priest's work, in which he was a type of 
 Christ, who came into the world to bless us, and when he was parted 
 from his disciples, at his ascension, <I>lifted up his hands and 
 blessed them,</I> and in them his whole church, of which they were the 
 elders and representatives, as the great high priest of our profession. 
 Aaron <I>lifted up his hands</I> in blessing them, to intimate whence 
 he desired and expected the blessing to come, even from heaven, which 
 is God's throne. Aaron could but crave a blessing, it is God's 
 prerogative to command it. Aaron, when he had blessed, came down; 
 Christ, when he blessed, went up.</P>

 <A NAME="Le9_23"> </A>
 <A NAME="Le9_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto all the people.
 &nbsp; 24 And there came a fire out from before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and consumed
 upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <I>which</I> when all
 the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are not told what Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Some of the Jewish writers say, "They went in to pray for the 
 appearance of the divine glory;" most probably they went in that Moses 
 might instruct Aaron how to do the service that was to be done 
 there--burn incense, light the lamps, set the show-bread, &c., that he 
 might instruct his sons in it. But, when they came out, they both 
 joined in blessing the people, who stood expecting the promised 
 appearance of the divine glory; and it was now (when Moses and Aaron 
 concurred in praying) that they had what they waited for. Note, God's 
 manifestations of himself, of his glory and grace, are commonly given 
 in answer to prayer. When Christ was praying the <I>heavens were 
 opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:21">Luke iii. 21</A>.

 The glory of God appeared, not while the sacrifices were in offering,
 but when the priests prayed (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:13">2 Chron. v. 13</A>),

 when they praised God, which intimates that the prayers and praises of
 God's spiritual priests are more pleasing to God than all 
 burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the solemnity was finished, the blessing pronounced, and the 
 congregation ready to be dismissed, in the close of the day, then God 
 testified his acceptance, which gave them such satisfaction as was well 
 worth waiting for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>The glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 What the appearance of it was we are not told; no doubt it was such as 
 carried its own evidence along with it. The glory which <I>filled the 
 tabernacle</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:34">Exod. xl. 34</A>)

 now showed itself at the door of the tabernacle to those who attended
 there, as a prince shows himself to the expecting crowd, to gratify 
 them. God hereby testified of their gifts, and showed them that he was 
 worthy for whom they should do all this. Note, Those that diligently 
 attend upon God in the way he has appointed shall have such a sight of 
 his glory as shall be abundantly to their satisfaction. Those that 
 dwell in God's house with an eye of faith may <I>behold the beauty of 
 the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>There came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed the 
 sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Here the learned bishop Patrick has a very probable conjecture, that 
 Moses and Aaron staid in the tabernacle till it was time to offer the 
 evening sacrifice, which Aaron did, but it is not mentioned, because it 
 was done of course, and it was this which the <I>fire that came out 
 from the Lord consumed.</I> Whether this fire came from heaven, or out 
 of the most holy place, or from that visible appearance of the glory of 
 God which all the people saw, it was a manifest token of God's 
 acceptance of their service, as, afterwards, of Solomon's sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:1">2 Chron. vii. 1</A>,

 and Elijah's,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:38">1 Kings xviii. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This fire did consume (or, as the word is, <I>eat up</I>) the 
 present sacrifice. And two ways this was a testimony of 
 acceptance:--

 (1.) It signified the turning away of God's wrath from them. God's
 wrath is a consuming fire; this fire might justly have fastened upon 
 the people, and consumed them for their sins; but its fastening upon 
 the sacrifice, and consuming that, signified God's acceptance of that 
 as an atonement for the sinner. 

 (2.) It signified God's entering into covenant and communion with them: 
 they ate their part of the sacrifice, and the fire of the Lord ate up 
 his part; and thus he did, as it were, <I>sup with them, and they with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This fire did, as it were, take possession of the altar. The fire 
 was thus kindled in God's house, which was to continue as long as the 
 house stood, as we read before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>.

 This also was a figure of good things to come. The Spirit descended
 upon the apostles in <I>fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:3">Acts ii. 3</A>),

 so ratifying their commission, as this spoken of here did the priests'.
 And the descent of this holy fire into our souls to kindle in them 
 pious and devout affections towards God, and such a holy zeal as burns 
 up the flesh and the lusts of it, is a certain token of God's gracious 
 acceptance of our persons and performances. That redounds to God's 
 glory which is the work of his own grace in us. <I>Hereby we know that 
 we dwell in God, and God in us, because he hath thus given us of his 
 Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:13">1 John iv. 13</A>.

 Now henceforward,

 (1.) All their sacrifices and incense must be offered with this fire.
 Note, Nothing goes to God but what comes from him. We must have grace, 
 that holy fire, from the God of grace, else we cannot <I>serve him 
 acceptably,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28">Heb. xii. 28</A>.

 (2.) The priests must keep it burning with a constant supply of fuel, 
 and the fuel must be wood, the cleanest of fuel. Thus those to whom God 
 has given grace must take heed of quenching the Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are here told how the people were affected with this discovery 
 of God's glory and grace; they received it, 

 1. With the highest joy: <I>They shouted;</I> so stirring up themselves 
 and one another to a holy triumph, in the assurance now given them that 
 they had God nigh unto them, which is spoken of the grandeur of their 
 nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>.

 2. With the lowest reverence: <I>They fell on their faces,</I> humbly 
 adoring the majesty of that God who vouchsafed thus to manifest himself 
 to them. That is a sinful fear of God which drives us from him; a 
 gracious fear makes us bow before him. Very good impressions were made 
 upon their minds for the present, but they soon wore off, as those 
 commonly do which are made by that which is only sensible; while the 
 influences of faith are durable.</P>
