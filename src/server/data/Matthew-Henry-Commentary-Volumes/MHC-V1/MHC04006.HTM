 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
 either man or woman shall separate <I>themselves</I> to vow a vow of a
 Nazarite, to separate <I>themselves</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 3 He shall separate <I>himself</I> from wine and strong drink, and
 shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
 neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
 grapes, or dried.
 &nbsp; 4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
 made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
 &nbsp; 5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no
 razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the
 which he separateth <I>himself</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he shall be holy,
 <I>and</I> shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
 &nbsp; 6 All the days that he separateth <I>himself</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> he
 shall come at no dead body.
 &nbsp; 7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
 mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
 because the consecration of his God <I>is</I> upon his head.
 &nbsp; 8 All the days of his separation he <I>is</I> holy unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
 the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the
 day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
 &nbsp; 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two
 young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of
 the congregation:
 &nbsp; 11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and
 the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him,
 for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
 same day.
 &nbsp; 12 And he shall consecrate unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the days of his
 separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
 trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost,
 because his separation was defiled.
 &nbsp; 13 And this <I>is</I> the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
 separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
 the tabernacle of the congregation:
 &nbsp; 14 And he shall offer his offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, one he lamb
 of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
 ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
 and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,
 &nbsp; 15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour
 mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with
 oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.
 &nbsp; 16 And the priest shall bring <I>them</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and shall
 offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:
 &nbsp; 17 And he shall offer the ram <I>for</I> a sacrifice of peace
 offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with the basket of unleavened bread: the
 priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink
 offering.
 &nbsp; 18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation <I>at</I>
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take
 the hair of the head of his separation, and put <I>it</I> in the fire
 which <I>is</I> under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram,
 and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
 wafer, and shall put <I>them</I> upon the hands of the Nazarite, after
 <I>the hair of</I> his separation is shaven:
 &nbsp; 20 And the priest shall wave them <I>for</I> a wave offering before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: this <I>is</I> holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
 heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.
 &nbsp; 21 This <I>is</I> the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, <I>and of</I>
 his offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for his separation, beside <I>that</I> that
 his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
 must do after the law of his separation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the law for the discovery and shame of those that by sin had made 
 themselves vile, fitly follows this for the direction and encouragement 
 of those who by their eminent piety and devotion had made themselves 
 honourable, and distinguished themselves from their neighbours. It is 
 very probable that there were those before the making of this law who 
 went under the character of <I>Nazarites,</I> and were celebrated by 
 that title as persons professing greater strictness and zeal in 
 religion than other people; for the vow of a Nazarite is spoken of here 
 as a thing already well known, but the obligation of it is reduced to a 
 greater certainty than hitherto it had been. Joseph is called a 
 Nazarite among his brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:26">Gen. xlix. 26</A>),

 not only because separate from them, but because eminent among them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general character of a Nazarite: it is a person <I>separated 
 unto the Lord,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Some were Nazarites for life, either by divine designation, as Samson
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5">Judg. xiii. 5</A>),

 and John Baptist 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15">Luke i. 15</A>),

 or by their parents' vow concerning them, as Samuel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11">1 Sam. i. 11</A>.

 Of these this law speaks not. Others were so for a certain time, and by
 their own voluntary engagement, and concerning them rules are given by 
 this law.  A woman might bind herself with the vow of a Nazarite, under 
 the limitations we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:3"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 3</A>,

 where the vow which the woman is supposed to vow unto the Lord seems to
 be meant especially of this vow.  The Nazarites were,

 1. Devoted to the Lord during the time of their Nazariteship, and, it 
 is probable, spent much of their time in the study of the law, in acts 
 of devotion, and instructing others. An air of piety was thereby put 
 upon them, and upon their whole conversation.  

 2. They were separated from common persons and common things. Those
 that are consecrated to God must not be conformed to this world. They 
 distinguished themselves, not only from others, but from what they 
 themselves were before and after. 

 3. They separated themselves by vowing a vow. Every Israelite was bound
 by the divine law to love God with all his heart, but the Nazarites by 
 their own act and deed bound themselves to some religious observances, 
 as fruits and expressions of that love, which other Israelites were not 
 bound to. Some such there were, whose spirits God stirred up to be in 
 their day the ornaments of the church, the standard-bearers of 
 religion, and patterns of piety. It is spoken of as a great favour to 
 their nation that God <I>raised up of their young men for 
 Nazarites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>.

 The Nazarites were known in the streets and respected as <I>purer than
 snow, whiter than milk,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7">Lam. iv. 7</A>.

 Christ was called in reproach a Nazarene, so were his followers: but he
 was no Nazarite according to this law; he drank wine, and touched dead 
 bodies, yet in his this type had its accomplishment, for in him all 
 purity and perfection met; and every true Christian is a spiritual 
 Nazarite, separated by vow unto the Lord.  We find St. Paul, by the 
 persuasion of his friends, in complaisance to the Jews, submitting to 
 this law of the Nazarites; but at the same time it is declared that the 
 Gentiles should <I>observe no such thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:24,25">Acts xxi. 24, 25</A>.

 It was looked upon as a great honour to a man to be a Nazarite, and
 therefore if a man speak of it as a punishment, saying for instance, "I 
 will be a Nazarite rather than do so or so," he is (say the Jews) a 
 wicked man; but he that vows unto the Lord in the way of holiness to be 
 a Nazarite, lo, <I>the crown of his God is upon his head.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular obligations that the Nazarites lay under. That the 
 fancies of superstitious men might not multiply their restraints 
 endlessly, God himself lays down the law for them, and gives them the 
 rule of their profession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must have nothing to do with <I>the fruit of the vine,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:3,4"><I>v.</I>  3, 4</A>.

 They must drink no wine nor string drink, nor eat grapes, no, not the 
 kernel nor the husk; they might not so much as eat a raisin. The 
 learned Dr. Lightfoot has a conjecture (Hor. Heb. in Luc. 1. 15), that,
 as the ceremonial pollutions by leprosy and otherwise represented the 
 sinful state of fallen man, so the institution of the order of 
 Nazarites was designed to represent the pure and perfect state of man 
 in innocency, and that the tree of knowledge, forbidden to Adam, was 
 the vine, and for that reason it was forbidden to the Nazarites, and 
 all the produce of it. Those who gave the Nazarites wine to drink did 
 the tempter's work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:12">Amos ii. 12</A>),

 persuading them to that forbidden fruit. That it was reckoned a
 perfection and praise not to drink wine appears from the instance of 
 the Rechabites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:6">Jer. xxxv. 6</A>.

 They were to <I>drink no wine,</I>

 (1.) That they might be examples of temperance and mortification. Those
 that separate themselves to God and to his honour must not gratify the 
 desires of the body, but keep it under and bring it into subjection. 
 Drinking <I>a little wine for the stomach's sake</I> is allowed, to 
 help that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1 Tim. v. 23</A>.

 But drinking much wine for the <I>palate's sake,</I> to please that,
 does by no means become those who profess to walk not <I>after the 
 flesh, but after the Spirit.</I>

 (2.) That they might be qualified to employ themselves in the service
 of God. They must not drink, lest they should <I>forget the law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>),

 lest they should <I>err through wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa.  xxviii. 7</A>.

 Let all Christians oblige themselves to be very moderate in the use of
 wine and strong drink; for, if the love of these once gets the mastery 
 of a man, he becomes a very easy prey to Satan. It is observable that 
 because they were to drink no wine (which was the thing mainly 
 intended) they were to eat nothing that came of the vine, to teach us 
 with the utmost care and caution to avoid sin and every thing that 
 borders upon it and leads to it, or may be a temptation to us.  
 <I>Abstain from all appearance of evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:22">1 Thess. v. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must not <I>cut their hair,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They must neither poll their heads nor shave their beards; this was 
 that mark of Samson's Nazariteship which we often read of in his story. 
 Now,

 (1.) This signified a noble neglect of the body and the ease and
 ornament of it, which became those who, being separated to God, ought 
 to be wholly taken up with their souls, to secure their peace and 
 beauty. It signified that they had, for the present, renounced all 
 sorts of sensual pleasures and delights, and resolved to live a life of 
 self-denial and mortification. Mephibosheth in sorrow <I>trimmed not 
 his beard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:24">2 Sam. xix. 24</A>.

 (2.) Some observe that long hair is spoken of as a badge of subjection
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:5">1 Cor. xi. 5</A>,

 &c.); so that the long hair of the Nazarites denoted their subjection
 to God, and their putting themselves under his dominion.

 (3.) By this they were known to all that met them to be Nazarites, and
 so it commanded respect. It made them look great without art; it was 
 nature's crown to the head, and a testimony for them that they had 
 preserved their purity. For, if they had been defiled, their hair must 
 have been cut, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:29">Jer. vii. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They must not come near any dead body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Others might touch dead bodies, and contracted only a ceremonial 
 pollution by it for some time; some must do it, else the dead must be 
 unburied; but the Nazarites must not do it, upon pain of forfeiting all 
 the honour of their Nazariteship. They must not attend the funeral of 
 any relation, no, not father nor mother, any more than the high priest 
 himself, because <I>the consecration of his God is upon his head.</I> 
 Those that separate themselves to God must learn,

 (1.) To distinguish themselves, and do more than others.

 (2.) To keep their consciences pure from dead works, and not to touch
 the unclean thing. The greater profession of religion we make, and the 
 more eminent we appear, the greater care we must take to avoid all sin, 
 for we have so much the more honour to lose by it.

 (3.) To moderate their affections even to their near relations, so as
 not to let their sorrow for the loss of them break in upon their joy in 
 God and submission to his will.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:21,22">Matt. viii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. All <I>the days of their separation</I> they must be <I>holy to the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This was the meaning of those external observances, and without this 
 they were of no account. The Nazarites must be devoted to God, employed 
 for him, and their minds intent upon him; they must keep themselves 
 pure in heart and life, and be in every thing conformable to the divine 
 image and will; this is to be holy, this is to be a Nazarite 
 indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The provision that was made for the cleansing of a Nazarite, if he 
 happened unavoidably to contract a ceremonial pollution by the touch of 
 a dead body. No penalty is ordered by this law for the wilful breach of 
 the foregoing laws; for it was not supposed that a man who had so much 
 religion as to make that vow could have so little as to break it 
 presumptuously: nor could it be supposed that he should drink wine, or 
 have his hair cut, but by his own fault; but purely by the providence 
 of God, without any fault of his own, he might be near a dead body, and 
 that is the case put 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>If a man die very suddenly by him, he has defiled the head of his 
 consecration.</I> Note, Death sometimes takes men away very suddenly, 
 and without any previous warning. A man might be well and dead in so 
 little a time that the most careful Nazarite could not avoid being 
 polluted by the dead body; so short a step is it sometimes, and so soon 
 taken, from time to eternity. God prepare us for sudden death! In this 
 case,

 1. He must be purified from the ceremonial pollution he had contracted, 
 as others must, upon the seventh day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Nay, more was required for the purifying of the Nazarite than of any 
 other person that had touched a dead body; he must bring a sin-offering 
 and a burnt-offering, and an atonement must be <I>made for him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 This teaches us that sins of infirmity, and the faults we are overtaken 
 in by surprise, must be seriously repented of, and that an application 
 must be made of the virtue of Christ's sacrifice to our souls for the 
 forgiveness of them every day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,2">1 John ii. 1, 2</A>.

 It teaches us also that, if those who make an eminent profession of
 religion do any thing to sully the reputation of their profession, more 
 is expected from them than others, for the retrieving both of their 
 peace and of their credit.

 2. He must begin the days of his separation again; for all that were
 past before his pollution, though coming ever so near the period of his 
 time set, were lost, and not reckoned to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>.

 This obliged them to be very careful not to defile themselves by the 
 dead, for that was the only thing that made them lose their time, and 
 it teaches us that <I>if a righteous man turn away from his 
 righteousness,</I> and defile himself with dead works, all his 
 righteousness that he has done shall be lost to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:13">Ezek. xxxiii. 13</A>.

 It is all lost, all in vain, if he do not persevere, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:4">Gal. iii. 4</A>.

 He must begin again, and do his first works.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The law for the solemn discharge of a Nazarite from his vow, when
 he had completed the time he fixed to himself. Before the expiration of 
 that term he could not be discharged; before he vowed, it was in his 
 own power, but it was too late after the vow to make enquiry. The Jews 
 say that the time of a Nazarite's vow could not be less than thirty 
 days; and if a man said, "I will be a Nazarite but for two days," yet 
 he was bound for thirty; but it should seem Paul's vow was for only 
 seven days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:27">Acts xxi. 27</A>),

 or, rather, then he observed the ceremony of finishing that vow of
 Nazariteship from which, being at a distance from the temple, he had 
 discharged himself some years before at Cenchrea only by the ceremony 
 of cutting his hair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18">Acts xviii. 18</A>.

 When the time of the vowed separation was out, he was to be made free,

 1. Publicly, <I>at the door of the tabernacle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that all might take notice of the finishing of his vow, and none might 
 be offended if they saw him now drink wine, who had so lately refused.

 2.  It was to be done with sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Lest he should think that by this eminent piece of devotion he had made 
 God a debtor to him, he is appointed, even when he had finished his 
 vow, to bring an offering to God; for, when we have done our utmost in 
 duty to God, still we must own ourselves behind-hand with him. He must 
 bring one of each sort of the instituted offerings.

 (1.) A burnt-offering, as an acknowledgment of God's sovereign dominion
 over him and all he had still, notwithstanding his discharge from this 
 particular vow. 

 (2.) A sin-offering. This, though mentioned second 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>),

 yet seems to have been offered first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 for atonement must be made for our sins before any of our sacrifices 
 can be accepted. And it is very observable that even the Nazarite, who 
 in the eye of men was <I>purer than snow</I> and <I>whiter than 
 milk,</I> yet durst not appear before the holy God without a 
 sin-offering. Though he had fulfilled the vow of his separation without 
 any pollution, yet he must bring a sacrifice for sin; for there is 
 guilt insensibly contracted by the best of men, even in their best 
 works--some good omitted, some ill admitted, which, if we were dealt
 with in strict justice, would be our ruin, and in consequence of which 
 it is necessary for us to receive the atonement, and plead it as our 
 righteousness before God.

 (3.) A peace-offering, in thankfulness to God who had enabled him to
 fulfil his vow, and in supplication to God for grace to preserve him 
 from ever doing any thing unbecoming one that had been once a Nazarite, 
 remembering that, though he was now freed from the bonds of his own 
 vow, he still remained under the bonds of the divine law.

 (4.) To these were added the meat-offerings and drink-offerings,
 according to the manner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:15,17"><I>v.</I>  15, 17</A>),

 for these always accompanied the burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: 
 and, besides these, a basket of unleavened cakes, and wafers.

 (5.) Part of the peace-offering, with a cake and wafer, was to be waved
 for a wave-offering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>);

 and this was a gratuity to the priest, who had it for his pains, after 
 it had been first presented to God.

 (6.) Besides all this, he might bring his free-will offerings, <I>such
 as his hand shall get,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 More than this he might bring, but not less. And, to grace the 
 solemnity, it was common upon this occasion to have their friends to be 
 at <I>charges with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:24">Acts xxi. 24</A>.

 <I>Lastly,</I> One ceremony more was appointed, which was like the
 cancelling of the bond when the condition is performed, and that was 
 the <I>cutting off of his hair,</I> which had been suffered to grow all 
 the time of his being a Nazarite, and burning it in the fire over which 
 the peace-offerings were boiling,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This intimated that his full performance of his vow was acceptable to 
 God in Christ the great sacrifice, and not otherwise. Learn hence to 
 <I>vow and pay to the Lord our God,</I> for <I>he has no pleasure in 
 fools.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The priests, among other good offices which they were to do, are 
 appointed solemnly to bless the people in the <I>name of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It was part of their work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:5">Deut. xxi. 5</A>.

 Hereby God put an honour upon the priests, for <I>the less is blessed
 of the better;</I> and hereby he gave great comfort and satisfaction to 
 the people, who looked upon the priest as God's mouth to them. Though 
 the priests of himself could do no more than beg a blessing, yet being 
 an intercessor by office, and doing that in his name who commands the 
 blessing, the prayer carried with it a promise, and he pronounced it as 
 one having authority with his hands lifted up and his face towards the 
 people. Now,

 1. This was a type of Christ's errand into the world, which was to
 <I>bless us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>),

 as the high priest of our profession.  The last thing he did on earth
 was with uplifted hands to bless his disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:50,51">Luke xxiv. 50, 51</A>.

 The learned bishop Pearson observes it as a tradition of the Jews that
 the priests blessed the people only at the close of the morning 
 sacrifice, not of the evening sacrifice, to show (says he) that in the 
 last days, the days of the Messiah, which are (as it were) the evening 
 of the world, the benediction of the law should cease, and the blessing 
 of Christ should take place.

 2. It was a pattern to gospel ministers, the masters of assemblies, who
 are in like manner to dismiss their solemn assemblies with a blessing. 
 The same that are God's mouth to his people, to teach and command them, 
 are his mouth likewise to bless them; and those that receive the law 
 shall receive the blessing. The Hebrew doctors warn the people that 
 they say not, "What availeth the blessing of this poor simple priest? 
 "For," say they, "the receiving of the blessing depends, not on the 
 priest, but on the holy blessed God."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A form of blessing is here prescribed them. In their other 
 devotions no form was prescribed, but this being God's command 
 concerning benediction, that it might not look like any thing of their 
 own, he puts the very words in their mouths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24-26"><I>v.</I>  24-26</A>.
 
 Here observe,
 
 1. That the blessing is commanded upon each particular person: <I>The
 Lord bless thee.</I> They must each of them prepare themselves to 
 receive the blessing, and then they should find enough in it to make 
 them every man happy. <I>Blessed shalt thou be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:3">Deut. xxviii. 3</A>.

 If we take the law to ourselves, we may take the blessing to ourselves,
 as if our names were inserted.

 2. That the name <I>Jehovah</I> is three times repeated in it, and (as
 the critics observe) each with a different accent in the original; the 
 Jews themselves think there is some mystery in this, and we know what 
 it is, the New Testament having explained it, which directs us to 
 expect the blessing from <I>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the 
 love of the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost,</I> each of 
 which persons is Jehovah, and yet they are "not three Lords, but one 
 Lord," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:14">2 Cor. xiii. 14</A>.

 3. That the favour of God is all in all in this blessing, for that is
 the fountain of all good.

 (1.) <I>The Lord bless thee!</I> Our blessing God is only our speaking
 well of him; his blessing us is doing well for us; those whom he 
 blesses are blessed indeed.

 (2.) <I>The Lord make his face shine upon thee,</I> alluding to the
 shining of the sun upon the earth, to enlighten and comfort it, and to 
 renew the face of it. "The Lord love thee and cause thee to know that 
 he loves thee." We cannot but be happy if we have God's love; and we 
 cannot but be easy if we know that we have it.

 (3.) <I>The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee.</I> This is to the
 same purport with the former, and it seems to allude to the smiles of a 
 father upon his child, or of a man upon his friend whom he takes 
 pleasure in. If God give us the assurances of his special favour and 
 his acceptance of us, this will <I>put gladness into the heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7,8">Ps. iv. 7, 8</A>.

 4. That the fruits of this favour conveyed by this blessing are
 protection, pardon, and peace.

 (1.) Protection from evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The Lord <I>keep thee,</I> for it is he that keeps Israel, and neither 
 <I>slumbers nor sleeps</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:4">Ps. cxxi. 4</A>), 

 and all believers are <I>kept by the power of God.</I>

 (2.) Pardon of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The Lord be <I>gracious,</I> or <I>merciful,</I> unto thee.

 (3.) Peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 including all that good which goes to make up a complete happiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God here promises to ratify and confirm the blessing: <I>They 
 shall put my name upon the children of Israel,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 God gives them leave to make use of his name in blessing the people,
 and to bless them as his people, called by his name.  This included all 
 the blessings they could pronounce upon them, to mark them for God's 
 peculiar, the people of his choice and love. God's name upon them was 
 their honour, their comfort, their safety, their plea. <I>We are called 
 by thy name, leave us not.</I> It is added, <I>and I will bless 
 them.</I> Note, A divine blessing goes along with divine institutions, 
 and puts virtue and efficacy into them. What Christ says of the peace 
 is true of the blessing, "Peace to this congregation," if the sons of 
 peace and heirs of blessing be there, the peace, the blessing, shall 
 rest upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:5,6">Luke x. 5, 6</A>.

 For in <I>every place where God records his name</I> he will <I>meet
 his people and bless them.</I></P>
