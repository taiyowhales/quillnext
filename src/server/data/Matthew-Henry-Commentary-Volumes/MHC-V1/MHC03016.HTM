 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the institution of the annual solemnity of the 
 day of atonement, or expiation, which had as much gospel in it as 
 perhaps any of the appointments of the ceremonial law, as appears by 
 the reference the apostle makes to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7">Heb. ix. 7</A>,

 &c. We had before divers laws concerning sin-offerings for particular
 persons, and to be offered upon particular occasions; but this is 
 concerning the stated sacrifice, in which the whole nation was 
 interested. The whole service of the day is committed to the high 
 priest. 

 I. He must never come into the most holy place but upon this day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He must come dressed in linen garments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. He must bring a sin-offering and a burnt-offering for himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:3">ver. 3</A>),

 offer his sin-offering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>), 

 then go within the veil with some of the blood of his sin-offering,
 burn incense, and sprinkle the blood before the mercy-seat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 IV. Two goats must be provided for the people, lots cast upon them,
 and,

 1. One of them must be a sin-offering for the people 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:5,7-9">ver. 5, 7-9</A>),

 and the blood of it must be sprinkled before the mercy-seat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>),

 and then some of the blood of both the sin-offerings must be sprinkled
 upon the altar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>.

 2. The other must be a scape-goat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:10">ver. 10</A>),

 the sins of Israel must be confessed over him, and then he must be sent
 away into the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>), 

 and he that brought him away must be ceremonially unclean,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:26">ver. 26</A>.

 V. The burnt-offerings were then to be offered, the fat of the
 sin-offerings burnt on the altar, and their flesh burnt without the 
 camp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:23-25,27,28">ver. 23-25, 27, 28</A>.

 VI. The people were to observe the day religiously by a holy rest and
 holy mourning for sin; and this was to be a statute for ever,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:29-34">ver. 29</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
 of Aaron, when they offered before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and died;
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
 that he come not at all times into the holy <I>place</I> within the
 vail before the mercy seat, which <I>is</I> upon the ark; that he die
 not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.
 &nbsp; 3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy <I>place</I>: with a young
 bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.
 &nbsp; 4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
 linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen
 girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these <I>are</I>
 holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and
 <I>so</I> put them on.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The date of this law concerning the day of atonement: it was 
 <I>after the death of the two sons of Aaron</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which we read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:1"><I>ch.</I> x. 1</A>.

 1. Lest Aaron should fear that any remaining guilt of that sin should
 cleave to his family, or (seeing the priests were so apt to offend) 
 that some after-sin of his other sons should be the ruin of his family, 
 he is directed how to make atonement for his house, that it might keep 
 in with God; for the atonement for it would be the establishment of it, 
 and preserve the entail of the blessing upon it.

 2. The priests being warned by the death of Nadab and Abihu to approach
 to God with reverence and godly fear (without which they came at their 
 peril), directions are here given how the nearest approach might be 
 made, not only without peril, but to unspeakable advantage and comfort, 
 if the directions were observed. When they were cut off for an undue 
 approach, the rest must not say, "Then we will not draw near at all," 
 but, "Then we will do it by rule." They died for their sin, therefore 
 God graciously provides for the rest, that they die not. Thus God's 
 judgments on some should be instructions to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The design of this law. One intention of it was to preserve a 
 veneration for the most holy place, within the veil, where the 
 <I>Shechinah,</I> or divine glory, was pleased to dwell between the 
 cherubim: <I>Speak unto Aaron, that he come not at all times into the 
 holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Before the veil some of the priests came every day to burn incense upon
 the golden altar, but within the veil none must ever come but the high 
 priest only, and he but on one day in the year, and with great ceremony 
 and caution. That place where God manifested his special presence must 
 not be made common. If none must come into the presence-chamber of an 
 earthly king uncalled, no, not the queen herself, upon pain of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:11">Esth. iv. 11</A>),

 was it not requisite that the same sacred respect should be paid to the
 Kings of kings? But see what a blessed change is made by the gospel of 
 Christ; all good Christians have now <I>boldness to enter into the 
 holiest,</I> through the veil, every day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,20">Heb. x. 19, 20</A>);

 and we <I>come boldly</I> (not as Aaron must, with fear and trembling)
 to the <I>throne of grace,</I> or mercy-seat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16">Heb. iv. 16</A>.

 While the manifestations of God's presence and grace were sensible, it
 was requisite that they should thus be confined and upon reserve, 
 because the objects of sense the more familiar they are made the less 
 awful or delightful they become; but now that they are purely spiritual 
 it is otherwise, for the objects of faith the more they are conversed 
 with the more do they manifest of their greatness and goodness: now 
 therefore we are welcome to come at all times into the <I>holy place 
 not made with hands,</I> for we are made to <I>sit together with Christ 
 in heavenly places</I> by faith,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:6">Eph. ii. 6</A>.

 Then Aaron must not come near at all times, <I>lest he die;</I> we now
 must come near at all times that we may live: it is distance only that 
 is our death. Then God appeared in the cloud upon the mercy-seat, but 
 now with open face we behold, not in a dark cloud, but in a clear 
 glass, the glory of the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The person to whom the work of this day was committed, and that 
 was the high priest only: <I>Thus shall Aaron come into the holy 
 place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He was to do all himself upon the day of atonement: only there was a
 second provided to be his substitute or supporter, in case any thing 
 should befal him, either of sickness or ceremonial uncleanness, that he 
 could not perform the service of the day. All Christians are spiritual 
 priests, but Christ only is the high priest, and he alone it is that 
 makes atonement, nor needed he either assistant or substitute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The attire of the high priest in this service. He was not to be 
 dressed up in his rich garments that were peculiar to himself: he was 
 not to put on the ephod, with the precious stones in it, but only the 
 linen clothes which he wore in common with the inferior priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 That meaner dress did best become him on this day of humiliation; and,
 being thinner and lighter, he would in it be more expedite for the work 
 or service of the day, which was all to go through his hands. Christ, 
 our high priest, made atonement for sin in our nature; not in the robes 
 of his own peculiar glory, but the linen garments of our mortality, 
 clean indeed, but mean.</P>

 Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for
 a burnt offering.
 &nbsp; 6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
 <I>is</I> for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
 house.
 &nbsp; 7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
 &nbsp; 9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s lot
 fell, and offer him <I>for</I> a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat,
 shall be presented alive before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to make an atonement
 with him, <I>and</I> to let him go for a scapegoat into the
 wilderness.
 &nbsp; 11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
 <I>is</I> for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
 for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
 which <I>is</I> for himself:
 &nbsp; 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire
 from off the altar before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and his hands full of sweet
 incense beaten small, and bring <I>it</I> within the vail:
 &nbsp; 13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that <I>is</I>
 upon the testimony, that he die not:
 &nbsp; 14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle
 <I>it</I> with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
 mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven
 times.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Jewish writers say that for seven days before the day of expiation 
 the high priest was to retire from his own house, and to dwell in a 
 chamber of the temple, that he might prepare himself for the service of 
 this great day. During those seven days he himself did the work of the 
 inferior priests about the sacrifices, incense, &c., that he might have 
 his hand in for this day: he must have the institution read to him 
 again and again, that he might be fully apprised of the whole method. 
 
 1. He was to begin the service of the day very early with the usual
 morning sacrifice, after he had first washed his whole body before he 
 dressed himself, and his hands and feet again afterwards. He then 
 burned the daily incense, dressed the lamps, and offered the 
 extraordinary sacrifice appointed for this day (not here, but 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:8">Num. xxix. 8</A>),

 a bullock, a ram, and seven lambs, all for burnt-offerings. This he is
 supposed to have done in his high priest's garments.

 2. He must now put off his rich robes, bathe himself, put on the linen
 garments, and present unto the Lord his own bullock, which was to be a 
 sin-offering for himself and his own house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The bullock was set between the temple and the altar, and the offering
 of him mentioned in this verse was the making of a solemn confession of 
 his sins and the sins of his house, earnestly praying for the 
 forgiveness of them, and this with his hands on the head of the 
 bullock.

 3. He must then cast lots upon the two goats, which were to make (both
 together) one sin-offering for the congregation. One of these goats 
 must be slain, in token of a satisfaction to be made to God's justice 
 for sin, the other must be sent away, in token of the remission or 
 dismission of sin by the mercy of God. Both must be presented together 
 to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 before the lot was cast upon them, and afterwards the scape-goat by 
 itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Some think that goats were chosen for the sin-offering because, by the
 disagreeableness of their smell, the offensiveness of sin is 
 represented: others think, because it was said that the demons which 
 the heathens then worshipped often appeared to their worshippers in the 
 form of goats, God therefore obliged his people to sacrifice goats, 
 that they might never be tempted to sacrifice to goats.

 4. The next thing to be done was to kill the bullock for the
 sin-offering for himself and his house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 "Now," say the Jews, "he must again put his hands on the head of the
 bullock, and repeat the confession and supplication he had before made, 
 and kill the bullock with his own hands, to make atonement for himself 
 first (for how could he make reconciliation for the sins of the people 
 till he was himself first reconciled?) and for his house, not only his 
 own family, but all the priests, who are called the <I>house of 
 Aaron,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:19">Ps. cxxxv. 19</A>.

 This charity must begin at home, though it must not end there.  The
 bullock being killed, he left one of the priests to stir the blood, 
 that it might not thicken, and then,

 5. He took a censer of burning coals (that would not smoke) in one
 hand, and a dish full of the sweet incense in the other, and then went 
 into the holy of holies through the veil, and went up towards the ark, 
 set the coals down upon the floor, and scattered the incense upon them, 
 so that the room was immediately filled with smoke. The Jews say that 
 he was to go in <I>side-ways,</I> that he might not look directly upon 
 the ark where the divine glory was, till it was covered with smoke; 
 then he must come out <I>backwards,</I> out of reverence to the divine 
 majesty; and, after a short prayer, he was to hasten out of the 
 sanctuary, to show himself to the people, that they might not suspect 
 that he had misbehaved himself and died before the Lord. 

 6. He then fetched the blood of the bullock from the priest whom he had
 left stirring it, and took that in with him the second time into the 
 holy of holies, which was now filled with the smoke of the incense, and 
 sprinkled with his finger of that blood upon, or rather towards, the 
 mercy-seat, once over against the top of it and then seven times 
 towards the lower part of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 But the drops of blood (as the Jews expound it) all fell upon the
 ground, and none touched the mercy-seat. Having done this, he came out 
 of the most holy place, set the basin of blood down in the sanctuary, 
 and went out.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that <I>is</I>
 for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
 that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle
 it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
 &nbsp; 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy <I>place,</I> because
 of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
 their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
 the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in
 the midst of their uncleanness.
 &nbsp; 17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
 congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
 <I>place,</I> until he come out, and have made an atonement for
 himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 18 And he shall go out unto the altar that <I>is</I> before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood
 of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put <I>it</I> upon
 the horns of the altar round about.
 &nbsp; 19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
 seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness
 of the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the priest had come out from the sprinkling the blood of the 
 bullock before the mercy-seat, 

 1. He must next kill the goat which was the sin-offering for the people
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and go the third time into the holy of holies, to sprinkle the blood of 
 the goat, as he had done that of the bullock; and thus he was to 
 <I>make atonement for the holy place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 that is, whereas the people by their sins had provoked God to take away 
 those tokens of his favourable presence with them, and rendered even 
 that holy place unfit to be the habitation of the holy God, atonement 
 was hereby made for sin, that God, being reconciled to them, might 
 continue with them.

 2. He must then do the same for the outward part of the tabernacle that
 he had done for the inner room, by sprinkling the blood of the bullock 
 first, and then that of the goat, without the veil, where the table and 
 incense-altar stood, eight times each as before. The reason intimated
 is <I>because the tabernacle remained among them in the midst of their 
 uncleanness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 God would hereby show them how much their hearts needed to be purified,
 when even the tabernacle, only by standing in the midst of such an 
 impure and sinful people, needed this expiation; and also that even 
 their devotions and religious performances had much amiss in them, for 
 which it was necessary that atonement should be made. During this 
 solemnity, none of the inferior priests must come into the tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 but, by standing without, must own themselves unworthy and unfit to 
 minister there, because their follies, and defects, and manifold 
 impurities in their ministry, had made this expiation of the tabernacle 
 necessary.

 3. He must then put some of the blood, both of the bullock and of the
 goat mixed together, upon the horns of the altar that is before the 
 Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 It is certain that the altar of incense had this blood put upon it, for
 so it is expressly ordered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:10">Exod. xxx. 10</A>);

 but some think that this directs the high priest to the altar of
 burnt-offerings, for that also is here called the <I>altar before the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 because he is said to <I>go out</I> to it, and because it may be 
 presumed that that also had need of an expiation; for to that the gifts 
 and offerings of the children of Israel were all brought, from whose 
 uncleanness the altar is here said to be hallowed.</P>

 &nbsp; 21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
 goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
 Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting
 them upon the head of the goat, and shall send <I>him</I> away by the

 and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
 offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
 atonement for himself, and for the people.
 &nbsp; 25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the
 altar.
 &nbsp; 26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
 clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
 the camp.
 &nbsp; 27 And the bullock <I>for</I> the sin offering, and the goat <I>for</I>
 the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in
 the holy <I>place,</I> shall <I>one</I> carry forth without the camp; and
 they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and
 their dung.
 &nbsp; 28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe
 his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

 The high priest having presented unto the Lord the expiatory 
 sacrifices, by the sprinkling of their blood, the remainder of which, 
 it is probable, he poured out at the foot of the brazen altar, 

 1. He is next to confess the sins of Israel, with both his hands upon
 the head of the scape-goat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>);

 and whenever hands were imposed upon the head of any sacrifice it was 
 always done with confession, according as the nature of the sacrifice 
 was; and, this being a sin-offering, it must be a confession of sin. In 
 the latter and more degenerate ages of the Jewish church they had a set 
 form of confession prepared for the high priest, but God here 
 prescribed none; for it might be supposed that the high priest was so 
 well acquainted with the state of the people, and had such a tender 
 concern for them, that he needed not any form. The confession must be 
 as particular as he could make it, not only of <I>all the iniquities of 
 the children of Israel,</I> but <I>all their transgressions in all 
 their sins.</I> In one sin there may be many transgressions, from the 
 several aggravating circumstances of it; and in our confessions we 
 should take notice of them, and not only say, <I>I have sinned,</I> 
 but, with Achan, "Thus and thus have I done." By this confession he 
 must <I>put the sins of Israel upon the head of the goat;</I> that is, 
 exercising faith upon the divine appointment which constituted such a 
 translation, he must transfer the punishment incurred from the sinners 
 to the sacrifice, which would have been but a jest, nay, an affront to 
 God, if he himself had not ordained it.

 2. The goat was then to be sent away immediately by the hand of a fit
 person pitched upon for the purpose, into a wilderness, a land not 
 inhabited; and God allowed them to make this construction of it, that 
 the sending away of the goat was the sending away of their sins, by a 
 free and full remission: <I>He shall bear upon him all their 
 iniquities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The losing of the goat was a sign to them that <I>the sins of Israel
 should be sought for, and not found,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:20">Jer. l. 20</A>.

 The later Jews had a custom to tie one shred of scarlet cloth to the
 horns of the goat and another to the gate of the temple, or to the top 
 of the rock where the goat was lost, and they concluded that if it 
 turned white, as they say it usually did, the sins of Israel were 
 forgiven, as it is written, <I>Though your sins have been as scarlet, 
 they shall be as wool:</I> and they add that for forty years before the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans the scarlet cloth never changed 
 colour at all, which is a fair confession that, having rejected the 
 substance, the shadow stood them in no stead.

 3. The high priest must then put off his linen garments in the
 tabernacle, and leave them there, the Jews say never to be worn again 
 by himself or any other, for they made new ones every year; and he must 
 bathe himself in water, put on his rich clothes, and then offer both 
 his own and the people's burnt-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 When we have the comfort of our pardon God must have the glory of it.
 If we have the benefit of the sacrifice of atonement, we must not 
 grudge the sacrifices of acknowledgment. And, it should seem, the 
 burning of the fat of the sin-offering was deferred till now

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 that it might be consumed with the burnt-offerings.

 4. The flesh of both those sin-offerings whose blood was taken within
 the veil was to be all burnt, not upon the altar, but at a distance 
 without the camp, to signify both our putting away sin by true 
 repentance, and the spirit of burning, and God's putting it away by a 
 full remission, so that it shall never rise up in judgment against us. 
 
 5. He that took the scape-goat into the wilderness, and those that
 burned the sin-offering, were to be looked upon as ceremonially 
 unclean, and must not come into the camp till they had washed their 
 clothes and bathed their flesh in water, which signified the defiling 
 nature of sin; even the sacrifice which was but made sin was defiling: 
 also the imperfection of the legal sacrifices; they were so far from 
 taking away sin that even <I>they</I> left some stain upon those that 
 touched them. 

 6. When all this was done, the high priest went again into the most
 holy place to fetch his censer, and so returned to his own house with 
 joy, because he had done his duty, and died not.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here some additional directions in reference to this great 
 solemnity, particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The day appointed for this solemnity. It must be observed yearly on 
 <I>the tenth day of the seventh month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The seventh had been reckoned the first month, till God appointed that
 the month in which the children of Israel came out of Egypt should 
 thenceforward be accounted and called the first month. Some have 
 fancied that this tenth day of the seventh month was the day of the 
 year on which our first parents fell, and that it was kept as a fast in 
 remembrance of their fall. Dr. Lightfoot computes that this was the day 
 on which Moses came the last time down from the mount, when he brought 
 with him the renewed tables, and the assurances of God's being 
 reconciled to Israel, and his face shone: that day must be a day of 
 atonement throughout their generations; for the remembrance of God's 
 forgiving them their sin about the golden calf might encourage them to 
 hope that, upon their repentance, he would forgive them all 
 trespasses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duty of the people on this day. 

 (1.) They must rest from all their labours: <I>It shall be a sabbath of
 rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The work of the day was itself enough, and a good day's work if it was
 done well; therefore they must do no other work at all. The work of 
 humiliation for sin requires such a close application of mind, and such 
 a fixed engagement of the whole man, as will not allow us to turn aside 
 to any other work. The day of atonement seems to be that sabbath spoken 
 of by the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:13">Isa. lviii. 13</A>),

 for it is the same with the fast spoken of in the verses before.

 (2.) They must afflict their souls. They must refrain from all bodily
 refreshments and delights, in token of inward humiliation and 
 contrition of soul for their sins. They all fasted on this day from 
 food (except the sick and children), and laid aside their ornaments, 
 and did not anoint themselves, as Daniel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3,12"><I>ch.</I> x. 3, 12</A>.

 <I>David chastened his soul with fasting,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13">Ps. xxxv. 13</A>.

 And it signified the mortifying of sin and turning from it, <I>loosing
 the bands of wickedness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6,7">Isa. lviii. 6, 7</A>.

 The Jewish doctors advised that they should not on that day read those
 portions of scripture which were proper to affect them with delight and 
 joy, because it was a day to afflict their souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The perpetuity of this institution: <I>It shall be a statute for 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:29,34"><I>v.</I> 29, 34</A>.

 It must not be intermitted any year, nor ever let fall till that
 constitution should be dissolved, and the type should be superseded by 
 the antitype. As long as we are continually sinning, we must be 
 continually repenting, and receiving the atonement. The law of 
 afflicting our souls for sin is a statute for ever, which will continue 
 in force till we arrive where all tears, even those of repentance, will 
 be wiped from our eyes. The apostle observes it as an evidence of the 
 insufficiency of the legal sacrifices to take away sin, and purge the 
 conscience from it, that in them there was a <I>remembrance made of sin 
 every year,</I> upon the day of atonement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1-3">Heb. x. 1-3</A>.

 The annual repetition of the sacrifices showed that there was in them
 only a faint and feeble effort towards making atonement; it could be 
 done effectually only by the <I>offering up of the body of Christ once 
 for all,</I> and that once was sufficient; that sacrifice needed not to 
 be repeated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us see what there was of gospel in all this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here are typified the two great gospel privileges of the remission 
 of sin and access to God, both which we owe to the mediation of our 
 Lord Jesus. Here then let us see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The expiation of guilt which Christ made for us. He is himself 
 both the maker and the matter of the atonement; for he is, 

 [1.] The priest, the high priest, that <I>makes reconciliation for the
 sins of the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>.

 He, and he only, is <I>par negotio--fit for the work</I> and worthy of
 the honour: he is appointed by the Father to do it, who sanctified him, 
 and sent him into the world for this purpose, that <I>God might in him 
 reconcile the world to himself.</I> He undertook it, and for our sakes 
 sanctified himself, and set himself apart for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>.

 The high priest's frequently bathing himself on this day, and
 performing the service of it in fine linen clean and white, signified 
 the holiness of the Lord Jesus, his perfect freedom from all sin, and 
 his being beautified and adorned with all grace. No man was to be with 
 the high priest when he made atonement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 for our Lord Jesus was to <I>tread the wine-press alone,</I> and of the 
 people there must be <I>none with him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3">Isa. lxiii. 3</A>);

 therefore, when he entered upon his sufferings, <I>all his disciples
 forsook him and fled,</I> for it any of them had been taken and put to 
 death with him it would have looked as if they had assisted in making 
 the atonement; none but thieves, concerning whom there could be no such 
 suspicion, must suffer with him. And observe what the extent of the 
 atonement was which the high priest made: it was <I>for the holy 
 sanctuary, for the tabernacle, for the altar, for the priests,</I> and 
 <I>for all the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Christ's satisfaction is that which atones for the sins both of
 ministers and people, the <I>iniquities of our holy</I> (and our 
 unholy) <I>things;</I> the title we have to the privileges of 
 ordinances, our comfort in them, and benefit by them, are all owing to 
 the atonement Christ made. But, whereas the atonement which the high 
 priest made pertained only to the congregation of Israel, Christ is the 
 propitiation, not for their sins only, that are Jews, but for the sins 
 of the whole Gentile world. And in this also Christ infinitely excelled 
 Aaron, that Aaron needed to offer sacrifice for his own sin first, of 
 which he was to make confession upon the head of his sin-offering; but 
 our Lord Jesus had no sin of his own to answer for. <I>Such a high 
 priest became us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:26">Heb. vii. 26</A>.

 And therefore, when he was baptized in Jordan, whereas others stood in
 the water <I>confessing their sins</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:6">Matt. iii. 6</A>),

 he <I>went up straightway out of the water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 having no sins to confess.

 [2.] As he is the high priest, so he is the sacrifice with which
 atonement is made; for he is all in all in our reconciliation to God. 
 Thus he was prefigured by the two goats, which both made one offering: 
 the slain goat was a type of Christ dying for our sins, the scape-goat 
 a type of Christ rising again for our justification. It was directed by 
 lot, the disposal whereof was of the Lord, which goat should be slain; 
 for Christ was delivered <I>by the determinate counsel and 
 foreknowledge of God. First,</I> The atonement is said to be completed 
 by putting the sins of Israel upon the head of the goat. They deserved 
 to have been abandoned and sent into a land of forgetfulness, but that 
 punishment was here transferred to the goat that bore their sins, with 
 reference to which God is said to have laid upon our Lord Jesus (the 
 substance of all these shadows) <I>the iniquity of us all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:6">Isa. liii. 6</A>),

 and he is said to have <I>borne our sins,</I> even the punishment of
 them, <I>in his own body upon the tree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:24">1 Pet. ii. 24</A>.

 Thus was he made sin for us, that is, a sacrifice for sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2 Cor. v. 21</A>.

 He suffered and died, not only for our good, but in our stead, and was
 forsaken, and seemed to be forgotten for a time, that we might not be 
 forsaken and forgotten for ever. Some learned men have computed that 
 our Lord Jesus was baptized of John in Jordan upon the tenth day of the 
 seventh month, which was the very day of atonement.  Then he entered 
 upon his office as Mediator, and was immediately <I>driven of the 
 Spirit into the wilderness,</I> a land not inhabited.  <I>Secondly,</I> 
 The consequence of this was that all the iniquities of Israel were 
 <I>carried into a land of forgetfulness.</I> Thus Christ, the Lamb of 
 God, <I>takes away the sin the of world,</I> by taking it upon himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">John i. 29</A>.

 And, when God forgives sin, he is said to remember it no more

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb. viii. 12</A>),

 <I>to cast it behind his back</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17">Isa. xxxviii. 17</A>),

 <I>into the depths of the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:19">Mic. vii. 19</A>),

 and to separate it <I>as far as the east is from the west,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:12">Ps. ciii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The entrance into heaven which Christ made for us is here typified
 by the high priest's entrance into the most holy place. This the 
 apostle has expounded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7">Heb. ix. 7</A>,

 &c.), and he shows,

 [1.] That heaven is the holiest of all, but not of that building, and
 that the way into it by faith, hope, and prayer, through a Mediator, 
 was not then so clearly manifested as it is to us now by the gospel. 
 
 [2.] That Christ our high priest entered into heaven at his ascension
 once for all, and as a public person, in the name of all his spiritual 
 Israel, and through the veil of his flesh, which was rent for that 
 purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:20">Heb. x. 20</A>.

 [3.] That he entered <I>by his own blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>),

 taking with him to heaven the virtues of the sacrifice he offered on
 earth, and so sprinkling his blood, as it were, before the mercy-seat, 
 where it speaks better things than the blood of bulls and goats could 
 do.  Hence he is said to appear in the midst of the throne as <I>a lamb 
 that had been slain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Rev. v. 6</A>.

 And, though he had no sin of his own to expiate, yet it was by his own
 merit that he obtained for himself a restoration to his own ancient 
 glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5">John xvii. 4, 5</A>),

 as well as an eternal redemption for us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>.

 [4.] The high priest in the holy place burned incense, which typified
 the intercession that Christ ever lives to make for us within the veil, 
 in virtue of his satisfaction. And we could not expect to live, no,
 not before the mercy-seat, if it were not covered with the cloud of 
 this incense. Mere mercy itself will not save us, without the 
 interposition of a Mediator. The intercession of Christ is there set
 forth before God as incense, as <I>this incense.</I> And as the high 
 priest interceded for himself first, then for his household, and then 
 for all Israel, so our Lord Jesus, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">17th of St. John</A>

 (which was a specimen of the intercession he makes in heaven),
 recommended himself first to his Father, then his disciples who were 
 his household, and then all that should believe on him through their 
 word, as all Israel; and, having thus adverted to the uses and 
 intentions of his offering, he was immediately seized and crucified, 
 pursuant to these intentions.

 [5.] Herein the entry Christ made far exceeded Aaron's, that Aaron
 could not gain admission, no, not for his own sons, into the most holy 
 place; but our Lord Jesus has consecrated for us also a <I>new and 
 living way into the holiest,</I> so that we also have <I>boldness to 
 enter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,20">Heb. x. 19, 20</A>.

 [6.] The high priest was to come out again, but our Lord Jesus ever
 lives, making intercession, and always appears in the presence of God 
 for us, whither as the forerunner he has for us entered, and where as 
 agent he continues for us to reside.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here are likewise typified the two great gospel duties of faith and 
 repentance, by which we are qualified for the atonement, and come to be 
 entitled to the benefit of it. 

 (1.) By faith we must put our hands upon the head of the offering,
 relying on Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, pleading his 
 satisfaction as that which was alone able to atone for our sins and 
 procure us a pardon. "<I>Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.</I> This is 
 all I have to say for myself, <I>Christ has died, yea, rather has risen 
 again;</I> to his grace and government I entirely submit myself, and in 
 him I <I>receive the atonement,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>.

 (2.) By repentance we must afflict our souls; not only fasting for a
 time from the delights of the body, but inwardly sorrowing for our 
 sins, and living a life of self-denial and mortification. We must also 
 make a penitent confession of sin, and this with an eye to Christ, whom 
 we have pierced, and mourning because of him; and with a hand of faith 
 upon the atonement, assuring ourselves that, <I>if we confess our sins, 
 God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from 
 all unrighteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, In the year of jubilee, the trumpet which proclaimed the 
 liberty was ordered to be sounded in the close of the <I>day of 
 atonement,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:9"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 9</A>.

 For the remission of our debt, release from our bondage, and our return
 to our inheritance, are all owing to the mediation and intercession of 
 Jesus Christ. By the atonement we obtain rest for our souls, and all 
 the glorious liberties of the children of God.</P>
