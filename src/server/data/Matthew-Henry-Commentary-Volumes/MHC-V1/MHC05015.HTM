 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 At the end of <I>every</I> seven years thou shalt make a release.
 &nbsp; 2 And this <I>is</I> the manner of the release: Every creditor that
 lendeth <I>ought</I> unto his neighbour shall release <I>it;</I> he shall
 not exact <I>it</I> of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is
 called the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s release.
 &nbsp; 3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact <I>it again:</I> but <I>that</I> which
 is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;
 &nbsp; 4 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 shall greatly bless thee in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 giveth thee <I>for</I> an inheritance to possess it:
 &nbsp; 5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee
 this day.
 &nbsp; 6 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
 thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and
 thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over
 thee.
 &nbsp; 7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren
 within any of thy gates in thy land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth
 thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from
 thy poor brother:
 &nbsp; 8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt
 surely lend him sufficient for his need, <I>in that</I> which he
 wanteth.
 &nbsp; 9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
 saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
 thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him
 nought; and he cry unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against thee, and it be sin unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
 grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
 that thou puttest thine hand unto.
 &nbsp; 11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
 command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
 brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law for the relief of poor debtors, such (we may suppose) as were 
 insolvent. Every seventh year was a year of release, in which the 
 ground rested from being tilled and servants were discharged from their 
 services; and, among other acts of grace, this was one, that those who 
 had borrowed money, and had not been able to pay it before, should this 
 year be released from it; and though, if they were able, they were 
 afterwards bound in conscience to repay it, yet thenceforth the 
 creditor should never recover it by law. Many good expositors think it 
 only forbids the exacting of the debt in the year of release, because, 
 no harvest being gathered in that year, it could not be expected that 
 men should pay their debts then, but that afterwards it might be sued 
 for and recovered: so that the release did not extinguish the debt, but 
 only stayed the process for a time. But others think it was a release 
 of the debt for ever, and this seems more probable, yet under certain 
 limitations expressed or implied. It is supposed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 that the debtor was an Israelite (an alien could not take the benefit
 of this law) and that he was poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that he did not borrow for trade or purchase, but for the subsistence
 of his family, and that now he could not pay it without reducing 
 himself to poverty and coming under a necessity of seeking relief in 
 other countries, which might be his temptation to revolt from God. The 
 law is not that the creditor shall not receive the debt if the debtor, 
 or his friends for him, can pay it; but he shall not exact it by a 
 legal process. The reasons of this law are, 

 1. To put an honour upon the sabbatical year: <I>Because it is called
 the Lord's release,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>.

 That was Gods year for their land, as the weekly sabbath was God's day
 for themselves, their servants, and cattle; and, as by the resting of 
 their ground, so by the release of their debts, God would teach them to 
 depend upon his providence. This year of release typified the grace of 
 the gospel, in which is proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord, and 
 by which we obtain the release of our debts, that is, the pardon of our 
 sins, and we are taught to forgive injuries, as we are and hope to be 
 forgiven of God.  

 2. It was to prevent the falling of any Israelite into extreme poverty:
 so the margin reads

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>To the end there shall be no poor among you,</I> none miserably and
 scandalously poor, to the reproach of their nation and religion, the 
 reputation of which they ought to preserve. 

 3. God's security is here given by a divine promise that, whatever they
 lost by their poor debtors, it should be made up to them in the 
 blessing of God upon all they had and did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 Let them take care to do their duty, and then God would bless them with
 such great increase that what they might lose by bad debts, if they 
 generously remitted them, should not be missed out of their stock at 
 the year's end. Not only, <I>the Lord shall bless thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but he <I>doth bless thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is altogether inexcusable if, though God had given us abundance, so
 that we have not only enough but to spare, yet we are rigorous and 
 server in our demands from our poor brethren; for our abundance should 
 be the supply of their wants, that at least there may not be such an 
 inequality as is between two extremes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:14">2 Cor. viii. 14</A>.

 They must also consider that their land was God's gift to them, that
 all their increase was the fruit of God's blessing upon them, and 
 therefore they were bound in duty to him to use and dispose of their 
 estates as he should order and direct them. And, <I>lastly,</I> If they 
 would remit what little sums they had lent to their poor brethren, it 
 is promised that they should be able to lend great sums to their rich 
 neighbours, <I>even to many nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>),

 and should be enriched by those loans. Thus the nations should become
 subject to them, and dependent on them, as <I>the borrower is servant 
 to the lender,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:7">Prov. xxii. 7</A>.

 To be able to lend, and not to have need to borrow, we must look upon
 as a great mercy, and a good reason why we should do good with what we 
 have, lest we provoke God to turn the scales.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a law in favour of poor borrowers, that they might not 
 suffer damage by the former law. Men would be apt to argue, <I>If the 
 case of a man be so with his debtor</I> that if the debt be not paid 
 before the year of release it shall be lost, it were better not to 
 lend. "No," says this branch of the statute, "thou shalt not think such 
 a thought." 

 1. It is taken for granted that there would be poor among them, who
 would have occasion to borrow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and that there would never cease to be some such objects of charity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and that there would never cease to be some such objects of charity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The poor shall never cease out of thy land,</I> though not such as
 were reduced to extreme poverty, yet such as would be behind-hand, and 
 would have occasion to borrow; of such poor he here speaks, and such we 
 have always with us, so that a charitable disposition may soon find a 
 charitable occasion. 

 2. In such a case we are here commanded to lend or give, according to
 our ability and the necessity of the case: <I>Thou shalt not harden thy 
 heart, nor shut thy hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 If the hand be shut, it is a sign the heart is hardened; for, <I>if the
 clouds were full of rain, they would empty themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:3">Eccl. xi. 3</A>.

 Bowels of compassion would produce liberal distributions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16">Jam. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 Thou shalt not only stretch out thy hand to him to reach him something,
 but thou shalt <I>open thy hand wide unto him,</I> to <I>lend him
 sufficient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>.

 Sometimes there is as much charity in prudent lending as in giving, as
 it obliges the borrower to industry and honesty and may put him into a 
 way of helping himself. We are sometimes tempted to think, when an 
 object of charity presents itself, we may choose whether we will give 
 any thing or nothing, little or much; whereas it is here an express 
 precept

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>I command thee,</I> not only to give, but to <I>open thy hand
 wide,</I> to give liberally.  

 3. Here is a caveat against that objection which might arise against
 charitable lending from the foregoing law for the release of debts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Beware that there be not a thought,</I> a covetous ill-natured
 thought, <I>in thy Belial heart, "The year of release is at hand,</I> 
 and therefore I will not lend what I must then be sure to lose;" lest 
 thy poor brother, whom thou refusest to lend to, complain to God, and 
 it will be a sin, a great sin, to thee. Note,

 (1.) The law is spiritual and lays a restraint upon the thoughts of the
 heart. We mistake if we think thoughts are free from the divine 
 cognizance and check.

 (2.) That is a wicked heart indeed that raises evil thoughts from the
 good law of God, as theirs did who, because God had obliged them to the 
 charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving.

 (3.) We must carefully watch against all those secret suggestions which
 would divert us from our duty or discourage us in it. Those that would 
 keep from the act of sin must keep out of their minds the very thought 
 of sin.

 (4.) When we have an occasion of charitable lending, if we cannot trust
 the borrower, we must trust God, and lend, hoping for nothing again in 
 this world, but expecting it will be recompensed in the resurrection of 
 the just,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:35,14:14">Luke vi. 35; xiv. 14</A>.

 (5.) It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor against us, for
 God has his ear open to that cry, and, in compassion to them, will be 
 sue to reckon with those that deal hardly with them. 

 (6.) That which we think is our prudence often proves sin to us; he
 that refused to lend because the year of release was at hand thought he 
 did wisely, and that men would <I>praise him as doing well for 
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18">Ps. xlix. 18</A>.

 But he is here told that he did wickedly, and that God would condemn
 him as doing ill to his brother; and we are sure that the <I>judgment 
 of God is according to truth,</I> and that what he says is sin to us 
 will certainly be ruin to us if it be not repented of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a command to give cheerfully whatever we give in charity: 
 "<I>Thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Be not loth to part with thy money on so good an account, nor think it
 lost; grudge not a kindness to they brother; and distrust not the 
 providence of God, as if thou shouldest want that thyself which thou 
 givest in charity; but, on the contrary, let it be a pleasure and a 
 satisfaction of soul to thee to think that thou art honouring God with 
 thy substance, doing good, making thy brother easy, and laying up for 
 thyself a good security for the time to come. What thou doest do 
 freely, for God <I>loves a cheerful giver,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7">2 Cor. ix. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is a promise of a recompence in this life: "<I>For this thing 
 the Lord thy God shall bless thee.</I>" Covetous people say "Giving 
 undoes us;" no, giving cheerfully in charity will enrich us, it will 
 <I>fill the barns with plenty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:10">Prov. iii. 10</A>)

 and the soul with true comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:10,11">Isa. lviii. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 12 <I>And</I> if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be
 sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh
 year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
 &nbsp; 13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
 let him go away empty:
 &nbsp; 14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out
 of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: <I>of that</I> wherewith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.
 &nbsp; 15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
 of Egypt, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command
 thee this thing to day.
 &nbsp; 16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away
 from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
 well with thee;
 &nbsp; 17 Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust <I>it</I> through his ear
 unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
 unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
 &nbsp; 18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
 free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant <I>to
 thee,</I> in serving thee six years: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall
 bless thee in all that thou doest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A repetition of the law that had been given concerning Hebrew 
 servants who had sold themselves for servants, or were sold by their 
 parents through extreme poverty, or were sold by the court of judgment 
 for some crime committed. The law was,

 1. That they should serve but six years, and in the seventh should go
 out free, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:2">Exod. xxi. 2</A>.

 And, if the year of jubilee happened before they served out their time,
 that would be their discharge. God's Israel were a free people, and 
 must not be compelled to perpetual slavery; thus are God's spiritual 
 Israel called unto liberty. 

 2. That if, when their six years' service had expired, they had no mind
 to go out free, but would rather continue in service, as having less 
 care, though taking more pains, than their masters, in this case they 
 must lay themselves under an obligation to serve for ever, that is, for 
 life, by having <I>their ears bored to the door-posts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:6">Exod. xxi. 6</A>.

 If hereby a man disgraced himself with some, as of a mean and servile
 spirit, that had not a due sense of the honour and pleasure of liberty, 
 yet, we may suppose, with others he got reputation, as of a quiet 
 contented spirit, humble, and diligent, and loving, and not <I>given to 
 change.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is an addition to this law, requiring them to put some small 
 stock into their servants' hands to set up with for themselves, when 
 they sent them out of their service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 It was to be supposed that they had nothing of their own, and that
 their friends had little or nothing for them, else they else they would 
 have been redeemed before they were discharged by law; they had no 
 wages for their service, and all they got by their labour was their 
 masters', so that their liberty would do them little good, having 
 nothing to begin the world with; therefore their masters are here 
 commanded to furnish them liberally with corn and cattle. No certain 
 measure is prescribed: that is left to the generosity of the master, 
 who probably would have respect to the servant's merit and necessity; 
 but the Jewish writers say, "He could not give less than the value of 
 thirty shekels of silver, but as much more as he pleased" The 
 maid-servants, though they were not to have their ears bored if they 
 were disposed to stay, yet, if they went out free, they were to have a 
 gratuity given them; for to this those words refer, <I>Unto thy 
 maid-servant thou shalt do likewise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The reasons for this are taken from the law of gratitude. They must do
 it,

 1. In gratitude to God, who had not only brought them out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 but brought them out greatly enriched with the spoils of the Egyptians.
 Let them not send their servants out empty, for they were not sent 
 empty out of the house of bondage. God's tender care of us and kindness 
 to us oblige us to be careful of, and kind to, those that have a 
 dependence upon us. Thus we must <I>render according to the benefit 
 done unto us.</I> 

 2. In gratitude to their servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 "Grudge not to give him a little out of thy abundance, for <I>he has
 been worth a double hired servant unto thee.</I> The days of the 
 hireling at most were but three years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:14">Isa. xvi. 14</A>),

 but he has served thee six years, and, unlike the hired servant,
 without any wages." Masters and landlords ought to consider what need 
 they have of, and what ease and advantage they have by, their servants 
 and tenants, and should not only be just but kind to them. To these 
 reasons it is added, as before in this chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:4,6,10"><I>v.</I> 4, 6, 10</A>),

 <I>The Lord they God shall bless thee.</I> Then we may expect family
 blessings, the springs of family-prosperity, when we make conscience of 
 our duty to our family-relations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A repetition of the law concerning the firstlings of their cattle,
 that, if they were males, they were to be <I>sanctified to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 in remembrance of, and in thankfulness for, the sparing of the
 first-born of Israel, when the first-born of the Egyptians, both of man 
 and beast, were slain by the destroying angel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2,15">Exod. xiii. 2, 15</A>);

 on the eighth day it was to be given to God (

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:30">Exod. xxii. 30</A>),

 and to be divided between the priest and the altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:17,18">Num. xviii. 17, 18</A>.

 2.  An addition to that law, for the further explication of it,
 directing them what to do with the firstlings,

 (1.) That were females: "Thou shalt <I>do no work with the</I> female
 <I>firstlings of the cow,</I> nor shear those of the sheep"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 of them the learned bishop Patrick understands it. Though the female
 firstlings were not so entirely sanctified to God as the males, nor so 
 early as at eight days old, yet they were not to be converted by the 
 owners to their own use as the other cattle, but must be offered to God 
 as peace-offerings, or used in a religious feast, at the year's end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 <I>Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God,</I> as directed

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:18"><I>ch.</I> xii. 18</A>.

 (2.) But what must they do with that which was blemished,
 ill-blemished? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Were it male or female, it must not be brought near the sanctuary, nor
 used either for sacrifice or for holy feasting, for it would not be fit 
 to honour God with, nor to typify Christ, who is a <I>Lamb without 
 blemish;</I> yet it must not be reared, but killed and eaten at their 
 own houses as common food

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 only they must be sure <I>not to eat it with the blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The frequent repetition of this caution intimates what need the people
 had of it, and what stress God laid upon it. What a mercy it is that we 
 are not under this yoke! We are not dieted as they were; we make no 
 difference between a first calf, or lamb, and the rest that follow. Let 
 us therefore realize the gospel meaning of this law, devoting ourselves 
 and the first of our time and strength to God, as a kind of 
 first-fruits of his creatures, and using all our comforts and 
 enjoyments to his praise and under the direction of his law, as we have 
 them all by his gift.</P>
