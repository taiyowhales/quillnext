 At this chapter we return to the story of Joseph. We have him 
 here, 
 
 I. A servant, a slave in Potiphar's house
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:1">ver. 1</A>),
 and yet 
 there greatly honoured and favoured, 
 
 1. By the providence of God, 
 which made him, in effect, a master,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.
 2. By the grace of 
 God, which made him more than a conqueror over a strong temptation 
 to uncleanness,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.
 
 II. We have him here a sufferer, 
 falsely accused
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>),
 imprisoned
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>),
 and yet his imprisonment made both honourable and comfortable by 
 the tokens of God's special presence with him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.
 And herein Joseph was a type of Christ, "who took upon him 
 the form of a servant," and yet then did that which made it 
 evident that "God was with him," who was tempted by Satan, 
 but overcame the temptation, who was falsely accused and bound, 
 and yet had all things committed to his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Joseph was brought down
 to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
 of Pharaoh, captain of the guard,
 an Egyptian, bought him of the hands
 of the Ishmeelites, which had brought
 him down thither.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous 
 man; and he was in the house 
 of his master the Egyptian.
 &nbsp; 3 And 
 his master saw that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> 
 with him, and that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made all 
 that he did to prosper in his hand.
 &nbsp; 4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, 
 and he served him: and he made him 
 overseer over his house, and all <I>that</I> 
 he had he put into his hand.
 &nbsp; 5 And 
 it came to pass from the time <I>that</I> he 
 had made him overseer in his house, 
 and over all that he had, that the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed the Egyptian's house 
 for Joseph's sake; and the blessing
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon all that he had 
 in the house, and in the field.
 &nbsp; 6 And 
 he left all that he had in Joseph's 
 hand; and he knew not ought he had, 
 save the bread which he did eat. And 
 Joseph was <I>a</I> goodly <I>person,</I> and well 
 favoured.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Joseph bought
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 and he 
 that bought him, whatever he gave for him, 
 had a good bargain of him; it was better 
 than the merchandise of silver. The Jews 
 have a proverb, "If the world did not know 
 the worth of good men, they would hedge 
 them about with pearls." He was sold to 
 an officer of Pharaoh, with whom he might 
 get acquainted with public persons and public 
 business, and so be fitted for the preferment 
 for which he was designed. Note, 1. What 

 <A NAME="Page221"> </A>
 
 God intends men for he will be sure, some
 way or other, to qualify them for. 
 
 2. Providence 
 is to be acknowledged in the disposal 
 even of poor servants and in their settlements, 
 and therein may perhaps be working towards 
 something great and important.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joseph blessed, wonderfully blessed, 
 even in the house of his servitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God prospered him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 Perhaps 
 the affairs of Potiphar's family had remarkably 
 gone backward before; but, upon Joseph's 
 coming into it, a discernible turn was given 
 to them, and the face and posture of them 
 altered on a sudden. Though, at first, we 
 may suppose that his hand was put to the 
 meanest services, even in those appeared his 
 ingenuity and industry; a particular blessing 
 of Heaven attended him, which, as he rose 
 in his employment, became more and more 
 discernible. Note, 
 
 (1.) Those that have wisdom 
 and grace have that which cannot be 
 taken away from them, whatever else they 
 are robbed of. Joseph's brethren had stripped 
 him of his coat of many colours, but they 
 could not strip him of his virtue and prudence. 
 
 (2.) Those that can separate us
 from all our friends, yet cannot deprive 
 us of the gracious presence of our God. 
 When Joseph had none of all his relations 
 with him, he had his God with him, even in 
 the house of the Egyptian. Joseph was 
 separated from his brethren, but not from 
 his God; banished from his father's house, 
 but <I>the Lord was with him,</I> and this comforted 
 him. 
 
 (3.) It is God's presence with 
 us that makes all we do prosperous. Those 
 that would prosper must therefore make 
 God their friend; and those that do prosper 
 must therefore give God the praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His master preferred him, by degrees 
 made him steward of his household,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) Industry and honesty are the 
 surest and safest way both of rising and 
 thriving: <I>Seest thou a man</I> prudent, and 
 faithful, and <I>diligent in his business? He shall 
 stand before kings</I> at length, and not always 
 <I>before mean men.</I> 
 
 (2.) It is the wisdom of 
 those that are in any sort of authority to 
 countenance and employ those with whom 
 it appears that the presence of God is, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:6">Ps. ci. 6</A>.
 Potiphar knew what he did when he 
 put all into the hands of Joseph; for he 
 knew it would prosper better there than in 
 his own hand. 
 
 (3.) He that is faithful in a 
 few things stand fair for being made ruler 
 over many things,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:21">Matt. xxv. 21</A>.
 Christ goes by this rule with his servants. 
 
 (4.) It 
 is a great ease to a master to have those employed 
 under him that are trusty. Potiphar 
 was so well satisfied with Joseph's conduct 
 that <I>he knew not aught he had, save the bread 
 which he did eat,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 The servant had all 
 the care and trouble of the estate; the master 
 had only the enjoyment of it: an example 
 not to be imitated by any master, unless he 
 could be sure that he had one in all respects 
 like Joseph for a servant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God favoured his master for his sake
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 <I>He blessed the Egyptian's house,</I> 
 though he was an Egyptian, a stranger to 
 the true God, <I>for Joseph's sake;</I> and he himself, 
 like Laban, soon learned it by experience,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:27"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 27</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) Good men 
 are the blessings of the places where they 
 live; even good servants may be so, though 
 mean, and lightly esteemed. 
 
 (2.) The prosperity 
 of the wicked is, one way or other, 
 for the sake of the godly. Here was a 
 wicked family blessed for the sake of one 
 good servant in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And it came to pass after these 
 things, that his master's wife cast her 
 eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie 
 with me.
 &nbsp; 8 But he refused, and said 
 unto his master's wife, Behold, my
 master wotteth not what <I>is</I> with me 
 in the house, and he hath committed 
 all that he hath to my hand;
 &nbsp; 9 <I>There 
 is</I> none greater in this house than I; 
 neither hath he kept back any thing 
 from me but thee, because thou <I>art</I> 
 his wife: how then can I do this great 
 wickedness, and sin against God?
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass, as she spake to 
 Joseph day by day, that he hearkened 
 not unto her, to lie by her, <I>or</I> to be 
 with her.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass 
 about this time, that <I>Joseph</I> went into
 the house to do his business; and 
 <I>there was</I> none of the men of the house 
 there within.
 &nbsp; 12 And she caught 
 him by his garment, saying, Lie with 
 me: and he left his garment in her 
 hand, and fled, and got him out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A most shameful instance of impudence 
 and immodesty in Joseph's mistress, 
 the shame and scandal of her sex, perfectly 
 lost to all virtue and honour, and not to be 
 mentioned, nor thought of, without the utmost 
 indignation. It was well that she was 
 an Egyptian; for we must have shared in 
 the confusion if such folly had been found 
 in Israel. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Her sin began in the eye: She <I>cast her 
 eyes upon Joseph</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 who <I>was a goodly 
 person, and well-favoured,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) Remarkable beauty, either of men or women, 
 often proves a dangerous snare both to themselves 
 and others, which forbids pride in it 
 and commands constant watchfulness against 
 the temptation that attends it; favour is 
 deceitful--deceiving. 
 
 (2.) We have great 
 need to make a covenant with our eyes 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1">Job xxxi. 1</A>),
 lest the eye infect the heart. 
 Joseph's mistress had a husband that ought 
 to have been to her for a covering of the 
 eyes from all others,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16"><I>ch.</I> xx. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She was daring and shameless in the 
 
 <A NAME="Page222"> </A>

 sin. With an impudent face, and a harlot's 
 forehead, she said, <I>Lie with me,</I> having 
 already, by her wanton looks and unchaste 
 desires, committed adultery with him in her 
 heart. Note, Where the unclean spirit gets 
 possession and dominion in a soul, it is as 
 with the possessed of the devils
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:27,29">Luke viii. 27, 29</A>),
 the clothes of modesty are thrown 
 off and the bands and fetters of shame are 
 broken in pieces. When lust has got head, 
 it will stick at nothing, blush at nothing; 
 decency, and reputation, and conscience, are 
 all sacrificed to that Baal-peor. 
 
 3. She was 
 urgent and violent in the temptation. Often 
 she had been denied with the strongest 
 reasons, and yet as often renewed her vile 
 solicitations. She <I>spoke to him day by day,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Now this was, 
 
 (1.) Great wickedness 
 in her, and showed her heart fully set to do 
 evil. 
 
 (2.) A great temptation to Joseph. 
 The hand of Satan, no doubt, was in it, who, 
 when he found he could not overcome him 
 with troubles and the frowns of the world 
 (for in them he still held fast his integrity), 
 assaulted him with soft and charming pleasures, 
 which have ruined more than the 
 former, and have slain their ten-thousands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a most illustrious instance of 
 virtue and resolved chastity in Joseph, who, 
 by the grace of God, was enabled to resist 
 and overcome this temptation; and, all 
 things considered, his escape was, for aught 
 I know, as great an instance of the divine 
 power as the deliverance of the three children 
 out of the fiery furnace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The temptation he was assaulted with 
 was very strong. Never was a more violent 
 onset made upon the fort of chastity than 
 this recorded here. 
 
 (1.) The sin he was 
 tempted to was uncleanness, which considering 
 his youth, his beauty, his single state, 
 and his plentiful living at the table of a ruler, 
 was a sin which, one would think, might 
 most easily beset him and betray him. 
 
 (2.) The tempter was his mistress, a person of 
 quality, whom it was his place to obey and 
 his interest to oblige, whose favour would 
 contribute more than any thing to his preferment, 
 and by whose means he might 
 arrive at the highest honours of the court. 
 On the other hand, it was at his utmost peril 
 if he slighted her, and made her his enemy. 
 
 (3.) Opportunity makes a thief, makes an 
 adulterer, and that favoured the temptation. 
 The tempter was in the house with him; his 
 business led him to be, without any suspicion, 
 where she was; none of the family were 
 within
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 there appeared no danger of 
 its being ever discovered, or, if it should be 
 suspected, his mistress would protect him. 
 
 (4.) To all this was added importunity, 
 frequent constant importunity, to such a degree 
 that, at last, she laid violent hands on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His resistance of the temptation was 
 very brave, and the victory truly honourable. 
 The almighty grace of God enabled him to 
 overcome this assault of the enemy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By strength of reason; and wherever 
 right reason may be heard, religion no 
 doubt will carry the day. He argues from 
 the respect he owed both to God and his 
 master,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 [1.] He would not wrong 
 his master, nor do such an irreparable injury 
 to his honour. He considers, and urges, 
 how kind his master had been to him, what 
 a confidence he had reposed in him, in how 
 many instances he had befriended him, for 
 which he abhorred the thought of making 
 such an ungrateful return. Note, We are 
 bound in honour, as well as justice and 
 gratitude, not in any thing to injure those 
 that have a good opinion of us and place a 
 trust in us, how secretly soever it may be 
 done. See how he argues
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 "<I>There 
 is none greater in this house than I,</I> therefore 
 I will not do it." Note, Those that are 
 great, instead of being proud of their greatness, 
 should use it as an argument against 
 sin. "Is none greater than I? Then I will 
 scorn to do a wicked thing; it is below me 
 to serve a base lust; I will not disparage 
 myself so much." 
 
 [2.] He would not offend 
 his God. This is the chief argument with 
 which he strengthens his aversion to the 
 sin. <I>How can I do this?</I> not only, How shall 
 I? or, How dare I? but, <I>How can I? Id possumus, 
 quod jure possumus--We can do that 
 which we can do lawfully.</I> It is good to shut 
 out sin with the strongest bar, even that of 
 an impossibility. He that is born of God 
 cannot sin,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9">1 John iii. 9</A>.
 Three arguments 
 Joseph urges upon himself. <I>First,</I> He considers 
 who he was that was tempted. "<I>I;</I> 
 others may perhaps take their liberty, but <I>I</I> 
 cannot. <I>I</I> that am an Israelite in covenant 
 with God, that profess religion, and relation 
 to him: it is next to impossible for me to do 
 so." <I>Secondly,</I> What the sin was to which 
 he was tempted: <I>This great wickedness.</I> 
 Others might look upon it as a small matter, 
 a peccadillo, a trick of youth; but Joseph 
 had another idea of it. In general, when at 
 any time we are tempted to sin, we must consider 
 the great wickedness there is in it, let 
 sin appear sin 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:13">Rom. vii. 13</A>),
 call it by its 
 own name, and never go about to lessen it. 
 Particularly let the sin of uncleanness always 
 be looked upon as great wickedness, as an 
 exceedingly sinful sin, that wars against 
 the soul as much as any other. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 Against whom he was tempted to sin--<I>against 
 God;</I> not only, "How shall I do it, and sin 
 against my master, my mistress, myself, my 
 own body and soul; but against God?" 
 Note, Gracious souls look upon this as the 
 worst thing in sin that it is against God, 
 against his nature and his dominion, against 
 his love and his design. Those that love 
 God do for this reason hate sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By stedfastness of resolution. The 
 grace of God enabled him to overcome the 
 temptation by avoiding the tempter. 
 
 [1.] He <I>hearkened not to her,</I> so much as to be 
 with her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 Note, Those that would be 

 <A NAME="Page223"> </A>

 kept from harm must keep themselves out of 
 harm's way. <I>Avoid it, pass not by it.</I> Nay, 
 
 [2.] When she laid hold of him, he <I>left his garment 
 in her hand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 He would not stay so 
 much as to parley with the temptation, but 
 flew out from it with the utmost abhorrence; 
 he left his garment, as one escaping for his 
 life. Note, It is better to lose a good coat 
 than a good conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And it came to pass, when she 
 saw that he had left his garment in her 
 hand, and was fled forth,
 &nbsp; 14 That she 
 called unto the men of her house, and 
 spake unto them, saying, See, he hath 
 brought in an Hebrew unto us to 
 mock us; he came in unto me to lie 
 with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, when he heard 
 that I lifted up my voice and cried, 
 that he left his garment with me, and 
 fled, and got him out.
 &nbsp; 16 And she 
 laid up his garment by her, until his 
 lord came home.
 &nbsp; 17 And she spake 
 unto him according to these words, 
 saying, The Hebrew servant, which 
 thou hast brought unto us, came in 
 unto me to mock me:
 &nbsp; 18 And it came 
 to pass, as I lifted up my voice and 
 cried, that he left his garment with 
 me, and fled out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Joseph's mistress, having tried in vain to 
 make him a criminal, now endeavours to represent 
 him as one; so to be revenged on 
 him for his virtue. Now was her love turned 
 into the utmost rage and malice, and she 
 pretends she cannot endure the sight of him 
 whom awhile ago she could not endure out 
 of her sight. Chaste and holy love will 
 continue, though slighted; but sinful love, 
 like Amnon's to Tamar, is easily changed 
 into sinful hatred. 
 
 1. She accused him to 
 his fellow servants
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>)
 and gave him 
 a bad name among them. Probably they 
 envied him his interest in their master's 
 favour, and his authority in the house; and 
 perhaps found themselves aggrieved sometimes 
 by his fidelity, which prevented their 
 purloining; and therefore they were glad to 
 hear any thing that might tend to his disgrace, 
 and, if there was room for it, incensed 
 their mistress yet more against him. Observe, 
 When she speaks of her husband, she 
 does not call him her husband, or her lord, 
 but only <I>he;</I> for she had forgotten the covenant 
 of her God, that was between them. 
 Thus the adulteress 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:19">Prov. vii. 19</A>)
 calls her 
 husband <I>the good man.</I> Note, Innocence 
 itself cannot secure a man's reputation. Not 
 every one that keeps a good conscience can 
 keep a good name. 
 
 2. She accused him to 
 his master, who had power in his hand to 
 punish him, which his fellow servants had 
 not,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 (1.) What an improbable 
 story she tells, producing his garment 
 as an evidence that he had offered 
 violence to her, which was a plain indication 
 that she had offered violence to him. Note, 
 Those that have broken the bonds of modesty 
 will never be held by the bonds of truth. No 
 marvel that she who had impudence enough 
 to say, <I>Lie with me,</I> had front enough to say, 
 "He would have lien with me." Had the 
 lie been told to conceal her own crime it 
 would have been bad enough, yet, in some 
 degree, excusable; but it was told to be revenged 
 upon his virtue, a most malicious 
 lie. And yet, 
 
 (2.) She manages it so as to 
 incense her husband against him, reflecting 
 upon him for bringing this Hebrew servant 
 among them, perhaps at first against her 
 mind, because he was a Hebrew. Note, It 
 is no new thing for the best of men to be 
 falsely accused of the worst of crimes by 
 those who themselves are the worst of 
 criminals. As this matter was represented, 
 one would have thought chaste Joseph a 
 very bad man and his wanton mistress a 
 virtuous woman; it is well that there is a 
 day of discovery coming, in which all shall 
 appear in their true characters. This was 
 not the first time that Joseph's coat was 
 made use of as a false witness concerning 
 him; his father had been deceived by it 
 before, now his master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 And it came to pass, when his 
 master heard the words of his wife, 
 which she spake unto him, saying, After 
 this manner did thy servant to me; 
 that his wrath was kindled.
 &nbsp; 20 And 
 Joseph's master took him, and put 
 him into the prison, a place where the 
 king's prisoners <I>were</I> bound: and he 
 was there in the prison.
 &nbsp; 21 But the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with Joseph, and showed 
 him mercy, and gave him favour in 
 the sight of the keeper of the prison.
 &nbsp; 22 And the keeper of the prison committed 
 to Joseph's hand all the prisoners 
 that <I>were</I> in the prison; and 
 whatsoever they did there, he was the 
 doer <I>of it.</I>
 &nbsp; 23 The keeper of the 
 prison looked not to any thing <I>that 
 was</I> under his hand; because the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with him, and <I>that</I> which
 he did, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made <I>it</I> to prosper.

 Here is, 
 
 1. Joseph wronged by his master. 
 He believed the accusation, and either Joseph 
 durst not make his defence by telling the 
 truth, as it would reflect too much upon his 
 mistress, or his master would not hear it, or 
 would not believe it, and there is no remedy, 
 he is condemned to perpetual imprisonment,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 God restrained his wrath, else he 
 had put him to death; and that wrath which 

 <A NAME="Page224"> </A>

 imprisoned him God made to turn to his 
 praise, in order to which Providence so disposed 
 that he should be shut up among the 
 king's prisoners, the state-prisoners. Potiphar, 
 it is likely, chose that prison because 
 it was the worst; for there the iron entered 
 into the soul 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:18">Ps. cv. 18</A>),
 but God designed 
 to pave the way to his enlargement. He was 
 committed to the king's prison, that he might 
 thence be preferred to the king's person. 
 Note, Many an action of false imprisonment 
 will, in the great day, be found to lie against 
 the enemies and persecutors of God's people. 
 Our Lord Jesus, like Joseph here, was bound, 
 and numbered with the transgressors. 
 
 2. Joseph 
 owned and righted by his God, who is, 
 and will be, the just and powerful patron of oppressed 
 innocence. Joseph was at a distance 
 from all his friends and relations, had not them 
 with him to comfort him, or to minister to him, 
 or to mediate for him; but <I>the Lord was with 
 Joseph, and showed him mercy,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) God despises not his prisoners, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:33">Ps. lxix. 33</A>.
 No gates nor bars can shut out his 
 gracious presence from his people; for he 
 has promised that he will never leave them. 
 
 (2.) Those that have a good conscience in a 
 prison have a good God there. Integrity 
 and uprightness qualify us for the divine 
 favour, wherever we are. Joseph is not long 
 a prisoner before he becomes a little ruler 
 even in the prison, which is to be attributed, 
 under God, 
 
 [1.] To the keeper's favour. God 
 <I>gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of 
 the prison.</I> Note, God can raise up friends 
 for his people even where they little expect 
 to find them, and can <I>make them to be pitied</I> 
 even of those that carry them captive, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>.

 [2.] To Joseph's fitness for business. 
 The keeper saw that God was with 
 him, and that every thing prospered under 
 his hand; and therefore entrusted him with 
 the management of the affairs of the prison,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 Note, Wisdom and virtue will 
 shine in the narrowest spheres. A good man 
 will do good wherever he is, and will be a 
 blessing even in bonds and banishment; for 
 the Spirit of the Lord is not bound nor 
 banished, witness St. Paul,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12,13">Phil. i. 12, 13</A>.</P>
