 This chapter and the next are concerning the tribe of Levi, which was 
 to be mustered and marshalled by itself, and not in common with the 
 other tribes, intimating the particular honour put upon them and the 
 particular duty and service required from them. The Levites are in this 
 chapter considered, 

 I. As attendants on, and assistants to, the priests in the 
 temple-service. And so we have an account,

 1. Of the priests themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>)
 
 and their work,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:10">ver. 10</A>.

 2. Of the gift of the Levites to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>),

 in order to which they are mustered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>), 

 and the sum of them taken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:39">ver. 39</A>. 

 Each particular family of them is mustered, has its place assigned and
 its charge, the Gershonites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:17-26">ver. 17-26</A>), 
 
 the Kohathites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:27-32">ver. 27-32</A>), 
 
 the Merarites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:33-39">ver. 33-39</A>.
 
 II. As equivalents for the first-born,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 1. The first-born are numbered, and the Levites taken instead of them,
 as far as the number of the Levites went,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:40-45">ver. 40-45</A>. 

 2. What first-born there were more than the Levites were redeemed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:46-51">ver. 46</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 These also <I>are</I> the generations of Aaron and Moses in the
 day <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake with Moses in mount Sinai.
 &nbsp; 2 And these <I>are</I> the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
 firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
 &nbsp; 3 These <I>are</I> the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
 were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
 office.
 &nbsp; 4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when they offered
 strange fire before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
 they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the
 priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 6 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
 the priest, that they may minister unto him.
 &nbsp; 7 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
 congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the
 service of the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 8 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
 the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do
 the service of the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 9 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
 they <I>are</I> wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 10 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall
 wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
 shall be put to death.
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
 children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the
 matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall
 be mine;
 &nbsp; 13 Because all the firstborn <I>are</I> mine; <I>for</I> on the day that
 I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me
 all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they
 be: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. The family of Aaron is confirmed in the priests' office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They had been called to it before, and consecrated; here they are 
 appointed to <I>wait on their priests' office:</I> the apostle uses 
 this phrase 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:7">Rom. xii. 7</A>),

 <I>Let us wait on our ministry.</I> The office of the ministry requires
 a constant attendance and great diligence; so frequent are the returns 
 of its work, and yet so transient its favourable opportunities, that it 
 must be waited on. Here is repeated what was said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:51"><I>ch.</I> i. 51</A>):

 <I>The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death,</I> which
 forbids the invading of the priest's office by any other person 
 whatsoever; none must come nigh to minister but Aaron and his sons 
 only, all others are strangers.  It also lays a charge on the priests, 
 as door-keepers in God's house, to take care that none should come near 
 who were forbidden by the law; they must keep off all intruders, whose 
 approach would be to the profanation of the holy things, telling them 
 that if they came near it was at their peril, they would <I>die by the 
 hand of God,</I> as Uzza did. The Jews say that afterwards there was 
 hung over the door of the temple a golden sword (perhaps alluding to 
 that flaming sword at the entrance of the garden of Eden), on which was 
 engraven, <I>The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to 
 death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular account is given of this family of Aaron; what we have 
 met with before concerning them is here repeated. 

 1. The consecration of the sons of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They were all anointed to minister before the Lord, though it appeared 
 afterwards, and God knew it, that two of them were wise and two were 
 foolish.

 2. The fall of the two elder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 they <I>offered strange fire,</I> and died for so doing, <I>before the 
 Lord.</I> This is mentioned here in the preamble to the law concerning 
 the priesthood, for a warning to all succeeding priests; let them know, 
 by this example, that God is a jealous God, and will not be mocked; the 
 holy anointing oil was an honour to the obedient, but not a shelter to 
 the disobedient. It is here said, <I>They had no children,</I> 
 Providence so ordering it, for their greater punishment, that none of 
 their descendants should remain to be priests, and so bear up their 
 name who had profaned God's name.

 3. The continuance of the two younger: Eleazar and Ithamar ministered
 <I>in the sight of Aaron.</I> It intimates,

 (1.) The care they took about their ministration not to make any
 blunders; they kept under their father's eye, and took instruction from 
 him in all they did, because, probably, Nadab and Abihu got out of 
 their father's sight when they offered strange fire. Note, It is good 
 for young people to act under the direction and inspection of those 
 that are aged and experienced.

 (2.) The comfort Aaron took in it; it pleased him to see his younger
 sons behave themselves prudently and gravely, when his two elder had 
 miscarried. Note, It is a great satisfaction to parents to <I>see their 
 children walk in the truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:4">3 John 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A grant is made of the Levites to be assistants to the priests in 
 their work: <I>Give the Levites to Aaron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Aaron was to have a greater propriety in, and power over, the tribe of 
 Levi than any other of the prices had in and over their respective 
 tribes. There was a great deal of work belonging to the priests' 
 office, and there were now only three pairs of hands to do it all, 
 Aaron's and his two sons'; for it does not appear that they had either 
 of them any children at this time, at least not any that were of age to 
 minister, therefore God appoints the Levites to attend upon them. Note, 
 Those whom God finds work for his will find help for. Here is,

 1. The service for which the Levites were designed: they were to 
 <I>minister to the priests</I> in their ministration to the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>),

 and to <I>keep Aaron's charge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 as the deacons to the bishops in the evangelical constitution, serving 
 at tables, while the bishops waited on their ministry. The Levites 
 killed the sacrifices, and then the priests needed only to sprinkle the 
 blood and burn the fat: the Levites prepared the incense, the priests 
 burnt it.  They were to keep, not only Aaron's charge, but the 
 <I>charge of the whole congregation.</I> Note, It is a great trust that 
 is reposed in ministers, not only for the glory of Christ, but for the 
 good of his church; so that they must not only keep the charge of the 
 great high priest, but must also be faithful to the souls of men, in 
 trust for whom a dispensation is committed to them.

 2. The consideration upon which the Levites were demanded; they were
 taken instead of the first-born. The preservation of the first-born of 
 Israel, when all the first-born of the Egyptians (with whom they were 
 many of them mingled) were destroyed, was looked upon by him who never 
 makes any unreasonable demands as cause sufficient of the appropriating 
 of all the first-born thenceforward to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>All the first-born are mine.</I> That was sufficient to make them 
 his, though he had given no reason for it, for he is the sole fountain 
 and Lord of all beings and powers; but because all obedience must flow 
 from love, and acts of duty must be acts of gratitude, before they were 
 challenged into peculiar services they were crowned with peculiar 
 favours. Note, When he that made us saves us we are thereby laid under 
 further obligations to serve him and live to him. God's right to us by 
 redemption corroborates the right he has to us by creation. Now because 
 the first-born of a family are generally the favourites, and some would 
 think it a disparagement to have their eldest sons servants to the 
 priests, and attending before the door of the tabernacle, God took the 
 tribe of Levi entire for his own, in lieu of the first-born, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Note, God's institutions put no hardships upon men in any of their just 
 interests or reasonable affections. It was presumed that the Israelites 
 would rather part with the Levites than with the first-born, and 
 therefore God graciously ordered the exchange; yet for us he <I>spared 
 not his own Son.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 15 Number the children of Levi after the house of their
 fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and
 upward shalt thou number them.
 &nbsp; 16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 as he was commanded.
 &nbsp; 17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
 Kohath, and Merari.
 &nbsp; 18 And these <I>are</I> the names of the sons of Gershon by their
 families; Libni, and Shimei.
 &nbsp; 19 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
 Hebron, and Uzziel.
 &nbsp; 20 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
 These <I>are</I> the families of the Levites according to the house of
 their fathers.
 &nbsp; 21 Of Gershon <I>was</I> the family of the Libnites, and the family
 of the Shimites: these <I>are</I> the families of the Gershonites.
 &nbsp; 22 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
 all the males, from a month old and upward, <I>even</I> those that
 were numbered of them <I>were</I> seven thousand and five hundred.
 &nbsp; 23 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
 tabernacle westward.
 &nbsp; 24 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
 <I>shall be</I> Eliasaph the son of Lael.
 &nbsp; 25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of
 the congregation <I>shall be</I> the tabernacle, and the tent, the
 covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle
 of the congregation,
 &nbsp; 26 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door
 of the court, which <I>is</I> by the tabernacle, and by the altar
 round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.
 &nbsp; 27 And of Kohath <I>was</I> the family of the Amramites, and the
 family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and
 the family of the Uzzielites: these <I>are</I> the families of the
 Kohathites.
 &nbsp; 28 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
 <I>were</I> eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
 sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 29 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side
 of the tabernacle southward.
 &nbsp; 30 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
 the Kohathites <I>shall be</I> Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
 &nbsp; 31 And their charge <I>shall be</I> the ark, and the table, and the
 candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
 wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 32 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest <I>shall be</I> chief
 over the chief of the Levites, <I>and have</I> the oversight of them
 that keep the charge of the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 33 Of Merari <I>was</I> the family of the Mahlites, and the family
 of the Mushites: these <I>are</I> the families of Merari.
 &nbsp; 34 And those that were numbered of them, according to the
 number of all the males, from a month old and upward, <I>were</I> six
 thousand and two hundred.
 &nbsp; 35 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
 Merari <I>was</I> Zuriel the son of Abihail: <I>these</I> shall pitch on
 the side of the tabernacle northward.
 &nbsp; 36 And <I>under</I> the custody and charge of the sons of Merari
 <I>shall be</I> the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof,
 and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the
 vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto,
 &nbsp; 37 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
 and their pins, and their cords.
 &nbsp; 38 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
 <I>even</I> before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, <I>shall
 be</I> Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
 sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
 stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
 &nbsp; 39 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
 numbered at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, throughout their
 families, all the males from a month old and upward, <I>were</I>
 twenty and two thousand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Levites being granted to Aaron to minister to him, they are here 
 delivered to him by tale, that he might know what he had, and employ 
 them accordingly.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By what rule they were numbered: <I>Every male from a month old and 
 upward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The rest of the tribes were numbered only from twenty years old and 
 upwards, and of them those only that were <I>able to go forth to 
 war;</I> but into the number of the Levites they must take in both 
 infants, and infirm; being exempted from the war, it was not insisted 
 upon that they should be of age and strength for the wars.  Though it 
 appears afterwards that little more than a third part of the Levites 
 were fit to be employed in the service of the tabernacle (about 8000 
 out of 22,000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:47,48"><I>ch.</I> iv. 47, 48</A>),

 yet God would have them all numbered as retainers to his family; that
 none may think themselves disowned and rejected of God because they are 
 not in a capacity of doing him that service which they see others do 
 him. The Levites of a month old could not honour God and serve the 
 tabernacle, as those that had grown up; yet out of the mouths of babes 
 and sucklings the Levites' praise was perfected. Let not little 
 children be hindered from being enrolled among the disciples of Christ, 
 for such was the tribe of Levi, of such is the kingdom of heaven, that 
 kingdom of priests. The redemption of the first-born was reckoned from 
 a month old

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:15,16"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 15, 16</A>),

 therefore from that age the Levites were numbered. They were numbered
 <I>after the house of their fathers,</I> not their <I>mothers,</I> for, 
 if the daughter of a Levite married one of another tribe, her son was 
 not a Levite; but we read of a spiritual priest to out God who 
 inherited the unfeigned faith which dwelt in his mother and 
 grandmother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5">2 Tim. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were distributed into three classes, according to the 
 number of the sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, and these 
 subdivided into several families, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:17-20"><I>v.</I>  17-20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning each of these three classes we have an account, 

 (1.) Of their number. The Gershonites were 7500. The Kohathites were
 8600. The Merarites were 6200. The rest of the tribes had not their
 subordinate families numbered by themselves as those of Levi; this 
 honour God put upon his own tribe.

 (2.) Of their post about the tabernacle on which they were to attend.
 The Gershonites pitched behind the tabernacle, westward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The Kohathites on the right hand, southward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The Merarites on the left hand, northward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 And, to complete the square, Moses and Aaron, with the priests, 
 encamped in the front, eastward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:38"><I>v.</I>  38</A>.

 Thus was the tabernacle surrounded with its guards; and thus does the 
 <I>angel of the Lord encamp round about those that fear him,</I> those 
 living temples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7">Ps. xxxiv. 7</A>.

 Every one knew his place, and must therein abide with God.

 (3.) Of their chief or head. As each class had its own place, so each
 had its own prince. The commander of the Gershonites was Eliasaph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);
 
 of the Kohathites Elizaphan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:30"><I>v.</I>  30</A>),

 of whom we read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:4">Lev. x. 4</A>)

 that he was one of the bearers at the funeral of Nadab and Abihu; of
 the Merarites Zuriel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 (4.) Of their charge, when the camp moved. Each class knew their own
 business; it was requisite they should, for that which is every body's 
 work often proves nobody's work. The Gershonites were charged with the 
 custody and carriage of all the curtains and hangings and coverings of 
 the tabernacle and court 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 the Kohathites of all the furniture of the tabernacle--the ark, altar, 
 table, &c. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),

 the Merarites of the heavy carriage, boards, bars, pillars, &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here we may observe, 

 (1.) That the Kohathites, though they were the second house, yet were
 preferred before the elder family of the Gershonites. Besides that 
 Aaron and the priests were of that family, they were more numerous, and 
 their post and charge more honourable, which probably was ordered to 
 put an honour upon Moses, who was of that family. Yet,

 (2.) The posterity of Moses were not at all dignified or privileged,
 but stood upon the level with other Levites, that it might appear he 
 did not seek the advancement of his own family, nor to entail any 
 honours upon it either in church or state; he that had honour enough 
 himself coveted not to have his name shine by that borrowed light, but 
 rather to have the Levites borrow honour from his name. Let none think 
 contemptibly of the Levites, though inferior to the priests, for Moses 
 himself though it preferment enough for his sons to be Levites. 
 Probably it was because the family of Moses were Levites only that in

 III. The sum total of the numbers of this tribe. They are computed in 
 all 22,000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 The sum of the particular families amounts to 300 more; if this had 
 been added to the sum total, the Levites, instead of being 273 fewer 
 than the first-born, as they were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 would have been twenty-seven more, and so the balance would have fallen 
 the other way; but it is supposed that the 300 which were struck off 
 from the account when the exchange was to be made were the first-born 
 of the Levites themselves, born since their coming out of Egypt, which 
 could not be put into the exchange, because they were already 
 sanctified to God. But that which is especially observable here is that 
 the tribe of Levi was by much the least of all the tribes. Note, God's 
 part in the world is too often the smallest part. His chosen are 
 comparatively a little flock.</P>

 money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five
 <I>shekels,</I> after the shekel of the sanctuary:
 &nbsp; 51 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto
 Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the exchange made of the Levites for the first-born. 

 1. The first-born were numbered from a month old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>.

 Those certainly were not reckoned who, though first-born, had become
 heads of families themselves, but those only that were under age; and 
 the learned bishop Patrick is decidedly of opinion that none were 
 numbered but those only that were born since their coming out of Egypt, 
 when the first-born were sanctified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2">Exod. xiii. 2</A>.

 If there were 22,000 first-born males, we may suppose as many females,
 and all these brought forth in the first year after they came out of 
 Egypt, we must hence infer that in the last year of their servitude, 
 even when it was in the greatest extremity, there were abundance of 
 marriages made among the Israelites; they were not discouraged by the 
 present distress, but married in faith, expecting that God would 
 shortly visit them with mercy, and that their children, though born in 
 bondage, should live in liberty and honour.  And it was a token of good 
 to them, an evidence that they were blessed of the Lord, that they were 
 not only kept alive, but greatly increased, in a barren wilderness.

 2. The number of the first-born, and that of the Levites, by a special 
 providence, came pretty near to each other; thus, when he <I>divided 
 the nations, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of 
 the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8">Deut. xxxii. 8</A>.

 Known unto God are all his works beforehand, and there is an exact
 proportion between them, and so it will appear when they come to be 
 compared. The Levites' cattle are said to be taken instead of the 
 firstlings <I>of the cattle of the children of Israel,</I> that is, the 
 Levites, with all their possessions, were devoted to God instead of the 
 first-born and all theirs; for, when we give ourselves to God, all we 
 have passes as appurtenances with the premises.

 3. The small number of first-born which exceeded the number of the
 Levites (273 in all) were to be redeemed, at five shekels apiece, and 
 the redemption-money given to Aaron; for it would not do well to have 
 them added to the Levites.  It is probable that in the exchange they 
 began with the eldest of the first-born, and so downward, so that those 
 were to be redeemed with money who were the 273 youngest of the 
 first-born; more likely so than either that it was determined by lot or 
 that the money was paid out of the public stock. The church is called 
 the church of the <I>first-born,</I> which is redeemed, not as these 
 were, with silver and gold, but, being devoted by sin to the justice of 
 God, is ransomed with <I>the precious blood of the Son of God.</I></P>
