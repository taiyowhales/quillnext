 The first seven verses of this chapter might fitly have been added to 
 the foregoing chapter, being a continuation of the law of the 
 trespass-offering, and the putting of other cases in which it was to be 
 offered; and with this end the instructions God gave concerning the 
 several kinds of sacrifices that should be offered: and then at 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>

 (which in the original begins a new section of the law) he comes to 
 appoint the several rites and ceremonies concerning these sacrifices 
 which had not been mentioned before. 
 
 I. The burnt-offering,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 II. The meat-offering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>),

 particularly that at the consecration of the priest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>.

 III. The sin-offering,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep,
 or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
 deceived his neighbour;
 &nbsp; 3 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
 and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
 sinning therein:
 &nbsp; 4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
 he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing
 which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him
 to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
 &nbsp; 5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
 restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
 thereto, <I>and</I> give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
 day of his trespass offering.
 &nbsp; 6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, a ram
 without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
 trespass offering, unto the priest:
 &nbsp; 7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he
 hath done in trespassing therein.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the latter part of the law of the trespass-offering: the former 
 part, which concerned trespasses about holy things, we had in the close 
 of the foregoing chapter; this concerns trespasses in common things. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The trespass supposed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Though all the instances relate to our neighbour, yet it is called a 
 <I>trespass against the Lord,</I> because, though the injury be done 
 immediately to our neighbour, yet an affront is thereby given to his 
 Maker and our Master. He that speaks evil of his brother is said to 
 speak evil of the law, and consequently of the Law-maker, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:11">Jam. iv. 11</A>.

 Though the person injured be ever so mean and despicable, and every way
 our inferior, yet the injury reflects upon that God who has made the 
 command of loving our neighbour second to that of loving himself. The 
 trespasses specified are,

 1. Denying a trust: <I>If a man lie unto his neighbour in that which
 was delivered him to keep,</I> or, which is worse, which was lent him 
 for his use. If we claim that as our own which is only borrowed, left 
 in our custody, or committed to our care, this is a trespass <I>against 
 the Lord,</I> who, for the benefit of human society, will have property 
 and truth maintained. 

 2. Defrauding a partner: <I>If a man lie in fellowship,</I> claiming a 
 sole interest in that wherein he has but a joint-interest.  

 3.  Disowning a manifest wrong: <I>If a man</I> has the front to <I>lie 
 in a thing taken away by violence,</I> which ordinarily cannot be hid.  
 
 4.  Deceiving in commerce, or, as some think, by false accusation; if a
 man have <I>deceitfully oppressed</I> his neighbour, as some read it, 
 either withholding what is due or extorting what is not. 

 5. Detaining what is found, and denying it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 if a man have <I>found that which was lost,</I> he must not call it his 
 own presently, but endeavour to find out the owner, to whom it must be 
 returned; this is doing as we would be done by: but he that <I>lies 
 concerning it,</I> that falsely says he knows nothing of it, especially 
 if he back this lie with a false oath, <I>trespasseth against the 
 Lord,</I> who to every thing that is said is a witness, but in an oath 
 he is the party appealed to, and highly affronted when he is called to 
 witness to a lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The trespass-offering appointed. 

 1. <I>In the day of his trespass-offering</I> he must make satisfaction
 to his brother. This must be first done <I>if thy brother hath aught 
 against thee: Because he hath sinned and is guilty,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 that is, is convicted of his guilt by his own conscience, and is 
 touched with remorse for it; seeing himself guilty before God, let him 
 faithfully restore all that he has got by fraud or oppression, with a 
 fifth part added, to make amends to the owner for the loss and trouble 
 he had sustained in the mean time; let him account both for debt and 
 damages. Note, Where wrong has been done restitution must be made; and 
 till it is made to the utmost of our power, or an equivalent accepted 
 by the person wronged, we cannot have the comfort of the forgiveness of 
 the sin; for the keeping of what is unjustly got avows the taking, and 
 both together make but one continued act of unrighteousness. To repent 
 is to undo what we have done amiss, which (whatever we pretend) we 
 cannot be said to do till we restore what has been got by it, as 
 Zaccheus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:8">Luke xix. 8</A>),

 and make satisfaction for the wrong done.

 2.  He must <I>then come and offer his gift,</I> must <I>bring his 
 trespass-offering to the Lord</I> whom he had offended; and the priest 
 must make an atonement for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:6,7"><I>v.</I>  6, 7</A>.

 This trespass-offering could not, of itself, make satisfaction for sin, 
 nor reconciliation between God and the sinner, but as it signified the 
 atonement that was to be made by our Lord Jesus, when he should make 
 his soul <I>an offering or sin,</I> a <I>trespass-offering;</I> it is 
 the same word that is here used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>.

 The trespasses here mentioned are trespasses still against the law of
 Christ, which insists as much upon justice and truth as ever the law of 
 nature or the law of Moses did; and though now we may have them 
 pardoned without a trespass-offering, yet not without true repentance, 
 restitution, reformation, and a humble faith in the righteousness of 
 Christ: and, if any make the more bold with these sins because they are 
 not now put to the expense of a trespass-offering for them, they turn 
 the grace of God into wantonness, and so bring upon themselves a swift 
 destruction. The Lord is the avenger of all such,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This <I>is</I> the law of the
 burnt offering: It <I>is</I> the burnt offering, because of the
 burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire
 of the altar shall be burning in it.
 &nbsp; 10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
 breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which
 the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and
 he shall put them beside the altar.
 &nbsp; 11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other
 garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean
 place.
 &nbsp; 12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
 not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
 morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
 shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall
 never go out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto we have had the instructions which Moses was directed to give 
 to the people concerning the sacrifices; but here begin the 
 instructions he was to give to the priests; he must <I>command Aaron 
 and his sons,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The priests were rulers in the house of God, but these rulers must be 
 ruled; and those that had the command of others must themselves be 
 commanded. Let ministers remember that not only commissions, but 
 commands, were given to Aaron and his sons, who must be in subjection 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the law of the burnt-offering, as far as it was 
 the peculiar care of the priests. The daily sacrifice of a lamb, which 
 was offered morning and evening for the whole congregation, is here 
 chiefly referred to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The priest must take care of the ashes of the burnt-offering, that 
 they be decently disposed of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He must clear the altar of them every morning, and put them on the east 
 side of the altar, which was furthest from the sanctuary; this he must 
 do in his linen garment, which he always wore when he did any service 
 at the altar; and then he must shift himself, and put on other 
 garments, either such as were his common wear, or (as some think) other 
 priestly garments less honourable, and must <I>carry the ashes into a 
 clean place without the camp.</I> Now,

 1. God would have this done, for the honour of his altar and the 
 sacrifices that were burnt upon it. Even the ashes of the sacrifices 
 must be preserved, to testify the regard God had to it; by the 
 burnt-offering <I>he</I> was honoured, and therefore thus <I>it</I> was 
 honoured, and therefore thus <I>it</I> was honoured. And some think 
 that this care which was taken of the ashes of the sacrifice typified 
 the burial of our Saviour; his dead body (the ashes of his sacrifice) 
 was carefully laid up in a garden, in a new sepulchre, which was a 
 <I>clean place.</I> It was also requisite that the altar should be kept 
 as clean as might be; the fire upon it would burn the better, and it is 
 decent in a house to have a clean fire-side. 

 2. God would have the priests themselves to keep it so, to teach them 
 and us to stoop to the meanest services for the honour of God and of 
 his altar. The priest himself must not only kindle the fire, but clean 
 the hearth, and carry out the ashes. God's servants must think nothing 
 below them but sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The priest must take care of the fire upon the altar, that it be 
 kept <I>always burning.</I> This is much insisted on here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:9,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 12</A>),
 
 and this express law is given: <I>The fire shall ever be burning upon 
 the altar, it shall never go out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We may suppose that no day passed without some extraordinary 
 sacrifices, which were always offered between the morning and evening 
 lamb; so that from morning to night the fire on the altar was kept up 
 of course. But to preserve it <I>all night unto the morning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 required some care. Those that keep good houses never let their kitchen 
 fire go out; therefore God would thus give an instance of his good 
 house-keeping. The first fire upon the altar came <I>from heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:24"><I>ch.</I> ix. 24</A>),

 so that by keeping that up continually with a constant supply of fuel
 all their sacrifices throughout all their generations might be said to 
 be consumed with that fire from heaven, in token of God's acceptance. 
 If, through carelessness, they should ever let it go out, they could 
 not expect to have it so kindled again.  Accordingly the Jews tell us 
 that the fire never did go out upon the altar, till the captivity in 
 Babylon. This is referred to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+31:9">Isa. xxxi. 9</A>,

 where God is said <I>to have his fire in Zion, and his furnace in 
 Jerusalem.</I> By this law we are taught to keep up in our minds a 
 constant disposition to all acts of piety and devotion, an habitual 
 affection to divine things, so as to be always ready to every good word 
 and work. We must not only not <I>quench the Spirit,</I> but we must 
 <I>stir up the gift</I> that is in us. Though we be not always 
 sacrificing, yet we must keep the fire of holy love always burning; and 
 thus we must pray always.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And this <I>is</I> the law of the meat offering: the sons of
 Aaron shall offer it before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, before the altar.
 &nbsp; 15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the
 meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
 which <I>is</I> upon the meat offering, and shall burn <I>it</I> upon the

 &nbsp; 16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
 unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
 court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
 &nbsp; 17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it <I>unto
 them for</I> their portion of my offerings made by fire; it <I>is</I>
 most holy, as <I>is</I> the sin offering, and as the trespass
 offering.

 <I>It shall be</I> a statute for ever in your generations concerning
 the offerings of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made by fire: every one that toucheth
 them shall be holy.
 &nbsp; 19 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 20 This <I>is</I> the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
 shall offer unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the day when he is anointed; the
 tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
 perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.
 &nbsp; 21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; <I>and when it is</I> baken,
 thou shalt bring it in: <I>and</I> the baken pieces of the meat
 offering shalt thou offer <I>for</I> a sweet savour unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead
 shall offer it: <I>it is</I> a statute for ever unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; it
 shall be wholly burnt.
 &nbsp; 23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly
 burnt: it shall not be eaten.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The meat-offering was either that which was offered by the people or 
 that by the priests at their consecration. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As to the common meat-offering,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Only a handful of it was to be burnt upon the altar; all the rest 
 was allowed to the priests for their food. The law of the 
 burnt-offerings was such as imposed upon the priests a great deal of 
 care and work, but allowed them little profit; for the flesh was wholly 
 burnt, and the priests had nothing but the skin. But to make them 
 amends the greatest part of the meat-offering was their own. The 
 burning of a handful of it upon the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 was ordered before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:2,9"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2, 9</A>.

 Here the remainder of it is consigned to the priests, the servants of
 God's house: <I>I have given it unto them for their portion of my 
 offerings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) It is the will of God that his ministers should be well provided 
 for with food convenient; and what is given to them he accepts as 
 offered to himself, if it be done with a single eye. 

 (2.) All Christians, being spiritual priests, do themselves share in
 the spiritual sacrifices they offer. It is not God that is the gainer 
 by them; the handful burnt upon the altar was not worth speaking of, in 
 comparison with the priests' share; we ourselves are the gainers by our 
 religious services. Let God have all the frankincense, and the priests 
 shall have the flour and the oil; what we give to God the praise and 
 glory of we may take to ourselves the comfort and benefit of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The laws concerning the eating of it were, 

 (1.) That it must be <I>eaten unleavened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 What was offered to God must have no leaven in it, and the priests must 
 have it as the altar had it, and no otherwise. Thus must we keep the 
 feasts of the Lord with the <I>unleavened bread of sincerity and 
 truth.</I>

 (2.) It must be eaten in <I>the court of the tabernacle</I> (here
 called the <I>holy place</I>), in some room prepared by the side of the 
 court for this purpose. It was a great crime to carry any of it out of 
 the court.  The very eating of it was a sacred rite, by which they were 
 to honour God, and therefore it must be done in a religious manner, and 
 with a holy reverence, which was preserved by confining it to the holy 
 place.  

 (3.) The males only must eat of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Of the less holy things, as the first-fruits and tithes, and the 
 shoulder and breasts of the peace-offerings, the <I>daughters</I> of 
 the priests might eat, for they might be carried out of the court; but 
 this was of the most holy things, which being to be eaten only in the 
 tabernacle, the <I>sons</I> of Aaron only might eat of it.

 (4.) The priests only that were clean might eat of it: <I>Every one
 that toucheth them shall be holy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Holy things for holy persons. Some read it, <I>Every thing that 
 toucheth it shall be holy:</I> Al the furniture of the table on which 
 these holy things were eaten must be appropriated to that use only, and 
 never after used as common things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As to the consecration meat-offering, which was offered for the 
 priests themselves, it was to be <I>wholly burnt, and none of it 
 eaten,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It comes in here as an exception to the foregoing law. It should seem 
 that this law concerning the meat-offering of initiation did not only 
 oblige the high priest to offer it, and on that day only that he was 
 anointed, and so for his successors in the day they were anointed; but 
 the Jewish writers say that by this law every priest, on the day he 
 first entered upon his ministry, was bound to offer this 
 meat-offering,--that the high priest was bound to offer it every day of 
 his life, from the day in which he was anointed,--and that it was to be 
 offered besides the meat-offering that attended the morning and evening 
 sacrifice, because it is said here to be a <I>meat-offering 
 perpetual,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Josephus says, "The high priest sacrificed twice every day at his own 
 charges, and this was his sacrifice." Note, Those whom God has advanced 
 above others in dignity and power ought to consider that he expects 
 more from them than from others, and should attend to every intimation 
 of service to be done for him. The meat-offering of the priest was to 
 be baked as if it were to be eaten, and yet it must be wholly burnt. 
 Though the priest that ministered was to be paid for serving the 
 people, yet there was no reason that he should be paid for serving the 
 high priest, who was the father of the family of the priests, and whom 
 therefore any priest should take a pleasure in serving gratis. Nor was 
 it fit that the priests should eat of the offerings of a priest; for as 
 the sins of the people were typically transferred to the priests, which 
 was signified by their eating of their offerings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:8">Hos. iv. 8</A>),

 so the sins of the priests must be typically transferred to the altar,
 which therefore must eat up all their offerings. We are all undone, 
 both ministers and people, if we must <I>bear our own iniquity;</I> nor 
 could we have had any comfort or hope if God had not laid on his dear 
 Son the iniquity of us all, and he is both the priest and the 
 altar.</P>

 We have here so much of the law of the sin-offering as did peculiarly 
 concern the priests that offered it. As, 

 1. That it must be killed <I>in the place where the burnt-offering was 
 killed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 that is, on the north side of the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>),

 which, some think typified the crucifying of Christ on mount Calvary,
 which was on the north side of Jerusalem.

 2.  That the priest who offered it for the sinner was (with his sons, 
 or other priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 to eat the flesh of it, after the blood and fat had been offered to 
 God, in the <I>court of the tabernacle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Hereby they were to <I>bear the iniquity of the congregation,</I> as it 
 is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:17"><I>ch.</I> x. 17</A>.

 3. The blood of the sin-offering was with great reverence to be washed 
 out of the clothes on which it happened to light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 which signified the awful regard we ought to have to the blood of 
 Christ, not counting it a common thing; that blood must be sprinkled on 
 the conscience, not on the raiment.

 4.  The vessel in which the flesh of the sin-offering was boiled must 
 be broken if it were an earthen one, and, if a brazen one, well washed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>.

 This intimated that the defilement was not wholly taken away by the 
 offering, but did rather cleave to it, such was the weakness and 
 deficiency of those sacrifices; but the blood of Christ thoroughly 
 cleanses from all sin, and after it there needs no cleansing.

 5. That all this must be understood of the common sin-offerings, not of 
 those for the priest, or the body of the congregation, either 
 occasional, or stated upon the day of atonement; for it had been before 
 ordained, and was now ratified, that if the blood of the offering was 
 brought into the holy place, as it was in those extraordinary cases, 
 the flesh was not to be eaten, but burnt without the camp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Hence the apostle infers the advantage we have under the gospel above 
 what they had under the law; for though the blood of Christ was 
 <I>brought into the tabernacle, to reconcile within the holy place,</I> 
 yet we have a right by faith to <I>eat of the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10-12">Heb. xiii. 10-12</A>),

 and so to take the comfort of the great propitiation.</P>
