 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is the only authentic history extant of the first age 
 of the world from the creation to the flood, containing (according 
 to the verity of the Hebrew text) 1656 years, as may easily be 
 computed by the ages of the patriarchs, before they begat that son 
 through whom the line went down to Noah. This is one of 
 those which the apostle calls "endless genealogies" 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:4">1 Tim. i. 4</A>),
 for Christ, who was the end of the Old-Testament law, was 
 also the end of the Old-Testament genealogies; towards him 
 they looked, and in him they centered. The genealogy here recorded 
 is inserted briefly in the pedigree of our Saviour 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:36-38">Luke iii. 36-38</A>),
 and is of great use to show that Christ was the 
 "seed of the woman" that was promised. We have here an account,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 This <I>is</I> the book of the generations 
 of Adam. In the day
 that God created man, in the likeness 
 of God made he him;
 &nbsp; 2 Male and 
 female created he them; and blessed 
 them, and called their name Adam, 
 in the day when they were created.
 &nbsp; 3 And Adam lived a hundred and
 thirty years, and begat <I>a son</I> in his
 own likeness, after his image; and 
 called his name Seth:
 &nbsp; 4 And the 
 days of Adam after he had begotten 
 Seth were eight hundred years: and 
 he begat sons and daughters:
 &nbsp; 5 And 
 all the days that Adam lived were
 nine hundred and thirty
 years: and he died.

 <A NAME="Page47"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of the chapter are the title
 or argument of the whole chapter: it is <I>the
 book of the generations of Adam;</I> it is the list
 or catalogue of the posterity of Adam, not of
 all, but only of the <I>holy seed who were the
 substance thereof</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">Isa. vi. 13</A>),
 and <I>of whom,
 as concerning the flesh, Christ came</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>),
 the names, ages, and deaths, of those 
 that were the successors of the first Adam in 
 the custody of the promise, and the ancestors 
 of the second Adam. The genealogy begins 
 with Adam himself. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His creation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>,
 where we have a 
 brief rehearsal of what was before at large 
 related concerning the creation of man. This 
 is what we have need frequently to hear of 
 and carefully to acquaint ourselves with. 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. That <I>God created man.</I> Man 
 is not his own maker, therefore he must not 
 be his own master; but the Author of his 
 being must be the director of his motions 
 and the centre of them. 
 
 2. That there was 
 a day in which God created man. He was 
 not from eternity, but of yesterday; he was 
 not the first-born, but the junior of the creation. 
 
 3. That God made him in his own 
 likeness, righteous and holy, and therefore, 
 undoubtedly, happy. Man's nature resembled
 the divine nature more than that of any 
 of the creatures of this lower world. 
 
 4. That God 
 created them male and female 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 for their mutual comfort as well as for the preservation 
 and increase of their kind. Adam 
 and Eve were both made immediately by the 
 hand of God, both made in God's likeness; 
 and therefore between the sexes there is not 
 that great distance and inequality which 
 some imagine. 
 
 5. That God blessed them. 
 It is usual for parents to bless their children; 
 so God, the common Father, blessed his. 
 But earthly parents can only beg a blessing; 
 it is God's prerogative to command it. It 
 refers chiefly to the blessing of increase, not 
 excluding other blessings. 
 
 6. That he <I>called 
 their name Adam. Adam</I> signifies <I>earth, red 
 earth.</I> Now, 
 
 (1.) God gave him this name. 
 Adam had himself named the rest of the 
 creatures, but he must not choose his own 
 name, lest he should assume some glorious 
 pompous title. But God gave him a name 
 which would be a continual memorandum to 
 him of the meanness of his original, and 
 oblige him to <I>look unto the rock whence he 
 was hewn and the hole of the pit whence he 
 was digged,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1">Isa. li. 1</A>.
 Those have little reason 
 to be proud who are so near akin to dust. 
 
 (2.) He gave this name both to the man and 
 to the woman. Being at first one by nature, 
 and afterwards one by marriage, it was fit 
 they should both have the same name, in 
 token of their union. The woman is <I>of the
 earth earthy</I> as well as the man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The birth of his son <I>Seth,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 He was born in the hundred and thirtieth year
 of Adam's life; and probably the murder of
 Abel was not long before. Many other sons 
 and daughters were born to Adam, besides 
 Cain and Abel, before this; but no notice is 
 taken of them, because an honourable mention 
 must be made of his name only in whose 
 loins Christ and the church were. But that 
 which is most observable here concerning 
 Seth is that Adam begat him <I>in his own likeness, 
 after his image.</I> Adam was made in the 
 image of God; but, when he was fallen and 
 corrupt, he begat a son in his own image, 
 sinful and defiled, frail, mortal, and miserable, 
 like himself; not only a <I>man</I> like himself, 
 consisting of body and soul, but a <I>sinner</I> 
 like himself, guilty and obnoxious, degenerate 
 and corrupt. Even the man after God's own 
 heart owns himself <I>conceived and born in sin,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:5">Ps. li. 5</A>.
 This was Adam's own likeness, 
 the reverse of that divine likeness in which 
 Adam was made; but, having lost it himself, 
 he could not convey it to his seed. Note, 
 Grace does not run in the blood, but corruption 
 does. A sinner begets a sinner, but a 
 saint does not beget a saint.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His age and death. He lived, in all, 
 nine hundred and thirty years, and then he 
 died, according to the sentence passed upon 
 him, <I>To dust thou shalt return.</I> Though he 
 did not die in the day he ate forbidden fruit, 
 yet in that very day he became mortal. 
 Then he began to die; his whole life afterwards 
 was but a reprieve, a forfeited condemned 
 life; nay, it was a wasting dying life: 
 he was not only like a criminal sentenced, but 
 as one already crucified, that dies slowly and 
 by degrees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here all that the Holy Ghost 
 thought fit to leave upon record concerning 
 five of the patriarchs before the flood, Seth, 
 Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, and Jared. There 
 is nothing observable concerning any of these 
 particularly, though we have reason to think 
 they were men of eminence, both for prudence 
 and piety, in their day: but in general,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Observe how largely and expressly their 
 generations are recorded. This matter, one 
 would think, might have been delivered in 
 fewer words; but it is certain that there is 
 not one idle word in God's books, whatever 
 there is in men's. It is thus plainly set down, 
 
 1. To make it easy and intelligible to the 
 meanest capacity. When we are informed 
 how old they were when they begat such a 
 son, and how many years they lived afterwards, 
 a very little skill in arithmetic will 
 enable a man to tell how long they lived in 
 all; yet the Holy Ghost sets down the sum 
 total, for the sake of those that have not even 
 so much skill as this. 
 
 2. To show the pleasure 
 God takes in the names of his people. 
 We found Cain's generation numbered in 
 haste 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>),
 but this account of the holy 
 seed is enlarged upon, and given in words at 
 length, and not in figures; we are told how 
 long those lived that lived in God's fear, and 
 when those died that died in his favour; but 
 as for others it is no matter. <I>The memory of 
 the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked 
 shall rot.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their life is reckoned by days 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 <I>All the days of Seth,</I> and so of the rest, which 
 intimates the shortness of the life of man 
 when it is at the longest, and the quick revolution 
 of our times on earth. If they 
 reckoned by days, surely we must reckon by 
 hours, or rather make that our frequent 
 prayer 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:12">Ps. xc. 12</A>),
 <I>Teach us to number our days.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning each of them, except 
 Enoch, it is said, <I>and he died.</I> It is implied 
 in the numbering of the years of their life 
 that their life, when those years were numbered 
 and finished, came to an end; and yet 
 it is still repeated, <I>and he died,</I> to show that 
 death passed upon all men without exception, 
 and that it is good for us particularly to observe 
 and improve the deaths of others for 
 our own edification. Such a one was a strong 
 healthful man, but he died; such a one was 
 a great and rich man, but he died; such a 
 one was a wise politic man, but he died; such 
 a one was a very good man, perhaps a very 
 useful man, but he died, &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That which is especially observable is 
 that they all lived very long; not one of them 
 died till he had seen the revolution of almost 
 eight hundred years, and some of them lived 
 much longer, a great while for an immortal 
 soul to be imprisoned in a house of clay. 
 The present life surely was not to them such 
 a burden as commonly it is now, else they 
 would have been weary of it; nor was the 
 future life so clearly revealed then as it is 
 now under the gospel, else they would have 
 been impatient to remove to it: long life to 
 the pious patriarchs was a blessing and made 
 them blessings. 
 
 1. Some natural causes may 
 be assigned for their long life in those first 
 ages of the world. It is very probable that 
 the earth was more fruitful, that the productions 
 of it were more strengthening, that the 
 air was more healthful, and that the influences 
 of the heavenly bodies were more benign, 
 before the flood, than afterwards. Though 
 man was driven out of paradise, yet the earth 
 itself was then paradisiacal--a garden in 
 comparison with its present wilderness-state: 
 and some think that their great knowledge 
 of the creatures, and of their usefulness both 
 for food and medicine, together with their 
 sobriety and temperance, contributed much 
 to it; yet we do not find that those who were 
 intemperate, as many were 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:27">Luke xvii. 27</A>),
 were as short-lived as intemperate men generally 
 are now. 
 
 2. It must chiefly be resolved 
 into the power and providence of God. He 
 prolonged their lives, both for the more 
 speedy replenishing of the earth and for the 
 more effectual preservation of the knowledge 
 of God and religion, then, when there was 
 no written word, but tradition was the channel 
 of its conveyance. All the patriarchs 
 here, except Noah, were born before Adam 
 died; so that from him they might receive a 
 full and satisfactory account of the creation, 
 paradise, the fall, the promise, and those divine 
 precepts which concerned religious worship 
 and a religious life: and, if any mistake 
 arose, they might have recourse to him while 
 he lived, as to an oracle, for the rectifying of 
 it, and after his death to Methuselah, and 
 others, that had conversed with him: so great 
 was the care of Almighty God to preserve in 
 his church the knowledge of his will and the 
 purity of his worship.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The accounts here run on for several generations 
 without any thing remarkable, or any 
 variation but of the names and numbers; but 
 at length there comes in one that must not 
 
 <A NAME="Page49"> </A>

 be passed over so, of whom special notice 
 must be taken, and that is <I>Enoch,</I> the seventh 
 from Adam: the rest, we may suppose, did 
 virtuously, but he excelled them all, and was 
 the brightest star of the patriarchal age. It 
 is but little that is recorded concerning him; 
 but this little is enough to make his name 
 great, greater than the name of the other 
 Enoch, who had a city called by his name. 
 Here are two things concerning him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His gracious conversation in this world, 
 which is twice spoken of: <I>Enoch walked with 
 God after he begat Methuselah</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 and again, <I>Enoch walked with God,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The nature of his religion and the scope 
 and tenour of his conversation: he <I>walked 
 with God,</I> which denotes, 
 
 (1.) True religion; 
 what is godliness, but walking with God? 
 The ungodly and profane are without God in 
 the world, they walk contrary to him: but 
 the godly walk with God, which presupposes 
 reconciliation to God, for two cannot <I>walk 
 together except they be agreed</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:3">Amos iii. 3</A>),
 and includes all the parts and instances of a 
 godly, righteous, and sober life. To walk 
 with God is to set God always before us, and 
 to act as those that are always under his eye. 
 It is to live a life of communion with God 
 both in ordinances and providences. It is to 
 make God's word our rule and his glory our 
 end in all our actions. It is to make it our 
 constant care and endeavour in every thing 
 to please God, and nothing to offend him. 
 It is to comply with his will, to concur with 
 his designs, and to be workers together with 
 him. It is to be <I>followers of him as dear 
 children.</I> 
 
 (2.) Eminent religion. He was 
 entirely dead to this world, and did not only 
 walk after God, as all good men do, but he 
 walked with God, as if he were in heaven already. 
 He lived above the rate, not only of 
 other men, but of other saints: not only good 
 in bad times, but the best in good times. 
 
 (3.) Activity in promoting religion among 
 others. Executing the priest's office is called 
 <I>walking before God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30,35">1 Sam. ii. 30, 35</A>,
 and see
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:7">Zech. iii. 7</A>.
 Enoch, it should seem, was 
 a priest of the most high God, and like Noah, 
 who is likewise said to walk with God, he 
 was a preacher of righteousness, and prophesied 
 of Christ's second coming. 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>,
 <I>Behold, the Lord cometh with his holy myriads.</I> 
 Now the Holy Spirit, instead of saying, Enoch 
 <I>lived,</I> says, Enoch <I>walked with God;</I> for it is 
 the life of a good man to walk with God. 
 This was,
 
 [1.] The business of Enoch's life, 
 his constant care and work; while others 
 lived to themselves and the world, he lived to 
 God. 
 
 [2.] It was the joy and support of 
 his life. Communion with God was to him 
 better than life itself. <I>To me to live is Christ,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:21">Phil. i. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The date of his religion. It is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 <I>he lived sixty-five years, and begat 
 Methuselah;</I> but 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 <I>he walked with God 
 after he begat Methuselah,</I> which intimates 
 that he did not begin to be eminent for piety 
 till about that time; at first he walked but 
 as other men. Great saints arrive at their 
 eminence by degrees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The continuance of his religion: he 
 walked with God <I>three hundred years,</I> as long 
 as he continued in this world. The hypocrite 
 will not pray always; but the real saint that 
 acts from a principle, and makes religion his 
 choice, will persevere to the end, and walk 
 with God while he lives, as one that hopes to 
 live for ever with him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:33">Ps. civ. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His glorious removal to a better world. 
 As he did not live like the rest, so he did not 
 die like the rest 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 <I>He was not, for God 
 took him;</I> that is, as it is explained
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:5">Heb. xi. 5</A>),
 <I>He was translated that he should not 
 see death, and was not found, because God had 
 translated him.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When he was thus translated. 
 
 (1.) What time of his life. It was when he had 
 lived but three hundred and sixty-five years 
 (a year of years), which, as men's ages went 
 then, was in the midst of his days; for there 
 was none of the patriarchs before the flood 
 that did not more than double that age. But 
 why did God take him so soon? Surely, because 
 the world, which had now grown corrupt,
 was not worthy of him, or because he 
 was so much above the world, and so weary 
 of it, as to desire a speedy removal out of it, 
 or because his work was done, and done the 
 sooner for his minding it so closely. Note, 
 God often takes those soonest whom he loves 
 best, and the time they lose on earth is gained 
 in heaven, to their unspeakable advantage. 
 
 (2.) What time of the world. It was when 
 all the patriarchs mentioned in this chapter 
 were living, except Adam, who died fifty-seven 
 years before, and Noah, who was born sixty-nine 
 years after; those two had sensible confirmations 
 to their faith other ways, but to 
 all the rest, who were or might have been 
 witnesses of Enoch's translation, it was a 
 sensible encouragement to their faith and 
 hope concerning a future state.</P>

 2. How his removal is expressed: <I>He was 
 not, for God took him.</I> 
 
 (1.) He was not any 
 longer in this world; it was not the period of 
 his being, but of his being here: he was <I>not 
 found,</I> so the apostle explains it from the 
 LXX.; not found by his friends, who sought 
 him as the sons of the prophets sought Elijah 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:17">2 Kings ii. 17</A>);
 not found by his enemies, 
 who, some think, were in quest of him, to 
 put him to death in their rage against him 
 for his eminent piety. It appears by his 
 prophecy that there were then many ungodly 
 sinners, who spoke hard speeches, and probably 
 did hard things too, against God's 
 people 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>),
 but God hid Enoch from 
 them, not under heaven, but in heaven. 
 
 (2.) God took him body and soul to himself in 
 the heavenly paradise, by the ministry of 
 angels, as afterwards he took Elijah. He 
 was changed, as those saints will be that shall 
 be found alive at Christ's second coming. 
 Whenever a good man dies God takes him, 

 <A NAME="Page50"> </A>

 fetches him hence, and receives him to himself. 
 The apostle adds concerning Enoch 
 that, <I>before his translation, he had this testimony, 
 that he pleased God,</I> and this was the 
 good report he obtained. Note, 
 
 [1.] Walking 
 with God pleases God. 
 
 [2.] We cannot 
 walk with God so as to please him, but by 
 faith. 
 
 [3.] God himself will put an honour 
 upon those that by faith walk with him so as 
 to please him. He will own them now, and 
 witness for them before angels and men at 
 the great day. Those that have not this 
 testimony before the translation, yet shall 
 have it afterwards. 
 
 [4.] Those whose conversation 
 in the world is truly holy shall find 
 their removal out of it truly happy. Enoch's 
 translation was not only an evidence to faith 
 of the reality of a future state, and of the possibility 
 of the body's existing in glory in that 
 state; but it was an encouragement to the 
 hope of all that walk with God that they 
 shall be for ever with him: signal piety shall 
 be crowned with signal honours.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And Methuselah lived a hundred 
 eighty and seven years, and 
 begat Lamech:
 &nbsp; 26 And Methuselah 
 lived after he begat Lamech seven 
 hundred eighty and two years, and 
 begat sons and daughters:
 &nbsp; 27 And 
 all the days of Methuselah were nine 
 hundred sixty and nine years: and 
 he died.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning Methuselah observe, 
 
 1. The 
 signification of his name, which some think 
 was prophetical, his father Enoch being a 
 prophet. <I>Methuselah</I> signifies, <I>he dies,</I> or 
 <I>there is a dart,</I> or, <I>a sending forth,</I> namely, 
 of the deluge, which came the very year that 
 Methuselah died. If indeed his name was 
 so intended and so explained, it was fair 
 warning to a careless world, a long time before 
 the judgment came. However, this is 
 observable, that the longest liver that ever 
 was carried death in his name, that he might 
 be reminded of its coming surely, though it 
 came slowly. 
 
 2. His age: he lived nine 
 hundred and sixty-nine years, the longest we 
 read of that ever any man lived on earth; 
 and yet he died. The longest liver must die 
 at last. Neither youth nor age will discharge 
 from that war, for that is the end of all men: 
 none can challenge life by long prescription, 
 nor make that a plea against the arrests of 
 death. It is commonly supposed that Methuselah 
 died a little before the flood; the 
 Jewish writers say, "seven days before," referring 
 to 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:10"><I>ch.</I> vii. 10</A>,
 and that he was taken 
 away from the evil to come, which goes upon 
 this presumption, which is generally received, 
 that all the patriarchs mentioned in this 
 chapter were holy good men. I am loth to 
 offer any surmise to the contrary; and yet I 
 see not that this can be any more inferred 
 from their enrollment here among the ancestors 
 of Christ than that all those kings of 
 Judah were so whose names are recorded in 
 his genealogy, many of whom, we are sure, 
 were much otherwise: and, if this be questioned, 
 it may be suggested as probable that 
 Methuselah was himself drowned with the 
 rest of the world; for it is certain that he 
 died that year.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28 And Lamech lived a hundred 
 eighty and two years, and begat a 
 son:
 &nbsp; 29 And he called his name 
 Noah, saying, This <I>same</I> shall comfort 
 us concerning our work and toil of 
 our hands, because of the ground 
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath cursed.

 begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the first mention of Noah, of 
 whom we shall read much in the following 
 chapters. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His name, with the reason of it: <I>Noah</I> 
 signifies <I>rest;</I> his parents gave him that 
 name, with a prospect of his being a more 
 than ordinary blessing to his generation: 
 <I>This same shall comfort us concerning our work 
 and toil of our hands, because of the ground 
 which the Lord hath cursed.</I> Here is, 
 
 1. Lamech's 
 complaint of the calamitous state of human 
 life. By the entrance of sin, and the entail 
 of the curse for sin, our condition has become 
 very miserable: our whole life is spent 
 in labour, and our time filled up with continual 
 toil. God having cursed the ground, 
 it is as much as some can do, with the utmost 
 care and pains, to fetch a hard livelihood 
 out of it. He speaks as one fatigued with 
 the business of this life, and grudging that 
 so many thoughts and precious minutes, 
 which otherwise might have been much better 
 employed, are unavoidably spent for the support 
 of the body. 
 
 2. His comfortable hopes 
 of some relief by the birth of this son: <I>This 
 same shall comfort us,</I> which denotes not 
 only the desire and expectation which parents 
 generally have concerning their children 
 (that, when they grow up, they will be comforts 
 to them and helpers in their business, 
 though they often prove otherwise), but an 
 apprehension and prospect of something more. 
 Very probably there were some prophecies 
 that went before of him, as a person that 
 should be wonderfully serviceable to his generation, 
 which they so understood as to 
 conclude that he was the promised seed, the 
 Messiah that should come; and then it intimates 
 that a covenant-interest in Christ as 
 ours, and the believing expectation of his coming, 
 furnish us with the best and surest 

 <A NAME="Page51"> </A>

 comforts, both in reference to the wrath and 
 curse of God which we have deserved and to 
 the toils and troubles of this present time of 
 which we are often complaining. "Is Christ 
 ours? Is heaven ours? <I>This same shall comfort 
 us.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His children, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
 These Noah begat (the eldest of these) when 
 he was 500 years old. It should seem that 
 Japheth was the eldest 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:21"><I>ch.</I> x. 21</A>),
 but Shem 
 is put first because on him the covenant was 
 entailed, as appears by 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:26"><I>ch.</I> ix. 26</A>,
 where God 
 is called the <I>Lord God of Shem.</I> To him, it 
 is probable, the birth-right was given, and 
 from him, it is certain, both Christ the head, 
 and the church the body, were to descend. 
 Therefore he is called <I>Shem,</I> which signifies a 
 <I>name,</I> because in his posterity the name of 
 God should always remain, till he should 
 come out of his loins whose name is above 
 every name; so that in putting Shem first 
 Christ was, in effect, put first, who in all 
 things must have the pre-eminence.</P>
