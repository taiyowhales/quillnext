 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jacob was a very honest good man, a man of great devotion and 
 integrity, yet he had more trouble and vexation than any of the 
 patriarchs. He left his father's house in a fright, went to 
 his uncle's in distress, very hard usage he met with there, and 
 now is going back surrounded with fears. Here is, 
 
 I. His resolution to return,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. His clandestine departure,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:17-21">ver. 17-21</A>.
 
 III. Laban's pursuit of him in displeasure,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:22-25">ver. 22-25</A>.
 
 IV. The hot words that passed between them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And he heard the words of Laban's 
 sons, saying, Jacob hath 
 taken away all that <I>was</I> our father's; 
 and of <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> our father's 
 hath he gotten all this glory.
 &nbsp; 2 And 
 Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, 
 and, behold, it <I>was</I> not toward 
 him as before.
 &nbsp; 3 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said
 unto Jacob, Return unto the land of
 thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and
 I will be with thee.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jacob
 sent and called Rachel and Leah to

 <A NAME="Page184"> </A>

 the field unto his flock,
 &nbsp; 5 And said 
 unto them, I see your father's countenance, 
 that it <I>is</I> not toward me as 
 before; but the God of my father hath 
 been with me.
 &nbsp; 6 And ye know that 
 with all my power I have served your 
 father.
 &nbsp; 7 And your father hath deceived 
 me, and changed my wages ten 
 times; but God suffered him not to 
 hurt me.
 &nbsp; 8 If he said thus, The 
 speckled shall be thy wages; then all 
 the cattle bare speckled: and if he 
 said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy 
 hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
 &nbsp; 9 Thus God hath taken away 
 the cattle of your father, and given
 <I>them</I> to me.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass 
 at the time that the cattle conceived,
 that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in 
 a dream, and, behold, the rams which 
 leaped upon the cattle <I>were</I> ringstraked, 
 speckled, and grisled.
 &nbsp; 11 And the 
 angel of God spake unto me in a dream, 
 <I>saying,</I> Jacob: And I said, Here <I>am</I> 
 I.
 &nbsp; 12 And he said, Lift up now thine 
 eyes, and see, all the rams which leap 
 upon the cattle <I>are</I> ringstraked, 
 speckled, and grisled: for I have seen 
 all that Laban doeth unto thee.
 &nbsp; 13 I 
 <I>am</I> the God of Beth-el, where thou 
 anointedst the pillar, <I>and</I> where thou 
 vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, 
 get thee out from this land, and return 
 unto the land of thy kindred.
 &nbsp; 14 And Rachel and Leah answered 
 and said unto him, <I>Is there</I> yet any 
 portion or inheritance for us in our 
 father's house?
 &nbsp; 15 Are we not counted 
 of him strangers? for he hath sold us,
 and hath quite devoured also our 
 money.
 &nbsp; 16 For all the riches which 
 God hath taken from our father, that 
 <I>is</I> ours, and our children's: now 
 then, whatsoever God hath said unto 
 thee, do.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jacob is here taking up a resolution immediately 
 to quit his uncle's service, to take 
 what he had and go back to Canaan. This 
 resolution he took up upon a just provocation, 
 by divine direction, and with the advice 
 and consent of his wives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Upon a just provocation; for Laban 
 and his sons had become very cross and ill-natured 
 towards him, so that he could not 
 stay among them with safety or satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Laban's sons showed their ill-will in 
 what they said,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 It should seem they 
 said it in Jacob's hearing, with a design to 
 vex him. The last chapter began with Rachel's 
 envying Leah; this begins with Laban's 
 sons envying Jacob. Observe, 
 
 (1.) How greatly they magnify Jacob's prosperity: 
 <I>He has gotten all this glory.</I> And 
 what was this glory that they made so much 
 ado about? It was a parcel of brown sheep 
 and speckled goats (and perhaps the fine 
 colours made them seem more glorious), 
 and some camels and asses, and such like 
 trading; and this was <I>all this glory.</I> Note, 
 Riches are glorious things in the eyes of 
 carnal people, while to all those that are 
 conversant with heavenly things they have 
 no glory in comparison with the glory which 
 excelleth. Men's over-valuing worldly wealth 
 is that fundamental error which is the root 
 of covetousness, envy, and all evil. 
 
 (2.) How 
 basely they reflect upon Jacob's fidelity, as 
 if what he had he had not gotten honestly: 
 <I>Jacob has taken away all that was our father's.</I> 
 Not all, surely. What had become of those 
 cattle which were committed to the custody 
 of Laban's sons, and sent <I>three days' journey</I> 
 off?
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:35,36"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 35, 36</A>.
 They mean all that 
 was committed to him; but, speaking invidiously, 
 they express themselves thus generally. Note, 
 
 [1.] Those that are ever so 
 careful to keep a good conscience cannot 
 always be sure of a good name. 
 
 [2.] This 
 is one of the vanities and vexations which 
 attend outward prosperity, that it makes a 
 man to be envied of his neighbors 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>),
 and <I>who can stand before envy?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:4">Prov. xxvii. 4</A>.
 Whom Heaven blesses hell curses, 
 and all its children on earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Laban himself said little, but his countenance 
 was not towards Jacob as it used to 
 be; and Jacob could not but take notice of 
 it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:2,5"><I>v.</I> 2, 5</A>.
 He was but a churl at the best, 
 but now he was more churlish than formerly. 
 Note, Envy is a sin that often appears in the 
 countenance; hence we read of an <I>evil eye,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:6">Prov. xxiii. 6</A>.
 Sour looks may do a great 
 deal towards the ruin of peace and love in a 
 family, and the making of those uneasy of 
 whose comfort we ought to be tender. Laban's 
 angry countenance lost him the greatest 
 blessing his family ever had, and justly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By divine direction and under the convoy 
 of a promise: <I>The Lord said unto Jacob, 
 Return, and I will be with thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Though 
 Jacob had met with very hard usage here, 
 yet he would not quit his place till God bade 
 him. He came thither by orders from 
 Heaven, and there he would stay till he was 
 ordered back. Note, It is our duty to set 
 ourselves, and it will be our comfort to see 
 ourselves, under God's guidance, both in our 
 going out and in our coming in. The direction 
 he had from Heaven is more fully related in 
 the account he gives of it to his wives
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>),
 where he tells them of a dream he had 
 about the cattle, and the wonderful increase 
 of those of his colour; and how the angel 
 of God, in that dream (for I suppose the 
 
 <A NAME="Page185"> </A>

 dream spoken of
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>
 and that
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>
 to be 
 the same), took notice of the workings of his 
 fancy in his sleep, and instructed him, so 
 that it was not by chance, or by his own 
 policy, that he obtained that great advantage; 
 but, 
 
 1. By the providence of God, who had
 taken notice of the hardships Laban had put 
 upon him, and took this way to recompense 
 him: "<I>For I have seen all that Laban doeth
 unto thee,</I> and herein I have an eye to that." 
 Note, There is more of equity in the distributions 
 of the divine providence than we are 
 aware of, and by them the injured are recompensed 
 really, though perhaps insensibly. 
 Nor was it only by the justice of providence 
 that Jacob was thus enriched, but, 
 
 2. In 
 performance of the promise intimated in what 
 is said
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,
 <I>I am the God of Beth-el,</I> This 
 was the place where the covenant was renewed 
 with him. Note, Worldly prosperity and 
 success are doubly sweet and comfortable 
 when we see them flowing, not from common 
 providence, but from covenant-love, <I>to 
 perform the mercy promised</I>--when we have 
 them from God as <I>the God of Beth-el,</I> from 
 those promises of the life which now is that 
 belong to godliness. Jacob, even when he 
 had this hopeful prospect of growing rich 
 with Laban, must think of returning. When 
 the world begins to smile upon us we must 
 remember it is not our home. <I>Now arise</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)
 <I>and return,</I> 
 
 (1.) To thy devotions in 
 Canaan, the solemnities of which had 
 perhaps been much intermitted while he was 
 with Laban. The times of this servitude 
 God had winked at; but now, "Return to 
 the place where thou anointedst the pillar 
 and vowedst the vow. Now that thou beginnest 
 to grow rich it is time to think of an 
 altar and sacrifices again." 
 
 (2.) To thy comforts 
 in Canaan: <I>Return to the land of thy 
 kindred.</I> He was here among his near kindred; 
 but those only he must look upon as 
 his kindred in the best sense, the kindred he 
 must live and die with, to whom pertained 
 the covenant. Note, The heirs of Canaan 
 must never reckon themselves at home till 
 they come thither, however they may seem 
 to take root here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With the knowledge and consent of 
 his wives. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He sent for Rachel and Leah to him to 
 the field
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 that he might confer with 
 them more privately, or because one would 
 not come to the other's apartment and he 
 would willingly talk with them together, or 
 because he had work to do in the field which 
 he would not leave. Note, Husbands that 
 love their wives will communicate their purposes 
 and intentions to them. Where there 
 is a mutual affection there will be a mutual 
 confidence. And the prudence of the wife 
 should engage the heart of her husband to 
 trust in her, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:11">Prov. xxxi. 11</A>.
 Jacob told his 
 wives,

 (1.) How faithfully he had served their 
 father,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Note, If others do not do their 
 duty to us, yet we shall have the comfort of 
 having done ours to them. 
 
 (2.) How unfaithfully 
 their father had dealt with him
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 He would never keep to any bargain 
 that he made with him, but, after the first 
 year, still as he saw Providence favour Jacob 
 with the colour agreed on, every half year 
 of the remaining five he changed it for some 
 other colour, which made it ten times; as if 
 he thought not only to deceive Jacob, but 
 the divine Providence, which manifestly 
 smiled upon him. Note, Those that deal 
 honestly are not always honestly dealt with. 
 
 (3.) How God had owned him notwithstanding. 
 He had protected him from Laban's 
 ill-will: <I>God suffered him not to hurt me.</I> 
 Note, Those that keep close to God shall be 
 kept safely by him. He had also provided 
 plentifully for him, notwithstanding Laban's 
 design to ruin him: <I>God has taken away the 
 cattle of your father, and given them to me,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Thus the righteous God paid Jacob for 
 his hard service out of Laban's estate; as 
 afterwards he paid the seed of Jacob for their 
 serving the Egyptians, with their spoils. 
 Note, God is not unrighteous to forget his 
 people's work and labour of love, though 
 men be so, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.
 Providence has 
 ways of making those honest in the event 
 that are not so in their design. Note, further, 
 <I>The wealth of the sinner is laid up for 
 the just,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:22">Prov. xiii. 22</A>.

 (4.) He told them of 
 the command God had given him, in a dream, 
 to return to his own country
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 that they 
 might not suspect his resolution to arise from 
 inconstancy, or any disaffection to their country 
 or family, but might see it to proceed 
 from a principle of obedience to his God, 
 and dependence on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His wives cheerfully consented to his 
 resolution. They also brought forward their 
 grievances, complaining that their father had 
 been not only unkind, but unjust, to them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>),
 that he looked upon them as 
 strangers, and was without natural affection 
 towards them; and, whereas Jacob had looked 
 upon the wealth which God had transferred 
 from Laban to him as his wages, they looked 
 upon it as their portions; so that, both ways, 
 God forced Laban to pay his debts, both to 
 his servant and to his daughters. So then 
 it seemed, 
 
 (1.) They were weary of their own 
 people and their father's house, and could 
 easily forget them. Note, This good use we 
 should make of the unkind usage we meet 
 with from the world, we should sit the more 
 loose to it, and be willing to leave it and 
 desirous to be at home. 
 
 (2.) They were 
 willing to go along with their husband, and 
 put themselves with him under the divine 
 direction: <I>Whatsoever God hath said unto 
 thee do.</I> Note, Those wives that are their 
 husband's meet helps will never be their 
 hindrances in doing that to which God calls 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his 
 sons and his wives upon camels;

 <A NAME="Page186"> </A>

 &nbsp; 18 And he carried away all his cattle, and 
 all his goods which he had gotten, the 
 cattle of his getting, which he had 
 gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac 
 his father in the land of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: 
 and Rachel had stolen the images that 
 <I>were</I> her father's.
 &nbsp; 20 And Jacob stole 
 away unawares to Laban the Syrian, 
 in that he told him not that he fled.
 &nbsp; 21 So he fled with all that he had; 
 and he rose up, and passed over the 
 river, and set his face <I>toward</I> the 
 mount Gilead.
 &nbsp; 22 And it was told 
 Laban on the third day that Jacob 
 was fled.
 &nbsp; 23 And he took his brethren 
 with him, and pursued after him
 seven days' journey; and they overtook 
 him in the mount Gilead.
 &nbsp; 24 And God came to Laban the Syrian 
 in a dream by night, and said unto 
 him, Take heed that thou speak not 
 to Jacob either good or bad.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Jacob's flight from Laban. We 
 may suppose he had been long considering of 
 it, and casting about in his mind respecting 
 it; but when now, at last, God had given him 
 positive orders to go, he made no delay, nor 
 was he disobedient to the heavenly vision. 
 The first opportunity that offered itself he 
 laid hold of, when Laban was shearing his 
 sheep
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 that part of his flock which was 
 in the hands of his sons three days' journey 
 off. Now, 
 
 1. It is certain that it was lawful 
 for Jacob to leave his service suddenly, without 
 giving a quarter's warning. It was not 
 only justified by the particular instructions 
 God gave him, but warranted by the fundamental 
 law of self-preservation, which directs 
 us, when we are in danger, to shift for our 
 own safety, as far as we can do it without 
 wronging our consciences. 
 
 2. It was his 
 prudence to steal away unawares to Laban, 
 lest, if Laban had known, he should have 
 hindered him or plundered him. 
 
 3. It was 
 honestly done to take no more than his own 
 with him, the <I>cattle of his getting,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 He took what Providence gave him, and was 
 content with that, and would not take the 
 repair of his damages into his own hands. 
 Yet Rachel was not so honest as her husband; 
 she <I>stole her father's images</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)
 and carried 
 them away with her. The Hebrew calls them 
 <I>teraphim.</I> Some think they were only little 
 representations of the ancestors of the family, 
 in statues or pictures, which Rachel had a 
 particular fondness for, and was desirous to 
 have with her, now that she was going into 
 another country. It should rather seem that 
 they were images for a religious use, <I>penates, 
 household-gods,</I> either worshipped or consulted 
 as oracles; and we are willing to hope (with
 bishop Patrick) that she took them away not
 out of covetousness of the rich metal they
 were made of, much less for her own use, or
 out of any superstitious fear lest Laban, by
 consulting his <I>teraphim,</I> might know which
 way they had gone (Jacob, no doubt, dwelt
 with his wives as a man of knowledge, and
 they were better taught than so), but out of
 a design hereby to convince her father of the
 folly of his regard to those as gods which
 could not secure themselves,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2">Isa. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Laban's pursuit of Jacob. Tidings 
 were brought him, on the third day, that 
 Jacob had fled; he immediately raises the 
 whole clan, takes his brethren, that is, the 
 relations of his family, that were all in his 
 interests, and pursues Jacob (as Pharaoh and 
 his Egyptians afterwards pursued the seed of 
 Jacob), to bring him back into bondage again, 
 or with design to strip him of what he had. 
 Seven days' journey he marched in pursuit 
 of him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 He would not have taken 
 half the pains to have visited his best friends. 
 But the truth is bad men will do more to 
 serve their sinful passions than good men 
 will to serve their just affections, and are 
 more vehement in their anger than in their 
 love. Well, at length Laban, overtook him, 
 and the very night before he came up with 
 him God interposed in the quarrel, rebuked 
 Laban and sheltered Jacob, charging Laban 
 not to <I>speak unto him either good or bad</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 that is, to say nothing against his going 
 on with his journey, for that it proceeded 
 from the Lord. The same Hebraism we 
 have,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:50"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 50</A>.
 Laban, during his seven 
 day's march, had been full of rage against 
 Jacob, and was now full of hopes that his 
 lust should be satisfied upon him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:9">Exod. xv. 9</A>);
 but God comes to him, and with one 
 word ties his hands, though he does not turn 
 his heart. Note, 
 
 1. In a dream, and in 
 slumberings upon the bed, God has ways of 
 opening the <I>ears of men, and sealing their 
 instruction,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15,16">Job xxxiii. 15, 16</A>.
 Thus he admonishes 
 men by their consciences, in secret 
 whispers, which the man of wisdom will hear 
 and heed. 
 
 2. The safety of good men is 
 very much owing to the hold God has of the 
 consciences of bad men and the access he has 
 to them. 
 
 3. God sometimes appears wonderfully 
 for the deliverance of his people when 
 they are upon the very brink of ruin. The 
 Jews were saved from Haman's plot when 
 the king's decree drew near to be put in
 execution, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1">Esth. ix. 1</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. 
 Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the 
 mount: and Laban with his brethren 
 pitched in the mount of Gilead.
 &nbsp; 26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast 
 thou done, that thou hast stolen away 
 unawares to me, and carried away my 
 daughters, as captives <I>taken</I> with the 
 
 <A NAME="Page187"> </A>

 sword?
 &nbsp; 27 Wherefore didst thou flee 
 away secretly, and steal away from
 me; and didst not tell me, that I 
 might have sent thee away with mirth, 
 and with songs, with tabret, and with 
 harp?
 &nbsp; 28 And hast not suffered me 
 to kiss my sons and my daughters?
 thou hast now done foolishly in <I>so</I> 
 doing.
 &nbsp; 29 It is in the power of my 
 hand to do you hurt: but the God of
 your father spake unto me yesternight, 
 saying, Take thou heed that thou speak 
 not to Jacob either good or bad.
 &nbsp; 30 And now, <I>though</I> thou wouldest needs 
 be gone, because thou sore longedst 
 after thy father's house, <I>yet</I> wherefore 
 hast thou stolen my gods?
 &nbsp; 31 And 
 Jacob answered and said to Laban, 
 Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure 
 thou wouldest take by force 
 thy daughters from me.
 &nbsp; 32 With 
 whomsoever thou findest thy gods, 
 let him not live: before our brethren 
 discern thou what <I>is</I> thine with me, 
 and take <I>it</I> to thee. For Jacob knew 
 not that Rachel had stolen them.
 &nbsp; 33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, 
 and into Leah's tent, and into the two 
 maidservants' tents; but he found 
 <I>them</I> not. Then went he out of Leah's 
 tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
 &nbsp; 34 Now Rachel had taken the images, 
 and put them in the camel's furniture, 
 and sat upon them. And Laban 
 searched all the tent, but found <I>them</I> 
 not.
 &nbsp; 35 And she said to her father, 
 Let it not displease my lord that I 
 cannot rise up before thee; for the 
 custom of women <I>is</I> upon me. And 
 he searched, but found not the images.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the reasoning, not to say 
 the rallying, that took place between Laban 
 and Jacob at their meeting, in that mountain 
 which was afterwards called <I>Gilead,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The high charge which Laban exhibited 
 against him. He accuses him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As a renegade that had unjustly deserted 
 his service. To represent Jacob as a 
 criminal, he will have it thought that he intended 
 kindness to his daughters
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),
 that he would have dismissed them with all 
 the marks of love and honour that could be, 
 that he would have made a solemn business 
 of it, would have kissed his little grandchildren 
 (and that was all he would have 
 given them), and, according to the foolish 
 custom of the country, would have sent them 
 away <I>with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, 
 and with harp:</I> not as Rebekah was sent 
 away out of the same family, above 120 
 years before, with prayers and blessings
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:60"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 60</A>),
 but with sport and merriment, 
 which was a sign that religion had very much 
 decayed in the family, and that they had lost 
 their seriousness. However, he pretends 
 they would have been treated with respect at 
 parting. Note, It is common for bad men, 
 when they are disappointed in their malicious 
 projects, to pretend that they designed nothing 
 but what was kind and fair. When 
 they cannot do the mischief they intended, 
 they are loth it should be thought that they 
 ever did intend it. When they have not 
 done what they should have done they come 
 off with this excuse, that they would have 
 done it. Men may thus be deceived, but 
 God cannot. He likewise suggests that Jacob 
 had some bad design in stealing away 
 thus
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 that he took his wives away as 
 captives. Note, Those that mean ill themselves 
 are most apt to put the worst construction 
 upon what others do innocently.
 The insinuating and the aggravating of faults 
 are the artifices of a designing malice, and 
 those must be represented (though never so 
 unjustly) as intending ill against whom ill is 
 intended. Upon the whole matter, 
 
 (1.) He boasts of his own power
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):
 <I>It is in the 
 power of my hand to do you hurt.</I> He supposes 
 that he had both right on his side (<I>a 
 good action,</I> as we say, against Jacob) and 
 <I>strength</I> on his side, either to avenge the 
 wrong or recover the right. Note, Bad 
 people commonly value themselves much 
 upon their power to do hurt, whereas a 
 power to do good is much more valuable. 
 Those that will do nothing to make themselves 
 amiable love to be thought formidable. 
 And yet, 
 
 (2.) He owns himself under the 
 check and restraint of God's power; and, 
 though it redounds much to the credit and 
 comfort of Jacob, he cannot avoid telling him 
 the caution God had given him the night before 
 in a dream, <I>Speak not to Jacob good nor 
 bad.</I> Note, As God has all wicked instruments 
 in a chain, so when he pleases he can 
 make them sensible of it, and force them to 
 own it to his praise, as protector of the 
 good, as Balaam did. Or we may look upon 
 this as an instance of some conscientious regard 
 felt by Laban for God's express prohibitions. 
 As bad as he was he durst not injure 
 one whom he saw to be the particular 
 care of Heaven. Note, A great deal of mischief 
 would be prevented if men would but 
 attend to the caveats which their own consciences 
 give them in slumberings upon the 
 bed, and regard the voice of God in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As a thief,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 Rather than own 
 that he had given him any colour of provocation 
 to depart, he is willing to impute it to 
 a foolish fondness for his father's house, 
 which made him that he would needs begone; 
 but then (says he) <I>wherefore hast thou 
 
 <A NAME="Page188"> </A>

 stolen my gods?</I> Foolish man! to call those 
 his gods that could be stolen! Could he 
 expect protection from those that could 
 neither resist nor discover their invaders? 
 Happy are those who have the Lord for their 
 God, for they have a God that they cannot 
 be robbed of. Enemies may steal our goods, 
 but not our God. Here Laban lays to Jacob's 
 charge things that he knew not, the common 
 distress of oppressed innocency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jacob's apology for himself. Those 
 that commit their cause to God, yet are not 
 forbidden to plead it themselves with meekness 
 and fear. 
 
 1. As to the charge of stealing 
 away his own wives he clears himself by 
 giving the true reason why he went away
 unknown to Laban,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 He feared lest 
 Laban would by force take away his daughters, 
 and so oblige him, by the bond of his 
 affection to his wives, to continue in his service. 
 Note, Those that are unjust in the 
 least, it may be suspected, will be unjust also 
 in much,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:10">Luke xvi. 10</A>.
 If Laban deceive 
 Jacob in his wages, it is likely he will make 
 no conscience of robbing him of his wives, 
 and putting those asunder whom God has joined 
 together. What may not be feared 
 from men that have no principle of honesty? 
 
 2. As to the charge of stealing Laban's gods 
 he pleads not guilty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 He not only did 
 not take them himself (he was not so fond of 
 them), but he did not know that they were 
 taken. Yet perhaps he spoke too hastily 
 and inconsiderately when he said, "Whoever 
 had taken them, <I>let him not live;</I>" upon this 
 he might reflect with some bitterness when, 
 not long after, Rachel who had taken them 
 died suddenly in travail. How just soever 
 we think ourselves to be, it is best to forbear 
 imprecations, lest they fall heavier than we 
 imagine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The diligent search Laban made for 
 his gods
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:33-35"><I>v.</I> 33-35</A>),
 partly out of hatred to 
 Jacob, whom he would gladly have an occasion 
 to quarrel with, partly out of love to 
 his idols, which he was loth to part with. 
 We do not find that he searched Jacob's
 flocks for stolen cattle; but he searched his 
 furniture for stolen gods. He was of Micah's 
 mind, <I>You have taken away my gods, and 
 what have I more?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:24">Judg. xviii. 24</A>.
 Were 
 the worshippers of false gods so set upon 
 their idols? did they thus walk in the name 
 of their gods? and shall not we be as solicitous 
 in our enquires after the true God? 
 When he has justly departed from us, how 
 carefully should we ask, <I>Where is God my 
 Maker? O that I knew where I might find 
 him!</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:3">Job xxiii. 3</A>.
 Laban, after all his 
 searches, missed of finding his gods, and was 
 baffled in his enquiry with a sham; but our 
 God will not only be found of those that seek
 him, but they shall find him their bountiful 
 rewarder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode 
 with Laban: and Jacob answered and 
 said to Laban, What <I>is</I> my trespass? 
 what <I>is</I> my sin, that thou hast so hotly 
 pursued after me?
 &nbsp; 37 Whereas thou 
 hast searched all my stuff, what hast 
 thou found of all thy household stuff? 
 set <I>it</I> here before my brethren and 
 thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt 
 us both.
 &nbsp; 38 This twenty years 
 <I>have</I> I <I>been</I> with thee; thy ewes and
 thy she goats have not cast their young, 
 and the rams of thy flock have I not 
 eaten.
 &nbsp; 39 That which was torn <I>of 
 beasts</I> I brought not unto thee; I 
 bare the loss of it; of my hand didst 
 thou require it, <I>whether</I> stolen by day, 
 or stolen by night.
 &nbsp; 40 <I>Thus</I> I was; 
 in the day the drought consumed me, 
 and the frost by night; and my sleep 
 departed from mine eyes.
 &nbsp; 41 Thus 
 have I been twenty years in thy house; 
 I served thee fourteen years for thy 
 two daughters, and six years for thy
 cattle: and thou hast changed my 
 wages ten times.
 &nbsp; 42 Except the God 
 of my father, the God of Abraham, 
 and the fear of Isaac, had been with 
 me, surely thou hadst sent me away
 now empty. God hath seen mine affliction 
 and the labour of my hands, 
 and rebuked <I>thee</I> yesternight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The power of provocation. Jacob's natural 
 temper was mild and calm, and grace 
 had improved it; he was a smooth man, and 
 a plain man; and yet Laban's unreasonable 
 carriage towards him put him into a heat that
 transported him into some vehemence,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.
 His chiding with Laban, though it may 
 admit of some excuse, was not justifiable, nor 
 is it written for our imitation. Grievous 
 words stir up anger, and commonly do but 
 make bad worse. It is a very great affront 
 to one that bears an honest mind to be 
 charged with dishonesty, and yet even this 
 we must learn to bear with patience, committing 
 our cause to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The comfort of a good conscience. 
 This was Jacob's rejoicing, that when Laban 
 accused him his own conscience acquitted 
 him, and witnessed for him that he had been 
 in all things willing and careful to live 
 honestly, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18">Heb. xiii. 18</A>.
 Note, Those that in 
 any employment have dealt faithfully, if they 
 cannot obtain the credit of it with men, yet 
 shall have the comfort of it in their own 
 bosoms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The character of a good servant, and 
 particularly of a faithful shepherd. Jacob 
 had approved himself such a one,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.
 
 1. He was very careful, so that, through his 
 
 <A NAME="Page189"> </A>

 oversight or neglect, the ewes did not cast 
 their young. His piety also procured a 
 blessing upon his master's effects that were 
 under his hands. Note, Servants should 
 take no less care of what they are entrusted 
 with for their masters than if they were entitled 
 to it as their own. 
 
 2. He was very 
 honest, and took none of that for his own 
 eating which was not allowed him. He contented 
 himself with mean fare, and coveted 
 not to feast upon the rams of the flock. 
 Note, Servants must not be dainty in their 
 food, nor covet what is forbidden them, but 
 in that, and other instances, show all good 
 fidelity. 
 
 3. He was very laborious,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 He stuck to his business, all weathers; and 
 bore both heat and cold with invincible patience. 
 Note, Men of business, that intend 
 to make something of it, must resolve to endure 
 hardness. Jacob is here an example to 
 ministers; they also are shepherds, of whom 
 it is required that they be true to their trust 
 and willing to take pains.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The character of a hard master. 
 Laban had been such a one to Jacob. Those 
 are bad masters, 
 
 1. Who exact from their 
 servants that which is unjust, by obliging 
 them to make good that which is not damaged 
 by any default of theirs. This Laban did,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 Nay, if there has been a neglect, yet it 
 is unjust to punish above the proportion of 
 the fault. That may be an inconsiderable 
 damage to the master which would go near 
 to ruin a poor servant. 
 
 2. Those also are 
 bad masters who deny to their servants that
 which is just and equal. This Laban did,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 It was unreasonable for him to make 
 Jacob serve for his daughters, when he had
 in reversion so great an estate secured to him
 by the promise of God himself; as it was
 also to give him his daughters without portions,
 when it was in the power of his hands
 to do well for them. Thus he robbed the poor
 because he was poor, as he did also by
 changing his wages.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The care of providence for the protection 
 of injured innocence,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 God took 
 cognizance of the wrong done to Jacob, and 
 repaid him whom Laban would otherwise 
 have sent empty away, and rebuked Laban, 
 who otherwise would have swallowed him 
 up. Note, God is the patron of the oppressed; 
 and those who are wronged and yet 
 not ruined, cast down and yet not destroyed, 
 must acknowledge him in their preservation 
 and give him the glory of it. Observe, 
 
 1. Jacob speaks of God as the God of his father, 
 intimating that he thought himself unworthy 
 to be thus regarded, but was beloved for 
 the father's sake. 
 
 2. He calls him the God of 
 Abraham, and the fear of Isaac; for Abraham 
 was dead, and had gone to that world 
 where perfect love casts out fear; but Isaac 
 was yet alive, sanctifying the Lord in his 
 heart, as his fear and his dread.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>43 And Laban answered and said 
 unto Jacob, <I>These</I> daughters <I>are</I> my 
 daughters, and <I>these</I> children <I>are</I> my 
 children, and <I>these</I> cattle <I>are</I> my cattle, 
 and all that thou seest <I>is</I> mine: 
 and what can I do this day unto these 
 my daughters, or unto their children 
 which they have born?
 &nbsp; 44 Now therefore 
 come thou, let us make a covenant, 
 I and thou; and let it be for a 
 witness between me and thee.
 &nbsp; 45 And 
 Jacob took a stone, and set it up <I>for</I> 
 a pillar.
 &nbsp; 46 And Jacob said unto his 
 brethren, Gather stones; and they
 took stones, and made an heap: and 
 they did eat there upon the heap.
 &nbsp; 47 And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: 
 but Jacob called it Galeed.
 &nbsp; 48 And 
 Laban said, This heap <I>is</I> a witness 
 between me and thee this day. Therefore 
 was the name of it called Galeed;
 &nbsp; 49 And Mizpah; for he said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 watch between me and thee, when we 
 are absent one from another.
 &nbsp; 50 If 
 thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if 
 thou shalt take <I>other</I> wives beside my 
 daughters, no man <I>is</I> with us; see, 
 God <I>is</I> witness betwixt me and thee.
 &nbsp; 51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold 
 this heap, and behold <I>this</I> pillar, which 
 I have cast betwixt me and thee;
 &nbsp; 52 This heap <I>be</I> witness, and <I>this</I> pillar 
 <I>be</I> witness, that I will not pass over 
 this heap to thee, and that thou shalt 
 not pass over this heap and this pillar 
 unto me, for harm.
 &nbsp; 53 The God of 
 Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the 
 God of their father, judge betwixt us. 
 And Jacob sware by the fear of his
 father Isaac.
 &nbsp; 54 Then Jacob offered 
 sacrifice upon the mount, and called 
 his brethren to eat bread: and they 
 did eat bread, and tarried all night in 
 the mount.
 &nbsp; 55 And early in the 
 morning Laban rose up, and kissed 
 his sons and his daughters, and blessed 
 them: and Laban departed, and returned 
 unto his place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the compromising of the 
 matter between Laban and Jacob. Laban 
 had nothing to say in reply to Jacob's remonstrance: 
 he could neither justify himself 
 nor condemn Jacob, but was convicted by his 
 own conscience of the wrong he had done 
 him; and therefore desires to hear no more 
 of the matter He is not willing to own himself 
 in a fault, nor to ask Jacob's forgiveness, 
 
 <A NAME="Page190"> </A>

 and make him satisfaction, as he ought to 
 have done. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He turns it off with a profession of 
 kindness for Jacob's wives and children
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):
 <I>These daughters are my daughters.</I> When he 
 cannot excuse what he has done, he does, in 
 effect, own what he should have done; he 
 should have treated them as his own, but he 
 had counted them as strangers,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 Note, 
 It is common for those who are without natural 
 affection to pretend much to it when it 
 will serve a turn. Or perhaps Laban said 
 this in a vain-glorious say, as one that loved 
 to talk big, and use great swelling words of 
 vanity: "All that thou seest is mine." It 
 was not so, it was all Jacob's, and he had 
 paid dearly for it; yet Jacob let him have his 
 saying, perceiving him coming into a better 
 humour. Note, Property lies near the hearts 
 of worldly people. They love to boast of it, 
 "This is mine, and the other is mine," as 
 Nabal,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:11">1 Sam. xxv. 11</A>, 
 <I>my bread and my water.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proposes a covenant of friendship 
 between them, to which Jacob readily agrees, 
 without insisting upon Laban's submission, 
 much less his restitution. Note, When quarrels 
 happen, we should be willing to be friends 
 again upon any terms: peace and love are 
 such valuable jewels that we can scarcely 
 buy them too dearly. Better sit down losers 
 than go on in strife. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The substance of this covenant. Jacob 
 left it wholly to Laban to settle it. The tenour 
 of it was, 
 
 (1.) That Jacob should be a 
 good husband to his wives, that he should 
 not afflict them, nor marry other wives besides 
 them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.
 Jacob had never given 
 him any cause to suspect that he would be 
 any other than a kind husband; yet, as if he 
 had, he was willing to come under this engagement. 
 Though Laban had afflicted them 
 himself, yet he will bind Jacob that he shall 
 not afflict them. Note, Those that are injurious 
 themselves are commonly most jealous 
 of others, and those that do not do their own 
 duty are most peremptory in demanding duty 
 from others. 
 
 (2.) That he should never be a 
 bad neighbour to Laban,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.
 It was agreed 
 that no act of hostility should ever pass between 
 them, that Jacob should forgive and 
 forget all the wrongs he had received and 
 not remember them against Laban or his 
 family in after-times. Note, We may resent 
 an injury which yet we may not revenge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The ceremony of this covenant. It was 
 made and ratified with great solemnity, according 
 to the usages of those times. 
 
 (1.) A pillar was erected
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),
 and a heap of 
 stones raised
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),
 to perpetuate the memory 
 or the thing, the way of recording
 agreements by writing being then either not 
 known or not used. 
 
 (2.) A sacrifice was 
 offered
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),
 a sacrifice of peace-offerings. 
 Note, Our peace with God is that which puts 
 true comfort into our peace with our friends. 
 If parties contend, the reconciliation of both 
 to him will facilitate their reconciliation one 
 to another. 
 
 (3.) They did eat bread together
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),
 jointly partaking of the feast 
 upon the sacrifice,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.
 This was in token 
 of a hearty reconciliation. Covenants of 
 friendship were anciently ratified by the 
 parties eating and drinking together. It 
 was in the nature of a love-feast. 
 
 (4.) They 
 solemnly appealed to God concerning their 
 sincerity herein, 
 
 [1.] As a witness
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):
 <I>The Lord watch between me and thee,</I> that is, 
 "The Lord take cognizance of every thing 
 that shall be done on either side in violation 
 of this league. When we are out of one 
 another's sight, let his be a restraint upon 
 us, that wherever we are we are under God's 
 eye." This appeal is convertible into a 
 prayer. Friends at a distance from each 
 other may take the comfort of this, that when 
 they cannot know or succour one another 
 God watches between them, and has his eye 
 on them both. 
 
 [2.] As a Judge,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.
 <I>The God of Abraham</I> (from whom Jacob descended), 
 <I>and the God of Nahor</I> (from whom 
 Laban descended), <I>the God of their father</I> 
 (the common ancestor, form whom they both 
 descended), <I>judge betwixt us.</I> God's relation 
 to them is thus expressed to intimate that 
 they worshipped one and the same God, 
 upon which consideration there ought to be 
 no enmity between them. Note, Those that 
 have one God should have one heart: those 
 that agree in religion should strive to agree 
 in every thing else. God is Judge between 
 contending parties, and he will judge righteously; 
 whoever does wrong, it is at his peril. 
 
 (5.) They gave a new name to the place,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>.
 Laban called it in Syriac, and Jacob 
 in Hebrew, <I>the heap of witness;</I> and
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>)
 it was called <I>Mizpah, a watch-tower.</I> Posterity 
 being included in the league, care was 
 taken that thus the memory of it should be 
 preserved. These names are applicable to 
 the seals of the gospel covenant, which are 
 witnesses to us if we be faithful, but witnesses 
 to us if we be faithful, but witnesses 
 against us if we be false. The name 
 Jacob gave this heap (<I>Galeed</I>) stuck by it,
 not the name Laban gave it. In all this rencounter,
 Laban was noisy and full of words, 
 affecting to say much; Jacob was silent, and 
 said little. When Laban appealed to God 
 under many titles, Jacob only <I>swore by the 
 fear of his father Isaac,</I> that is, the God 
 whom his father Isaac feared, who had never 
 served other gods, as Abraham and Nahor 
 had done. Two words of Jacob's were more 
 memorable than all Laban's speeches and 
 vain repetitions: <I>for the words of wise men 
 are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him 
 that ruleth among fools,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:17">Eccl. ix. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> After all this angry parley, they 
 part friends,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.
 Laban very affectionately 
 <I>kissed his sons and his daughters, and 
 blessed them,</I> and then went back in peace. 
 Note, God is often better to us than our 
 fears, and strangely overrules the spirits of 
 men in our favour, beyond what we could

 have expected; for it is not in vain to trust 
 in him.</P>
