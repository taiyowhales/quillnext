 Moses in this chapter exhorts Israel, 

 I. In general, to keep God's commandments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 II. In particular, and in order to that, to keep themselves pure from
 all communion with idolaters. 

 1. They must utterly destroy the seven devoted nations, and not spare
 them, or make leagues with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:1,2,16,24">ver. 1, 2, 16, 24</A>.

 2. They must by no means marry with the remainders of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 3. They must deface and consume their altars and images, and not so
 much as take the silver and gold of them to their own use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:5,25,26">ver. 5, 25, 26</A>.
 
 To enforce this charge, he shows that they were bound to do so,

 (1.) In duty. Considering 
 
 [1.] Their election to God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:6">ver. 6</A>.
 
 [2.] The reason of that election,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.
 
 [3.] The terms they stood upon with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 (2.) In interest. It is here promised,

 [1.] In general, that, if they would serve God, he would bless and 
 prosper them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 [2.] In particular, that if they would drive out the nations, that they
 might not be a temptation to them, God would drive them out, that they 
 should not be any vexation to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17-26">ver. 17</A>, &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
 thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before
 thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and
 the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
 &nbsp; 2 And when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall deliver them before thee;
 thou shalt smite them, <I>and</I> utterly destroy them; thou shalt
 make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them:
 &nbsp; 3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter
 thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou
 take unto thy son.
 &nbsp; 4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
 may serve other gods: so will the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be kindled
 against you, and destroy thee suddenly.
 &nbsp; 5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
 altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves,
 and burn their graven images with fire.
 &nbsp; 6 For thou <I>art</I> a holy people unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
 above all people that <I>are</I> upon the face of the earth.
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
 because ye were more in number than any people; for ye <I>were</I> the
 fewest of all people:
 &nbsp; 8 But because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> loved you, and because he would keep the
 oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought
 you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of
 bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 9 Know therefore that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, he <I>is</I> God, the
 faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that
 love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;
 &nbsp; 10 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
 them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay
 him to his face.
 &nbsp; 11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the
 statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do
 them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A very strict caution against all friendship and fellowship with 
 idols and idolaters. Those that are taken into communion with God must 
 have no communication with the unfruitful works of darkness. These 
 things they are charged about for the preventing of this snare now 
 before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must <I>show them no mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Bloody work is here appointed them, and yet it is God's work, and good 
 work, and in its time and place needful, acceptable, and 
 honourable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God here engages to do his part. It is spoken of as a thing taken 
 for granted that God would <I>bring them into the land of promise,</I> 
 that he would cast out the nations before them, who were the present 
 occupants of that land; no room was left to doubt of that. His power is 
 irresistible, and therefore he can do it; his promise is inviolable, 
 and therefore he will do it. Now, 

 [1.] These devoted nations are here named and numbered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>seven</I> in all, and seven to one are great odds. They are
 specified, that Israel might know the bounds and limits of their 
 commission: hitherto their severity must come, but no further; nor must 
 they, under colour of this commission, kill all that came in their way; 
 no, here must its waves be stayed. The confining of this commission to 
 the nations here mentioned plainly intimates that after-ages were not 
 to draw this into a precedent; this will not serve to justify those 
 barbarous laws which give no quarter. How agreeable soever this method 
 might be, when God himself prescribed it, to that dispensation under 
 which such multitudes of beasts were killed and burned in sacrifice, 
 now that all sacrifices of atonement are perfected in, and superseded 
 by, the great propitiation made by the blood of Christ, human blood has 
 become perhaps more precious than it was, and those that have most 
 power yet must not be prodigal of it. 

 [2.] They are here owned to be greater and mightier than Israel. They
 had been long rooted in this land, to which Israel came strangers; they 
 were more numerous, had men much more bulky and more expert in war than 
 Israel had; yet all this shall not prevent their being cast out before 
 Israel. The strength of Israel's enemies magnifies the power of 
 Israel's God, who will certainly be too hard for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He engages them to do their part. Thou shalt <I>smite them, and 
 utterly destroy them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 If God cast them out, Israel must not take them in, no, not as tenants, 
 nor tributaries, nor servants. Not covenant of any kind must be made 
 with them, no mercy must be shown them. This severity was appointed, 
 
 [1.] By way of punishment for the wickedness they and their fathers had
 been guilty of. The iniquity of the Amorites was now full, and the 
 longer it had been in the filling the sorer was the vengeance when it 
 came at last. 

 [2.] In order to prevent the mischiefs they would do to God's Israel if
 they were left alive. The people of these abominations must not be 
 mingled with the holy seed, lest they corrupt them. Better that all 
 these lives should be lost from the earth than that religion and the 
 true worship of God should be lost in Israel. Thus we must deal with 
 our lusts that was against our souls; God has delivered them into our 
 hands by that promise, <I>Sin shall not have dominion over you,</I> 
 unless it be your own faults; let not us them make covenants with them, 
 nor show them any mercy, but mortify and crucify them, and utterly 
 destroy them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must make no marriages with those of them that escaped the 
 sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The families of the Canaanites were ancient, and it is probable that 
 some of them were called <I>honourable,</I> which might be a temptation 
 to the Israelites, especially those of them that were of least note in 
 their tribes, to court an alliance with them, to ennoble their blood; 
 and the rather because their acquaintance with the country might be 
 serviceable to them in the improvement of it: but religion, and the 
 fear of God, must overrule all these considerations. To intermarry
 with them was <I>therefore</I> unlawful, because it was dangerous; this 
 very thing had proved of fatal consequence to the old world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:2">Gen. vi. 2</A>),

 and thousands in the world that now is have been undone by irreligious
 ungodly marriages; for there is more ground of fear in mixed marriages 
 that the good will be perverted than of hope that the bad will be 
 converted. The event proved the reasonableness of this warning: <I>They 
 will turn away thy son from following me.</I> Solomon paid dearly for 
 his folly herein. We find a national repentance for this sin of 
 marrying strange wives, and care taken to reform

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:1-10:44,Ne+13:1-31">Ezra ix. x., and Neh. xiii.</A>),

 and a New-Testament caution not to be <I>unequally yoked with
 unbelievers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14">2 Cor. vi. 14</A>.

 Those that in choosing yokefellows keep not at least within the bounds
 of a justifiable profession of religion cannot promise themselves helps 
 meet for them. One of the Chaldee paraphrases adds here, as a reason
 of this command

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>For he that marries with idolaters does in effect marry with their
 idols.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They must destroy all the relics of their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Their altars and pillars, their groves and graven images, all must be 
 destroyed, both in a holy indignation against idolatry and to prevent 
 infection. This command was given before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:24,34:13">Exod. xxiii. 24; xxxiv. 13</A>.

 A great deal of good work of this kind was done by the people, in their
 pious zeal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+31:1">2 Chron. xxxi. 1</A>),
 
 and by good Josiah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:3,7">2 Chron. xxxiv. 3, 7</A>),

 and with this may be compared the burning of the conjuring books, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:19">Acts xix. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are very good reasons to enforce this caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The choice which God had made of this people for his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 There was such a covenant and communion established between God and 
 Israel as was not between him and any other people in the world. Shall 
 they by their idolatries dishonour him who had thus honoured them? 
 Shall they slight him who had thus testified his kindness for them? 
 Shall they put themselves upon the level with other people, when God 
 had thus dignified and advanced them above all people? Had God taken 
 them to be a special people to him, and no other but them, and will not 
 they take God to be a special God to them, and no other but him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The freeness of that grace which made this choice. 

 (1.) There was nothing in them to recommend or entitle them to this
 favour. <I>In multitude of the people is the king's honour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:28">Prov. xiv. 28</A>.

 But their number was inconsiderable; they were only seventy souls when
 they went down into Egypt, and, though greatly increased there, yet 
 there were many other nations more numerous: <I>You were the fewest of 
 all people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The author of the Jerusalem Targum passes too great a compliment upon 
 his nation in his reading this, <I>You were humble in spirit, and meek 
 above all people;</I> quite contrary: they were rather stiff-necked and 
 ill-natured above all people.

 (2.) God fetched the reason of it purely from himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 [1.] He loved you <I>because he would love you.</I> Even so, Father, 
 because it seemed good in thy eyes. All that God loves he loves freely, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+14:4">Hos. xiv. 4</A>.

 Those that perish perish by their own merits, but all that are saved
 are saved by prerogative.

 [2.] He has done his work because he would keep his word. "He has
 brought you out of Egypt in pursuance of the oath sworn to your 
 fathers." Nothing in them, or done by them, did or could make God a 
 debtor to them; but he had made himself a debtor to his own promise, 
 which he would perform notwithstanding their unworthiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The tenour of the covenant into which they were taken; it was in 
 short this, That as they were to God so God would be to them. They 
 should certainly find him, 

 (1.) Kind to his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 "The Lord thy God is not like the gods of the nations, the creatures of 
 fancy, subjects fit enough for loose poetry, but no proper objects of 
 serious devotion; no, he is God, God indeed, God alone, the faithful 
 God, able and ready not only to fulfil his own promises, but to answer 
 all the just expectations of his worshippers, and he will certainly 
 keep covenant and mercy," that is, "show mercy according to covenant, 
 to <I>those that love him and keep his commandments</I>" (and in vain 
 do we pretend to love him if we do not make conscience of his 
 commandments); "and this" (as is here added for the explication of the 
 promise in the second commandment) "not only to thousands of persons, 
 but to thousands of generations--so inexhaustible is the fountain, so 
 constant are the streams!"

 (2.) Just to his enemies: He <I>repays those that hate him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Note, 

 [1.] Wilful sinners are haters of God; for the carnal mind is enmity 
 against him. Idolaters are so in a special manner, for they are in 
 league with his rivals. 

 [2.] Those that hate God cannot hurt him, but certainly ruin
 themselves. He will repay them to their face, in defiance of them and 
 all their impotent malice. His arrows are said to be <I>made ready
 against the face of them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:12">Ps. xxi. 12</A>.

 Or, He will bring those judgments upon them which shall appear to
 themselves to be the just punishment of their idolatry. Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:9">Job xxi. 19</A>,

 <I>He rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</I> Though vengeance seem to
 be slow, yet it is not slack. The wicked and sinner shall be 
 <I>recompensed in the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:31">Prov. xi. 31</A>.

 I cannot pass the gloss of the Jerusalem Targum upon this place,
 because it speaks the faith of the Jewish church concerning a future 
 state: <I>He recompenses to those that hate him the reward of their 
 good works in this world, that he may destroy them in the world to 
 come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
 judgments, and keep, and do them, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall
 keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy
 fathers:
 &nbsp; 13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
 will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land,
 thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine,
 and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy
 fathers to give thee.
 &nbsp; 14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
 male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will take away from thee all sickness, and will
 put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon
 thee; but will lay them upon all <I>them</I> that hate thee.
 &nbsp; 16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
 neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that <I>will be</I> a snare
 unto thee.
 &nbsp; 17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations <I>are</I> more
 than I; how can I dispossess them?
 &nbsp; 18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: <I>but</I> shalt well remember
 what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;
 &nbsp; 19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs,
 and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
 whereby the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God brought thee out: so shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.
 &nbsp; 20 Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will send the hornet among them,
 until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 <I>is</I> among you, a mighty God and terrible.
 &nbsp; 22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will put out those nations before thee
 by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
 the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
 &nbsp; 23 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
 destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.
 &nbsp; 24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
 shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be
 able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
 &nbsp; 25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire:
 thou shalt not desire the silver or gold <I>that is</I> on them, nor
 take <I>it</I> unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it <I>is</I> an
 abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house,
 lest thou be a cursed thing like it: <I>but</I> thou shalt utterly
 detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it <I>is</I> a cursed
 thing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The caution against idolatry is repeated, and against communion with 
 idolaters: "Thou shalt consume the people, and not serve their gods."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 We are in danger of having fellowship with the works of darkness if we 
 take pleasure in fellowship with those that do those works. Here is 
 also a repetition of the charge to destroy the images, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 The idols which the heathen had worshipped were an abomination to God, 
 and therefore must be so to them: all that truly love God hat what he 
 hates. Observe how this is urged upon them: <I>Thou shalt utterly 
 detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it;</I> such a holy indignation 
 as this must we conceive against sin, that <I>abominable thing which 
 the Lord hates.</I> They must not retain the images to gratify their 
 covetousness: <I>Thou shalt not desire the silver nor gold that is on 
 them,</I> nor think it a pity to have that destroyed. Achan paid dearly 
 for converting that to his own use which was an anathema. Nor must they 
 retain them to gratify their curiosity: "Neither shalt thou bring it 
 into thy house, to be hung up as an ornament, or preserved as a 
 monument of antiquity. No, to the fire with it, that is the fittest 
 place for it." Two reasons are given for this caution:--

 1. <I>Lest thou be snared therein</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 that is, "Lest thou be drawn, ere thou art aware, to like it and love
 it, to fancy it and pay respect to it" 

 2. <I>Lest thou be a cursed thing like it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Those that make images are said to be like the, stupid and senseless; 
 here they are said to be in a worse sense like them, accursed of God 
 and devoted to destruction. Compare these two reasons together, and 
 observe that whatever brings us into a snare brings us under a 
 curse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promise of God's favour to them, if they would be obedient, is 
 enlarged upon with a most affecting copiousness and fluency of 
 expression, which intimates how much it is both God's desire and our 
 own interest that we be religious. All possible assurance is here given 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That, if they would sincerely endeavour to do their part of the 
 covenant, God would certainly perform his part. He shall <I>keep the 
 mercy which he swore to thy fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Let us be constant in our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of 
 God's mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That if they would love God and serve him, and devote themselves and 
 theirs to him, he would love them, and bless them, and multiply them 
 greatly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 
 What could they desire more to make them happy?
 
 (1.) "<I>He will love thee.</I>" He began in love to us
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:10">1 John iv. 10</A>),
 
 and, if we return his love in filial duty, then, and then only, we may
 expect the continuance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:21">John xiv. 21</A>.

 (2.) "He will bless thee with the tokens of his love above all people." 
 If they would distinguish themselves from their neighbours by singular 
 services, God would dignify them above their neighbours by singular 
 blessings.

 (3.) "He will <I>multiply thee.</I>" Increase was the ancient blessing 
 for the peopling of the world, once and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28,9:1">Gen. i. 28; ix. 1</A>),

 and here for the peopling of Canaan, that little world by itself. The
 increase both of their families and of their stock is promised: they 
 should neither have estates without heirs nor heirs without estates, 
 but should have the complete satisfaction of having many children and 
 plentiful provisions and portions for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, if they would keep themselves pure from the idolatries of 
 Egypt, God would keep them clear form the <I>diseases of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It seems to refer not only to those plagues of Egypt by the force of 
 which they were delivered, but to some other epidemical country disease 
 (as we call it), which they remembered the prevalency of among the 
 Egyptians, and by which God had chastised them for their national sins. 
 Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what 
 he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies to
 mortify the sin of our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That, if they <I>would</I> cut off the devoted nations, they 
 <I>should</I> cut them off, and none should be able to stand before 
 them. Their duty in this matter would itself be their advantage: 
 <I>Thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall 
 deliver thee</I>--this is the precept
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 and <I>the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy
 them</I>--this is the promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Thus we are commanded not to let sin reign, not to indulge ourselves in 
 it nor give countenance to it, but to hate it and strive against it; 
 and then God has promised that <I>sin shall not have dominion over 
 us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:12,14">Rom. vi. 12, 14</A>),

 but that we shall be more than conquerors over it. The difficulty and
 doubtfulness of the conquest of Canaan having been a stone of stumbling 
 to their fathers, Moses here animates them against those things which 
 were most likely to discourage them, bidding them not to be <I>afraid 
 of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 (1.) Let them not be disheartened by the number and strength of their
 enemies: <I>Say not, They are more than I, how can I dispossess 
 them?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 We are apt to think that the most numerous must needs be victorious: 
 but, to fortify Israel against this temptation, Moses reminds them of 
 the destruction of Pharaoh and all the power of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 They had seen the great <I>temptations,</I> or <I>miracles</I> (so the 
 Chaldee reads it), the signs and wonders, wherewith God had brought 
 them out of Egypt, in order to his bringing them into Canaan, and 
 thence might easily infer that God <I>could</I> dispossess the 
 Canaanites (who, though formidable enough, had not such advantages 
 against Israel as the Egyptians had; he that had done the greater could 
 do the less), and that he <I>would</I> dispossess them, otherwise his 
 bringing Israel out of Egypt had been no kindness to them. He that 
 begun would finish. Thou shalt therefore <I>well remember</I> this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The word and works of God are well remembered when they are improved as 
 helps to our faith and obedience. That is well laid up which is ready 
 to us when we have occasion to use it.

 (2.) Let them not be disheartened by the weakness and deficiency of
 their own forces; for God will send them in auxiliary troops of 
 <I>hornets,</I> or <I>wasps,</I> as some read it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 probably larger than ordinary, which would so terrify and molest their
 enemies (and perhaps be the death of many to them) that their most 
 numerous armies would become an easy prey to Israel. God plagued the 
 Egyptians with flies, but the Canaanites with hornets. Those who take 
 not warning by less judgments on others may expect greater on 
 themselves. But the great encouragement of Israel was that they had God 
 among them, a <I>mighty God and terrible,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And if God be for us, if God be with us, we need not fear the power of 
 any creature against us.

 (3.) Let them not be disheartened by the slow progress of their arms,
 nor think that the Canaanites would never be subdued if they were not 
 expelled the first year; no, they must be <I>put out by little and 
 little,</I> and not <I>all at once,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, We must not think that, because the deliverance of the church and
 the destruction of its enemies are not effected immediately, therefore 
 they will never be effected. God will do his own work in his own method 
 and time, and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus 
 corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers <I>by little and 
 little.</I> The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but 
 that judgment will at length be brought forth into a complete victory. 
 The reason here given (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29,30">Exod. xxiii. 29, 30</A>)

 is, <I>Lest the beast of the field increase upon thee.</I> The earth
 God has given to the children of men; and therefore there shall rather 
 be a remainder of Canaanites to keep possession till Israel become 
 numerous enough to replenish it than that it should be a habitation of 
 dragons, and a court for <I>the wild beasts of the desert,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:13,14">Isa. xxxiv. 13, 14</A>.

 Yet God could have prevented this mischief from the beasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:6">Lev. xxvi. 6</A>.
 
 But pride and security, and other sins that are the common effects of a
 settled prosperity, were enemies more dangerous than the beasts of the 
 field, and these would be apt to increase upon them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:1,4">Judges iii. 1, 4</A>.</P>
