 God having in the foregoing chapter intimated to Moses his
 reconciliation to Israel, here gives proofs of it, proceeding to settle
 his covenant and communion with them. Four instances of the return of
 his favour we have in this chapter:--

 I. The orders he gives to Moses to come up to the mount, the next
 morning, and bring two tables of stone with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. His meeting him there, and the proclamation of his name,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. The instructions he gave him there, and his converse with him for
 forty days together, without intermission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:10-28">ver. 10-28</A>. 

 IV. The honour he put upon him when he sent him down with his face
 shining, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:29-35">ver. 29-35</A>.

 In all this God dealt with Moses as a public person, and mediator
 between him and Israel, and a type of the great Mediator.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
 like unto the first: and I will write upon <I>these</I> tables the
 words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.
 &nbsp; 2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
 mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
 mount.
 &nbsp; 3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
 seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds
 feed before that mount.
 &nbsp; 4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
 Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai,
 as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded him, and took in his hand the two
 tables of stone.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The treaty that was on foot between God and Israel being broken off 
 abruptly, by their worshipping the golden calf, when peace was made all 
 must be begun anew, not where they left off, but from the beginning. 
 Thus backsliders must <I>repent, and do their first works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5">Rev. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Moses must prepare for the renewing of the tables, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Before, God himself provided the tables, and wrote on them; now, Moses 
 must <I>hew out the tables,</I> and God would only write upon them. 
 Thus, in the first writing of the law upon the heart of man in 
 innocency, both the tables and the writing were the work of God; but 
 when those were broken and defaced by sin, and the divine law was to be 
 preserved in the scriptures, God therein made use of the ministry of 
 man, and Moses first. But the prophets and apostles did only hew the 
 tables, as it were; the writing was God's still, for <I>all scripture 
 is given by inspiration of God.</I> Observe, When God was reconciled to 
 them, he ordered the tables to be renewed, and wrote his law in them, 
 which plainly intimates to us,

 1. That even under the gospel of peace and reconciliation by Christ (of
 which the intercession of Moses was typical) the moral law should 
 continue to bind believers. Though Christ has redeemed us from the 
 curse of the law, yet not from the command of it, but still we are 
 <I>under the law to Christ;</I> when our Saviour, in his sermon on the 
 mount, expounded the moral law, and vindicated it from the corrupt 
 glosses with which the scribes and Pharisees had broken it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:19">Matt. v. 19</A>),

 he did in effect renew the tables, and make them like the first, that
 is, reduce the law to its primitive sense and intention.

 2.  That the best evidence of the pardon of sin and peace with God is 
 the writing of the law in the heart. The first token God gave of his 
 reconciliation to Israel was the renewing of the tables of the law; 
 thus the first article of the new covenant is, <I>I will write my law 
 in their heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:10">Heb. viii. 10</A>),

 and it follows
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.</I>

 3. That, if we would have God to write the law in our hearts, we must 
 prepare our hearts for the reception of it. The heart of stone must be 
 hewn by conviction and humiliation for sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:5">Hos. vi. 5</A>),

 the <I>superfluity of naughtiness</I> must be taken off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:21">James i. 21</A>),

 the heart made smooth, and laboured with, that the word may have a
 place in it. Moses did accordingly hew out the <I>tables of stone,</I> 
 or slate, for they were so slight and thin that Moses carried them both 
 in his hand; and, for their dimensions, they must have been somewhat 
 less, and perhaps not much, than the ark in which they were deposited, 
 which was a yard and quarter long, and three quarters broad. It should 
 seem there was nothing particularly curious in the framing of them, for 
 there was no great time taken; Moses had them ready presently, to take 
 up with him, next morning. They were to receive their beauty, not from 
 the art of man, but from the finger of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses must attend again on the top of mount Sinai, and present 
 himself to God there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Though the absence of Moses, and his continuance so long on the mount, 
 had lately occasioned their making the golden calf, yet God did not 
 therefore alter his measures, but he shall come up and tarry as long as 
 he had done, to try whether they had learned to wait. To strike an awe 
 upon the people, they are directed to keep their distance, none must 
 come up with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 1</A>),

 <I>We know not what has become of him,</I> and God will not let them
 know.  Moses, accordingly, <I>rose up early</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 to go to the place appointed, to show how forward he was to present 
 himself before God and loth to lose time. It is good to be early at our 
 devotions. The morning is perhaps as good a friend to the graces as it 
 is to the muses.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> descended in the cloud, and stood with him
 there, and proclaimed the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant
 in goodness and truth,
 &nbsp; 7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
 transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear <I>the
 guilty;</I> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
 and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the
 fourth <I>generation.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth,
 and worshipped.
 &nbsp; 9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord,
 let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it <I>is</I> a stiffnecked
 people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
 thine inheritance.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 No sooner had Moses got to the top of the mount than God gave him the 
 meeting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The Lord descended,</I> by some sensible token of his presence, and 
 manifestation of his glory. His descending bespeaks his condescension; 
 he humbles himself to take cognizance of those that humble themselves 
 to walk with him. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:6">Ps. cxiii. 6</A>,

 <I>Lord, what is man, that he should be thus visited?</I> He descended
 <I>in the cloud,</I> probably that pillar of cloud which had hitherto 
 gone before Israel, and had the day before met Moses at the door of the 
 tabernacle. This cloud was to strike an awe upon Moses, that the 
 familiarity he was admitted to might not breed contempt. The disciples 
 <I>feared, when they entered the cloud.</I> His making a cloud his 
 pavilion intimated that, though he made known much of himself, yet 
 there was much more concealed. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God proclaimed his name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 he did it <I>in transitu--as he passed by him.</I> Fixed views of God 
 are reserved for the future state; the best we have in this world are 
 transient. God now was performing what he had promised Moses, the day 
 before, that his glory should pass by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:22"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 22</A>.

 He <I>proclaimed the name of the Lord,</I> by which he would make
 himself known. He had made himself known to Moses in the glory of his 
 self-existence and self-sufficiency when he proclaimed that name, <I>I 
 am that I am;</I> now he makes himself known in the glory of his grace, 
 and goodness, and all-sufficiency to us. Now that God is about to 
 publish a second edition of the law he prefaces it with this 
 proclamation; for it is God's grace or goodness that gives the law, 
 especially the remedial law. The pardon of Israel's sin in worshipping 
 the calf was now to pass the seals; and God, by this declaration, would 
 let them know that he pardoned <I>ex mero motu--merely out of his own 
 good pleasure,</I> not for their merits' sake, but from his own 
 inclination to forgive. The proclaiming of it denotes the universal 
 extent of God's mercy. He is not only good to Israel, but good to all; 
 let all take notice of it. He that hath an ear, let him hear, and know, 
 and believe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the God with whom we have to do is a great God. He is Jehovah, 
 the Lord, who has his being of himself, and is the fountain of all 
 being, <I>Jehovah-El, the Lord, the strong God,</I> a God of almighty 
 power himself, and the original of all power. This is prefixed before
 the display of his mercy, to teach us to think and to speak even of 
 God's grace and goodness with great seriousness and a holy awe, and to 
 encourage us to depend upon these mercies; they are not the mercies of 
 a man, that is frail and feeble, false and fickle, but the mercies of 
 the Lord, the Lord God; therefore sure mercies, and sovereign mercies, 
 mercies that may be trusted, but not tempted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he is a good God. His greatness and goodness illustrate and set 
 off each other. That the terror of his greatness may not make us 
 afraid, we are told how good he is; and, that we may not presume upon 
 his goodness, we are told how great he is. Many words are here heaped
 up, to acquaint us with, and convince us of, God's goodness, and to 
 show how much his goodness is both his glory and his delight, yet 
 without any tautology. 

 (1.) He is <I>merciful.</I> This bespeaks his tender compassion, like 
 that of a father to his children. This is put first, because it is the 
 first wheel in all the instances of God's good-will to fallen man, 
 whose misery makes him an object of pity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16,Isa+63:9">Judg. x. 16; Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.

 Let us not then have either hard thoughts of God or hard hearts towards
 our brethren.

 (2.) He is <I>gracious.</I> This bespeaks both freeness and kindness; 
 it intimates not only that he has a compassion to his creatures, but a 
 complacency in them and in doing good to them, and this of his own 
 good-will, and not for the sake of any thing in them.  His mercy is 
 grace, free grace; this teaches us to be not only pitiful, but 
 courteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:8">1 Pet. iii. 8</A>.

 (3.) He is <I>long-suffering.</I> This is a branch of God's goodness 
 which the wickedness of sinners gives occasion for; that of Israel had 
 done so: they had tried his patience, and experienced it. He is 
 long-suffering, that is, he is slow to anger, and delays the execution 
 of his justice; he waits to be gracious, and lengthens out the offers 
 of his mercy.  

 (4.) He is <I>abundant in goodness and truth.</I> This bespeaks
 plentiful goodness, goodness abounding above our deserts, above our 
 conception and expression. The springs of mercy are always full, the 
 streams of mercy always flowing; there is mercy enough in God, enough 
 for all, enough for each, enough for ever. It bespeaks promised 
 goodness, goodness and truth put together, goodness engaged by promise, 
 and his faithfulness pledged for the security of it. He not only does 
 good, but by his promise he raises our expectation of it, and even 
 binds himself to show mercy. 

 (5.) He keepeth <I>mercy for thousands.</I> This denotes,

 [1.] Mercy extended to thousands of persons. When he gives to some, 
 still he keeps for others, and is never exhausted; he has mercy enough 
 for all the thousands of Israel, when they shall <I>multiply as the 
 sand.</I> 

 [2.] Mercy entailed upon thousands of generations, even those upon whom 
 the ends of the world have come; nay, the line of it is drawn parallel 
 with that of eternity itself. 

 (6.) He <I>for giveth iniquity, transgression, and sin.</I> Pardoning
 mercy is specified, because in this divine grace is most magnified, and 
 because in this divine grace is most magnified, and because it is this 
 which opens the door to all other gifts of his divine grace, and 
 because of this he had lately given a very pregnant proof. He forgives 
 offences of all sorts--<I>iniquity, transgression, and sin,</I> 
 multiplies his pardons; and with him is <I>plenteous 
 redemption.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he is a just and holy God. For, 

 (1.) <I>He will by no means clear the guilty.</I> Some read it so as to 
 express a mitigation of wrath, even when he does punish: <I>When he 
 empties, he will not make quite desolate;</I> that is, "He does not 
 proceed to the greatest extremity, till there be no remedy." As we read 
 it, we must expound it that he will by no means connive at the guilty, 
 as if he took no notice of their sin. Or, he will not clear the 
 impenitently guilty, that go on still in their trespasses: he will not 
 clear the guilty without some satisfaction to his justice, and 
 necessary vindications of the honour of his government. 

 (2.) <I>He visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children.</I> He 
 may justly do it, for all souls are his, and there is a malignity in 
 sin that taints the blood. He sometimes will do it, especially for the 
 punishment of idolaters. Thus he shows his hatred to sin, and 
 displeasure against it; yet he <I>keepeth not his anger for ever,</I> 
 but visits to the third and fourth generation only, while he <I>keepeth 
 his mercy for thousands.</I> Well, this is God's name for ever, and 
 this is his memorial unto all generations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How Moses received this declaration which God made of himself, and 
 of his grace and mercy. It should seem as if Moses accepted this as a 
 sufficient answer to his request that God would <I>show him his 
 glory;</I> for we read not that he went into the cleft of the rock, 
 whence to gain a sight of God's back parts. Perhaps this satisfied him, 
 and he desired no more; as we read not that Thomas did <I>thrust his 
 hand into Christ's side,</I> though Christ invited him to do it. God 
 having thus proclaimed his name, Moses says, "It is enough, I expect no 
 more till I come to heaven;" at least he did not think fit to relate 
 what he saw. Now we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What impression it made upon him: <I>Moses made haste, and bowed his 
 head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Thus he expressed,

 (1.) His humble reverence and adoration of God's glory, giving him 
 <I>the honour due to that name</I> he had thus proclaimed. Even the 
 goodness of God must be looked upon by us with a profound veneration 
 and holy awe. 

 (2.) His joy in this discovery which God had made of himself, and his 
 thankfulness for it.  We have reason gratefully to acknowledge God's 
 goodness to us, not only in the real instances of it, but in the 
 declarations he has made of it by his word; not only that he is, and 
 will be, gracious to us, but that he is pleased to let us know it. 

 (3.) His holy submission to the will of God, made known in this 
 declaration, subscribing to his justice as well as mercy, and putting 
 himself and his people Israel under the government and direction of 
 such a God as Jehovah had now proclaimed himself to be. Let this God be 
 our God for ever and ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What improvement he made of it. He immediately grounded a prayer 
 upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 
 and a more earnest affectionate prayer it is,

 (1.) For the presence of God with his people Israel in the wilderness: 
 "<I>I pray thee, go among us,</I> for thy presence is all in all to our 
 safety and success." 

 (2.) For pardon of sin: "<I>O pardon our iniquity and our sin,</I> else 
 we cannot expect thee to go among us." And, 

 (3.) For the privileges of a peculiar people: "Take us for <I>thy 
 inheritance,</I> which thou wilt have a particular eye to, and concern 
 for, and delight in." These things God had already promised, and given 
 Moses assurances of, and yet he prays for them, not as doubting the 
 sincerity of God's grants, but as one solicitous for the ratification 
 of them. God's promises are intended, not to supersede, but to direct 
 and encourage, prayer. Those who have some good hopes, through grace, 
 that their sins are pardoned, must yet continue to pray for pardon, for 
 the renewing of their pardon, and the clearing of it more and more to 
 their souls. The more we see of God's goodness the more ashamed we 
 should be of our own sins, and the more earnest for an interest in it.  
 God had said, in the close of the proclamation, that he would <I>visit 
 the iniquity upon the children;</I> and Moses here deprecates that.  
 "Lord, do not only pardon it to them, but to their children, and let 
 our covenant-relation to thee be entailed upon our posterity, as an 
 inheritance." Thus Moses, like a man of a truly public spirit, 
 intercedes even for the children that should be born. But it is a 
 strange plea he urges: <I>For it is a stiff-necked people.</I> God had 
 given this as a reason why he would not go along with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:3"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 3</A>.

 "Yea," says Moses, "the rather go along with us; for the worse they are
 the more need they have of thy presence and grace to make them better." 
 Moses sees them so stiff-necked that, for his part, he has neither 
 patience nor power enough to deal with them. "Therefore, Lord, do thou 
 go among us, else they will never be kept in awe. Thou wilt spare, and 
 bear with them, for thou art <I>God, and not man,</I>"

 Reconciliation being made, a covenant of friendship is here settled 
 between God and Israel. The traitors are not only pardoned, but 
 preferred and made favourites again. Well may the assurances of this be 
 ushered in with a <I>behold,</I> a word commanding attention and 
 admiration: <I>Behold, I make a covenant.</I> When the covenant was 
 broken, it was Israel that broke it; now that it comes to be renewed, 
 it is God that makes it. If there be quarrels, we must bear all the 
 blame; if there be peace, God must have all the glory. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's part of this covenant, what he would do for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 1. In general: <I>Before all thy people, I will do marvels.</I> Note, 
 Covenant-blessings are marvellous things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:1">Ps. xcviii. 1</A>),

 marvels in the kingdom of grace; those mentioned here were marvels in
 the kingdom of nature, the drying up of Jordan, the standing still of 
 the sun, &c.  Marvels indeed, for they were without precedent, <I>such 
 as have not been done in all the earth.</I> They were the joy of 
 Israel, and the confirmation of their faith: <I>Thy people shall 
 see,</I> and own <I>the work of the Lord.</I> And they were the terror 
 of their enemies: <I>It is a terrible thing that I will do.</I> Nay, 
 even God's own people should see them with astonishment.

 2. In particular: <I>I drive out before thee the Amorite.</I> God, as 
 King of nations, plucks up some, to plant others, as it pleases him; as 
 King of saints, he made room for the vine he brought out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8,9">Ps. lxxx. 8, 9</A>.

 Kingdoms are sacrificed to Israel's interests,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their part of the covenant: <I>Observe that which I command 
 thee.</I> We cannot expect the benefit of the promises unless we make 
 conscience of the precepts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The two great precepts are, 

 (1.) <I>Thou shalt worship no other gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 not give divine honour to any creature, or any name whatsoever, the 
 creature of fancy. A good reason is annexed. It is at thy peril if thou 
 do: <I>For the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God,</I> as 
 tender in the matters of his worship as the husband is of the honour of 
 the marriage-bed. Jealousy is called the <I>rage of a man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:34">Prov. vi. 34</A>),

 but it is <I>God's holy and just displeasure.</I> Those cannot worship
 God aright who do not worship him alone.

 (2.) "<I>Thou shalt make thee no molten god</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 thou shalt not worship the true God by images." This was the sin they 
 had lately fallen into, which therefore they are particularly cautioned 
 against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Fences are here erected about these two precepts by two others: 

 (1.) That they might not be tempted to worship other gods, they must 
 not join in affinity or friendship with those that did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 "<I>Take heed to thyself,</I> for thou art upon thy good behaviour. It 
 is a sin that thou art prone to and that will easily beset thee, and 
 therefore be very cautious, and carefully abstain from all appearances 
 of it and advances towards it. <I>Make no covenant with the inhabitants 
 of the land.</I>" If God, in kindness to them, drove out the 
 Canaanites, they ought, in duty to God, not to harbour them. What could 
 be insisted on more reasonable than this? If God make war with the 
 Canaanites, let not Israel make peace with them. If God take care that 
 the Canaanites be not their lords, let them take care that they be not 
 their snares. It was for their civil interest to complete the conquest 
 of the land; so much does God consult our benefit in the laws he gives 
 us. They must particularly take heed of intermarrying with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 If they espoused their children, they would be in danger of espousing 
 their gods; such is the corruption of nature that the bad are much more 
 likely to debauch the good than the good to reform the bad.  The way of 
 sin is downhill: those that are in league with idolaters will come by 
 degrees to be in love with idolatry; and those that are prevailed upon 
 to eat of the idolatrous sacrifice will come at length to offer it.  
 <I>Obsta principiis--Nip the mischief in the bud.</I>

 (2.) That they might not be tempted to make molten gods, they must
 utterly destroy those they found and all that belong to them, the 
 altars and groves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 lest, if these were left standing, they should be brought, in process 
 of time, either to use them or to take pattern by them, or to abate in 
 their detestation and dread of idolatry. The relics of idolatry ought 
 to be abolished as affronts to the holy God and a great reproach to 
 human nature. Let it never be said that men who pretend to reason were 
 ever guilty of such absurdities as to make gods of their own and 
 worship them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days
 thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
 of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 19 All that openeth the matrix <I>is</I> mine; and every firstling
 among thy cattle, <I>whether</I> ox or sheep, <I>that is male.</I>
 &nbsp; 20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb:
 and if thou redeem <I>him</I> not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
 the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
 appear before me empty.
 &nbsp; 21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
 rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
 &nbsp; 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the
 firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the
 year's end.
 &nbsp; 23 Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before
 the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, the God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
 borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt
 go up to appear before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God thrice in the year.
 &nbsp; 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
 neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left
 unto the morning.
 &nbsp; 26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring
 unto the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
 in his mother's milk.
 &nbsp; 27 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
 after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee
 and with Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a repetition of several appointments made before, especially 
 relating to their solemn feasts. When they had made the calf, they 
 proclaimed a feast in honour of it; now, that they might never do so 
 again, they are here charged with the observance of the feasts which 
 God had instituted. Note, Men need not be drawn from their religion by 
 the temptation of mirth, for we serve a Master that has abundantly 
 provided for the joy of his servants: serious godliness is a continual 
 feast, and joy in God always.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Once a week they must rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>even in earing time, and in harvest,</I> the most busy times of the 
 year. All worldly business must give way to that holy rest; 
 harvest-work will prosper the better for the religious observance of 
 the sabbath-day in harvest-time. Hereby we must show that we prefer our 
 communion with God, and our duty to him, before either the business or 
 the joy of harvest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Thrice a year they must feast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 they must then appear <I>before the Lord, God, the God of Israel.</I> 
 In all our religious approaches to God, we must eye him as the Lord 
 God, infinitely blessed, great, and glorious, that we may worship him 
 with reverence and godly fear, as the God of Israel, a God in covenant 
 with us, that we may be encouraged to trust in him, and to serve him 
 cheerfully. We always are before God; but, in holy duties, we present 
 ourselves before him, as servants to receive commands, as petitioners 
 to sue for favours, and we have reason to do both with joy. But it 
 might be suggested that, when all the males from every part of the 
 country had gone up to worship in the place that God should choose, the 
 country would be left exposed to the insults of their neighbours; and 
 what would become of the poor women and children, and sick and aged, 
 that were left at home? Trust God with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Neither shall any man desire thy land;</I> not only they shall not 
 invade it, but they shall not so much as think of invading it. Note,

 1. All hearts are in God's hands, and under his check; he can lay a 
 restraint, not only upon men's actions, but upon their desires. Canaan 
 was a desirable land, and the neighbouring nations were greedy enough; 
 and yet God says, "They shall not desire it." Let us check all sinful 
 desires in our own hearts against God and his glory, and then trust him 
 to check all sinful desires in the hearts of others against us and our 
 interest. 

 2. The way of duty is the way of safety. If we serve God, he will 
 preserve us; and those that venture for him shall never lose by him. 
 While we are employed in God's work, and are attending upon him, we are 
 taken under special protection, as noblemen and members of parliament 
 are privileged from arrests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The three feasts are here mentioned, with their appendages. 

 1. The passover, and the feast of unleavened bread, in remembrance of
 their deliverance out of Egypt; and to this is annexed the law of the
 redemption of the first-born, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 This feast was instituted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:13"><I>ch.</I> xii. 13</A>,

 and urged again,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:15"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 15</A>.

 2. The feast of weeks, that is, that of pentecost, seven weeks after
 the passover; and to this is annexed the law of the first-fruits.

 3.  The feast of in-gathering at the year's end, which was the feast of
 tabernacles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 of these also he had spoken before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:16"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 16</A>.

 As to those laws repeated here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 that against leaven relates to the passover, that of the first-fruits 
 to the feast of pentecost, and therefore that against seething the kid 
 in his mother's milk in all probability relates to the feast of 
 in-gathering, at which God would not have them use that superstitious 
 ceremony, which probably they had seen the Egyptians, or some other of 
 the neighbouring nations, bless their harvests with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. With these laws, here repeated, it is probable all that was said to 
 him when he was before upon the mount was repeated likewise, and the 
 model of the tabernacle shown him again, lest the ruffle and 
 discomposure, which the golden calf had put him in to should have 
 bereaved him of the ideas he had in mind of what he had seen and heard; 
 also in token of a complete reconciliation, and to show that <I>not one 
 jot or tittle of the law should pass away,</I> but that all should be 
 carefully preserved by the great Mediator, who came not to destroy, but 
 to fulfil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:17,18">Matt. v. 17, 18</A>.

 And in the close,

 1. Moses is ordered to write these words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 that the people might be the better acquainted with them by a frequent 
 perusal, and that they might be transmitted to the generations to come. 
 We can never be enough thankful to God for the written word.

 2. He is told that according to the tenour of these words God would 
 make a covenant with Moses and Israel; not with Israel immediately, but 
 with them in Moses a mediator. Thus the covenant of grace is made with 
 believers through Christ, who is <I>given for a covenant to the 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8">Isa. xlix. 8</A>.

 And, as here the covenant was made according to the tenour of the
 command, so it is still; for we are by baptism brought into covenant, 
 that we may be <I>taught to observe all things whatsoever Christ has 
 commanded us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28 And he was there with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> forty days and forty nights;
 he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
 tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
 with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
 down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
 face shone while he talked with him.
 &nbsp; 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
 behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come
 nigh him.
 &nbsp; 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
 the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
 &nbsp; 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
 gave them in commandment all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had spoken with him in
 mount Sinai.
 &nbsp; 33 And <I>till</I> Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail
 on his face.
 &nbsp; 34 But when Moses went in before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to speak with him, he
 took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake
 unto the children of Israel <I>that</I> which he was commanded.
 &nbsp; 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
 skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face
 again, until he went in to speak with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The continuance of Moses in the mount, where he was miraculously 
 sustained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He was there in very intimate communion with God, without interruption, 
 forty days and forty nights, and did not think it long. When we are 
 weary of an hour or two spent in attendance upon God and adoration of 
 him, we should think how many days and nights Moses spent with him, and 
 of the eternal day we hope to spend in praising him. During all this 
 time Moses did neither eat nor drink. Though he had before been kept so 
 long fasting, yet he did not, this second time, take up so many days' 
 provision along with him, but believed that <I>man lives not by bread 
 alone,</I> and encouraged himself with the experience he had of the 
 truth of it. So long he continued without meat and drink (and probably 
 without sleep too), for,

 1. The power of God supported him, that he did not need it. He who made 
 the body can nourish it without ordinary means, which he uses, but is 
 not tied to. <I>The life is more than meat.</I> 

 2. His communion with God entertained him, so that he did not desire 
 it. He had meat to eat which the world knew not of, for it was his meat 
 and drink to hear the word of God and pray. The abundant satisfaction 
 his soul had in the word of God and the visions of the Almighty made 
 him forget the body and the pleasures of it. When God would treat his 
 favourite Moses, it was not with meat and drink, but with his light, 
 law, and love, with the knowledge of himself and his will; then man did 
 indeed eat angels' food. See what we should value as the truest 
 pleasure. <I>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</I> neither the 
 abundance nor delicacy of food, but <I>righteousness and peace and joy 
 in the Holy Ghost.</I> As Moses, so Elijah and Christ, fasted forty 
 days and forty nights. The more dead we are to the delights of sense 
 the better prepared we are for the pleasures of heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The coming down of Moses from the mount, greatly enriched and 
 miraculously adorned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He came down enriched with the best treasure; for he brought in his 
 hands the two tables of the law, written with the finger of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 It is a great favour to have the law given us; this favour was shown to
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19,20">Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20</A>.

 It is a great honour to be employed in delivering God's law to others;
 this honour was done to Moses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He came down adorned with the best beauty; for the <I>skin of his 
 face shone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This time of his being in the mount he heard only what he had heard 
 before, but he saw more of the glory of God, which having with open 
 face beheld, he was in some measure <I>changed into the same image from 
 glory to glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 The last time he came down from the mount with the glory of a
 magistrate, to frown upon and chastise Israel's idolatry; now with the 
 glory of an angel, with tidings of peace and reconciliation. Then he 
 came with a rod, now with the spirit of meekness. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This may be looked upon, 

 [1.] As a great honour done to Moses, that the people might never again
 question his mission nor think nor speak lightly of him. He carried his 
 credentials in his very countenance, which, some think, retained, as 
 long as he lived, some remainders of this glory, which perhaps 
 contributed to the vigour of his old age; that eye could not wax dim 
 which had seen God, nor that face become wrinkled which had shone with 
 his glory. The Israelites could not look him in the face but they must 
 there read his commission.  Thus it was done to the man whom the King 
 of kings did delight to honour. Yet, after this, they murmured against 
 him; for the most sensible proofs will not of themselves conquer an 
 obstinate infidelity.  The shining of Moses's face was a great honour 
 to him; yet that was no glory, in comparison with the glory which 
 excelled. We read of our Lord Jesus, not only that <I>his face 
 shone</I> as the sun, but his whole body also, for his <I>raiment was 
 white and glistering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:29">Luke ix. 29</A>.

 But, when he came down from the mount, he quite laid aside that glory,
 it being his will that we should <I>walk by faith, not by sight.</I>

 [2.] It was also a great favour to the people, and an encouragement to 
 them, that God put this glory upon him, who was their intercessor, 
 thereby giving them assurance that he was accepted, and they through 
 him. Thus the advancement of Christ, our advocate with the Father, is 
 the great support of our faith. 

 [3.] It was the effect of his sight of God. Communion with God, 
 <I>First,</I> Makes the face to shine in true honour. Serious godliness 
 puts a lustre upon a man's countenance, such as commands esteem and 
 affection.  <I>Secondly,</I> It should make the face to shine in 
 universal holiness. When we have been in the mount with God, we should 
 let our <I>light shine before men,</I> in humility, meekness, and all 
 the instances of a heavenly conversation; thus must the <I>beauty of 
 the Lord our God be upon us,</I> even the <I>beauty of holiness,</I> 
 that all we converse with may <I>take knowledge of us that we have been 
 with Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13">Acts iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Concerning the shining of Moses's face observe here, 

 [1.] Moses was not aware of it himself: <I>He wist not that the skin of
 his face shone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Thus, <I>First,</I> It is the infelicity of some that, though their 
 faces shine in true grace, yet they do not know it, to take the comfort 
 of it. Their friends see much of God in them, but they themselves are 
 ready to think they have no grace.  <I>Secondly,</I> It is the humility 
 of others that, though their faces shine in eminent gifts and 
 usefulness, yet they do not know it, to be puffed up with it.  Whatever 
 beauty God puts upon us, we should still be filled with a humble sense 
 of our own unworthiness, and manifold infirmities, as will make us even 
 overlook and forget that which makes our faces shine.

 [2.] Aaron and the children of Israel saw it, and <I>were afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The truth of it was attested by a multitude of witnesses, who were also 
 conscious of the terror of it. It not only dazzled their eyes, but 
 struck such an awe upon them as obliged them to retire.  Probably they 
 doubted whether it were a token of God's favour or of his displeasure; 
 and, though it seemed most likely to be a good omen, yet, being 
 conscious of guilt, they feared the worst, especially remembering the 
 posture Moses found them in when he came last down from the mount.  
 Holiness will command reverence; but the sense of sin makes men afraid 
 of their friends, and even of that which really is a favour to them.

 [3.] Moses put a <I>veil upon his face,</I> when he perceived that it
 shone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:33,35"><I>v.</I> 33, 35</A>.

 <I>First,</I> This teaches us all a lesson of modesty and humility. We 
 must be content to have our excellences obscured, and a veil drawn over 
 them, not coveting to <I>make a fair show in the flesh.</I> Those that 
 are truly desirous to be owned and accepted of God will likewise desire 
 not to be taken notice of nor applauded by men. <I>Qui bene latuit, 
 bene vixit--There is a laudable concealment.  Secondly,</I> It teaches 
 ministers to accommodate themselves to the capacities of people, and to 
 preach to them as they are able to bear it. Let all that art and all 
 that learning be veiled which tend to amusement rather than 
 edification, and let the strong condescend to the infirmities of the 
 weak. <I>Thirdly,</I> This veil signified the darkness of that 
 dispensation. The ceremonial institutions had in them much of Christ, 
 much of the grace of the gospel, but a veil was drawn over it, so that 
 the children of Israel could not distinctly and <I>stedfastly see those 
 good things to come which the law had the shadow of.</I> It was beauty 
 veiled, gold in the mine, a pearl in the shell; but, thanks be to God, 
 by the gospel life and immortality are brought to light, the veil is 
 taken away from off the Old Testament; yet still it remains upon the 
 hearts of those who shut their eyes against the light. Thus the apostle 
 expounds this passage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13-15">2 Cor. iii. 13-15</A>.

 [4.] When Moses <I>went in before the Lord,</I> to speak with him in 
 the tabernacle of meeting, he <I>put off the veil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Then there was no occasion for it, and, before God, every man does and 
 must appear unveiled; for <I>all things are naked and open before the 
 eyes of him with whom we have to do,</I> and it is folly for us to 
 think of concealing or disguising any thing.  Every veil must be thrown 
 aside when we come to present ourselves unto the Lord. This signified 
 also, as it is explained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:16">2 Cor. iii. 16</A>),

 that when a soul turns to the Lord the veil shall be taken away, and
 with open face it may behold his glory. And when we shall come before 
 the Lord in heaven, to be there for ever speaking with him, the veil 
 shall not only be taken off from the divine glory, but from our hearts 
 and eyes, that we may see as we are seen, and know as we are known.</P>
