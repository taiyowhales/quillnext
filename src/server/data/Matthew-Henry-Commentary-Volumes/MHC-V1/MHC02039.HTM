 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
 service, to do service in the holy <I>place,</I> and made the holy
 garments for Aaron; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 2 And he made the ephod <I>of</I> gold, blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, and fine twined linen.
 &nbsp; 3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut <I>it
 into</I> wires, to work <I>it</I> in the blue, and in the purple, and in
 the scarlet, and in the fine linen, <I>with</I> cunning work.
 &nbsp; 4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple <I>it</I> together: by
 the two edges was it coupled together.
 &nbsp; 5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that <I>was</I> upon it,
 <I>was</I> of the same, according to the work thereof; <I>of</I> gold,
 blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
 graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, <I>that they
 should be</I> stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 8 And he made the breastplate <I>of</I> cunning work, like the work
 of the ephod; <I>of</I> gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
 twined linen.
 &nbsp; 9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
 <I>was</I> the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, <I>being</I>
 doubled.
 &nbsp; 10 And they set in it four rows of stones: <I>the first</I> row
 <I>was</I> a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this <I>was</I> the first
 row.
 &nbsp; 11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
 &nbsp; 12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
 &nbsp; 13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: <I>they
 were</I> inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
 &nbsp; 14 And the stones <I>were</I> according to the names of the children
 of Israel, twelve, according to their names, <I>like</I> the
 engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the
 twelve tribes.
 &nbsp; 15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, <I>of</I>
 wreathen work <I>of</I> pure gold.
 &nbsp; 16 And they made two ouches <I>of</I> gold, and two gold rings; and
 put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.
 &nbsp; 17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
 rings on the ends of the breastplate.
 &nbsp; 18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
 the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod,
 before it.
 &nbsp; 19 And they made two rings of gold, and put <I>them</I> on the two
 ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which <I>was</I> on
 the side of the ephod inward.
 &nbsp; 20 And they made two <I>other</I> golden rings, and put them on the
 two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it,
 over against the <I>other</I> coupling thereof, above the curious
 girdle of the ephod.
 &nbsp; 21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the
 rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above
 the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
 not be loosed from the ephod; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 22 And he made the robe of the ephod <I>of</I> woven work, all <I>of</I>
 blue.
 &nbsp; 23 And <I>there was</I> an hole in the midst of the robe, as the
 hole of an habergeon, <I>with</I> a band round about the hole, that it
 should not rend.
 &nbsp; 24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates <I>of</I>
 blue, and purple, and scarlet, <I>and</I> twined <I>linen.</I>
 &nbsp; 25 And they made bells <I>of</I> pure gold, and put the bells
 between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about
 between the pomegranates;
 &nbsp; 26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
 about the hem of the robe to minister <I>in;</I> as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 Moses.
 &nbsp; 27 And they made coats <I>of</I> fine linen <I>of</I> woven work for
 Aaron, and for his sons,
 &nbsp; 28 And a mitre <I>of</I> fine linen, and goodly bonnets <I>of</I> fine
 linen, and linen breeches <I>of</I> fine twined linen,
 &nbsp; 29 And a girdle <I>of</I> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple,
 and scarlet, <I>of</I> needlework; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 30 And they made the plate of the holy crown <I>of</I> pure gold,
 and wrote upon it a writing, <I>like to</I> the engravings of a
 signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
 &nbsp; 31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten <I>it</I> on high
 upon the mitre; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this account of the making of the priests' garments, according to 
 the instructions given (ch. 28), we may observe, 

 1. That the priests' garments are called here <I>clothes of 
 service,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, Those that wear robes of honour must look upon them as clothes of
 service; for from those upon whom honour is put service is expected. It 
 is said of those that are arrayed in white robes that they <I>are 
 before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his 
 temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:13">Rev. vii. 13, 15</A>.

 Holy garments were not made for men to sleep in, or to strut in, but to
 do service in; and then they are indeed for glory and beauty. The Son 
 of man himself <I>came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.</I> 
 
 2. That all the six paragraphs here, which give a distinct account of
 the making of these holy garments, conclude with those words, <I>as the 
 Lord commanded Moses,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:5,7,21,26,29,31"><I>v.</I> 5, 7, 21, 26, 29, 31</A>.

 The like is not in any of the foregoing accounts, as if in these, more 
 than any other of the appurtenances of the tabernacle, they had a 
 particular regard to the divine appointment, both for warrant and for 
 direction. It is an intimation to all the Lord's ministers to make the 
 word of God their rule in all their ministrations, and to act in 
 observance of and obedience to the command of God. 

 3. That these garments, in conformity to the rest of the furniture of 
 the tabernacle, were very rich and splendid; the church in its infancy 
 was thus taught, thus pleased, with the rudiments of this world; but 
 now under the gospel, which is the ministration of the Spirit, to 
 affect and impose such pompous habits as the church of Rome does, under 
 pretence of decency and instruction, is to betray <I>the liberty 
 wherewith Christ has made us free,</I> and to entangle the church again 
 in the bondage of those carnal ordinances which were imposed only till 
 the time of reformation. 

 4. That they were all shadows of good things to come, but the substance 
 is Christ, and the grace of the gospel; when therefore the substance 
 has come, it is a jest to be fond of the shadow.

 (1.) Christ is our great high-priest; when he undertook the work of our
 redemption, he put on the clothes of service--he arrayed himself with
 the gifts and graces of the Spirit, which he received not by 
 measure--girded himself with the curious girdle of resolution, to go
 through with his undertaking--charged himself with the curious girdle of
 resolution, to go through with his undertaking--charged himself with all
 God's spiritual Israel, bore them on his shoulders, carried them in his 
 bosom, laid them near his heart, engraved them on the palms of his 
 hands, and presented them in the breast-plate of judgment unto his 
 Father. And (lastly) he crowned himself with <I>holiness to the 
 Lord,</I> consecrating his whole undertaking to the honour of his 
 Father's holiness: now consider how great this man is. 

 (2.) True believers are spiritual priests. The clean linen with which
 all their clothes of service must be made is <I>the righteousness of 
 saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>),

 and <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> must be so written upon their foreheads
 that all who converse with them may see, and say, that they bear the 
 image of God's holiness, and are devoted to the praise of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
 congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according
 to all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so did they.
 &nbsp; 33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and
 all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
 pillars, and his sockets,
 &nbsp; 34 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering
 of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
 &nbsp; 35 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
 mercy seat,
 &nbsp; 36 The table, <I>and</I> all the vessels thereof, and the showbread,
 &nbsp; 37 The pure candlestick, <I>with</I> the lamps thereof, <I>even with</I>
 the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and
 the oil for light,
 &nbsp; 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
 incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,
 &nbsp; 39 The brazen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and
 all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
 &nbsp; 40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
 the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all
 the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the
 congregation,
 &nbsp; 41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy <I>place,</I> and
 the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments,
 to minister in the priest's office.
 &nbsp; 42 According to all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so the
 children of Israel made all the work.
 &nbsp; 43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
 done it as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded, even so had they done it: and
 Moses blessed them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. The builders of the tabernacle made very good despatch. It was not 
 much more than five months from the beginning to the finishing of it. 
 Though there was a great deal of fine work about it, such as is usually 
 the work of time, embroidering and engraving, not only in gold, but in 
 precious stones, yet they went through with it in a little time. 
 Church-work is usually slow work, but they made quick work of this, and 
 yet did it with the greatest exactness imaginable. For,

 1. Many hands were employed, all unanimous, and not striving with each 
 other. This expedited the business, and made it easy. 

 2. The workmen were taught of God, and so were kept from making 
 blunders, which would have retarded them. 

 3. The people were hearty and zealous in the work, and impatient till 
 it was finished. God had prepared their hearts, and then <I>the thing 
 was done suddenly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:36">2 Chron. xxix. 36</A>.

 Resolution and industry, and a cheerful application of mind, will, by 
 the grace of God, bring a great deal of good work to pass in a little 
 time, in less than one would expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They punctually observed their orders, and did not in the least 
 vary from them. They did it <I>according to all that the Lord commanded 
 Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:32,42"><I>v.</I> 32, 42</A>.

 Note, God's work must be done, in every thing, according to his own 
 will. His institutions neither need nor admit men's inventions to make 
 them either more beautiful or more likely to answer the intention of 
 them. <I>Add thou not unto his words.</I> God is pleased with willing 
 worship, but not with will-worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They brought all their work to Moses, and submitted it to his 
 inspection and censure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 He knew what he had ordered them to make; and now the particulars were 
 called over, and all produced, that Moses might see both that they had 
 made all, omitting nothing, and that they had made all according to the 
 instructions given them, and that, if they had made a mistake in any 
 thing, it might be forthwith rectified. Thus they showed respect to 
 Moses, who was set over them in the Lord; not objecting that Moses did 
 not understand such work, and therefore that there was no reason for 
 submitting it to his judgment. No, that God who gave them so much
 knowledge as to do the work gave them also so much humility as to be 
 willing to have it examined and compared with the model. Moses was in 
 authority, and they would pay a deference to his place. <I>The spirit 
 of the prophets is subject to the prophets.</I> And besides, though 
 they knew how to do the work better than Moses, Moses had a better and 
 more exact idea of the model than they had, and therefore they could 
 not be well pleased with their own work, unless they had his 
 approbation. Thus in all the services of religion we should <I>labour 
 to be accepted of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Moses, upon search, found all done according to the rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Moses, both for their satisfaction and for his own, did look upon all 
 the work, piece by piece, and behold they had done it according to the 
 pattern shown him, for the same Being that showed him the pattern 
 guided their hand in the work. All the copies of God's grace exactly 
 agree with the original of his counsels: what God works in us, and by 
 us, is the fulfilling of the good pleasure of his own goodness; and 
 when the mystery of God shall be finished, and all his performances 
 come to be compared with his purposes, it will appear that behold all 
 is done according to the counsel of his own will, not one iota or 
 tittle of which shall fall to the ground, or be varied from.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Moses blessed them. 

 1. He commended them, and signified his approbation of all they had 
 done. He did not find fault where there was none, as some do, who think 
 they disparage their own judgment if they do not find something amiss 
 in the best and most accomplished performance. In all this work it is 
 probable there might have been found here and there a stitch amiss, and 
 a stroke awry, which would have served for an over-curious and 
 censorious critic to animadvert upon; but Moses was too candid to 
 notice small faults where there were no great ones. Note, All governors 
 must be a praise to those that do well, as well as a terror to 
 evil-doers. Why should any take a pride in being hard to be pleased? 

 2. He not only praised them, but prayed for them. He blessed them as
 one having authority, for the less is blessed of the better. We read 
 not of any wages that Moses paid them for their work, but this blessing 
 he gave them. For, though ordinarily the labourer be worthy of his 
 hire, yet in this case,

 1. They wrought for themselves. The honour and comfort of God's
 tabernacle among them would be recompence enough. <I>If thou be wise,
 thou shalt be wise for thyself.</I> 

 2. They had their meat from heaven on free-cost, for themselves and 
 their families, and their raiment waxed not old upon them; so that they 
 neither needed wages nor had reason to expect any. <I>Freely you have
 received, freely give.</I> The obligations we lie under, both in duty 
 and interest, to serve God, should be sufficient to quicken us to our 
 work, though we had not a reward in prospect. But, 

 3. This blessing, in the name of the Lord, was wages enough for all
 their work. Those whom God employs he will bless, and those whom he 
 blesses are blessed indeed. The blessing he commands is <I>life for
 evermore.</I></P>
