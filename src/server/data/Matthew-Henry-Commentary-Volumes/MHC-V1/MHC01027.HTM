 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we return to the typical story of the struggle between 
 Esau and Jacob. Esau had profanely sold the birthright to 
 Jacob; but Esau hopes he shall be never the poorer, nor Jacob 
 the richer, for that bargain, while he preserves his interest in 
 his father's affections, and so secures the blessing. Here therefore 
 we find how he was justly punished for his contempt of the 
 birthright (of which he foolishly deprived himself) with the loss 
 of the blessing, of which Jacob fraudulently deprives him. Thus 
 this story is explained, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:16,17">Heb. xii. 16, 17</A>,
 "Because he sold the 
 birthright, when he would have inherited the blessing he was 
 rejected." For those that make light of the name and profession 
 of religion, and throw them away for a trifle, thereby forfeit the 
 powers and privileges of it. We have here, 
 
 I. Isaac's purpose to 
 entail the blessing upon Esau,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. Rebekah's plot to 
 procure it for Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:6-17">ver. 6-17</A>.
 
 III. Jacob's successful management 
 of the plot, and his obtaining the blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:18-29">ver. 18-29</A>.
 
 IV. Esau's resentment of this, in which, 
 
 1. His great importunity with 
 his father to obtain a blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:30-40">ver. 30-40</A>.
 
 2. His great enmity 
 to his brother for defrauding him of the first blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:41-46">ver. 41</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, that when 
 Isaac was old, and his eyes were 
 dim, so that he could not see, he called 
 Esau his eldest son, and said unto 
 him, My son: and he said unto him, 
 Behold, <I>here am</I> I.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, 
 Behold now, I am old, I know not 
 the day of my death:
 &nbsp; 3 Now therefore 
 take, I pray thee, thy weapons, 
 thy quiver and thy bow, and go out 
 to the field, and take me <I>some</I> venison;
 &nbsp; 4 And make me savoury meat, 
 such as I love, and bring <I>it</I> to me, 
 that I may eat; that my soul may 
 bless thee before I die.
 &nbsp; 5 And Rebekah 
 heard when Isaac spake to Esau 
 his son. And Esau went to the field 
 to hunt <I>for</I> venison, <I>and</I> to bring <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Isaac's design to make his will, 
 and to declare Esau his heir. The promise 
 of the Messiah and the land of Canaan was 
 a great trust, first committed to Abraham, 
 inclusive and typical of spiritual and eternal 
 blessings; this, by divine direction, he transmitted 
 to Isaac. Isaac, being now old, and 
 
 <A NAME="Page163"> </A>

 not knowing, or not understanding, or not 
 duly considering, the divine oracle concerning 
 his two sons, that the elder should serve 
 the younger, resolves to entail all the honour 
 and power that were wrapped up in the promise 
 upon Esau his eldest son. In this he 
 was governed more by natural affection, and 
 the common method of settlements, than he 
 ought to have been, if he knew (as it is probable 
 he did) the intimations God had given 
 of his mind in this matter. Note, We are 
 very apt to take our measures rather from 
 our own reason than from divine revelation, 
 and thereby often miss our way; we think 
 the wise and learned, the mighty and noble, 
 should inherit the promise; but God sees 
 not as man sees. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:6,7">1 Sam. xvi. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The directions he gave to Esau, pursuant 
 to this design. He calls him to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 For Esau, though married, had not 
 yet removed; and, though he had greatly 
 grieved his parents by his marriage, yet they 
 had not expelled him, but it seems were 
 pretty well reconciled to him, and made the 
 best of it. Note, Parents that are justly 
 offended at their children yet must not be 
 implacable towards them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells him upon what considerations 
 he resolved to do this now
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 "<I>I am old,</I>
 and therefore must die shortly, yet <I>I know 
 not the day of my death,</I> nor when I must 
 die; I will therefore do that at this time 
 which must be done some time." Note, 
 
 (1.) Old people should be reminded by the growing 
 infirmities of age to do quickly, and with 
 all the little might they have, what their hand 
 finds to do. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:1">Josh. xiii. 1</A>.

 (2.) The 
 consideration of the uncertainty of the time 
 of our departure out of the world (about 
 which God has wisely kept us in the dark) 
 should quicken us to do the work of the day 
 in its day. The heart and the house should 
 both be set, and kept, in order, because <I>at 
 such an hour as we think not the Son of man
 comes;</I> because we <I>know not the day of our 
 death,</I> we are concerned to mind the business 
 of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He bids him to get things ready for the 
 solemnity of executing his last will and testament, 
 by which he designed to make him his 
 heir,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 Esau must go a hunting, and 
 bring some venison, which his father will eat 
 of, and then bless him. In this he designed, 
 not so much the refreshment of his own 
 spirits, that he might give the blessing in a 
 lively manner, as it is commonly taken, but 
 rather the receiving of a fresh instance of his 
 son's filial duty and affection to him, before 
 he bestowed this favour upon him. Perhaps 
 Esau, since he had married, had brought his 
 venison to his wives, and seldom to his father, 
 as formerly
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:28"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 28</A>),
 and therefore Isaac, 
 before he would bless him, would have him 
 show this piece of respect to him. Note, It 
 is fit, if the <I>less be blessed of the greater,</I> that 
 the greater should be served and honoured 
 by the less. He says, <I>That my soul may 
 bless thee before I die.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) Prayer is 
 the work of the soul, and not of the lips only; 
 as the soul must be employed in blessing God 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:1">Ps. ciii. 1</A>),
 so it must be in blessing ourselves 
 and others: the blessing will not come 
 to the heart if it do not come from the heart. 
 
 (2.) The work of life must be done before we 
 die, for it cannot be done afterwards 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:10">Eccl. ix. 10</A>);
 and it is very desirable, when we 
 come to die, to have nothing else to do but 
 to die. Isaac lived above forty years after 
 this; let none therefore think that they shall 
 die the sooner for making their wills and 
 getting ready for death.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob 
 her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy 
 father speak unto Esau thy brother, 
 saying,
 &nbsp; 7 Bring me venison, and make 
 me savoury meat, that I may eat, and 
 bless thee before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before 
 my death.
 &nbsp; 8 Now therefore, my son, 
 obey my voice according to that which
 I command thee.
 &nbsp; 9 Go now to the 
 flock, and fetch me from thence two 
 good kids of the goats; and I will 
 make them savoury meat for thy father,
 such as he loveth:
 &nbsp; 10 And thou 
 shalt bring <I>it</I> to thy father, that 
 he may eat, and that he may bless thee 
 before his death.
 &nbsp; 11 And Jacob said 
 to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau 
 my brother <I>is</I> a hairy man, and I <I>am</I> 
 a smooth man:
 &nbsp; 12 My father peradventure 
 will feel me, and I shall 
 seem to him as a deceiver; and I 
 shall bring a curse upon me, and not 
 a blessing.
 &nbsp; 13 And his mother said 
 unto him, Upon me <I>be</I> thy curse, my
 son: only obey my voice, and go fetch 
 me <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And he went, and 
 fetched, and brought <I>them</I> to his mother:
 and his mother made savoury 
 meat, such as his father loved.
 &nbsp; 15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of 
 her eldest son Esau, which <I>were</I> with 
 her in the house, and put them upon 
 Jacob her younger son:
 &nbsp; 16 And she 
 put the skins of the kids of the goats 
 upon his hands, and upon the smooth 
 of his neck:
 &nbsp; 17 And she gave the 
 savoury meat and the bread, which 
 she had prepared, into the hand of 
 her son Jacob.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Rebekah is here contriving to procure for 
 Jacob the blessing which was designed for 
 Esau; and here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The end was good, for she was directed 
 in this intention by the oracle of God, by 
 
 <A NAME="Page164"> </A>

 which she had been governed in dispensing 
 her affections. God had said it should be so, 
 that the elder should <I>serve the younger;</I> and 
 therefore Rebekah resolves it shall be so, and 
 cannot bear to see her husband designing to 
 thwart the oracle of God. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The means were bad, and no way justifiable. 
 If it was not a wrong to Esau to 
 deprive him of the blessing (he himself 
 having forfeited it by selling the birthright), yet 
 it was a wrong to Isaac, taking advantage of 
 his infirmity, to impose upon him; it was 
 a wrong to Jacob too, whom she taught to deceive, 
 by putting a lie into his mouth, or at 
 least by putting one into his right hand. It 
 would likewise expose him to endless scruples 
 about the blessing, if he should obtain it thus 
 fraudulently, whether it would stand him or 
 his in any stead, especially if his father should 
 revoke it, upon the discovery of the cheat, 
 and plead, as he might, that it was nulled by 
 an <I>error person&aelig;--a mistake of the person.</I> 
 He himself also was aware of the danger, lest
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 if he should miss of the blessing, as 
 he might probably have done, he should 
 bring upon himself his father's curse, which 
 he dreaded above any thing; besides, he laid 
 himself open to that divine curse which is 
 pronounced upon him that <I>causeth the blind 
 to wander out of the way,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:18">Deut. xxvii. 18</A>.
 If Rebekah, when she heard Isaac promise 
 the blessing to Esau, had gone, at his return 
 from hunting, to Isaac, and, with humility 
 and seriousness, put him in remembrance of 
 that which God had said concerning their 
 sons,--if she further had shown him how 
 Esau had forfeited the blessing both by selling 
 his birthright and by marrying strange 
 wives, it is probable that Isaac would have 
 been prevailed upon knowingly and wittingly 
 to confer the blessing upon Jacob, 
 and needed not thus to have been cheated 
 into it. This would have been honourable 
 and laudable, and would have looked well 
 in the history; but God left her to herself, to 
 take this indirect course, that he might have 
 the glory of bringing good out of evil, and 
 of serving his own purposes by the sins and 
 follies of men, and that we might have the 
 satisfaction of knowing that, though there is 
 so much wickedness and deceit in the world, 
 God governs it according to his will, to his 
 own praise. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:16">Job xii. 16</A>,
 <I>With him are 
 strength and wisdom, the deceived and the deceiver 
 are his.</I> Isaac had lost the sense of 
 seeing, which, in this case, could not have 
 been imposed upon, Providence having so 
 admirably well ordered the difference of 
 features that no two faces are exactly alike: 
 conversation and commerce could scarcely 
 be maintained if there were not such a variety. 
 Therefore she endeavours to deceive, 
 
 1. His sense of tasting, by dressing some 
 choice pieces of kid, seasoning them, serving 
 them up, so as to make him believe they were 
 venison: this it was no hard matter to 
 do. See the folly of those that are nice and curious 
 in their appetite, and take a pride in 
 humouring it. It is easy to impose upon 
 them with that which they pretend to despise
 and dislike, so little perhaps does it differ 
 from that to which they give a decided preference. 
 Solomon tells us that dainties are 
 <I>deceitful meat;</I> for it is possible for us to be 
 deceived by them in more ways than one, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:32">Prov. xxiii. 32</A>.

 2. His sense of feeling and 
 smelling. She put Esau's clothes upon 
 Jacob, his best clothes, which, it might be 
 supposed, Esau would put on, in token of 
 joy and respect to his father, when he was to 
 receive the blessing. Isaac knew these, by 
 the stuff, shape, and smell, to be Esau's. If 
 we would obtain a blessing from our heavenly 
 Father, we must come for it in the garments 
 of our elder brother, clothed with his righteousness, 
 who is the first-born among many 
 brethren. Lest the smoothness and softness 
 of Jacob's hands and neck should betray 
 him, she covered them, and probably part 
 of his face, with the skins of the kids that 
 were newly killed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 Esau was rough 
 indeed when nothing less than these would 
 serve to make Jacob like him. Those that 
 affect to seem rough and rugged in their carriage 
 put the beast upon the man, and really 
 shame themselves, by thus disguising themselves. 
 And, <I>lastly,</I> it was a very rash word 
 which Rebekah spoke, when Jacob objected 
 the danger of a curse: <I>Upon me be thy curse, 
 my son,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Christ indeed, who is mighty 
 to save, because mighty to bear, has said, 
 <I>Upon me be the curse, only obey my voice;</I> he 
 has borne the burden of the curse, the curse 
 of the law, for all those that will take upon 
 them the yoke of the command, the command 
 of the gospel. But it is too daring for any 
 creature to say, <I>Upon me be the curse,</I> unless 
 it be that curse causeless which we are sure 
 <I>shall not come,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:2">Prov. xxvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And he came unto his father, 
 and said, My father: and he said, 
 Here <I>am</I> I; who <I>art</I> thou, my son?
 &nbsp; 19 And Jacob said unto his father, I 
 <I>am</I> Esau thy firstborn; I have done 
 according as thou badest me: arise, I 
 pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, 
 that thy soul may bless me.
 &nbsp; 20 And 
 Isaac said unto his son, How <I>is it</I> that 
 thou hast found <I>it</I> so quickly, my 
 son? And he said, Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 thy God brought <I>it</I> to me.
 &nbsp; 21 And

 voice, but the hands <I>are</I> the hands of 
 Esau.
 &nbsp; 23 And he discerned him not, 
 
 <A NAME="Page165"> </A>

 because his hands were hairy, as his 
 brother Esau's hands: so he blessed 
 him.
 &nbsp; 24 And he said, <I>Art</I> thou my 
 very son Esau? And he said, I <I>am.</I>
 &nbsp; 25 And he said, Bring <I>it</I> near to me, 
 and I will eat of my son's venison, 
 that my soul may bless thee. And he 
 brought <I>it</I> near to him, and he did 
 eat: and he brought him wine, and 
 he drank.
 &nbsp; 26 And his father Isaac 
 said unto him, Come near now, and 
 kiss me, my son.
 &nbsp; 27 And he came 
 near, and kissed him: and he smelled 
 the smell of his raiment, and blessed 
 him, and said, See, the smell of my
 son <I>is</I> as the smell of a field which 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath blessed:
 &nbsp; 28 Therefore 
 God give thee of the dew of heaven, 
 and the fatness of the earth, and 
 plenty of corn and wine:
 &nbsp; 29 Let 
 people serve thee, and nations bow 
 down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, 
 and let thy mother's sons bow 
 down to thee: cursed <I>be</I> every one 
 that curseth thee, and blessed <I>be</I> he 
 that blesseth thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 I. The art and assurance 
 with which Jacob managed this intrigue. 
 Who would have thought that this plain man 
 could have played his part so well in a design 
 of this nature? His mother having put him 
 in the way of it, and encouraged him in it, he 
 dexterously applied himself to those methods 
 which he had never accustomed himself to, 
 but had always conceived an abhorrence of. 
 Note, Lying is soon learnt. The psalmist 
 speaks of those who, <I>as soon as they are born, 
 speak lies,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:3,Jer+9:5">Ps. lviii. 3; Jer. ix. 5</A>.
 I wonder 
 how honest Jacob could so readily turn his 
 tongue to say
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 <I>I am Esau thy first-born;</I> 
 nor do I see how the endeavour of 
 some to bring him off with that equivocation, 
 <I>I am made thy first-born,</I> namely by purchase, 
 does him any service; for when his father 
 asked him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 <I>Art thou my very son Esau?</I> 
 he said, <I>I am.</I> How could he say, <I>I have 
 done as thou badest me,</I> when he had received 
 no command from his father, but was doing 
 as his mother bade him? How could he say, 
 <I>Eat of my venison,</I> when he knew it came, 
 not from the field, but from the fold? But 
 especially I wonder how he could have the 
 assurance to father it upon God, and to use 
 his name in the cheat
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 <I>The Lord thy 
 God brought it to me.</I> Is this Jacob? Is this 
 Israel indeed, without guile? It is certainly 
 written, not for our imitation, but for our admonition. 
 <I>Let him that thinks he stands take 
 heed lest he fall.</I> Good men have sometimes 
 failed in the exercise of those graces for which 
 they have been most eminent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The success of this management. Jacob 
 with some difficulty gained his point, and 
 obtained the blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Isaac was at first dissatisfied, and would 
 have discovered the fraud if he could have 
 trusted his own ears; for <I>the voice was Jacob's 
 voice,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 Providence has ordered a strange 
 variety of voices as well as faces, which is 
 also of use to prevent our being imposed 
 upon; and the voice is a thing not easily disguised 
 nor counterfeited. This may be alluded 
 to to illustrate the character of a hypocrite. 
 His voice is Jacob's voice, but his 
 hands are Esau's. He speaks the language of 
 a saint, but does the works of a sinner; but 
 the judgment will be, as here, by the hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. At length he yielded to the power of 
 the cheat, <I>because the hands were hairy</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 not considering how easy it was to counterfeit 
 that circumstance; and now Jacob 
 carries it on dexterously, sets his venison 
 before his father, and waits at table very 
 officiously, till dinner is done, and the blessing 
 comes to be pronounced in the close of 
 this solemn feast. That which in some small 
 degree extenuates the crime of Rebekah and 
 Jacob is that the fraud was intended, not so 
 much to hasten the fulfilling, as to prevent 
 the thwarting, of the oracle of God: the 
 blessing was just going to be put upon the 
 wrong head, and they thought it was time to 
 bestir themselves. Now let us see how Isaac 
 gave Jacob his blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:26-29"><I>v.</I> 26-29</A>.
 
 (1.) He embraced him, in token of a particular 
 affection to him. Those that are blessed of 
 God are kissed with the kisses of his mouth, 
 and they do, by love and loyalty, <I>kiss the 
 Son,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">Ps. ii. 12</A>.

 (2.) He praised him. <I>He 
 smelt the smell of his raiment, and said, See, 
 the smell of my son is as the smell of a field 
 which the Lord hath blessed,</I> that is, like that 
 of the most fragrant flowers and spices. It 
 appeared that God had blessed him, and 
 therefore Isaac would bless him. 
 
 (3.) He 
 prayed for him, and therein prophesied concerning 
 him. It is the duty of parents to 
 pray for their children, and to bless them in 
 the name of the Lord. And thus, as well as 
 by their baptism, to do what they can to preserve 
 and perpetuate the entail of the covenant 
 in their families. But this was an extraordinary 
 blessing; and Providence so ordered 
 it that Isaac should bestow it upon Jacob 
 ignorantly and by mistake, that it might appear 
 he was beholden to God for it, and not 
 to Isaac. Three things Jacob is here blessed 
 with:--
 
 [1.] Plenty
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 heaven and earth concurring to make him rich. 
 
 [2.] Power
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 particularly dominion over his brethren, 
 namely, Esau and his posterity. 
 
 [3.] Prevalency with God, and a great interest in 
 Heaven: "<I>Cursed by every one that curseth
 thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</I> Let 
 God be a friend to all thy friends, and an 
 enemy to all thy enemies." More is certainly 
 comprised in this blessing than appears 
 <I>prima facie--at first sight.</I> It must amount 
 
 <A NAME="Page166"> </A>

 to an entail of the promise of the Messiah, and 
 of the church; this was, in the patriarchal 
 dialect, <I>the blessing:</I> something spiritual, 
 doubtless, is included in it. <I>First,</I> That from 
 him should come the Messiah, who should 
 have a sovereign dominion on earth. It was 
 that top-branch of his family which people 
 should serve and nations bow down to. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:19">Num. xxiv. 19</A>,
 <I>Out of Jacob shall come he 
 that shall have dominion,</I> the <I>star</I> and <I>sceptre,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 Jacob's dominion over Esau was to 
 be only typical of this,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 10</A>.
 <I>Secondly,</I> 
 That from him should come the church, which 
 should be particularly owned and favoured 
 by Heaven. It was part of the blessing of 
 Abraham, when he was first called to be the 
 father of the faithful
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3"><I>ch.</I> xii. 3</A>),
 <I>I will bless 
 those that bless thee;</I> therefore, when Isaac 
 afterwards confirmed the blessing to Jacob, he 
 called it <I>the blessing of Abraham,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:4"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 4</A>.
 Balaam explains this too, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:9">Num. xxiv. 9</A>.
 Note, It is the best and most desirable blessing 
 to stand in relation to Christ and his 
 church, and to be interested in Christ's power 
 and the church's favours.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And it came to pass, as soon as 
 Isaac had made an end of blessing 
 Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone 
 out from the presence of Isaac his father, 
 that Esau his brother came in 
 from his hunting.
 &nbsp; 31 And he also 
 had made savoury meat, and brought 
 it unto his father, and said unto his 
 father, Let my father arise, and eat of
 his son's venison, that thy soul may 
 bless me.
 &nbsp; 32 And Isaac his father 
 said unto him, Who <I>art</I> thou? And 
 he said, I <I>am</I> thy son, thy firstborn 
 Esau.
 &nbsp; 33 And Isaac trembled very 
 exceedingly, and said, Who? where
 <I>is</I> he that hath taken venison, and 
 brought <I>it</I> me, and I have eaten of all 
 before thou camest, and have blessed 
 him? yea, <I>and</I> he shall be blessed.
 &nbsp; 34 And when Esau heard the words 
 of his father, he cried with a great and 
 exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his 
 father, Bless me, <I>even</I> me also, O my 
 father.
 &nbsp; 35 And he said, Thy brother 
 came with subtlety, and hath taken 
 away thy blessing.
 &nbsp; 36 And he said, Is 
 not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
 supplanted me these two times: he took 
 away my birthright; and, behold, now 
 he hath taken away my blessing. And 
 he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing 
 for me?
 &nbsp; 37 And Isaac answered 
 and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made
 him thy lord, and all his brethren 
 have I given to him for servants; 
 and with corn and wine have I sustained 
 him: and what shall I do now 
 unto thee, my son?
 &nbsp; 38 And Esau 
 said unto his father, Hast thou but 
 one blessing, my father? bless me, 
 <I>even</I> me also, O my father. And Esau 
 lifted up his voice, and wept.
 &nbsp; 39 And 
 Isaac his father answered and said unto 
 him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be 
 the fatness of the earth, and of the 
 dew of heaven from above;
 &nbsp; 40 And by thy sword shalt 
 thou live, and shalt serve 
 thy brother; and it shall come 
 to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, 
 that thou shalt break his yoke 
 from off thy neck.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The covenant-blessing denied 
 to Esau. He that made so light of the birthright 
 <I>would now have inherited the blessing, 
 but he was rejected, and found no place of repentance</I> 
 in his father, <I>though he sought it 
 carefully with tears,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:17">Heb. xii. 17</A>. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. How carefully he sought it. He prepared 
 the savoury meat, as his father had directed 
 him, and then begged the blessing which his 
 father had encouraged him to expect,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 When he understood that Jacob had obtained 
 it surreptitiously, he <I>cried with a great 
 and exceedingly bitter cry,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 No man could 
 have laid the disappointment more to heart 
 than he did; he made his father's tent to 
 ring with his grief, and again
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>)
 <I>lifted up his voice and wept.</I> Note, The day is 
 coming when those that now make light of 
 the blessings of the covenant, and sell their 
 title to them for a thing of nought, will in 
 vain be importunate for them. Those that 
 will not so much as ask and seek now will 
 knock shortly, and cry, <I>Lord, Lord.</I> Slighters 
 of Christ will then be humble suitors to 
 him. 
 
 2. How he was rejected. Isaac, when 
 first made sensible of the imposition that had 
 been practised on him, <I>trembled exceedingly,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 Those that follow the choice of their 
 own affections, rather than the dictates of the 
 divine will, involve themselves in such perplexities 
 as these. But he soon recovers 
 himself, and ratifies the blessing he had given 
 to Jacob: <I>I have blessed him, and he shall 
 be blessed;</I> he might, upon very plausible 
 grounds, have recalled it, but now, at last, he 
 is sensible that he was in an error when he 
 designed it for Esau. Either himself recollecting 
 the divine oracle, or rather having 
 found himself more than ordinarily filled with 
 the Holy Ghost when he gave the blessing to Jacob, he 
 perceived that God did, as it were, 
 say Amen to it. Now, 
 
 (1.) Jacob was hereby 
 confirmed in his possession of the blessing, 
 and abundantly satisfied of the validity of it, 
 though he obtained it fraudulently; hence
 too he had reason to hope that God graciously

 <A NAME="Page167"> </A>
 
 overlooked and pardoned his misconduct. 
 
 (2.) Isaac hereby acquiesced in the will of 
 God, though it contradicted his own expectations 
 and affection. He had a mind to give 
 Esau the blessing, but, when he perceived 
 the will of God was otherwise, he submitted; 
 and this he did <I>by faith</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:20">Heb. xi. 20</A>),
 as Abraham before him, when he had solicited 
 for Ishmael. May not God do what he will 
 with his own? 
 
 (3.) Esau hereby was cut off 
 from the expectation of that special blessing 
 which he thought to have preserved to himself 
 when he sold his birthright. We, by 
 this instance, are taught, 
 
 [1.] That <I>it is not 
 of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, 
 but of God that showeth mercy,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:16">Rom. ix. 16</A>.
 The apostle seems to allude to this story. 
 Esau had a good will to the blessing, and 
 ran for it; but God that showed mercy designed 
 it for Jacob, <I>that the purpose of God
 according to election might stand,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 The Jews, like Esau, hunted <I>after the law of righteousness</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 yet missed of the blessing 
 of righteousness, <I>because they sought it by 
 the works of the law</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);
 while the Gentiles, 
 who, like Jacob, sought it by faith in 
 the oracle of God, obtained it by force, with 
 that violence which the kingdom of heaven 
 suffers. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:12">Matt. xi. 12</A>.

 [2.] That those 
 who undervalue their spiritual birthright, 
 and can afford to sell it for a morsel of meat, 
 forfeit spiritual blessings, and it is just with 
 God to deny them those favours they were 
 careless of. Those that will part with their 
 wisdom and grace, with their faith and a 
 good conscience, for the honours, wealth, or 
 pleasures, of this world, however they may 
 pretend a zeal for the blessing, have already 
 judged themselves unworthy of it, and so 
 shall their doom be. 
 
 [3.] That those who 
 lift up hands in wrath lift them up in vain. 
 Esau, instead of repenting of his own folly, 
 reproached his brother, unjustly charged him 
 with taking away the birthright which he 
 had fairly sold to him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 and conceived 
 malice against him for what he had now 
 done,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 Those are not likely to speed 
 in prayer who turn those resentments upon 
 their brethren which they should turn upon 
 themselves, and lay the blame of their miscarriages
 upon others, when they should 
 take shame to themselves. 
 
 [4.] That those 
 who seek not till it is too late will be rejected. 
 This was the ruin of Esau, he did not come 
 in time. As there is an accepted time, a 
 time when God will be found, so there is a 
 time when he will not answer those that call 
 upon him, because they neglected the appointed 
 season. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:28">Prov. i. 28</A>.
 The time 
 of God's patience and our probation will not 
 last always; the day of grace will come to 
 an end, and the door will be shut. Then many that 
 now despise the blessing will seek it carefully; 
 for then they will know how to 
 value it, and will see themselves undone, for 
 ever undone, without it, but to no purpose,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:25-27">Luke xiii. 25-27</A>.
 O that we would therefore, 
 in this our day, <I>know the things that 
 belong to our peace!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a common blessing bestowed 
 upon Esau.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This he desired: <I>Bless me also,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 <I>Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) The worst of men know how to 
 wish well to themselves; and even those who 
 profanely sell their birthright seem piously to 
 desire the blessing. Faint desires of happiness, 
 without a right choice of the end and a 
 right use of the means, deceive many into 
 their own ruin. Multitudes go to hell with 
 their mouths full of good wishes. The desire 
 of the slothful and unbelieving kills them. 
 Many will seek to enter in, as Esau, who 
 shall not be able, because they do not strive,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:24">Luke xiii. 24</A>.

 (2.) It is the folly of most 
 men that they are willing to take up with any 
 good 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>),
 as Esau here, who desired 
 but a second-rate blessing, a blessing separated 
 from the birthright. Profane hearts 
 think any blessing as good as that from God's 
 oracle: <I>Hast thou but one?</I> As if he had said, 
 "I will take up with any: though I have not 
 the blessing of the church, yet let me have 
 some blessing."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This he had; and let him make his best 
 of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was a good thing, and better than 
 he deserved. It was promised him, 
 
 [1.] That he should have a competent livelihood--<I>the 
 fatness of the earth, and the dew of heaven.</I> 
 Note, Those that come short of the blessings 
 of the covenant may yet have a very good 
 share of outward blessings. God gives good 
 ground and good weather to many that reject 
 his covenant, and have no part nor lot in it. 
 
 [2.] That by degrees he should recover his 
 liberty. If Jacob must rule
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 Esau must serve; but he has this to comfort him, 
 he shall <I>live by his sword.</I> He shall serve, 
 but he shall not starve; and, at length, after 
 much skirmishing, he shall break the yoke of 
 bondage, and wear marks of freedom. 
 This was fulfilled
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:20,22">2 Kings viii. 20, 22</A>)
 when the Edomites revolted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet it was far short of Jacob's blessing. 
 For him God had reserved some better thing. 
 
 [1.] In Jacob's blessing <I>the dew of heaven</I> is 
 put first, as that which he most valued, and 
 desired, and depended upon; in Esau's <I>the 
 fatness of the earth</I> is put first, for it was this 
 that he had the first and principal regard to. 
 
 [2.] Esau has these, but Jacob has them 
 from God's hand: <I>God give thee the dew of 
 heaven,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 It was enough to Esau to have 
 the possession; but Jacob desired it by promise, 
 and to have it from covenant-love. 
 
 [3.] Jacob shall have dominion over his brethren: 
 hence the Israelites often ruled over the 
 Edomites. Esau shall have dominion, that 
 is, he shall gain some power and interest, 
 but shall never have dominion over his brother: 
 we never find that the Jews were sold 
 into the hands of the Edomites, or that they 
 oppressed them. But the great difference in 
 
 <A NAME="Page168"> </A>

 that there is nothing in Esau's blessing that 
 points at Christ, nothing that brings him or 
 his into the church and covenant of God, 
 without which the fatness of the earth, and 
 the plunder of the field, will stand him in 
 little stead. Thus Isaac by faith blessed them 
 both according as their lot should be. Some 
 observe that Jacob was blessed with a <I>kiss</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 so was not Esau.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>41 And Esau hated Jacob because 
 of the blessing wherewith his father 
 blessed him: and Esau said in his 
 heart, The days of mourning for my 
 father are at hand; then will I slay 
 my brother Jacob.
 &nbsp; 42 And these 
 words of Esau her elder son were told 
 to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob 
 her younger son, and said unto him,
 Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching 
 thee, doth comfort himself, <I>purposing</I> 
 to kill thee.
 &nbsp; 43 Now therefore, my 
 son, obey my voice; and arise, flee 
 thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
 &nbsp; 44 And tarry with him a few days, 
 until thy brother's fury turn away;
 &nbsp; 45 Until thy brother's anger turn 
 away from thee, and he forget <I>that</I> 
 which thou hast done to him: then I 
 will send, and fetch thee from thence: 
 why should I be deprived also of you 
 both in one day?
 &nbsp; 46 And Rebekah 
 said to Isaac, I am weary of my life 
 because of the daughters of Heth: if 
 Jacob take a wife of the daughters of
 Heth, such as these <I>which are</I> of the 
 daughters of the land, what good shall 
 my life do me?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The malice Esau bore to Jacob 
 upon account of the blessing which he had 
 obtained,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 Thus he went in the way of 
 Cain, who slew his brother because he had 
 gained that acceptance with God of which 
 he had rendered himself unworthy. Esau's
 hatred of Jacob was, 
 
 1. A causeless hatred. 
 He hated him for no other reason but because 
 his father blessed him and God loved him. 
 Note, The happiness of saints is the envy of 
 sinners. Whom Heaven blesses, hell curses. 
 
 2. It was a cruel hatred. Nothing less would 
 satisfy him than to slay his brother. It is 
 the blood of the saints that persecutors thirst 
 after: <I>I will slay my brother.</I> How could he 
 say that word without horror? How could 
 he call him <I>brother,</I> and yet vow his death? 
 Note, The rage of persecutors will not be tied 
 up by any bonds, no, not the strongest and 
 most sacred. 
 
 3. It was a politic hatred. He 
 expected his father would soon die, and then 
 titles must be tried and interests contested 
 between the brothers, which would give him
 a fair opportunity for revenge. He thinks it 
 not enough to <I>live by his sword himself</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),
 unless his brother die by it. He is loth to 
 grieve his father while he lives, and therefore 
 puts off the intended murder till his death, 
 not caring how much he then grieved his 
 surviving mother. Note, 
 
 (1.) Those are bad 
 children to whom their good parents are a 
 burden, and who, upon any account, long for 
 the days of mourning for them. 
 
 (2.) Bad 
 men are long held in by external restraints 
 from doing the mischief they would do, and 
 so their wicked purposes come to nought. 
 
 (3.) Those who think to defeat God's purposes 
 will undoubtedly be disappointed themselves. 
 Esau aimed to prevent Jacob, or his 
 seed, from having the dominion, by taking 
 away his life before he was married; but who 
 can disannul what God has spoken? Men 
 may fret at God's counsels, but cannot change 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method Rebekah took to prevent 
 the mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She gave Jacob warning of his danger, 
 and advised him to withdraw for a while, and 
 shift for his own safety. She tells him what 
 she heard of Esau's design, that he comforted 
 himself with the hope of an opportunity to 
 kill his brother,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 Would one think 
 that such a bloody barbarous thought as this 
 could be a comfort to a man? If Esau could 
 have kept his design to himself his mother 
 would not have suspected it; but men's impudence 
 in sin is often their infatuation; and 
 they cannot accomplish their wickedness because 
 their rage is too violent to be concealed, 
 and a bird of the air carries the voice. Observe 
 here, 
 
 (1.) What Rebekah feared--lest 
 she <I>should be deprived of them both in one 
 day</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),
 deprived, not only of the murdered, 
 but of the murderer, who either by the magistrate, 
 or by the immediate hand of God, 
 would by sacrificed to justice, which she herself 
 must acquiesce in, and not obstruct: or, 
 if not so, yet thenceforward she would be 
 deprived of all joy and comfort in him. Those
 that are lost to virtue are in a manner lost to 
 all their friends. With what pleasure can a 
 child be looked upon that can be looked upon 
 as no other than a child of the devil? 
 
 (2.) What Rebekah hoped--that, if Jacob for a 
 while kept out of sight, the affront which his 
 brother resented so fiercely would by degrees 
 go out of mind. The strength of passions is 
 weakened and taken off by the distances both 
 of time and place. She promised herself that 
 his brother's anger would turn away. Note, 
 Yielding pacifies great offences; and even 
 those that have a good cause, and God on 
 their side, must yet use this with other prudent 
 expedients for their own preservation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She impressed Isaac with an apprehension 
 of the necessity of Jacob's going among 
 her relations upon another account, which 
 was to take a wife,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 She would not tell 
 him of Esau's wicked design against the life 
 of Jacob, lest it should trouble him; but 
 
 <A NAME="Page169"> </A>

 prudently took another way to gain her point. 
 Isaac saw as uneasy as he was to Esau's being 
 unequally yoked with Hittites; and therefore, 
 with a very good colour of reason, she 
 moves to have Jacob married to one that was 
 better principled. Note, One miscarriage 
 should serve as a warning to prevent another; 
 those are careless indeed that stumble twice 
 at the same stone. Yet Rebekah seems to 
 have expressed herself somewhat too warmly 
 in the matter, when she said, <I>What good will 
 my life do me if Jacob marry a Canaanite?</I> 
 Thanks be to God, all our comfort is not 
 lodged in one hand; we may do the work of 
 life, and enjoy the comforts of life, though 
 every thing do not fall out to our mind, and 
 though our relations be not in all respects 
 agreeable to us. Perhaps Rebekah spoke 
 with this concern because she saw it necessary, 
 for the quickening of Isaac, to give 
 speedy orders in this matter. Observe, 
 Though Jacob was himself very towardly, 
 and well fixed in his religion, yet he had need 
 to be put out of the way of temptation. Even 
 he was in danger both of following the bad 
 example of his brother and of being drawn 
 into a snare by it. We must not presume too 
 far upon the wisdom and resolution, no, not
