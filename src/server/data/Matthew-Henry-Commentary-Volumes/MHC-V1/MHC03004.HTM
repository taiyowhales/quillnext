 This chapter is concerning the sin-offering, which was properly
 intended to make atonement for a sin committed through ignorance, 

 I. By the priest himself,

 Or, 
 
 II. By the whole congregation,

 Or, 
 
 III. By a ruler, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall
 sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>concerning things</I> which ought not to be done, and shall do
 against any of them:
 &nbsp; 3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
 the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned,
 a young bullock without blemish unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for a sin offering.
 &nbsp; 4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and shall lay his
 hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
 blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:
 &nbsp; 6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and
 sprinkle of the blood seven times before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, before the
 vail of the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 7 And the priest shall put <I>some</I> of the blood upon the horns
 of the altar of sweet incense before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which <I>is</I> in the
 tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of
 the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering,
 which <I>is at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
 the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the
 fat that <I>is</I> upon the inwards,
 &nbsp; 9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that <I>is</I> upon them, which
 <I>is</I> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the
 kidneys, it shall he take away,
 &nbsp; 10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of
 peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
 the burnt offering.
 &nbsp; 11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his
 head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,
 &nbsp; 12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
 unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him
 on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be
 burnt.

 The laws contained in the first three chapters seem to have been 
 delivered to Moses at one time. Here begin the statutes of another 
 session, another day. From the throne of glory between the cherubim God 
 delivered these orders. And he enters now upon a subject more strictly 
 new than those before. Burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and 
 peace-offerings, it should seem, had been offered before the giving of 
 the law upon mount Sinai; those sacrifices the patriarchs had not been 
 altogether unacquainted with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20,Ex+20:24">Gen. viii. 20; Exod. xx. 24</A>),

 and in them they had respect to sin, to make atonement for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">Job i. 5</A>.

 But the law being now added <I>because of transgressions</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19">Gal. iii. 19</A>),

 and having entered, that eventually <I>the offence might abound</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:20">Rom. v. 20</A>),

 they were put into a way of making atonement for sin more particularly
 by sacrifice, which was (more than any of the ceremonial institutions) 
 <I>a shadow of good things to come,</I> but the substance is Christ, 
 and that one offering of himself by which he put away sin and 
 <I>perfected for ever those who are sanctified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general case supposed we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 1. Concerning sin in general, that it is described to be against <I>any
 of the commandments of the Lord;</I> for <I>sin is the transgression of 
 the law,</I> the divine law. The wits or wills of men, their inventions 
 or their injunctions, cannot make that to be sin which the law of God 
 has not made to be so. It is said likewise, <I>if a soul sin,</I> for 
 it is not sin if it be not some way or other the soul's act; hence it 
 is called the <I>sin of the soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:7">Mic. vi. 7</A>),

 and it is the soul that is injured by it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:36">Prov. viii. 36</A>.

 2. Concerning the sins for which those offerings were appointed.

 (1.) They are supposed to be overt acts; for, had they been required to 
 bring a sacrifice for every sinful thought or word, the task had been 
 endless. Atonement was made for those in the gross, on the day of 
 expiation, once a year; but these are said to be done against the 
 commandments.

 (2.) They are supposed to be sins of commission, things which ought not 
 to be done. Omissions are sins, and must come into judgment; but what 
 had been omitted at one time might be done at another, and so to obey 
 was better than sacrifice: but a commission was past recall.

 (3.) They are supposed to be sins committed through ignorance. If they 
 were done presumptuously, and with an avowed contempt of the law and 
 the Law-maker, the offender was to be cut off, and there remained <I>no 
 sacrifice for the sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:26,27,Nu+15:30">Heb. x. 26, 27; Num. xv. 30</A>.

 But if the offender were either ignorant of the law, as in divers
 instances we may suppose many were (so numerous and various were the 
 prohibitions), or were surprised into the sin unawares, the 
 circumstances being such as made it evident that his resolution against 
 the sin was sincere, but that he was overtaken in it, as the expression 
 is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>),

 in this case relief was provided by the remedial law of the
 sin-offering. And the Jews say, "Those crimes only were to be expiated
 by sacrifice, if committed ignorantly, for which the criminal was to 
 have been cut off if they had been committed presumptuously."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The law begins with the case of the anointed priest, that is, the 
 high priest, provided he should sin through ignorance; for <I>the law 
 made men priests who had infirmity.</I> Though his ignorance was of all 
 others least excusable, yet he was allowed to bring his offering. His 
 office did not so far excuse his offence as that it should be forgiven 
 him without a sacrifice; yet it did not so far aggravate it but that it 
 should be forgiven him when he did bring his sacrifice. If he sin 
 <I>according to the sin of the people</I> (so the case is put, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 which supposes him in this matter to stand upon the level with other 
 Israelites, and to have no benefit of his clergy at all. Now the law 
 concerning the sin-offering for the high priest is, 

 1. That he must bring a bullock without blemish for a sin-offering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as valuable an offering as that for the whole congregation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 whereas for any other ruler, or a common person, <I>a kid of the 
 goats</I> should serve, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:23,28"><I>v.</I> 23, 28</A>.

 This intimated the greatness of the guilt connected with the sin of a 
 high priest. The eminency of his station, and his relation both to God 
 and to the people, greatly aggravated his offences; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21">Rom. ii. 21</A>.

 2. The hand of the offerer must be laid upon the head of the offering
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 with a solemn penitent confession of the sin he had committed, putting 
 it upon the head of the sin-offering,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:21"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21</A>.

 No remission without confession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5,Pr+28:13">Ps. xxxii. 5; Prov. xxviii. 13</A>.

 It signified also a confidence in this instituted way of expiating
 guilt, as a figure of something better yet to come, which they could 
 not stedfastly discern. He that laid his hand on the head of the beast 
 thereby owned that he deserved to die himself, and that it was God's 
 great mercy that he would please to accept the offering of this beast 
 to die for him. The Jewish writers themselves say that neither the
 sin-offering nor the trespass-offering made atonement, except for those 
 that repented and believed in their atonement.

 3. The bullock must be killed, and a great deal of solemnity there must
 be in disposing of the blood; for it was <I>the blood that made 
 atonement,</I> and <I>without shedding of blood</I> there was <I>no 
 remission,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 Some of the blood of the high-priest's sin-offering was to be 
 <I>sprinkled seven times before the veil,</I> with an eye towards the 
 mercy-seat, though it was veiled: some of it was to be put upon the 
 horns of the golden altar, because at that altar the priest himself 
 ministered; and thus was signified the putting away of that pollution 
 which from his sins did cleave to his services. It likewise serves to 
 illustrate the influence which Christ's satisfaction has upon the 
 prevalency of his intercession. The blood of his sacrifice is put upon 
 the altar of his incense and sprinkled before the Lord. When this was
 done the remainder of the blood was poured at the foot of the brazen 
 altar. By this rite, the sinner acknowledged that he deserved to have 
 his blood thus poured out like water. It likewise signified the pouring 
 out of the soul before God in true repentance, and typified our 
 Saviour's <I>pouring out his soul unto death.</I>

 4. The fat of the inwards was to be burnt upon the altar of
 burnt-offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 By this the intention of the offering and of the atonement made by it 
 was directed to the glory of God, who, having been dishonoured by the 
 sin, was thus honoured by the sacrifice. It signified the sharp 
 sufferings of our Lord Jesus, when he was made sin (that is, a 
 sin-offering) for us, especially the sorrows of his soul and his inward 
 agonies. It likewise teaches us, in conformity to the death of Christ, 
 to crucify the flesh.

 5. The head and body of the beast, skin and all, were to be carried
 <I>without the camp,</I> to a certain place appointed for that purpose, 
 and there burnt to ashes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 This was very significant,

 (1.) Of the duty of repentance, which is the putting away of sin as a
 detestable thing, which our soul hates. True penitents say to their 
 idols, "Get you hence; what have we to do any more with idols?" The 
 sin-offering is called <I>sin.</I> What they did to that we must do to 
 our sins; the body of sin must be destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:6">Rom. vi. 6</A>.

 (2.) Of the privilege of remission. When God pardons sin he quite
 abolishes it, casts it behind his back. <I>The iniquity of Judah shall 
 be sought for and not found.</I> The apostle takes particular notice of 
 this ceremony, and applies it to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:11-13">Heb. xiii. 11-13</A>),

 who suffered without the gate, in the place of a skull, where the ashes
 of dead men, as those of the altar, were poured out.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through
 ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly,
 and they have done <I>somewhat against</I> any of the commandments of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>concerning things</I> which should not be done, and are
 guilty;
 &nbsp; 14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
 then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
 and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands
 upon the head of the bullock before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and the bullock
 shall be killed before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
 blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

 and sprinkle <I>it</I> seven times before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> before the
 vail.
 &nbsp; 18 And he shall put <I>some</I> of the blood upon the horns of the
 altar which <I>is</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that <I>is</I> in the tabernacle of
 the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
 of the altar of the burnt offering, which <I>is at</I> the door of the
 tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn <I>it</I> upon
 the altar.
 &nbsp; 20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
 for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
 shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
 &nbsp; 21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
 burn him as he burned the first bullock: it <I>is</I> a sin offering
 for the congregation.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the law for expiating the guilt of a national sin, by a sin 
 offering. If the leaders of the people, through mistake concerning the 
 law, caused them to err, when the mistake was discovered an offering 
 must be brought, that wrath might not come upon the whole congregation. 
 Observe, 

 1. It is possible that the church may err, and that her guides may
 mislead her. It is here supposed that the whole congregation may sin, 
 and sin through ignorance. God will always have a church on earth; but 
 he never said it should be infallible, or perfectly pure from 
 corruption on this side heaven. 

 2. When a sacrifice was to be offered for the whole congregation, the
 elders were to lay their hands upon the head of it (three of them at 
 least), as representatives of the people and agents for them. The sin 
 we suppose to have been some common custom, taken up and used by the 
 generality of the people, upon presumption of its being lawful, which 
 afterwards, upon search, appeared to be otherwise. In this case the 
 commonness of the usage received perhaps by tradition from their 
 fathers, and the vulgar opinion of its being lawful, would not so far 
 excuse them from sin but that they must bring a sacrifice to make 
 atonement for it. There are many bad customs and forms of speech which 
 are thought to have no harm in them, and yet may bring guilt and wrath 
 upon a land, which therefore it concerns the elders both to reform and 
 to intercede with God for the pardon of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:16">Joel ii. 16</A>.

 3. The blood of this sin-offering, as of the former, was to be
 <I>sprinkled seven times before the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It was not to be poured out there, but sprinkled only; for the 
 cleansing virtue of the blood of Christ was then and still is 
 sufficiently signified and represented by sprinkling, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:15">Isa. lii. 15</A>.

 It was to be sprinkled seven times. Seven is a number of perfection,
 because when God had made the world in six days he rested the seventh; 
 so this signified the perfect satisfaction Christ made, and the 
 complete cleansing of the souls of the faithful by it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:14">Heb. x. 14</A>.

 The blood was likewise to be put upon the horns of the incense-altar,
 to which there seems to be an allusion in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1">Jer. xvii. 1</A>,

 where the sin of Judah is said to be <I>graven upon the horns of their 
 altars.</I> If they did not forsake their sins, the putting of the 
 blood of their sin-offerings upon the horns of their altars, instead of 
 taking away their guilt, did but bind it on the faster, perpetuated the 
 remembrance of it, and remained a witness against them. It is likewise 
 alluded to in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:13">Rev. ix. 13</A>,

 where a voice is heard <I>from the four horns of the golden altar;</I>
 that is, an answer of peace is given to the prayers of the saints, 
 which are acceptable and prevalent only by virtue of the blood of the 
 sin-offering put upon the horns of that altar; compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3">Rev. viii. 3</A>.

 4. When the offering is completed, it is said, <I>atonement is made,
 and the sin shall be forgiven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The promise of remission is founded upon the atonement. It is spoken 
 here of the forgiveness of the sin of the whole congregation, that is, 
 the turning away of those national judgments which the sin deserved. 
 Note, The saving of churches and kingdoms from ruin is owing to the 
 satisfaction and mediation of Christ.</P>

 male without blemish:
 &nbsp; 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. That God takes notice of and is displeased with the sins of rulers.
 Those who have power to call others to account are themselves 
 accountable to the ruler of rulers; for, as high as they are, there is 
 a higher than they. This is intimated in that the commandment 
 transgressed is here said to be the <I>commandment of the Lord his 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He is a prince to others, but let him know the Lord is a God to him.

 2. The sin of the ruler which he committed through ignorance is
 supposed afterwards to come to his knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which must be either by the check of his own conscience or by the 
 reproof of his friends, both which we should all, even the best and 
 greatest, not only submit to, but be thankful for. What we have done 
 amiss we should be very desirous to come to the knowledge of. <I>That 
 which I see not, teach thou me, and show me wherein I have erred,</I> 
 are prayers we should put up to God every day, that though through 
 ignorance we fall into sin we may not through ignorance lie still in 
 it.

 3. The sin-offering for a ruler was to be <I>a kid of the goats,</I>
 not a bullock, as for the priest and the whole congregation; nor was 
 the blood of his sin-offering to be brought into the tabernacle, as of 
 the other two, but it was all bestowed upon the brazen altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 nor was the flesh of it to be burnt, as that of the other two, without 
 the camp, which intimated that the sin of a ruler, though worse than 
 that of a common person, yet was not so heinous, nor of such pernicious 
 consequence, as the sin of the high priest, or of the whole 
 congregation. A kid of the goats was sufficient to be offered for a 
 ruler, but a bullock for a tribe, to intimate that the ruler, though 
 <I>major singulis--greater than each,</I> was <I>minor universis--less 
 than the whole.</I> It is bad when great men give bad examples, but 
 worse when all men follow them.

 4. It is promised that the atonement shall be accepted and the sin
 forgiven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 that is, if he repent and reform; for otherwise God swore concerning 
 Eli, a judge in Israel, that the iniquity of his house should not be 
 purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever,

 I. Here is the law of the sin-offering for a common person, which 
 differs from that for a ruler only in this, that a private person might 
 bring either a kid or a lamb, a ruler only a kid; and that for a ruler 
 must be a male, for the other a female: in all the circumstances of the 
 management of the offering they agreed. Observe, 

 1. The case supposed: <I>If any one of the common people sin through
 ignorance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The prophet supposes that they were not so likely as the great men to 
 <I>know the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4">Jer. v. 4</A>),

 and yet, if they sin through ignorance, they must bring a sin-offering.
 Note, Even sins of ignorance need to be atoned for by sacrifice. To be 
 able to plead, when we are charged with sin, that we did it ignorantly, 
 and through the surprise of temptation, will not bring us off if we be 
 not interested in that great plea, <I>Christ hath died,</I> and 
 entitled to the benefit of that. We have all need to pray with David 
 (and he was a ruler) to be cleansed from <I>secret faults,</I> the 
 errors which we ourselves do not understand or are not aware of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:12">Ps. xix. 12</A>.

 2. That the sins of ignorance committed by a single person, a common
 obscure person, did require a sacrifice; for, as the greatest are not 
 above the censure, so the meanest are not below the cognizance of the 
 divine justice. None of the common people, if offenders, were 
 overlooked in a crowd. 

 3. That a sin-offering was not only admitted, but accepted, even from
 one of the common people, and an atonement made by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:31,35"><I>v.</I> 31, 35</A>.

 Here rich and poor, prince and peasant, meet together; they are both 
 alike welcome to Christ, and to an interest in his sacrifice, upon the 
 same terms. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:19">Job xxxiv. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From all these laws concerning the sin-offerings we may learn, 

 1. To hate sin, and to watch against it. That is certainly a very bad
 thing to make atonement for which so many innocent and useful creatures 
 must be slain and mangled thus. 

 2. To value Christ, the great and true sin-offering, whose blood
 cleanses from all sin, which it was not possible that the <I>blood of 
 bulls and of goats should take away. Now, if any man sin,</I> Christ is 
 <I>the propitiation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,2">1 John ii. 1, 2</A>),

 not for Jews only, but for Gentiles. And perhaps there was some
 allusion to this law concerning sacrifices for sins of ignorance in 
 that prayer of Christ's, just when he was offering up himself a 
 sacrifice, <I>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they 
 do.</I></P>
