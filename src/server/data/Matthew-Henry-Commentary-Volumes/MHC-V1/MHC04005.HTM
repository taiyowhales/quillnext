 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
 every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is
 defiled by the dead:
 &nbsp; 3 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
 ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
 whereof I dwell.
 &nbsp; 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
 the camp: as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, so did the children of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 6 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
 commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and that person be guilty;
 &nbsp; 7 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and
 he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
 add unto it the fifth <I>part</I> thereof, and give <I>it</I> unto <I>him</I>
 against whom he hath trespassed.
 &nbsp; 8 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
 unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> to
 the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement
 shall be made for him.
 &nbsp; 9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
 Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
 &nbsp; 10 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
 man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

 Here is, 

 I. A command for the purifying of the camp, by turning out from within 
 its lines all those that were ceremonially unclean, by issues, 
 leprosies, or the touch of dead bodies, until they were cleansed 
 according to the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. These orders are executed immediately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) The camp was now newly-modelled and put in order, and therefore,
 to complete the reformation of it, it is next to be cleansed. Note, The 
 purity of the church must be as carefully consulted and preserved as 
 the peace and order of it. It is requisite, not only that every 
 Israelite be confined to his own standard, but that every polluted 
 Israelite be separated from it. <I>The wisdom from above is first pure, 
 then peaceable.</I>

 (2.) God's tabernacle was now fixed in the midst of their camp, and
 therefore they must be careful to keep it clean. Note, The greater 
 profession of religion any house or family make the more they are 
 obliged to <I>put away iniquity far from their tabernacle,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:23">Job xxii. 23</A>.

 The person, the place, <I>in the midst of which God dwells,</I> must
 not be defiled; for, if it be, he will be affronted, offended, and 
 provoked to withdraw, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16,17">1 Cor. iii. 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This expulsion of the unclean out of the camp was to signify, 

 (1.) What the governors of the church ought to do: they must
 <I>separate between the precious and the vile,</I> and purge out 
 scandalous persons, as old leaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:8,13">1 Cor. v. 8, 13</A>),

 lest others should be infected and defiled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>.

 It is for the glory of Christ and the edification of his church that
 those who are openly and incorrigibly profane and vicious should be put 
 out and kept from Christian communion till they repent.

 (2.) What God himself will do in the great day: he will <I>thoroughly
 purge his floor,</I> and <I>gather out of his kingdom all things that 
 offend.</I> As here the unclean were shut out of the camp, so into the 
 new Jerusalem <I>no unclean thing shall enter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:27">Rev. xxi. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law concerning restitution, in case of wrong done to a neighbour. 
 It is called <I>a sin that men commit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 because it is common among men; <I>a sin of man,</I> that is, <I>a sin 
 against man,</I> so it is thought it should be translated and 
 understood. If a man overreach or defraud his brother in any matter, it 
 is to be looked upon as a trespass against the Lord, who is the 
 protector of right, the punisher of wrong, and who strictly charges and 
 commands us to do justly. Now what is to be done when a man's awakened 
 conscience charges him with guilt of this kind, and brings it to his 
 remembrance though done long ago?

 1. He must <I>confess his sin,</I> confess it to God, confess it to his 
 neighbour, and so take shame to himself. If he have denied it before, 
 though it go against the grain to own himself in a lie, yet he must do 
 it; because his heart was hardened he denied it, therefore he has no 
 other way of making it appear that his heart is now softened but by 
 confessing it. 

 2. He must bring a sacrifice, a <I>ram of atonement,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Satisfaction must be made for the offence done to God, whose law is 
 broken, as well as for the loss sustained by our neighbour; restitution 
 in this case is not sufficient without faith and repentance. 

 3.  Yet the sacrifices would not be accepted till full amends were made
 to the party wronged, not only the principal, but a fifth part added to 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:7"><I>v.</I>  7</A>.

 It is certain that while that which is got by injustice is knowingly 
 retained in the hands the guilt of the injustice remains upon the 
 conscience, and is not purged by sacrifice nor offering, prayers not 
 tears, for it is one and the same continued act of sin persisted in.  
 This law we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:4">Lev. vi. 4</A>),

 and it is here added that if the party wronged was dead, and he had no
 near kinsman who was entitled to the debt, or if it was any way 
 uncertain to whom the restitution should be made, this should not serve 
 for an excuse to detain what was unjustly gotten; to whomsoever it 
 pertained, it was certainly none of his that got it by sin, and 
 therefore it must be given to the priest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 If there were any that could make out a title to it, it must not be 
 given to the priest (God hates robbery for burnt-offerings); but, if 
 there were not, then it lapsed to the great Lord (<I>ob defectum 
 sanguinis--for want of issue</I>), and the priests were his receivers.
 Note, Some work of piety or charity is a piece of necessary justice to 
 be done by those who are conscience to themselves that they have done 
 wrong, but know not how otherwise to make restitution; what is not our 
 property will never be our profit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A general rule concerning hallowed things given upon this 
 occasion, that, whatever was given to the priest, <I>his it shall 
 be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 1. He that gave it was not to receive his gift again upon any pretence 
 whatsoever. This law ratifies and confirms all grants for pious uses, 
 that people might not give things to the priests in a fit of zeal, and 
 then recall them in a fit of vexation. 

 2. The other priests should not come in sharers with that priest who
 then officiated, and to whom the hallowed thing, whatever it was, was 
 given.  Let him that was most ready and diligent in attending fare the 
 better for it: if he do the work, let him have the pay, and much good 
 may it do him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
 man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,
 &nbsp; 13 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
 of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and <I>there
 be</I> no witness against her, neither she be taken <I>with the
 manner;</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous
 of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
 come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
 defiled:
 &nbsp; 15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
 shall bring her offering for her, the tenth <I>part</I> of an ephah of
 barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense
 thereon; for it <I>is</I> an offering of jealousy, an offering of
 memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
 &nbsp; 16 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;
 and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
 shall take, and put <I>it</I> into the water:
 &nbsp; 18 And the priest shall set the woman before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her
 hands, which <I>is</I> the jealousy offering: and the priest shall
 have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:
 &nbsp; 19 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
 woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone
 aside to uncleanness <I>with another</I> instead of thy husband, be
 thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:
 &nbsp; 20 But if thou hast gone aside <I>to another</I> instead of thy
 husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
 beside thine husband:
 &nbsp; 21 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
 cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> make
 thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth
 make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;
 &nbsp; 22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
 bowels, to make <I>thy</I> belly to swell, and <I>thy</I> thigh to rot: And
 the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
 &nbsp; 23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
 shall blot <I>them</I> out with the bitter water:
 &nbsp; 24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
 causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
 enter into her, <I>and become</I> bitter.
 &nbsp; 25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
 woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 offer it upon the altar:
 &nbsp; 26 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, <I>even</I>
 the memorial thereof, and burn <I>it</I> upon the altar, and afterward
 shall cause the woman to drink the water.
 &nbsp; 27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
 come to pass, <I>that,</I> if she be defiled, and have done trespass
 against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall
 enter into her, <I>and become</I> bitter, and her belly shall swell,
 and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her
 people.
 &nbsp; 28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she
 shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
 &nbsp; 29 This <I>is</I> the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside <I>to
 another</I> instead of her husband, and is defiled;
 &nbsp; 30 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
 jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
 &nbsp; 31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this
 woman shall bear her iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the law concerning the solemn trial of a wife whose 
 husband was jealous of her.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What was the case supposed: That a man had some reason to suspect 
 his wife to have committed adultery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. The sin of adultery is justly represented as an exceedingly sinful
 sin; it is going aside from God and virtue, and the good way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:17">Prov. ii. 17</A>.

 It is committing a trespass against the husband, robbing him of his
 honour, alienating his right, introducing a spurious breed into his 
 family to share with his children in his estate, and violating her 
 covenant with him. It is being defiled; for nothing pollutes the mind 
 and conscience more than this sin does.

 2. It is supposed to be a sin which great care is taken by the sinners
 to conceal, which there is no witness of.  <I>The eye of the adulterer 
 waits for the twilight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15">Job xxiv. 15</A>.

 And the adulteress takes her opportunity when <I>the good man is not at
 home,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:19">Prov. vii. 19</A>.

 It would not covet to be secret if it were not shameful; and the devil
 who draws sinners to this sin teaches them how to cover it.

 3. The <I>spirit of jealousy</I> is supposed to come upon the husband,
 of which Solomon says, It is the <I>rage of a man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:34">Prov. vi. 34</A>),

 and that it is <I>cruel as the grave,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6">Cant. viii. 6</A>.

 4.  "Yet" (say the Jewish writers) "he must make it appear that he has
 some just cause for the suspicion." The rule they give is, "If the 
 husband have said unto his wife before witnesses, 'Be not thou in 
 secret with such a man;' and, notwithstanding that admonition, it is 
 afterwards proved that she was in secret with that man, though her 
 father or her brother, then he may compel her to drink the bitter 
 water." But the law here does not tie him to that particular method of 
 proving the just cause of his suspicion; it might be otherwise proved. 
 In case it could be proved that she had committed adultery, she was to 
 be put to death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:10">Lev. xx. 10</A>); 

 but, if it was uncertain, then this law took place.  Hence,

 (1.) Let all wives be admonished not to give any the least occasion for
 the suspicion of their chastity; it is not enough that they abstain 
 from the evil of uncleanness, but they must abstain from all appearance 
 of it, from every thing that looks like it, or leads to it, or may give 
 the least umbrage to jealousy; for <I>how great a matter</I> may a 
 <I>little fire kindle!</I>

 (2.) Let all husbands be admonished not to entertain any causeless or
 unjust suspicions of their wives. If charity in general, much more 
 conjugal affection, teaches to <I>think no evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:5">1 Cor. xiii. 5</A>.

 It is the happiness of the virtuous woman that <I>the heart of her
 husband does safely trust in her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:11">Prov. xxxi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was the course prescribed in this case, that, if the suspected 
 wife was innocent, she might not continue under the reproach and 
 uneasiness of her husband's jealousy, and, if guilty, her sin might 
 find her out, and others might hear, and fear, and take warning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The process of the trial must be thus:--

 (1.) Her husband must <I>bring her to the priest,</I> with the
 witnesses that could prove the ground of his suspicion, and desire that 
 she might be put upon her trial. The Jews say that the priest was first 
 to endeavour to persuade her to confess the truth, saying to this 
 purport, "Dear daughter, perhaps thou wast overtaken by drinking wine, 
 or wast carried away by the heat of youth or the examples of bad 
 neighbours; come, confess the truth, for the sake of his great name 
 which is described in the most sacred ceremony, and do not let it be 
 blotted out with the bitter water." If she confessed, saying, "I am 
 defiled," she was not put to death, but was divorced and lost her 
 dowry; if she said, "I am pure," then they proceeded.

 (2.) He must bring a coarse offering of barley-meal, without oil or
 frankincense, agreeably to the present afflicted state of his family; 
 for a great affliction it was either to have cause to be jealous or to 
 be jealous without cause.  It is an <I>offering of memorial,</I> to 
 signify that what was to be done was intended as a religious appeal to 
 the omniscience and justice of God.

 (3.) The priest was to prepare the water of jealousy, the holy water
 out of the laver at which the priests were to wash when they 
 ministered; this must be brought in an <I>earthen vessel,</I> 
 containing (they say) about a pint; and it must be an <I>earthen</I> 
 vessel, because the coarser and plainer every thing was the more 
 agreeable it was to the occasion.  <I>Dust</I> must be put into the 
 water, to signify the reproach she lay under, and the shame she ought 
 to take to herself, putting her mouth in the dust; but dust from <I>the 
 floor of the tabernacle,</I> to put an honour upon every thing that 
 pertained to the place God had chosen to put his name there, and to 
 keep up in the people a reverence for it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:6">John viii. 6</A>.

 (4.) The woman was to be <I>set before the Lord,</I> at the east gate
 of the temple-court (say the Jews), and her head was to be uncovered, 
 in token of her sorrowful condition; and there she stood for a 
 spectacle to the world, that other women might learn not to do <I>after 
 her lewdness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:48">Ezek. xxiii. 48</A>.

 Only the Jews say, "Her own servants were not to be present, that she
 might not seem vile in their sight, who were to give honour to her; her 
 husband also must be dismissed."

 (5.) The priest was to adjure her to tell the truth, and to denounce
 the curse of God against her if she were guilty, and to declare what 
 would be the effect of her drinking the water of jealousy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:19-22"><I>v.</I> 19-22</A>.

 He must assure her that, if she were innocent, the water would do her 
 no harm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 None need fear the curse of the law if they have not broken the 
 commands of the law. But, if she were guilty, this water would be 
 poison to her, it would make her <I>belly to swell and her thigh to 
 rot,</I> and she should be a curse or abomination among her people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 To this she must say, <I>Amen,</I> as Israel must do to the curses 
 pronounced on mount Ebal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:15-26">Deut. xxvii. 15-26</A>.

 Some think the <I>Amen,</I> being doubled, respects both parts of the
 adjuration, both that which freed her if innocent and that which 
 condemned her if guilty. No woman, if she were guilty, could say 
 <I>Amen</I> to this adjuration, and drink the water upon it, unless she 
 disbelieved the truth of God or defied his justice, and had come to 
 such a pitch of impudence and hard-heartedness in sin as to challenge 
 God Almighty to do his worst, and choose rather to venture upon his 
 curse than to give him glory by making confession; thus has whoredom 
 <I>taken away the heart.</I>

 (6.) The priest was to write this curse in a scrip or scroll o
 parchment, <I>verbatim--word for word,</I> as he had expressed it, and
 then to wipe or scrape out what he had written into the water 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 to signify that it was that curse which impregnated the water, and gave 
 it its strength to effect what was intended. It signified that, if she 
 were innocent, the curse should be blotted out and never appear against 
 her, as it is written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:25">Isa. xliii. 25</A>,

 <I>I am he that blotteth out thy transgression,</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:9">Ps. li. 9</A>,

 <I>Blot out my iniquities;</I> but that, if she were guilty, the curse,
 as it was written, being infused into the water, would enter into her 
 bowels with the water, even <I>like oil into her bones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:18">Ps. cix. 18</A>),

 as we read of a curse entering into a house,

 (7.) The woman must then drink the water 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 it is called <I>the bitter water,</I> some think because they put 
 wormwood in it to make it bitter, or rather because it caused the 
 curse. Thus sin is called <I>an evil thing and a bitter</I> for the 
 same reason, because it <I>causeth the curse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:19">Jer. ii. 19</A>.

 If she had been guilty (and otherwise it did not cause the curse), she
 was made to know that though her stolen waters had been sweet, and her 
 <I>bread eaten in secret pleasant,</I> yet the end was <I>bitter as 
 wormwood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:17">Prov. ix. 17</A>,

 and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>.

 Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures know that they will be
 bitterness in the latter end. The Jews say that if, upon denouncing the 
 curse, the woman was so terrified that she durst not drink the water, 
 but confessed she was defiled, the priest flung down the water, and 
 cast her offering among the ashes, and she was divorced without dowry: 
 if she confessed not, and yet would not drink, they forced her to it; 
 and, if she was ready to throw it up again, they hastened her away, 
 that she might not pollute the holy place.

 (8.) Before she drank the water, the jealousy-offering was waved and
 offered upon the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>);

 a handful of it was burnt for a memorial, and the remainder of it eaten
 by the priest, unless the husband was a priest, and then it was 
 scattered among the ashes. This offering in the midst of the 
 transaction signified that the whole was an appeal to God, as a God 
 that knows all things, and <I>from whom no secret is hid.</I>

 (9.) All things being thus performed according to the law, they were to
 wait the issue. The water, with a little dust put into it, and the 
 scrapings of a written parchment, had no natural tendency at all to do 
 either good or hurt; but if God was thus appealed to in the way of an 
 instituted ordinance, though otherwise the innocent might have 
 continued under suspicion and the guilty undiscovered, yet God would so 
 far own his own institution as that in a little time, by the miraculous 
 operation of Providence, the innocency of the innocent should be 
 cleared, and the sin of the guilty should find them out. 

 [1.] If the suspected woman was really guilty, the water she drank
 would be poison to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 her belly would swell and her thigh rot by a vile disease for vile 
 deserts, and she would <I>mourn at the last when her flesh and body 
 were consumed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:11">Prov. v. 11</A>.

 Bishop Patrick says, from some of the Jewish writers, that the effect
 of these waters appeared immediately, she grew pale, and her eyes ready 
 to start out of her head. Dr. Lightfoot says that sometimes it appeared 
 not for two or three years, but she bore no children, was sickly, 
 languished, and rotted at last; it is probable that some indications 
 appeared immediately. The rabbin say that the adulterer also died in 
 the same day and hour that the adulteress did, and in the same manner 
 too, that he belly swelled, and his secret parts rotted: a disease 
 perhaps not much unlike that which in these latter ages the avenging 
 hand of a righteous God has made the scourge of uncleanness, and with 
 which whores and whoremongers infect, and plague, and ruin one another, 
 since they escape punishment from men. The Jewish doctors add that the 
 waters had this effect upon the adulteress only in case the husband had 
 never offended in the same kind; but that, if he had at any time 
 defiled the marriage-bed, God did not thus right him against his 
 injurious wife; and that therefore in the latter and degenerate ages of 
 the Jewish church, when uncleanness did abound, this way of trial was 
 generally disused and laid aside; men, knowing their own crimes, were 
 content not to know their wives' crimes. And to this perhaps may refer 
 the threatening 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14">Hos. iv. 14</A>),

 <I>I will not punish your spouses when they commit adultery, for you
 yourselves are separated with whores.</I>

 [2.] If she were innocent, the water she drank would be physic to her:
 <I>She shall be free, and shall conceive seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The Jewish writers magnify the good effects of this water to the 
 innocent woman, that, to recompense her for the wrong done to her by 
 the suspicion, she should, after the drinking of these waters, be 
 stronger and look better than ever; if she was sickly, she should 
 become healthful, should bear a man-child, and have easy labour.</P>

 2. From the whole we may learn, 

 (1.) That secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely 
 brought to light in this life; however, there is a day coming when God 
 will, by Jesus Christ, as here by the priest, judge the <I>secrets of 
 men according to the gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16">Rom. ii. 16</A>.

 (2.) That, in particular, <I>Whoremongers and adulterers God will 
 judge.</I> The violation of conjugal faith and chastity is highly 
 provoking to the God of heaven, and sooner or later it will be reckoned 
 for. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy to be a sensible 
 terror to the unclean, yet we have a word from God which ought to be as 
 great a terror, that if <I>any man defile the temple of God, him shall 
 God destroy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:17">1 Cor. iii. 17</A>.

 (3.) That God will find out some way or other to clear the innocency of 
 the innocent, and to bring forth their righteousness as the light.

 (4.) That to <I>the pure all things are pure,</I> but <I>to the defiled
 nothing</I> is so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 The same word is to some a <I>savour of life unto life, to others a
 savour of death unto death,</I> like those waters of jealousy, 
 according as they receive it; the same providence is for good to some 
 and for hurt to others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5,8,9">Jer. xxiv. 5, 8, 9</A>.

 And, whatsoever it is intended for, it <I>shall not return
 void.</I></P>
