 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have an account of the increase,

 I. Of Jacob's
 family. Eight children more we find registered in this chapter;
 Dan and Naphtali by Bilhah, Rachel's maid,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.
 Gad and Asher by Zilpah, Leah's maid,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.
 Issachar, Zebulun, 
 and Dinah, by Leah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.
 And, last of all, Joseph,
 by Rachel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.
 
 II. Of Jacob's estate. He makes a new 
 bargain with Laban,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:25-34">ver. 25-34</A>.
 And in the six years' further 
 service he did to Laban God wonderfully blessed him, so that 
 his stock of cattle became very considerable,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:35-43">ver. 35-43</A>.
 Herein was fulfilled the blessing with which Isaac dismissed him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:3"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 3</A>),
 "God make thee fruitful, and multiply thee." Even 
 these small matters concerning Jacob's house and field, though 
 they seem inconsiderable, are improvable for our learning. For 
 the scriptures were written, not for princes and statesmen, to 
 instruct them in politics; but for all people, even the meanest, 
 to direct them in their families and callings: yet some things 
 are here recorded concerning Jacob, not for imitation, but for 
 admonition.</P>

 1 And when Rachel saw that she 
 bare Jacob no children, Rachel
 envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, 
 Give me children, or else I die.
 &nbsp; 2 And Jacob's anger was kindled 
 against Rachel: and he said, <I>Am</I> I in 
 God's stead, who hath withheld from 
 thee the fruit of the womb?
 &nbsp; 3 And 
 she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go 
 in unto her; and she shall bear upon 
 my knees, that I may also have children 
 by her.
 &nbsp; 4 And she gave him 
 Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob 
 went in unto her.
 &nbsp; 5 And Bilhah 
 conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
 &nbsp; 6 And Rachel said, God hath judged 
 me, and hath also heard my voice, 
 and hath given me a son: therefore 
 called she his name Dan.
 &nbsp; 7 And Bilhah 
 Rachel's maid conceived again, and 
 bare Jacob a second son.
 &nbsp; 8 And Rachel 
 said, With great wrestlings have I 
 wrestled with my sister, and I have 
 prevailed: and she called his name
 Naphtali.
 &nbsp; 9 When Leah saw that she 
 had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
 maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
 &nbsp; 10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a 
 son.
 &nbsp; 11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: 
 and she called his name Gad.
 &nbsp; 12 And 
 Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second 
 son.
 &nbsp; 13 And Leah said, Happy 
 am I, for the daughters will call me
 blessed: and she called his name Asher.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the bad consequences of that 
 strange marriage which Jacob made with the 
 two sisters. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An unhappy disagreement between him 
 and Rachel
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),
 occasioned, not so much 
 by her own barrenness as by her sister's fruitfulness. 
 Rebekah, the only wife of Isaac, 
 was long childless, and yet we find no uneasiness 
 between her and Isaac; but here, 
 because Leah bears children, Rachel cannot 
 live peaceably with Jacob.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Rachel frets. She <I>envied her sister,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Envy is grieving at the good of another, than 
 which no sin is more offensive to God, nor 
 more injurious to our neighbour and ourselves. 
 She considered not that it was God 
 that made the difference, and that though, in 
 this single instance her sister was preferred 
 before her, yet in other things she had the 
 advantage. Let us carefully watch against 
 all the risings and workings of this passion 
 in our minds. Let not our eye be evil 

 <A NAME="Page179"> </A>

 towards any of our fellow-servants because our 
 master's is good. But this was not all; she 
 said to Jacob, <I>Give me children, or else I die.</I> 
 Note, We are very apt to err in our desires 
 of temporal mercies, as Rachel here. 
 
 (1.) One child would not content her; but, because
 Leah has more than one, she must have 
 more too: <I>Give me children.</I> 
 
 (2.) Her heart 
 is inordinately set upon it, and, if she have 
 not what she would have, she will throw 
 away her life, and all the comforts of it. 
 "Give them to me, or <I>else I die,</I>" that is, "I 
 shall fret myself to death; the want of this 
 satisfaction will shorten my days." Some 
 think she threatens Jacob to lay violent hands 
 upon herself, if she could not obtain this 
 mercy. 
 
 (3.) She did not apply to God by 
 prayer, but to Jacob only, forgetting that 
 <I>children are a heritage of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:3">Ps. cxxvii. 3</A>.
 We wrong both God and ourselves 
 when our eye is more to men, the instruments 
 of our crosses and comforts, than to 
 God the author. Observe a difference between 
 Rachel's asking for this mercy and 
 Hannah's,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:10,11">1 Sam. i. 10</A>,
 &c. Rachel envied; 
 Hannah wept. Rachel must have children, 
 and she died of the second; Hannah prayed 
 for one child, and she had four more. Rachel 
 is importunate and peremptory; Hannah 
 is submissive and devout. <I>If thou wilt 
 give me a child, I will give him to the Lord.</I> 
 Let Hannah be imitated, and not Rachel; 
 and let our desires be always under the direction 
 and control of reason and religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jacob chides, and most justly. He loved 
 Rachel, and therefore reproved her for what 
 she said amiss,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 Note, Faithful reproofs 
 and products and instances of true affection, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5,Pr+27:5,6">Ps. cxli. 5; Prov. xxvii. 5, 6</A>.
 Job reproved 
 his wife when she spoke the language of the 
 foolish women, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:10">Job ii. 10</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:16">1 Cor. vii. 16</A>.
 He was angry, not at the person, but at the 
 sin; he expressed himself so as to show his 
 displeasure. Note, sometimes it is requisite 
 that a reproof should be given warm, like a 
 medical potion; not too hot, lest it scald the 
 patient; yet not cold, lest it prove ineffectual. 
 It was a very grave and pious reply which 
 Jacob gave to Rachel's peevish demand: <I>Am 
 I in God's stead?</I> The Chaldee paraphrases 
 it well, <I>Dost thou ask sons of me? Oughtest 
 thou not to ask them from before the Lord?</I> 
 The Arabic reads it, "<I>Am I above God?</I> can 
 I give thee that which God denies thee?" 
 This was said like a plain man. Observe, 
 
 (1.) He acknowledges the hand of God in the 
 affliction which he was a sharer with her in: 
 He <I>hath withheld the fruit of the womb.</I> Note, 
 Whatever we want, it is God that withholds 
 it, a sovereign Lord, most wise, holy, and 
 just, that may do what he will with his own, 
 and is debtor to no man, that never did, nor 
 ever can do, any wrong to any of his creatures. 
 The keys of the clouds, of the heart, 
 of the grave, and of the womb, are four keys 
 which God had in his hand, and which (the 
 rabbin say) he entrusts neither with angels 
 nor seraphim. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7,Job+11:10,12:14">Rev. iii. 7. Job xi. 10; xii. 14</A>.

 (2.) He acknowledges his own inability 
 to alter what God had appointed: 
 "<I>Am I in God's stead?</I> What! dost thou 
 make a god of me?" <I>Deos qui rogat ille 
 facit--He to whom we offer supplications is to 
 us a god.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] There is no creature 
 that is, or can be, to us, in God's stead. God 
 may be to us instead of any creature, as the 
 sun instead of the moon and stars; but the 
 moon and all the stars will not be to us instead 
 of the sun. No creature's wisdom, 
 power, and love, will be to us instead of God's.
 
 [2.] It is therefore our sin and folly to place 
 any creature in God's stead, and to place 
 that confidence in any creature which is to be 
 placed in God only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An unhappy agreement between him 
 and the two handmaids.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. At the persuasion of Rachel, he took 
 Bilhah her handmaid to wife, that, according 
 to the usage of those times, his children by 
 her might be adopted and owned as her mistress's 
 children,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:3-8"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,
 &c. She would rather 
 have children by reputation than none at all, 
 children that she might fancy to be her own, 
 and call her own, though they were not so. 
 One would think her own sister's children 
 were nearer akin to her than her maid's, and 
 she might with more satisfaction have made 
 them her own if she had so pleased; but (so 
 natural is it for us all to be fond of power) 
 children that she had a right to rule were 
 more desirable to her than children that she 
 had more reason to love; and, as an early 
 instance of her dominion over the children 
 born in her apartment, she takes a pleasure
 in giving them names that carry in them nothing 
 but marks of emulation with her sister, 
 as if she had overcome her, 
 
 (1.) At law. She 
 calls the first son of her handmaid <I>Dan</I> (<I>judgement</I>), 
 saying, "<I>God hath judged me</I>"
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 that is, "given sentence in my favour." 

 (2.) In battle. She calls the next <I>Naphtali</I> (<I>wrestlings</I>),
 saying, <I>I have wrestled with my sister, 
 and have prevailed</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);
 as if all Jacob's 
 sons must be born men of contention. See
 what roots of bitterness envy and strife are, 
 and what mischief they make among relations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. At the persuasion of Leah, he took 
 Zilpah her handmaid to wife also,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Rachel had done that absurd and preposterous 
 thing of giving her maid to her husband, in 
 emulation with Leah; and now Leah (because 
 she missed one year in bearing children) does 
 the same, to be even with her, or rather to 
 keep before her. See the power of jealousy 
 and rivalship, and admire the wisdom of the 
 divine appointment, which unites one man 
 and one woman only; for <I>God hath called us 
 to peace</I> and purity,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:15">1 Cor. vii. 15</A>.
 Two sons 
 Zilpah bore to Jacob, whom Leah looked 
 upon herself as entitled to, in token of which 
 she called one <I>Gad</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 promising herself 
 a little <I>troop</I> of children; and children are 
 the militia of a family, they fill the quiver, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:4,5">Ps. cxxvii. 4, 5</A>.
 The other she called <I>Asher</I> 
 
 <A NAME="Page180"> </A>

 (<I>happy</I>), thinking herself happy in him, and 
 promising herself that her neighbours would 
 think so too: <I>The daughters will call me 
 blessed,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Note, It is an instance of the 
 vanity of the world, and the foolishness bound 
 up in our hearts, that most people value 
 themselves and govern themselves more by 
 reputation than either by reason or religion; 
 they think themselves blessed if the daughters 
 do but call them so. There was much amiss 
 in the contest and competition between these 
 two sisters, yet God brought good out of this 
 evil; for, the time being now at hand when 
 the seed of Abraham must begin to increase 
 and multiply, thus Jacob's family was replenished 
 with twelve sons, heads of the 
 thousands of Israel, from whom the celebrated 
 twelve tribes descended and were named.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And Reuben went in the days 
 of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes 
 in the field, and brought them unto 
 his mother Leah. Then Rachel said 
 to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy 
 son's mandrakes.
 &nbsp; 15 And she said 
 unto her, <I>Is it</I> a small matter that thou 
 hast taken my husband? and wouldest 
 thou take away my son's mandrakes
 also? And Rachel said, Therefore he 
 shall lie with thee to night for thy 
 son's mandrakes.
 &nbsp; 16 And Jacob came 
 out of the field in the evening, and 
 Leah went out to meet him, and said, 
 Thou must come in unto me; for
 surely I have hired thee with my son's 
 mandrakes. And he lay with her that 
 night.
 &nbsp; 17 And God hearkened unto 
 Leah, and she conceived, and bare
 Jacob the fifth son.
 &nbsp; 18 And Leah said, 
 God hath given me my hire, because 
 I have given my maiden to my husband: 
 and she called his name Issachar.
 &nbsp; 19 And Leah conceived again, 
 and bare Jacob the sixth son.
 &nbsp; 20 And 
 Leah said, God hath endued me <I>with</I> 
 a good dowry; now will my husband 
 dwell with me, because I have borne 
 him six sons: and she called his name 
 Zebulun.
 &nbsp; 21 And afterwards she bare 
 a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
 &nbsp; 22 And God remembered Rachel, and 
 God hearkened to her, and opened 
 her womb.
 &nbsp; 23 And she conceived, and 
 bare a son; and said, God hath taken
 away my reproach:
 &nbsp; 24 And she called 
 his name Joseph; and said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 shall add to me another son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. Leah fruitful again, after she 
 had, for some time, left off bearing. Jacob, 
 it should seem, associated more with Rachel 
 than with Leah. The law of Moses supposes 
 it a common case that, if a man had two wives, 
 one would be beloved and the other hated, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:15">Deut. xxi. 15</A>.
 But at length Rachel's strong 
 passions betrayed her into a bargain with 
 Leah that Jacob should return to her apartment. 
 Reuben, a little lad, five or six years 
 old, playing in the field, found <I>mandrakes, 
 dudaim.</I> It is uncertain what they were, the 
 critics are not agreed about them; we are 
 sure they were some rarities, either fruits or 
 flowers that were very pleasant to the smell, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:13">Cant. vii. 13</A>.
 Note, The God of nature has 
 provided, not only for our necessities, but for 
 our delights; there are products of the earth 
 in the exposed fields, as well as in the planted 
 protected gardens, that are very valuable and 
 useful. How plentifully is nature's house 
 furnished and her table spread! Her precious 
 fruits offer themselves to be gathered by the 
 hands of little children. It is a laudable 
 custom of the devout Jews, when they find 
 pleasure, suppose in eating an apple, to lift 
 up their hearts, and say, "Blessed be he that 
 made this fruit pleasant!" Or, in smelling 
 a flower, "Blessed be he that made this flower 
 sweet." Some think these mandrakes were 
 jessamine flowers. Whatever they were, 
 Rachel could not see them in Leah's hands, 
 where the child had placed them, but she 
 must covet them. She cannot bear the want 
 of these pretty flowers, but will purchase them 
 at any rate. Note, There may be great sin 
 and folly in the inordinate desire of a small 
 thing. Leah takes this advantage (as Jacob 
 had of Esau's coveting his red pottage) to 
 obtain that which was justly due to her, but 
 to which Rachel would not otherwise have consented. 
 Note, Strong passions often thwart 
 one another, and those cannot but be continually 
 uneasy that are hurried on by them. 
 Leah is overjoyed that she shall have her 
 husband's company again, that her family 
 might yet further be built up, which is the 
 blessing she desires and devoutly prays 
 for, as is intimated,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,
 where it is said, 
 <I>God hearkened unto Leah.</I> The learned bishop 
 Patrick very well suggests here that the true 
 reason of this contest between Jacob's wives
 for his company, and their giving him their 
 maids to be his wives, was the earnest desire 
 they had to fulfil the promise made to Abraham 
 (and now lately renewed to Jacob), that 
 his seed should be as the stars of heaven for 
 multitude, and that in one seed of his, the 
 Messiah, all the nations of the earth should 
 be blessed. And he thinks it would have 
 been below the dignity of this sacred history 
 to take such particular notice of these things 
 if there had not been some such great consideration 
 in them. Leah was now blessed 
 with two sons; the first she called <I>Issachar</I> 
 (<I>a hire</I>), reckoning herself well repaid for her 
 mandrakes, nay (which is a strange construction 
 of the providence) rewarded for 
 giving her maid to her husband. Note, We 
 
 <A NAME="Page181"> </A>

 abuse God's mercy when we reckon that his 
 favours countenance and patronize our follies. 
 The other she called <I>Zebulun</I> (<I>dwelling</I>), owning 
 God's bounty to her: <I>God has endowed me 
 with a good dowry,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 Jacob had not endowed 
 her when he married her, nor had he 
 wherewithal in possession; but she reckons 
 a family of children not a bill of charges, but 
 a good dowry, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:9">Ps. cxiii. 9</A>.
 She promises 
 herself more of her husband's company now 
 that she had borne him six sons, and that, in 
 love to his children at least, he would often 
 visit her lodgings. Mention is made
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)
 of the birth of a daughter, <I>Dinah,</I> because of 
 the following story concerning her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv</A>.
 Perhaps Jacob had other daughters, though 
 their names are not registered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Rachel fruitful at last
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 <I>God remembered 
 Rachel,</I> whom he seemed to have 
 forgotten, and <I>hearkened to her</I> whose prayers 
 had been long denied; and then she bore a 
 son. Note, As God justly denies the mercy 
 we have been inordinately desirous of, so 
 sometimes he graciously grants, at length, 
 that which we have long waited for. He 
 corrects our folly, and yet considers our 
 frame, and does not contend for ever. Rachel 
 called her son <I>Joseph,</I> which in Hebrew is 
 akin to two words of a contrary signification, 
 <I>Asaph</I> (<I>abstulit</I>), <I>He has taken away my reproach,</I> 
 as if the greatest mercy she had in 
 this son was that she had saved her credit; 
 and <I>Jasaph</I> (<I>addidit</I>), <I>The Lord shall add to 
 me another son,</I> which may be looked upon
 either as the language of her inordinate desire 
 (she scarcely knows how to be thankful 
 for one unless she may be sure of another), 
 or of her faith--she takes this mercy as an 
 earnest of further mercy. "Has God given 
 me his grace? I may call it Joseph, and say, 
 He shall add more grace! Has he given me 
 his joy? I may call it Joseph, and say, He 
 will give me more joy. Has he begun, and 
 shall he not make an end?"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And it came to pass, when Rachel

 unto Laban, Send me away, that I

 my country.
 &nbsp; 26 Give <I>me</I> my wives

 &nbsp; 28 And he 
 said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will 
 give <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 29 And he said unto him, 
 Thou knowest how I have served thee,
 and how thy cattle was with me.
 &nbsp; 30 For <I>it was</I> little which thou hadst before 
 I <I>came,</I> and it is <I>now</I> increased 
 unto a multitude; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath 
 blessed thee since my coming: and 
 now when shall I provide for mine 
 own house also?
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, 
 What shall I give thee? And Jacob 
 said, Thou shalt not give me anything: 
 if thou wilt do this thing for me, I
 will again feed <I>and</I> keep thy flock:
 &nbsp; 32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, 
 removing from thence all the speckled 
 and spotted cattle, and all the brown
 cattle among the sheep, and the spotted 
 and speckled among the goats: and 
 <I>of such</I> shall be my hire.
 &nbsp; 33 So shall 
 my righteousness answer for me in 
 time to come, when it shall come for 
 my hire before thy face: every one 
 that <I>is</I> not speckled and spotted among 
 the goats, and brown among the sheep, 
 that shall be counted stolen with me.
 &nbsp; 34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it 
 might be according to thy word.
 &nbsp; 35 And he removed that day the he goats 
 that were ringstraked and spotted, and 
 all the she goats that were speckled and
 spotted, <I>and</I> every one that had <I>some</I> 
 white in it, and all the brown among 
 the sheep, and gave <I>them</I> into the hand 
 of his sons.
 &nbsp; 36 And he set three days' 
 journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and 
 Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jacob's thoughts of home. He faithfully 
 served his time out with Laban, even 
 his second apprenticeship, though he was an 
 old man, had a large family to provide for, 
 and it was high time for him to set up for 
 himself. Though Laban's service was hard,
 and he had cheated him in the first bargain 
 he had made, yet Jacob honestly performs 
 his engagements. Note, A good man, though 
 he swear to his own hurt, will not change. 
 And though others have deceived us this 
 will not justify us in deceiving them. Our 
 rule is to do as we <I>would be</I> done by, not as 
 we <I>are</I> done by. Jacob's term having expired, 
 he begs leave to be gone,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. He retained his affection for the land 
 of Canaan, not only because it was the land 
 of his nativity, and his father and mother were 
 there, whom he longed to see, but because it 
 was the land of promise; and, in token of his 
 dependence upon the promise of it, though he 
 sojourn in Haran he can by no means think 
 of settling there. Thus should we be affected 
 towards our heavenly country, looking upon 
 ourselves as strangers here, viewing the 
 heavenly country as our home, and longing 
 to be there, as soon as the days of our service 
 upon earth are numbered and finished. 
 
 <A NAME="Page182"> </A>

 We must not think of taking root here, for 
 this is not our place and country, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:14">Heb. xiii. 14</A>.

 2. He was desirous to go to Canaan, 
 though he had a great family to take with 
 him, and no provision yet made for them. 
 He had got wives and children with Laban, 
 but nothing else; yet he does not solicit 
 Laban to give him either a portion with his 
 wives or the maintenance of some of his 
 children. No, all his request is, <I>Give me my 
 wives and my children, and send me away,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 Note, Those that trust in God, in 
 his providence and promise, though they 
 have great families and small incomes, can 
 cheerfully hope that he who sends mouths 
 will send meat. He who feeds the brood of 
 the ravens will not starve the seed of the 
 righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Laban's desire of his stay,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 In love to himself, not to Jacob or to his wives 
 or children, Laban endeavours to persuade 
 him to continue his chief shepherd, entreating 
 him, by the regard he bore him, not to 
 leave him: <I>If I have found favour in thy eyes, 
 tarry.</I> Note, Churlish selfish men know 
 how to give good words when it is to serve 
 their own ends. Laban found that his stock 
 had wonderfully increased with Jacob's good 
 management, and he owns it, with very good 
 expressions of respect both to God and Jacob: 
 <I>I have learned by experience that the Lord has 
 blessed me for thy sake.</I> Observe, 
 
 1. Laban's 
 learning: <I>I have learned by experience.</I> Note, 
 There is many a profitable good lesson to be 
 learned by experience. We are very unapt 
 scholars if we have not learned by experience 
 the evil of sin, the treachery of our own 
 hearts, the vanity of the world, the goodness 
 of God, the gains of godliness, and the like. 
 
 2. Laban's lesson. He owns, 
 
 (1.) That his 
 prosperity was owing to God's blessing: <I>The 
 Lord has blessed me.</I> Note, worldly men, 
 who choose their portion in this life, are often 
 blessed with an abundance of this world's 
 goods. Common blessings are given plentifully 
 to many that have no title to covenant-blessings. 
 
 (3.) That Jacob's piety had 
 brought that blessing upon him: <I>The Lord 
 has blessed me,</I> not for my own sake (let not 
 such a man as Laban, that lives without God 
 in the world, <I>think that he shall receive any
 thing of the Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:7">Jam. i. 7</A>),
 but <I>for thy 
 sake.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] Good men are blessings to 
 the places where they live, even where they 
 live meanly and obscurely, as Jacob in the 
 field, and Joseph in the prison,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:23"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 23</A>.
 
 [2.] God often blesses bad men with outward 
 mercies for the sake of their godly relations, 
 though it is seldom that they have either the 
 wit to see it or the grace to own it, as Laban 
 did here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The new bargain they came upon. 
 Laban's craft and covetousness took advantage 
 of Jacob's plainness, honesty, and good-nature; 
 and, perceiving that Jacob began to 
 be won upon by his fair speeches, instead of 
 making him a generous offer and bidding
 high, as he ought to have done, all things 
 considered, he puts it upon him to make 
 his demands
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 <I>Appoint me thy wages,</I> 
 knowing he would be very modest in them, 
 and would ask less than he could for shame 
 offer. Jacob accordingly makes a proposal 
 to him, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows what reason he had to insist 
 upon so much, considering, 
 
 (1.) That Laban 
 was bound in gratitude to do well for him, 
 because he had served him not only faithfully, 
 but very successfully,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 Yet here 
 observe how he speaks, like himself, very 
 modestly. Laban had said, <I>The Lord has 
 blessed me for thy sake;</I> Jacob will not say 
 so, but, <I>The Lord has blessed thee since my 
 coming.</I> Note, Humble saints take more 
 pleasure in doing good than in hearing of it 
 again. 
 
 (2.) That he himself was bound in 
 duty to take care of his own family: <I>Now, 
 when shall I provide for my own house also?</I> 
 Note, Faith and charity, though they are 
 excellent things, must not take us off from 
 making necessary provisions for our own 
 support, and the support of our families. 
 We must, like Jacob, <I>trust in the Lord and 
 do good,</I> and yet we must, like him, provide 
 for our own houses also; he that does not the 
 latter <I>is worse than an infidel,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:8">1 Tim. v. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is willing to refer himself to the 
 providence of God, which, he knew, extends 
 itself to the smallest things, even the colour 
 of the cattle; and he will be content to have 
 for his wages the sheep and goats of such 
 and such a colour, speckled, spotted, and 
 brown, which should hereafter be brought 
 forth,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.
 This, he thinks, will be a 
 most effectual way both to prevent Laban's 
 cheating him and to secure himself from 
 being suspected of cheating Laban. Some 
 think he chose this colour because in Canaan 
 it was generally most desired and delighted 
 in; their shepherds in Canaan are called 
 <I>Nekohim</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:1">Amos i. 1</A>),
 the word here used for 
 <I>speckled;</I> and Laban was willing to consent 
 to this bargain because he thought if the few 
 he has that were now speckled and spotted 
 were separated from the rest, which by agreement 
 was to be done immediately, the body 
 of the flock which Jacob was to tend, being 
 of one colour, either all black or all white, 
 would produce few or none of mixed colours, 
 and so he should have Jacob's service for 
 nothing, or next to nothing. According to 
 this bargain, those few that were party-coloured 
 were separated, and put into the 
 hands of Laban's sons, and sent three days' 
 journey off; so great was Laban's jealously 
 lest any of them should mix with the rest of 
 the flock, to the advantage of Jacob. And 
 now a fine bargain Jacob has made for 
 himself! Is this his providing for his own 
 house, to put it upon such an uncertainty? 
 If these cattle bring forth, as usually cattle 
 do, young ones of the same colour with themselves, 
 he must still serve for nothing, and 
 be a drudge and a beggar all the days of his 
 
 <A NAME="Page183"> </A>

 life; but he knows whom he has trusted, and 
 the event showed, 
 
 (1.) That he took the best 
 way that could be taken with Laban, who
 otherwise would certainly have been too hard 
 for him. And, 
 
 (2.) That it was not in vain 
 to rely upon the divine providence, which 
 owns and blesses honest humble diligence. 
 Those that find men whom they deal with 
 unjust and unkind shall not find God so, 
 but, some way or other, he will recompense 
 the injured, and be a good pay-master to 
 those that commit their cause to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37 And Jacob took him rods of 
 green poplar, and of the hazel and 
 chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes 
 in them, and made the white appear 
 which <I>was</I> in the rods.
 &nbsp; 38 And he 
 set the rods which he had pilled before 
 the flocks in the gutters in the 
 watering troughs when the flocks came 
 to drink, that they should conceive 
 when they came to drink.
 &nbsp; 39 And 
 the flocks conceived before the rods, 
 and brought forth cattle ringstraked, 
 speckled, and spotted.
 &nbsp; 40 And Jacob 
 did separate the lambs, and set 
 the faces of the
 flocks toward the ringstraked, 
 and all the brown in the flock 
 of Laban; and he put his own flocks 
 by themselves, and put them not unto 
 Laban's cattle.
 &nbsp; 41 And it came to 
 pass, whensoever the stronger cattle 
 did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods 
 before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, 
 that they might conceive among 
 the rods.
 &nbsp; 42 But when the cattle 
 were feeble, he put <I>them</I> not in: so the 
 feebler were Laban's, and the stronger 
 Jacob's.
 &nbsp; 43 And the man increased 
 exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
 maidservants, and menservants, and 
 camels, and asses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is Jacob's honest policy to make his 
 bargain more advantageous to himself than 
 it was likely to be. If he had not taken 
 some course to help himself, it would have 
 been a bad bargain indeed, which he knew 
 Laban would never consider, or rather would
 be well pleased to see him a loser by, so little 
 did Laban consult any one's interest but his 
 own. Now Jacob's contrivances were, 
 
 1. To set peeled sticks before the cattle where 
 they were watered, that, looking much at 
 those unusual party-coloured sticks, by the 
 power of imagination they might bring forth 
 young ones in like manner party-coloured,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>.
 Probably this custom was commonly 
 used by the shepherds of Canaan, 
 who coveted to have their cattle of this 
 motley colour. Note, It becomes a man to 
 be master of his trade, whatever it is, and to 
 be not only industrious, but ingenious in it, 
 and to be versed in all its lawful arts and 
 mysteries; for what is a man but his trade? 
 There is a discretion which God teaches the 
 husbandman (as plain a trade as that is), and 
 which he ought to learn, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:26">Isa. xxviii. 26</A>.

 2. When he began to have a stock of ringstraked 
 and brown, he contrived to set them 
 first, and to put the faces of the rest towards 
 them, with the same design as in the former 
 contrivance; but would not let his own, that 
 were of one colour,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 Strong impressions, 
 it seems, are made by the eye, with 
 which therefore we have need to make a 
 covenant. 
 
 3. When he found that his project 
 succeeded, through the special blessing 
 of God upon it, he contrived, by using it 
 only with the stronger cattle, to secure to 
 himself those that were most valuable, leaving 
 the feebler to Laban,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>.
 Thus <I>Jacob 
 increased exceedingly</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),
 and grew very 
 rich in a little time. This success of his 
 policy, it is true, was not sufficient to justify 
 it, if there had been any thing fraudulent or 
 unjust in it, which we are sure there was 
 not, for he did it by divine direction
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:12"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 12</A>);
 nor was there any thing in the 
 thing itself but the honest improvement of 
 a fair bargain, which the divine providence 
 wonderfully prospered, both in justice to 
 Jacob whom Laban had wronged and dealt 
 hardly with and in pursuance of the particular 
 promises made to him of the tokens 
 of the divine favour, Note, Those who, 
 while their beginning is small, are humble 
 and honest, contented and industrious, are 
 in a likely way to see their latter end greatly 
 increasing. He that is faithful in a little 
 shall be entrusted with more. He that is 
 faithful in that which is another man's shall 
 be entrusted with something of his own. 
 Jacob, who had been a just servant, became 
 a rich master.</P>
