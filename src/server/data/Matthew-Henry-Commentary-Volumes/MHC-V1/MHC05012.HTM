 Moses at this chapter comes to the particular statues which he had to 
 give in charge to Israel, and he begins with those which relate to the 
 worship of God, and particularly those which explain the second 
 commandment, about which God is in a special manner jealous. 

 I. They must utterly destroy all relics and remains of idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  They must keep close to the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 The former precept was intended to prevent all false worship, the
 latter to preserve the worship God had instituted. By this latter law,

 1. They are commanded to bring all their offerings to the altar of God,
 and all their holy things to the place which he should choose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:6,7,11,12,14,18,26-28">ver. 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 18,
 26-28</A>.

 2. They are forbidden, in general, to do as they now did in the 
 wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),
 
 and as the Canaanites had done
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:29-32">ver. 29-32</A>),

 and, in particular, to eat the hallowed things at their own houses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:13,17,18">ver. 13, 17, 18</A>),

 or to forsake the instituted ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:19">ver. 19</A>.

 3. They are permitted to eat flesh as common food at their own houses,
 provided they do not eat the blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:20-26">ver. 20-26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 These <I>are</I> the statutes and judgments, which ye shall
 observe to do in the land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of thy fathers
 giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
 which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
 mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
 &nbsp; 3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
 and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven
 images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that
 place.
 &nbsp; 4 Ye shall not do so unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From those great original truths, That there is a God, and that there 
 is but one God, arise those great fundamental laws, That that God is to 
 be worshipped, and he only, and that therefore we are to have no other 
 God before him: this is the first commandment, and the second is a 
 guard upon it, or a hedge about it. To prevent a revolt to false gods, 
 we are forbidden to worship the true God in such a way and manner as 
 the false gods were worshipped in, and are commanded to observe the 
 instituted ordinances of worship that we may adhere to the proper 
 object of worship. For this reason Moses is very large in his 
 exposition of the second commandment. What is contained in this and the 
 four following chapters mostly refers to that. <I>These are statutes 
 and judgments</I> which they must <I>observe to do</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 1. In the days of their rest and prosperity, when they should be
 masters of Canaan. We must not think that our religion is instituted 
 only to be our work in the years of our servitude, our entertainment in 
 the places of our solitude, and our consolation in affliction; no, when 
 we come to possess a good land, still we must keep up the worship of 
 God in Canaan as well as in a wilderness, when we have grown up as well 
 as when we are children, when we are full of business as well as when 
 we have nothing else to do. 

 2. <I>All the days,</I> as long as you <I>live upon the earth.</I>
 While we are here in our state of trial, we must continue in our 
 obedience, even to the end, and never leave our duty, nor grow weary of 
 well-doing. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are here charged to abolish and extirpate all those things that 
 the Canaanites had served their idol-gods with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Here is no mention of idol-temples, which countenances the opinion some
 have, that the tabernacle Moses reared in the wilderness was the first 
 habitation that ever was made for religious uses, and that from it 
 temples took their rise. But the places that had been used, and were 
 now to be levelled, were enclosures for their worship on <I>mountains 
 and hills</I> (as if the height of the ground would give advantage to 
 the ascent of their devotions), and under green trees, either because 
 pleasant or because awful: whatever makes the mind easy and reverent, 
 contracts and composes it, was thought to befriend devotion. The solemn 
 shade and silence of a grove are still admired by those that are 
 disposed to contemplation. But the advantage which these retirements 
 gave to the Gentiles in the worship of their idols was that they 
 concealed those works of darkness which could not bear the light; and 
 therefore they must all be destroyed, with the altars, pillars, and 
 images, that had been used by the natives in the worship of their gods, 
 so as that the very names of them might be buried in oblivion, and not 
 only not be remembered with respect, but not remembered at all. They 
 must thus consult,

 1. The reputation of their land; let it never be said of this holy land
 that it had been thus polluted, but let all these dunghills be carried 
 away, as things they were ashamed of. 

 2. The safety of their religion; let none be left remaining, lest
 profane unthinking people, especially in degenerate ages, should make 
 use of them in the service of the God of Israel. Let these pest-houses 
 be demolished, as things they were afraid of. He begins the statutes 
 that relate to divine worship with this, because there must first be an 
 abhorrence of that which is evil before there can be a steady adherence 
 to that which is good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:9">Rom. xii. 9</A>.

 The kingdom of God must be set up, both in persons and places, upon the
 ruins of the devil's kingdom; for they cannot stand together, nor can 
 there be any communion between Christ and Belial.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are charged not to transfer the rites and usages of idolaters 
 into he worship of God; no, not under colour of beautifying and 
 improving it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>You shall not do so to the Lord your god,</I> that is, "you must not
 think to do honour to him by offering sacrifices on mountains and 
 hills, erecting pillars, planting groves, and setting up images; no, 
 you must not indulge a luxurious fancy in your worship, nor think that 
 whatever pleases that will please God: <I>he is above all gods,</I> and 
 will not be worshipped as other gods are."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 But unto the place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God shall choose out
 of all your tribes to put his name there, <I>even</I> unto his
 habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:
 &nbsp; 6 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
 sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
 and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of
 your herds and of your flocks:
 &nbsp; 7 And there ye shall eat before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and ye shall
 rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
 households, wherein the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath blessed thee.
 &nbsp; 8 Ye shall not do after all <I>the things</I> that we do here this
 day, every man whatsoever <I>is</I> right in his own eyes.
 &nbsp; 9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the
 inheritance, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God giveth you.
 &nbsp; 10 But <I>when</I> ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God giveth you to inherit, and <I>when</I> he giveth you
 rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
 safety;
 &nbsp; 11 Then there shall be a place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God shall
 choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring
 all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
 sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and
 all your choice vows which ye vow unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 12 And ye shall rejoice before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, ye, and your
 sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
 maidservants, and the Levite that <I>is</I> within your gates;
 forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
 &nbsp; 13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
 in every place that thou seest:
 &nbsp; 14 But in the place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall choose in one of thy
 tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
 thou shalt do all that I command thee.
 &nbsp; 15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
 gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
 blessing of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God which he hath given thee: the
 unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as
 of the hart.
 &nbsp; 16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
 earth as water.
 &nbsp; 17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn,
 or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
 of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
 freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:
 &nbsp; 18 But thou must eat them before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in the place
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy
 daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite
 that <I>is</I> within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.
 &nbsp; 19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as
 long as thou livest upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 20 When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
 promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy
 soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy
 soul lusteth after.
 &nbsp; 21 If the place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath chosen to put his
 name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd
 and of thy flock, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given thee, as I have
 commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy
 soul lusteth after.
 &nbsp; 22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
 them: the unclean and the clean shall eat <I>of</I> them alike.
 &nbsp; 23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood <I>is</I>
 the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
 &nbsp; 24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
 water.
 &nbsp; 25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and
 with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do <I>that which is</I>
 right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou
 shalt take, and go unto the place which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall choose:
 &nbsp; 27 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
 blood, upon the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God: and the blood of thy
 sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.
 &nbsp; 28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that
 it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
 ever, when thou doest <I>that which is</I> good and right in the sight
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 29 When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God shall cut off the nations from before
 thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
 them, and dwellest in their land;
 &nbsp; 30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
 them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
 thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations
 serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
 &nbsp; 31 Thou shalt not do so unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God: for every
 abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he hateth, have they done unto
 their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
 burnt in the fire to their gods.
 &nbsp; 32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou
 shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is not any one particular precept (as I remember) in all the law 
 of Moses so largely pressed and inculcated as this, by which they are 
 all tied to bring their sacrifices to that one altar which was set up 
 in the court of the tabernacle, and there to perform all the rituals of 
 their religion; for, as to moral services, then, no doubt, as now, men 
 might pray every where, as they did in their synagogues. The command to 
 do this, and the prohibition of the contrary, are here repeated again 
 and again, as we teach children: and yet we are sure that there is in 
 scripture no vain repetition; but all this stress is laid upon it, 

 1.  Because of the strange proneness there was in the hearts of the
 people to idolatry and superstition, and the danger of their being 
 seduced by the many temptations which they would be surrounded with. 

 2.  Because of the great use which the observance of this appointment
 would be of to them, both to prevent the introducing of corrupt customs 
 into their worship and to preserve among them unity and brotherly love, 
 that, meeting all in one place, they might continue both of one way and 
 of one heart. 

 3. Because of the significancy of this appointment. They must keep to
 one place, in token of their belief of those two great truths, which we 
 find together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:5">1 Tim. ii. 5</A>),

 That <I>there is one God,</I> and <I>one Mediator between God and
 man.</I> It not only served to keep up the notion of the unity of the 
 Godhead, but was an intimation to them (though they could not 
 stedfastly discern it) of the one only way of approach to God and 
 communion with him, in and by the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now reduce this long charge to its proper heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here promised that when they were settled in Canaan, when they 
 had <I>rest from their enemies, and dwelt in safety,</I> God would 
 choose a certain place, which he would appoint to be the centre of 
 their unity, to which they should bring all their offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. If they just be tied to one place, they should not be left in doubt
 concerning it, but should certainly know what place it was.  Had Christ 
 intended, under the gospel, to make any one place such a seat of power 
 as Rome pretends to be, we should not have been left so destitute of 
 instruction as we are concerning the appointed place. 

 2.  God does not leave it to them to choose the place, lest the tribes
 should have quarrelled about it, each striving, for their secular 
 advantage, to have it among them; but he reserves the choice to 
 himself, as he does the designation of the Redeemer and the institution 
 of holy ordinances.  

 3. He does not appoint the place now, as he had appointed mounts
 Gerizim and Ebal, for the pronouncing of the blessings and curses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:29"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29</A>),

 but reserves the doing of it till hereafter, that hereby they might be
 made to expect further directions from heaven, and a divine conduct, 
 after Moses should be removed. The place which God would choose is said 
 to be the place where he would put his name, that is, which he would 
 have to be called his, where his honour should dwell, where he would 
 manifest himself to his people, and make himself known, as men do by 
 their names, and where he would receive addresses, by which his name is 
 both praised and called upon. It was to be his habitation, where, as 
 King of Israel, he would keep court, and be found by all those that 
 reverently sought him. The ark was the token of God's presence, and 
 where that was put there God put his name, and that was his habitation. 
 It contained the tables of the law; for none must expect to receive 
 favours from God's hand but those that are willing to <I>receive the 
 law from his mouth.</I> The place which God first chose for the ark to 
 reside in was Shiloh; and, after that place had sinned away its 
 honours, we find the ark at Kirjath-jearim and other places; but at 
 length, in David's time, it was fixed at Jerusalem, and God said 
 concerning Solomon's temple, more expressly than ever he had said 
 concerning any other place, <I>This I have chosen for a house of 
 sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:12">2 Chron. vii. 12</A>.
 
 Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:5">2 Chron. vi. 5</A>.

 Now, under the gospel, we have no temple that sanctifies the gold, no
 altar that sanctifies the gift, but Christ only; and, as to the places 
 of worship, the prophets foretold that <I>in every place</I> the 
 spiritual <I>incense should be offered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>.

 And our Saviour has declared that those are accepted as true
 worshippers who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard 
 either to this mountain or Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:23">John iv. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are commanded to bring all their burnt-offerings and 
 sacrifices to this place that God would choose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Thither shall you bring all that I command you;</I> and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 <I>There thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings;</I> and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>The flesh and the blood must be offered upon the altar of the Lord
 thy God.</I> And of their peace-offerings, here called their 
 <I>sacrifices,</I> though they were to <I>eat the flesh,</I> yet <I>the 
 blood</I> was to be <I>poured out upon the altar.</I> By this they were 
 taught that sacrifices and offerings God did not desire, nor accept, 
 for their own sake, nor for any intrinsic worth in them, as natural 
 expressions of homage and adoration; but that they received their 
 virtue purely from that altar on which they were offered, as it 
 typified Christ; whereas prayers and praises, as much more necessary 
 and valuable, were to be offered every day by the people of God 
 wherever they were. A devout Israelite might honour God, and keep up 
 communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had not an 
 opportunity, perhaps, for many months together, of bringing a sacrifice 
 to his altar. But this signified the obligation we Christians are under 
 to offer up all our spiritual sacrifices to God in the name of Jesus 
 Christ, hoping for acceptance only upon the score of his mediation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are commanded to feast upon their hallowed things before the 
 Lord, with holy joy. They must not only bring to the altar the 
 sacrifices which were to be offered to God, but hey must bring to the 
 place of the altar all those things which they were appointed by the 
 law to eat and drink, to the honour of God, in token of their communion 
 with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Their, <I>tithes, and heave-offerings of their hand,</I> that is, their
 first-fruits, their vows, and <I>free-will-offerings,</I> and 
 firstlings, all those things which were to be religiously made use of 
 either by themselves or by the priests and Levites, must be brought to 
 the place which God would choose; as all the revenues of the crown, 
 from all parts of the kingdom, are brought into the exchequer. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>There you shall eat before the Lord, and rejoice in all that you put
 your hands unto;</I> and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>You shall rejoice before the Lord, you, and your sons, and your
 daughters.</I> Observe here, 

 1. That what we do in the service of God and to his glory redounds to
 our benefit, if it be not our own fault.  Those that sacrifice to God 
 are welcome to eat before him, and to feast upon their sacrifices: he 
 <I>sups with us,</I> and <I>we with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 If we glorify God, we edify ourselves, and cultivate our own minds,
 through the grace of God, by the increase of our knowledge and faith, 
 the enlivening of devout affections, and the confirming of gracious 
 habits and resolutions: thus is the soul nourished.

 2. That work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. You
 shall <I>eat and rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 and again,

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 (1.) Now while they were before the Lord they must rejoice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is the will of God that we should serve him with gladness; none
 displeased him more than those that <I>covered his altar with 
 tears.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:13">Mal. ii. 13</A>.

 See what a good Master we serve, who has made it our duty to sing at
 our work. Even the children and servants must rejoice with them before 
 God, that the services of religion might be a pleasure to them, and not 
 a task or drudgery.

 (2.) They must <I>carry away with them</I> the grateful relish of that
 delight which they found in communion with God; they must rejoice in 
 all that they <I>put their hands unto,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Some of the comfort which they must take with them into their common
 employments; and, being thus strengthened in soul, whatever they did 
 they must do it heartily and cheerfully. And this holy pious joy in God 
 and his goodness, with which we are to rejoice evermore, would be the 
 best preservative against the sin and snare of <I>vain and carnal 
 mirth</I> and a relief against the <I>sorrows of the world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They are commanded to be kind to the Levites. Did they feast with 
 joy? The Levites must feast with them, and rejoice with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,

 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>; 
 
 and a general caution
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>Take heed that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou
 livest.</I> There were Levites that attended the altar as assistants to 
 the priests, and these must not be forsaken, that is, the service they 
 performed must be constantly adhered to; no other altar must be set up 
 than that which God appointed; for that would be to forsake the 
 Levites. But this seems to be spoken of the Levites that were dispersed 
 in the country to instruct the people in the law of God, and to assist 
 them in their devotions; for it is <I>the Levite within their gates</I> 
 that they are here commanded to make much of. It is a great mercy to 
 have Levites near us, within our gates, that we may ask the law at 
 their mouth, and at our feasts to be a check upon us, to restrain 
 excesses. And it is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers 
 that give them good instructions and set them good examples. As long as 
 we live we shall need their assistance, till we come to that world 
 where ordinances will be superseded; and therefore <I>as long as we 
 live</I> we must not forsake the Levites. The reason given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 is because <I>the Levite has no part nor inheritance with you,</I> so
 that he cannot grow rich by husbandry or trade; let him therefore share 
 with you in the comfort of your riches. They must give the Levites 
 their tithes and offerings, settled on them by the law, because they 
 had no other maintenance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They are allowed to eat common flesh, but not the flesh of their 
 offerings, in their own houses, wherever they dwelt. What was any way 
 devoted to God they must not eat at home, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:13,17"><I>v.</I> 13, 17</A>.

 But what was not so devoted they might kill and eat of at their
 pleasure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And this permission is again repeated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>.

 It should seem that while they were in the wilderness they did not eat
 the flesh of any of those kinds of beasts that were used in sacrifice, 
 but what was killed at the door of the tabernacle, and part of it 
 presented to God as a peace-offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:3,4">Lev. xvii. 3, 4</A>.

 But when they came to Canaan, where they must live at a great distance
 from the tabernacle, they might kill what they pleased for their own 
 use of their flocks and herds, without bringing part to the altar. This 
 allowance is very express, and repeated, lest Satan should take 
 occasion from that law which forbade the eating of their sacrifices at 
 their own houses to suggest to them, as he did to our first parents, 
 hard thoughts of God, as if he grudged them: <I>Thou mayest eat 
 whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.</I> There is a natural regular 
 appetite, which it is lawful to gratify with temperance and sobriety, 
 not taking too great a pleasure in the gratification, nor being uneasy 
 if it be crossed. The unclean, who might not eat of the holy things, 
 yet might eat of the same sort of flesh when it was only used as common 
 food. The distinction between clean persons and unclean was sacred, and 
 designed for the preserving of the honour of their holy feasts, and 
 therefore must not be brought into their ordinary meals. This 
 permission has a double restriction:--

 1.  They must eat according to the blessing which God had given them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>.

 Note, It is not only our wisdom, but our duty, to live according to our
 estates, and not to spend above what we have. As it is unjust on the 
 one hand to hoard what should be laid out, so it is much more unjust to 
 lay out more than we have; for what is not our own must needs be 
 another's, who is thereby robbed and defrauded. And this, I say, is 
 much more unjust, because it is easier afterwards to distribute what 
 has been unduly spared, and so to make a sort of restitution for the 
 wrong, than it is to repay to wife, and children, and creditors, what 
 has been unduly spent. Between these two extremes let wisdom find the 
 mean, and then let watchfulness and resolution keep it.

 2. They must not eat blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,
 
 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Only be sure that thou eat not the blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 <I>Thou shalt not eat it;</I> and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt not eat it, that it may go well with thee.</I> When they
 could not bring the blood to the altar, to pour it out there before the 
 Lord, as belonging to him, they must pour it out upon the earth, as not 
 belonging to them, because it was the life, and therefore, as an 
 acknowledgment, belonged to him who gives life, and, as an atonement, 
 belonged to him to whom life is forfeited. Bishop Patrick thinks one 
 reason why they were forbidden thus strictly the eating of blood was to 
 prevent the superstitions of the old idolaters about the blood of their 
 sacrifices, which they thought their demons delighted in, and by eating 
 of which they imagined that they had communion with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They are forbidden to keep up either their own corrupt usages in 
 the wilderness or the corrupt usages of their predecessors in the land 
 of Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must not keep up those improper customs which they had got into 
 in the wilderness, and which were connived at in consideration of the 
 present unsettledness of their condition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day.</I>
 Never was there a better governor than Moses, and one would think never 
 a better opportunity of keeping up good order and discipline than now 
 among the people of Israel, when they lay so closely encamped under the 
 eye of their governor; and yet it seems there was much amiss and many 
 irregularities had crept in among them. We must never expect to see any 
 society perfectly pure and right, and as it should be till we come to 
 the heavenly Canaan. They had sacrifices and religious worship, courts 
 of justice and civil government, and, by the stoning of the man that 
 <I>gathered sticks on the sabbath day,</I> it appears there was great 
 strictness used in guarding the most weighty matters of the law; but 
 being frequently upon the remove, and always at uncertainty,

 (1.) They could none of them observe the solemn feasts, and the rites
 of cleansing, with the exactness that the law required. And,

 (2.) Those among them that were disposed to do amiss had opportunity
 given them to do it unobserved by the frequent interruptions which 
 their removals gave to the administration of justice. But (says Moses) 
 when you come to Canaan, you <I>shall not do as we do here.</I> Note, 
 When the people of God are in an unsettled condition, that may be 
 tolerated and dispensed with which would by no means be allowed at 
 another time.  Cases of necessity are to be considered while the 
 necessity continues; but that must not be done in Canaan which was done 
 in the wilderness.  While a house is in the building a great deal of 
 dirt and rubbish are suffered to lie by it, which must all be taken 
 away when the house is built. Moses was now about to lay down his life 
 and government, and it was a comfort to him to foresee that Israel 
 would be better in the next reign than they had been in his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must not worship the Lord by any of those rites or ceremonies 
 which the notions of Canaan had made use of in the service of their 
 gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:29-32"><I>v.</I> 29-32</A>.

 They must not so much as enquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous
 worship. What good would it do to them to <I>know those depths of 
 Satan?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24">Rev. ii. 24</A>.

 It is best to be ignorant of that which there is danger of being
 infected by. They must not introduce the customs of idolaters,

 (1.) Because it would be absurd to make those their patterns whom God
 had made their slaves and captives, cut off, and destroyed from before 
 them. The Canaanites had not flourished and prospered so much in the 
 service of their gods as that the Israelites should be invited to take 
 up their customs. Those are wretchedly besotted indeed who will walk in 
 the way of sinners, after they have seen their end.

 (2.) Because some of their customs were most barbarous and inhuman, and
 such as trampled, not only upon the light and law of nature, but upon 
 natural affection itself, as <I>burning their sons and their daughters 
 in the fire to their gods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 the very mention of which is sufficient to make it odious, and possess
 us with a horror of it.

 (3.) Because their idolatrous customs were an abomination to the Lord,
 and the translating of them into his worship would make even that an 
 abomination and an affront to him by which they should give him honour, 
 and by which they hoped to obtain his favour. The case is bad indeed 
 when the sacrifice itself has become an abomination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 He therefore concludes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>)

 with the same caution concerning the worship of God which he had before
 given concerning the word of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>):

 "<I>You shall not add thereto</I> any inventions of your own, under
 pretence of making the ordinance either more significant or more 
 magnificent, <I>nor diminish from it,</I> under pretence of making it 
 more easy and practicable, or of setting aside that which may be 
 spared; but observe to do all that, and that only, which God has 
 commanded." We may then hope in our religious worship to obtain the 
 divine acceptance when we observe the divine appointment. God will have 
 his own work done in his own way.</P>
