 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
 judgment, that <I>the judges</I> may judge them; then they shall
 justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.
 &nbsp; 2 And it shall be, if the wicked man <I>be</I> worthy to be beaten,
 that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
 before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.
 &nbsp; 3 Forty stripes he may give him, <I>and</I> not exceed: lest, <I>if</I>
 he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
 then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out <I>the corn.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A direction to the judges in scourging malefactors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 1. It is here supposed that, if a man be charged with a crime, the
 accuser and the accused (<I>Actor</I> and <I>Reus</I>) should be 
 brought face to face before the judges, that the controversy may be 
 determined. 

 2. If a man were accused of a crime, and the proof fell short, so that
 the charge could not be made out against him by the evidence, then he 
 was to be acquitted: "<I>Thou shalt justify the righteous,</I>" that 
 is, "him that appears to the court to be so." If the accusation be 
 proved, then the conviction of the accused is a justification of the 
 accuser, as righteous in the prosecution. 

 3. If the accused were found guilty, judgment must be given against
 him: "Thou shalt <I>condemn the wicked;</I>" for to justify the wicked 
 is as much an abomination to the Lord as it is to condemn the 
 righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:15">Prov. xvii. 15</A>.

 4. If the crime were not made capital by the law, then the criminal
 must be beaten. A great many precepts we have met with which have not 
 any particular penalty annexed to them, the violation of most of which, 
 according to the constant practice of the Jews, was punished by 
 scourging, from which no person's rank or quality did exempt him if he 
 were a delinquent, but with this proviso, that he should never be 
 upbraided with it, nor should it be looked upon as leaving any mark of 
 infamy or disgrace upon him. The directions here given for the 
 scourging of criminals are,

 (1.) That it be done solemnly; not tumultuously through the streets,
 but in open court before the judge's face, and with so much 
 deliberation as that the stripes might be numbered. The Jews say that 
 while execution was in doing the chief justice of the court read with a 
 loud voice

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:58,59,29:9">Deut. xxviii. 58, 59, and xxix. 9</A>,

 and concluded with those words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38">Ps. lxxviii. 38</A>),

 <I>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity.</I> Thus
 it was made a sort of religious act, and so much the more likely to 
 reform the offender himself and to be a warning to others.

 (2.) That it be done in proportion to the crime, <I>according to his
 fault,</I> that some crimes might appear, as they are, more heinous 
 than others, the criminal being <I>beaten with many stripes,</I> to 
 which perhaps there is an allusion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:47,48">Luke xii. 47, 48</A>.

 (3.) That how great soever the crime were the number of stripes should
 never exceed <I>forty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Forty <I>save one</I> was the common usage, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:24">2 Cor. xi. 24</A>.

 It seems, they always gave Paul as many stripes as ever they gave to
 any malefactor whatsoever.  They abated one for fear of having 
 miscounted (though one of the judges was appointed to number the 
 stripes), or because they would never go to the utmost rigour, or 
 because the execution was usually done with a whip of three lashes, so 
 that thirteen stripes (each one being counted for three) made up 
 thirty-nine, but one more by that reckoning would have been forty-two. 
 The reason given for this is, <I>lest thy brother should seem vile unto 
 thee.</I> He must still be looked upon as <I>a brother</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:15">2 Thess. iii. 15</A>),

 and his reputation as such was preserved by this merciful limitation of
 his punishment. It saves him from seeming vile to his brethren, when 
 God himself by his law takes this care of him. Men must not be treated 
 as dogs; nor must those seem vile in our sight to whom, for aught we 
 know, God may yet give grace to make them precious in his sight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A charge to husbandmen not to hinder their cattle from eating when 
 they were working, if meat were within their reach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This instance of the beast that trod out the corn (to which there is an
 allusion in that of the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:11">Hos. x. 11</A>)

 is put for all similar instances. That which makes this law very
 remarkable above its fellows (and which countenances the like 
 application of other such laws) is that it is twice quoted in the New 
 Testament to show that it is the duty of the people to give their 
 ministers a comfortable maintenance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9,10">1 Cor. ix. 9, 10</A>,
 
 and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17,18">1 Tim. v. 17, 18</A>.

 It teaches us in the letter of it to make much of the brute-creatures
 that serve us, and to allow them not only the necessary supports for 
 their life, but the advantages of their labour; and thus we must learn 
 not only to be just, but kind, to all that are employed for our good, 
 not only to maintain but to encourage them, especially those that 
 labour among us in the word and doctrine, and so are employed for the 
 good of our better part.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
 child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
 stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
 her to him to wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother
 unto her.
 &nbsp; 6 And it shall be, <I>that</I> the firstborn which she beareth shall
 succeed in the name of his brother <I>which is</I> dead, that his name
 be not put out of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
 his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My
 husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in
 Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
 &nbsp; 8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
 him: and <I>if</I> he stand <I>to it,</I> and say, I like not to take her;
 &nbsp; 9 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence
 of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
 his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that
 man that will not build up his brother's house.
 &nbsp; 10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him
 that hath his shoe loosed.
 &nbsp; 11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of
 the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand
 of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
 him by the secrets:
 &nbsp; 12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
 <I>her.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The law settled concerning the marrying of the brother's widow. It 
 appears from the story of Judah's family that this had been an ancient 
 usage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:8">Gen. xxxviii. 8</A>),

 for the keeping up of distinct families.  The case put is a case that
 often happens, of a man's dying without issue, it may be in the prime 
 of his time, soon after his marriage, and while his brethren were yet 
 so young as to be unmarried. Now in this case, 

 1. The widow was not to marry again into any other family, unless all
 the relations of her husband did refuse her, that the estate she was 
 endowed with might not be alienated. 

 2. The husband's brother, or next of kin, must marry her, partly out of
 respect to her, who, having forgotten her own people and her father's 
 house, should have all possible kindness shown her by the family into 
 which she was married; and partly out of respect to the deceased 
 husband, that though he was dead and gone he might not be forgotten, 
 nor lost out of the genealogies of his tribe; for the first-born child, 
 which the brother or next kinsman should have by the widow, should be 
 denominated from him that was dead, and entered in the genealogy as his 
 child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Under that dispensation we have reason to think men had not so clear
 and certain a prospect of living themselves on the other side death as 
 we have now, to whom <I>life and immortality are brought to light by 
 the gospel;</I> and therefore they could not but be the more desirous 
 to live in their posterity, which innocent desire was in some measure 
 gratified by this law, an expedient being found out that, though a man 
 had no child by his wife, yet <I>his name should not be put out of 
 Israel,</I> that is, out of the pedigree, or, which is equivalent, 
 remain there under the brand of childlessness.  The Sadducees put a 
 case to our Saviour upon this law, with a design to perplex the 
 doctrine of the resurrection by it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:24-33">Matt. xxii. 24</A>,

 &c.), perhaps
 insinuating that there was no need of maintaining the immortality of 
 the soul and a future state, since the law had so well provided for the 
 perpetuating of men's names and families in the world. But, 

 3. If the brother, or next of kin, declined to do this good office to
 the memory of him that was gone, what must be done in that case? Why,

 (1.) He shall not be compelled to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 If he like her not, he is at liberty to refuse her, which, some think,
 was not permitted in this case before this law of Moses. Affection is 
 all in all to the comfort of the conjugal relation; this is a thing 
 which cannot be forced, and therefore the relation should not be forced 
 without it.

 (2.) Yet he shall be publicly disgraced for not doing it. The widow, as
 the person most concerned for the name and honour of the deceased, was 
 to complain to the elders of his refusal; if he persist in it, she must 
 <I>pluck off his shoe, and spit in his face,</I> in open court (or, as 
 the Jewish doctors moderate it, spit <I>before</I> his face), thus to 
 fasten a mark of infamy upon him, which was to remain with his family 
 after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 Note, Those justly suffer in their own reputation who do not do what
 they ought to preserve the name and honour of others. He that would not 
 build up his brother's house deserved to have this blemish put upon his 
 own, that it should be called <I>the house of him that had his shoe 
 loosed,</I> in token that he deserved to go barefoot. In the case of 
 Ruth we find this law executed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:7">Ruth iv. 7</A>),

 but because, upon the refusal of the next kinsman, there was another
 ready to perform the duty of a husband's brother, it was that other 
 that plucked off the shoe, and not the widow--Boaz, and not Ruth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law for the punishing of an immodest woman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 The woman that by the foregoing law was to complain against her
 husband's brother for not marrying her, and to spit in his face before 
 the elders, needed a good measure of assurance; but, lest the 
 confidence which that law supported should grow to an excess unbecoming 
 the sex, here is a very severe but just law to punish impudence and 
 immodesty.

 1. The instance of it is confessedly scandalous to the highest degree.
 A woman could not do it unless she were perfectly lost to all virtue 
 and honour. 

 2.  The occasion is such as might in part excuse it; it was to help her
 husband out of the hands of one that was too hard for him.  Now if the 
 doing of it in a passion, and with such a good intention, was to be so 
 severely punished, much more when it was done wantonly and in lust. 

 3.  The punishment was that her hand should be cut off; and the
 magistrates must not pretend to be more merciful than God: <I>Thy eye 
 shall not pity her.</I> Perhaps our Saviour alludes to this law when he 
 commands us to <I>cut off the right hand</I> that <I>offends us,</I> or 
 is an occasion of sin to us. Better put the greatest hardships that can 
 be upon the body than ruin the soul for ever.  Modesty is the hedge of 
 chastity, and therefore ought to be very carefully preserved and kept 
 up by both sexes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
 small.
 &nbsp; 14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
 and a small.
 &nbsp; 15 <I>But</I> thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect
 and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
 in the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee.
 &nbsp; 16 For all that do such things, <I>and</I> all that do
 unrighteously, <I>are</I> an abomination unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
 come forth out of Egypt;
 &nbsp; 18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
 <I>even</I> all <I>that were</I> feeble behind thee, when thou <I>wast</I> faint
 and weary; and he feared not God.
 &nbsp; 19 Therefore it shall be, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath given thee
 rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God giveth thee <I>for</I> an inheritance to possess it,
 <I>that</I> thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
 heaven; thou shalt not forget <I>it.</I> 
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law against deceitful weights and measures: they must not only not 
 use them, but they must not have them, not have them in the bag, not 
 have them in the house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>);

 for, if they had them, they would be strongly tempted to use them.
 They must not have a great weight and measure to buy by and a small one 
 to sell by, for that was to cheat both ways, when either was bad 
 enough; as we read of those that made the <I>ephah</I> small, in which 
 they measured the corn they sold, and the <I>shekel</I> great, by which 
 they weighed the money they received for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:5">Amos viii. 5</A>.

 But <I>thou shalt have a perfect and just weight,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 That which is the rule of justice must itself be just; if that be
 otherwise, it is a constant cheat. This had been taken care of before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:35,36">Lev. xix. 35, 36</A>.

 This law is enforced with two very good reasons:--

 1. That justice and equity will bring down upon us the blessing of God.
 The way to have our days lengthened, and to prosper, is to be just and 
 fair in all our dealings <I>Honesty is the best policy.</I> 

 2. That fraud and injustice will expose us to the curse of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Not only unrighteousness itself, but all that do unrighteously, are an
 <I>abomination to the Lord.</I> And miserable is that man who is 
 abhorred by his Maker. How hateful, particularly, all the arts of 
 deceit are to God, Solomon several times observes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:1,20:10,23">Prov. xi. 1; xx. 10, 23</A>;

 and the apostle tells us <I>that the Lord is the avenger of all
 such</I> as overreach and <I>defraud in any matter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:6">1 Thess. iv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law for the rooting out of Amalek. Here is a <I>just weight</I> 
 and a <I>just measure,</I> that, as Amalek had measured to Israel, so 
 it should be measure to Amalek again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mischief Amalek did to Israel must be here remembered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 
 When it was first done it was ordered to be recorded
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14-16">Exod. xvii. 14-16</A>),
 
 and here the remembrance of it is ordered to be preserved, not in
 personal revenge (for that generation which suffered by the Amalekites 
 was gone, so that those who now lived, and their posterity, could not 
 have any personal resentment of the injury), but in a zeal for the 
 glory of God (which was insulted by the Amalekites), that <I>throne of 
 the Lord</I> against which the hand of Amalek was stretched out. The 
 carriage of the Amalekites towards Israel is here represented, 

 (1.) As very base and disingenuous. They had no occasion at all to
 quarrel with Israel, nor did they give them any notice, by a manifesto 
 or declaration of war; but took them at an advantage, when they had 
 just come out of the house of bondage, and, for aught that appeared to 
 them, were only going to <I>sacrifice to God in the wilderness.</I>

 (2.) As very barbarous and cruel; for they smote those that were more
 feeble, whom they should have succoured. The greatest cowards are 
 commonly the most cruel; while those that have the courage of a man 
 will have the compassion of a man.

 (3.) As very impious and profane: they feared not God. If they had had
 any reverence for the majesty of the God of Israel, which they saw a 
 token of in the cloud, or any dread of his wrath, which they lately 
 heard of the power of over Pharaoh, they durst not have made this 
 assault upon Israel. Well, here was the ground of the quarrel: and it 
 shows how God takes what is done against his people as done against 
 himself, and that he will particularly reckon with those that 
 discourage and hinder young beginners in religion, that (as Satan's 
 agents) set upon the weak and feeble, either to divert them or to 
 disquiet them, and offend his little ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This mischief must in due time be revenged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When their wars were finished, by which they were to settle their
 kingdom and enlarge their coast, then they must <I>make war upon 
 Amalek</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 not merely to chase them, but to consume them, to <I>blot out the
 remembrance of Amalek.</I> It was an instance of God's patience that he 
 deferred the vengeance so long, which should have led the Amalekites to 
 repentance; yet an instance of fearful retribution that the posterity 
 of Amalek, so long after, were destroyed for the mischief done by their 
 ancestors to the Israel of God, that all the world might see, and say, 
 that he who <I>toucheth them toucheth the apple of his eye.</I> It was 
 nearly 400 years after this that Saul was ordered to put this sentence 
 in execution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:1-35">1 Sam. xv.</A>),

 and was rejected of God because he did not do
 it effectually, but spared some of that devoted nation, in contempt,
 not only of the particular orders he received from Samuel, but of this 
 general command here given by Moses, which he could not be ignorant of. 
 David afterwards made some destruction of them; and the Simeonites, in 
 Hezekiah's time, smote the rest that remained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:43">1 Chron. iv. 43</A>);

 for when God judges he will overcome.</P>
