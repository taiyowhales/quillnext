 This chapter begins the story of Moses, that man of renown, famed for
 his intimate acquaintance with Heaven and his eminent usefulness on
 earth, and the most remarkable type of Christ, as a prophet, saviour,
 lawgiver, and mediator, in all the Old Testament. The Jews have a
 book among them of the life of Moses, which tells a great many stories
 concerning him, which we have reason to think are mere fictions; what
 he has recorded concerning himself is what we may rely upon, for we
 know that his record is true; and it is what we may be satisfied with,
 for it is what Infinite Wisdom thought fit to preserve and transmit to
 us. In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. The perils of his birth and infancy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. His preservation through those perils, and the preferment of his 
 childhood and youth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:5-10">ver. 5-10</A>.

 III. The pious choice of his riper years, which was to own the people 
 of God.

 1. He offered them his service at present, if they would accept it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 2. He retired, that he might reserve himself for further service 
 hereafter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 IV. The dawning of the day of Israel's deliverance,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <I>to wife</I>
 a daughter of Levi.
 &nbsp; 2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
 that he <I>was a</I> goodly <I>child,</I> she hid him three months.
 &nbsp; 3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
 ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
 put the child therein; and she laid <I>it</I> in the flags by the
 river's brink.
 &nbsp; 4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses was a Levite, both by father and mother. Jacob left Levi under
 marks of disgrace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:5">Gen. xlix. 5</A>); 
 
 and yet, soon after, Moses appears a
 descendant from him, that he might typify Christ, who came in the
 likeness of sinful flesh and was made a curse for us. This tribe began
 to be distinguished from the rest by the birth of Moses, as afterwards
 it became remarkable in many other instances. Observe, concerning this
 newborn infant,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was hidden. It seems to have been just at the time of his 
 birth that the cruel law was made for the murder of all the male 
 children of the Hebrews; and many, no doubt, perished by the execution 
 of it. The parents of Moses had Miriam and Aaron, both older than he, 
 born to them before this edict came out, and had nursed them without 
 that peril: but those that begin the world in peace know not what 
 troubles they may meet with before they have got through it. Probably 
 the mother of Moses was full of anxiety in the expectation of his 
 birth, now that this edict was in force, and was ready to say, 
 <I>Blessed are the barren that never bore,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>. 
 
 Better so
 than bring forth children to the murderer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13">Hos. ix. 13</A>.

 Yet this child
 proves the glory of his father's house. Thus that which is most our 
 fear often proves, in the issue, most our joy. Observe the beauty of 
 providence: just at the time when Pharaoh's cruelty rose to this height 
 the deliverer was born, though he did not appear for many years after. 
 Note, When men are projecting the church's ruin God is preparing for 
 its salvation. Moses, who was afterwards to bring Israel out of this 
 house of bondage, was himself in danger of falling a sacrifice to the 
 fury of the oppressor, God so ordering it that, being afterwards told 
 of this, he might be the more animated with a holy zeal for the 
 deliverance of his brethren out of the hands of such bloody men.

 1. His parents observed him to be a <I>goodly child,</I> more than
 ordinarily beautiful; he was <I>fair to God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:20">Acts vii. 20</A>. 
 
 They fancied he had a
 lustre in his countenance that was something more than human, and was a 
 specimen of the shining of his face afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:29">Exod. xxxiv. 29</A>.

 Note, God sometimes gives early earnests of his gifts, and manifests
 himself betimes in those for whom and by whom he designs to do great 
 things. Thus he put an early strength into Samson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:24,25">Judge xiii. 24, 25</A>),

 an early forwardness into Samuel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:18">1 Sam. ii. 18</A>),

 wrought an early deliverance for David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:37">1 Sam. xvii. 37</A>), 
 
 and began betimes with Timothy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:15">1 Tim. iii. 15</A>.

 2. Therefore they were the more solicitous for his preservation, 
 because they looked upon this as an indication of some kind purpose of 
 God concerning him, and a happy omen of something great. Note, A lively 
 active faith can take encouragement from the least intimation of the 
 divine favour; a merciful hint of Providence will encourage those whose 
 spirits make diligent search, <I>Three months</I> they hid him in some 
 private apartment of their own house, though probably with the hazard 
 of their own lives, had he been discovered. Herein Moses was a type of 
 Christ, who, in his infancy, was forced to abscond, and in Egypt too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:13">Matt. ii. 13</A>),

 and was wonderfully preserved, when many innocents were butchered. It
 is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:23">Heb. xi. 23</A>)

 that the parents of Moses <I>hid him by faith;</I> some think they had
 a special revelation to them that the deliverer should spring from 
 their loins; however they had the general promise of Israel's 
 preservation, which they acted faith upon, and in that faith hid their 
 child, not being afraid of the penalty annexed to the king's 
 commandment. Note, Faith in God's promise is so far from superseding 
 that it rather excites and quickens to the use of lawful means for the 
 obtaining of mercy. Duty is ours, events are God's. Again, Faith in
 God will set us above the ensnaring fear of man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was exposed. At three months' end, probably when the 
 searchers came about to look for concealed children, so that they could 
 not hide him any longer (their faith perhaps beginning now to fail), 
 they put him in an ark of bulrushes by the <I>river's brink</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and set his little sister at some distance to watch what would become 
 of him, and into whose hands he would fall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God put it into their hearts to do this, to bring about his own 
 purposes, that Moses might by this means be brought into the hands of 
 Pharaoh's daughter, and that by his deliverance from this imminent 
 danger a specimen might be given of the deliverance of God's church, 
 which now lay thus exposed. Note,

 1. God takes special care of the outcasts of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:2">Ps. cxlvii. 2</A>);

 they are <I>his</I> outcasts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:4">Isa. xvi. 4</A>. 
 
 Moses seemed quite abandoned by his
 friends; his own mother durst not own him: but now the Lord took him up 
 and protected him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:10">Ps. xxvii. 10</A>. 

 2. In times of extreme difficulty it is good to venture upon the 
 providence of God. Thus to have exposed their child while they might 
 have preserved it, would have been to tempt Providence; but, when they 
 could not, it was to trust to Providence. "Nothing venture, nothing
 win." <I>If I perish, I perish.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <I>herself</I> at
 the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
 when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch
 it.
 &nbsp; 6 And when she had opened <I>it,</I> she saw the child: and, behold,
 the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <I>is
 one</I> of the Hebrews' children.
 &nbsp; 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
 call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the
 child for thee?
 &nbsp; 8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
 called the child's mother.
 &nbsp; 9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
 and nurse it for me, and I will give <I>thee</I> thy wages. And the
 woman took the child, and nursed it.
 &nbsp; 10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
 daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses:
 and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Moses saved from perishing. Come see the place where that great man 
 lay when he was a little child; he lay in a bulrush-basket by the 
 river's side. Had he been left to lie there, he must have perished in a 
 little time with hunger, if he had not been sooner washed into the 
 river or devoured by a crocodile. Had he fallen into any other hands 
 than those he did fall into, either they would not, or durst not, have 
 done otherwise than have thrown him straightway into the river; but 
 Providence brings no less a person thither than Pharaoh's daughter, 
 just at that juncture, guides her to the place where this poor forlorn 
 infant lay, and inclines her heart to pity it, which she dares do when 
 none else durst. Never did poor child cry so seasonably, so happily, as 
 this did: <I>The babe wept,</I> which moved the compassion of the 
 princess, as no doubt his beauty did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Note,

 1. Those are hard-hearted indeed that have not a tender compassion for
 helpless infancy. How pathetically does God represent his compassion 
 for the Israelites in general considered in this pitiable state!

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:5,6">Ezek. xvi. 5, 6</A>.

 2. It is very commendable in persons of quality to take cognizance of 
 the distresses of the meanest, and to be helpful and charitable to 
 them.

 3. God's care of us in our infancy ought to be often made mention of
 by us to his praise. Though we were not thus exposed (that we were not 
 was God's mercy) yet many were the perils we were surrounded with in 
 our infancy, out of which the Lord delivered us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:9,10">Ps. xxii. 9, 10</A>.

 4. God often raises up friends for his people even among their enemies.
 Pharaoh cruelly seeks Israel's destruction, but his own daughter 
 charitably compassionates a Hebrew child, and not only so, but, beyond 
 her intention, preserves Israel's deliverer. <I>O Lord, how wonderful 
 are thy counsels!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses well provided with a good nurse, no worse than his own dear 
 mother,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 Pharaoh's daughter thinks it convenient that he should
 have a Hebrew nurse (pity that so fair a child should be suckled by a 
 sable Moor), and the sister of Moses, with art and good management, 
 introduces the mother into the place of a nurse, to the great advantage 
 of the child; for mothers are the best nurses, and those who receive 
 the blessings of the breasts with those of the womb are not just if 
 they give them not to those for whose sake they received them: it was 
 also an unspeakable satisfaction to the mother, who received her son as 
 life from the dead, and now could enjoy him without fear. The transport 
 of her joy, upon this happy turn, we may suppose sufficient to betray 
 her to be the true mother (had there been any suspicion of it) to a 
 less discerning eye than that of Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:27">1 Kings iii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Moses preferred to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 his parents herein perhaps not only yielding to necessity, having 
 nursed him <I>for her,</I> but too much pleased with the honour thereby 
 done to their son; for the smiles of the world are stronger temptations 
 than its frowns, and more difficult to resist. The tradition of the 
 Jews is that Pharaoh's daughter had no child of her own, and that she 
 was the only child of her father, so that when he was adopted for her 
 son he stood fair for the crown: however it is certain he stood fair 
 for the best preferments of the court in due time, and in the mean time 
 had the advantage of the best education and improvements of the court, 
 with the help of which, having a great genius, he became master of all 
 the lawful learning of the Egyptians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:22">Acts vii. 22</A>. 
 
 Note,

 1. Providence pleases itself sometimes in raising the poor out of the
 dust, to set them among princes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7,8">Ps. cxiii. 7, 8</A>.

 Many who, by their birth, seem marked for obscurity and poverty, by 
 surprising events of Providence are brought to sit at the upper end of 
 the world, to make men know that <I>the heavens do rule.</I>

 2. Those whom God designs for great services he finds out ways to
 qualify and prepare beforehand. Moses, by having his education in a 
 court, is the fitter to be a prince and <I>king in Jeshurun;</I> by 
 having his education in a learned court (for such the Egyptian then 
 was) is the fitter to be an historian; and by having his education in 
 the court of Egypt is the fitter to be employed, in the name of God, as 
 an ambassador to that court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Moses named. The Jews tell us that his father, at his circumcision, 
 called him <I>Joachim,</I> but Pharaoh's daughter called him 
 <I>Moses, Drawn out of the water,</I> so it signifies in the Egyptian
 language. The calling of the Jewish lawgiver by an Egyptian name is a
 happy omen to the Gentile world, and gives hopes of that day when it 
 shall be said, <I>Blessed be Egypt my people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:25">Isa. xix. 25</A>.

 And his tuition at
 court was an earnest of the performance of that promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:23">Isa. xlix. 23</A>,

 <I>Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing 
 mothers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown,
 that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
 and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
 &nbsp; 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
 <I>there was</I> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
 sand.
 &nbsp; 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
 Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,
 Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
 &nbsp; 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
 intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
 Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
 &nbsp; 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
 But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of
 Midian: and he sat down by a well.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses had now passed the first forty years of his life in the court of 
 Pharaoh, preparing himself for business; and now it was time for him to 
 enter upon action, and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He boldly owns and espouses the cause of God's people: <I>When Moses 
 was grown he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their 
 burdens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The best exposition of these words we have from an
 inspired pen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24-26">Heb. xi. 24-26</A>,

 where we are told that by this he
 expressed,

 1. His holy contempt of the honours and pleasures of the Egyptian
 court; he <I>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</I> 
 for <I>he went out.</I> The temptation was indeed very strong. He had a 
 fair opportunity (as we say) to make his fortune, and to have been 
 serviceable to Israel too, with his interest at court. He was obliged, 
 in gratitude as well as interest, to Pharaoh's daughter, and yet he 
 obtained a glorious victory by faith over his temptation. He reckoned 
 it much more his honour and advantage to be a son of Abraham than to be 
 the son of Pharaoh's daughter.

 2. His tender concern for his poor brethren in bondage, with whom
 (though he might easily have avoided it) he <I>chose to suffer 
 affliction;</I> he looked on their burdens as one that not only pitied 
 them, but was resolved to venture with them, and, if occasion were, to 
 venture for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives a specimen of the great things he was afterwards to do for 
 God and his Israel in two little instances, related particularly by 
 Stephen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:23-53">Acts vii. 23</A>, 
 
 &c.) with design to show how their fathers had
 <I>always resisted the Holy Ghost</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),
 
 even in Moses himself,
 when he first appeared as their deliverer, wilfully shutting their eyes 
 against this day-break of their enlargement. He found himself, no 
 doubt, under a divine direction and impulse in what he did, and that he 
 was in an extraordinary manner called of God to do it. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Moses was afterwards to be employed in plaguing the Egyptians for 
 the wrongs they had done to God's Israel; and, as a specimen of that, 
 he killed the Egyptian who smote the Hebrew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>);

 probably it was one of the Egyptian taskmasters, whom he found abusing 
 his Hebrew slave, a relation (as some think) of Moses, a man of the 
 same tribe. It was by special warrant from Heaven (which makes not a 
 precedent in ordinary cases) that Moses slew the Egyptian, and rescued 
 his oppressed brother. The Jew's tradition is that he did not slay him 
 with any weapon, but, as Peter slew Ananias and Sapphira, with the word 
 of his mouth. His <I>hiding him in the sand</I> signified that 
 hereafter Pharaoh and all his Egyptians should, under the control of 
 the rod of Moses, be buried in the sand of the Red Sea. His taking care 
 to execute this justice privately, when no man saw, was a piece of 
 needful prudence and caution, it being but an assay; and perhaps his 
 faith was as yet weak, and what he did was with some hesitation. Those 
 who come to be of great faith, yet began with a little, and at first 
 spoke tremblingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses was afterwards to be employed in governing Israel, and as a 
 specimen of this, we have him here trying to end a controversy between 
 two Hebrews, in which he is forced (as he did afterwards for forty 
 years) to suffer their manners. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The unhappy quarrel which Moses observed between two Hebrews,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It does not appear what was the occasion; but, whatever it was, it
 was certainly very unseasonable for Hebrews to strive with one another 
 when they were all oppressed and ruled with rigour by the Egyptians. 
 Had they not beating enough from the Egyptians, but they must beat one 
 another? Note, 

 [1.] Even sufferings in common do not always unite God's professing 
 people to one another, so much as one might reasonably expect. 

 [2.] When God raises up instruments of salvation for the church they 
 will find enough to do, not only with oppressing Egyptians, to restrain 
 them, but with quarrelsome Israelites, to reconcile them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The way he took of dealing with them; he marked him that caused
 the division, that did the wrong, and mildly reasoned with him: 
 <I>Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</I> The injurious Egyptian was 
 killed, the injurious Hebrew was only reprimanded; for what the former 
 did was from a rooted malice, what the latter did we may suppose was 
 only upon a sudden provocation. The wise God makes, and, according to 
 his example, all wise governors make, a difference between one offender 
 and another, according to the several qualities of the same offence. 
 Moses endeavoured to make them friends, a good office; thus we find 
 Christ often reproving his disciples' strifes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:46-50,22:24-27">Luke ix. 46, &c.; xxii. 24, &c.</A>),

 for he was a prophet like unto Moses, a healing prophet, a peacemaker, 
 who visited his brethren with a design to slay all enmities. The 
 reproof Moses gave on this occasion may still be of use, <I>Wherefore 
 smitest thou thy fellow?</I> Note, Smiting our fellows is bad in any, 
 especially in Hebrews, smiting with tongue or hand, either in a way of 
 persecution or in a way of strife and contention. Consider the person 
 thou smitest; it is thy fellow, thy fellow-creature, thy 
 fellow-christian, it is thy fellow-servant, thy fellow-sufferer.
 Consider the cause, <I>Wherefore smitest?</I> Perhaps it is for no 
 cause at all, or no just cause, or none worth speaking of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The ill success of his attempt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He said, Who made thee a prince?</I> He that did the wrong thus 
 quarrelled with Moses; the injured party, it should seem, was 
 inclinable enough to peace, but the wrong-doer was thus touchy. Note, 
 It is a sign of guilt to be impatient of reproof; and it is often 
 easier to persuade the injured to bear the trouble of taking wrong than 
 the injurious to bear the conviction of having <I>done wrong.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:7,8">1 Cor. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 It was a very wise and mild
 reproof which Moses gave to this quarrelsome Hebrew, but he could not 
 bear it, he kicked against the pricks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:5">Acts ix. 5</A>),

 and crossed questions with his reprover.

 [1.] He challenges his authority: <I>Who made thee a prince?</I> A man
 needs no great authority for the giving of a friendly reproof, it is an 
 act of kindness; yet this man needs will interpret it an act of 
 dominion, and represents his reprover as imperious and assuming. Thus 
 when people dislike good discourse, or a seasonable admonition, they 
 will call it <I>preaching,</I> as if a man could not speak a work for 
 God and against sin but he took too much upon him. Yet Moses was indeed 
 a prince and a judge, and knew it, and thought the Hebrews would have 
 understood it, and struck in with him; but they stood in their own 
 light, and <I>thrust him away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:25,27">Acts vii. 25, 27</A>.

 [2.] He upbraids him with what he had done in killing the Egyptian: 
 <I>Intendest thou to kill me?</I> See what base constructions malice 
 puts upon the best words and actions. Moses, for reproving him is 
 immediately charged with a design to kill him. An attempt upon his sin 
 was interpreted an attempt upon his life; and his having killed the 
 Egyptian was thought sufficient to justify the suspicion; as if Moses 
 made no difference between an Egyptian and a Hebrew. If Moses, to right 
 an injured Hebrew, had put his life in his hand, and slain an Egyptian, 
 he ought therefore to have submitted to him, not only as a friend to 
 the Hebrews, but as a friend that had more than ordinary power and 
 zeal. But he throws that in his teeth as a crime which was bravely 
 done, and was intended as a specimen of the promised deliverance; if 
 the Hebrews had taken the hint, and come in to Moses as their head and 
 captain, it is probable that they would have been delivered now; but, 
 despising their deliverer, their deliverance was justly deferred, and 
 their bondage prolonged forty years, as afterwards their despising 
 Canaan kept them out of it forty years more. <I>I would, and you would 
 not.</I> Note, Men know not what they do, nor what enemies they are to 
 their own interest, when they resist and despise faithful reproofs and 
 reprovers. When the Hebrews strove with Moses, God sent him away into 
 Midian, and they never heard of him for forty years; thus the things 
 that belonged to their peace were hidden from their eyes, because they 
 knew not the day of their visitation. As to Moses, we may look on it as 
 a great damp and discouragement to him. He was now <I>choosing to 
 suffer affliction with the people of God,</I> and embracing <I>the 
 reproach of Christ;</I> and now, at his first setting out, to meet with 
 this affliction and reproach from them was a very sore trial of his 
 resolution. He might have said, "If this be the spirit of the Hebrews, 
 I will go to court again, and be the son of Pharaoh's daughter." Note, 
 <I>First,</I> We must take heed of being prejudiced against the ways 
 and people of God by the follies and peevishness of some particular 
 persons that profess religion. <I>Secondly,</I> It is no new thing for 
 the church's best friends to meet with a great deal of opposition and 
 discouragement in their healing, saving attempts, even from their own 
 mother's children; Christ himself was set at nought by the builders, 
 and is still rejected by those he would save.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The flight of Moses to Midian, in consequence. The affront given
 him thus far proved a kindness to him; it gave him to understand that 
 his killing the Egyptian was discovered, and so he had time to make his 
 escape, otherwise the wrath of Pharaoh might have surprised him and 
 taken him off. Note, God can overrule even the strife of tongues, so 
 as, one way or other, to bring good to his people out of it. 
 Information was brought to Pharaoh (and it is well if it was not 
 brought by the Hebrew himself whom Moses reproved) of his killing the 
 Egyptian; warrants are presently out for the apprehending of Moses, 
 which obliged him to shift for his own safety, by flying into the land 
 of Midian,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 [1.] Moses did this out of a prudent care of his own life. If this be 
 his forsaking of Egypt which the apostle refers to as done by faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:27">Heb. xi. 27</A>), 

 it teaches us that when we are at any time in trouble and danger for 
 doing our duty the grace of faith will be of good use to us in taking 
 proper methods for our own preservation. Yet there it is said, <I>He 
 feared not the wrath of the king;</I> here it is said he <I>feared,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He did not fear with a fear of
 diffidence and amazement, which weakens and has torment, but with a 
 fear of diligence, which quickened him to take that way which 
 Providence opened to him for his own preservation. 

 [2.] God ordered it for wise and holy ends. Things were not yet ripe 
 for Israel's deliverance: the measure of Egypt's iniquity was not yet 
 full; the Hebrews were not sufficiently humbled, nor were they yet 
 increased to such a multitude as God designed; Moses is to be further 
 fitted for the service, and therefore is directed to withdraw for the 
 present, till the time to favour Israel, even the set time, should 
 come. God guided Moses to Midian because the Midianites were of the 
 seed of Abraham, and retained the worship of the true God among them, 
 so that he might have not only a safe but a comfortable settlement 
 among them. And through this country he was afterwards to lead Israel, 
 with which (that he might do it the better) he now had opportunity of 
 making himself acquainted. Hither he came, and sat down by a well, 
 tired and thoughtful, at a loss, and waiting to see which way 
 Providence would direct him. It was a great change with him, since he 
 was but the other day at ease in Pharaoh's court: thus God tried his 
 faith, and it was found to praise and honour.</P>

 Moses here gains a settlement in Midian, just as his father Jacob had
 gained one in Syria,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:2">Gen. xxix. 2</A>,

 &c. And both these instances should
 encourage us to trust Providence, and to follow it. Events that seem 
 inconsiderable, and purely accidental, after wards appear to have been 
 designed by the wisdom of God for very good purposes, and of great 
 consequence to his people. A casual transient occurrence has sometimes 
 occasioned the greatest and happiest turns of a man's life.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the seven daughters of Reuel the priest or prince of 
 Midian.

 1. They were humble, and very industrious, according as the employment
 of the country was: they <I>drew water for their father's flock,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If their father was a prince, it teaches us that even
 those who are honourably born, and are of quality and distinction in 
 their country, should yet apply themselves to some useful business, and 
 what their hand finds to do do it with all their might. Idleness can be 
 no one's honour. If their father was a priest, it teaches us that
 ministers' children should, in a special manner, be examples of 
 humility and industry.

 2. They were modest, and would not ask this strange Egyptian to come
 home with them (though handsome and a great courtier), till their 
 father sent for him. Modesty is the ornament of woman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning Moses. He was taken for an Egyptian

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 and strangers must be content to be the subjects of mistake; but it is
 observable,

 1. How ready he was to help Reuel's daughters to water their flocks.
 Though bred in learning and at court, yet he knew how to turn his hand 
 to such an office as this when there was occasion; nor had he learned 
 of the Egyptians to despise shepherds. Note, Those that have had a 
 liberal education yet should not be strangers to servile work, because 
 they know not what necessity Providence may put them in of working for 
 themselves, or what opportunity Providence may give them of being 
 serviceable to others. These young women, it seems, met with some 
 opposition in their employment, more than they and their servants could 
 conquer; the shepherds of some neighbouring prince, as some think, or 
 some idle fellows that called themselves shepherds, <I>drove away their 
 flocks;</I> but Moses, though melancholy and in distress, <I>stood up 
 and helped them,</I> not only to get clear of the shepherds, but, when 
 that was done, to water the flocks. This he did, not only in 
 complaisance to the daughters of Reuel (though that also did very well 
 become him), but because, wherever he was, as occasion offered itself, 

 (1.) He loved to be doing justice, and appearing in the defence of such 
 as he saw injured, which every man ought to do as far as it is in the 
 power of his hand to do it. 

 (2.) He loved to be doing good. Wherever the Providence of God casts us 
 we should desire and endeavour to be useful; and, when we cannot do the 
 good we would, we must be ready to do the good we can. And he that is 
 faithful in a little shall be entrusted with more.

 2. How well he was paid for his serviceableness. When the young women
 acquainted their father with the kindnesses they had received from this 
 stranger, he sent to invite him to his house, and made much of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Thus God will recompense the
 kindnesses which are at any time shown to his children; they shall in 
 no wise lose their reward. Moses soon recommended himself to the esteem 
 and good affection of this prince of Midian, who took him into his 
 house, and, in process of time, married one of his daughters to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 by whom he had a son, whom he called <I>Gershom, a stranger there</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 that if ever God should give him a home of his own
 he might keep in remembrance the land in which he had been a stranger. 
 Now this settlement of Moses in Midian was designed by Providence, 

 (1.) To shelter him for the present. God will find hiding-places for 
 his people in the day of their distress; nay, he will himself be to 
 them a little sanctuary, and will secure them, either under heaven or 
 in heaven. But, 

 (2.) It was also designed to prepare him for the great services he was 
 further designed for. His manner of life in Midian, where he kept the 
 flock of his father-in-law (having none of his own to keep), would be 
 of use to him, 

 [1.] To inure him to hardship and poverty, that he might learn how to 
 want as well as how to abound. Those whom God intends to exalt he
 first humbles. 

 [2.] To inure him to contemplation and devotion. Egypt accomplished him 
 as a scholar, a gentleman, a statesman, a soldier, all which 
 accomplishments would be afterwards of use to him; but yet he lacked 
 one thing, in which the court of Egypt could not befriend him. He that
 was to do all by divine revelation must know, by a long experience, 
 what it was to live a life of communion with God; and in this he would 
 be greatly furthered by the solitude and retirement of a shepherd's 
 life in Midian. By the former he was prepared to rule in Jeshurun, but 
 by the latter he was prepared to converse with God in Mount Horeb, near 
 which mount he had spent much of his time. Those that know what it is 
 to be alone with God in holy exercises are acquainted with better 
 delights than ever Moses tasted in the court of Pharaoh.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of
 Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
 bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason
 of the bondage.
 &nbsp; 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his
 covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
 &nbsp; 25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
 respect unto <I>them.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. The continuance of the Israelites' bondage in Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Probably the murdering of their infants did not continue; this part of 
 their affliction attended only the period immediately connected with 
 the birth of Moses, and served to signalize it. The Egyptians now were 
 content with their increase, finding that Egypt was enriched by their 
 labour; so that they might have them for slaves, they cared not how 
 many they were. On this therefore they were intent, to keep them all at 
 work, and make the best hand they could of their labour. When one 
 Pharaoh died, another rose up in his place that was governed by the 
 same maxims, and was as cruel to Israel as his predecessors. If there 
 was sometimes a little relaxation, yet it presently revived again with 
 as much rigour as ever; and probably, as the more Israel were oppressed 
 the more they multiplied, so the more they multiplied the more they 
 were oppressed. Note, Sometimes God suffers the rod of the wicked to 
 lie very long and very heavily on the lot of the righteous. If Moses, 
 in Midian, at any time began to think how much better his condition 
 might have been had he staid among the courtiers, he must of himself 
 think this also, how much worse it would have been if he had had his 
 lot with brethren: it was a great degradation to him to be keeping 
 sheep in Midian, but better so than making brick in Egypt. The 
 consideration of our brethren's afflictions would help to reconcile us 
 to our own.

 2. The preface to their deliverance at last.

 (1.) <I>They cried,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Now, at last, they began to think of God under their
 troubles, and to return to him from the idols they had served, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:8">Ezek. xx. 8</A>. 

 Hitherto they had fretted at the instruments of their trouble, but God 
 was not in all their thoughts. Thus <I>hypocrites in heart heap up 
 wrath; they cry not when he binds them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:13">Job xxxvi. 13</A>. 
 
 But before
 God unbound them he put it into their hearts to cry unto him, as it is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:16">Num. xx. 16</A>. 

 Note, It is a good sign that God is coming towards us with deliverance
 when he inclines and enables us to cry to him for it.

 (2.) <I>God heard,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 The name of God is here
 emphatically prefixed to four different expressions of a kind intention 
 towards them. 

 [1.] <I>God heard their groaning;</I> that is, he made it to appear 
 that he took notice of their complaints. The groans of the oppressed 
 cry aloud in the ears of the righteous God, to whom vengeance belongs, 
 especially the groans of God's spiritual Israel; he knows the burdens 
 they groan under and the blessings they groan after, and that the 
 blessed Spirit, by these groanings, makes intercession in them.

 [2.] <I>God remembered his covenant,</I> which he seemed to have 
 forgotten, but of which he is ever mindful. This God had an eye to, and 
 not to any merit of theirs, in what he did for them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.

 (3.) <I>God looked upon the children of Israel.</I> Moses looked upon
 them and pitied them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 but now God looked upon them and helped them.

 (4.) <I>God had a respect unto them,</I> a favourable respect to them
 as his own. The frequent repetition of the name of God here intimates 
 that now we are to expect something great, <I>Opus Deo dignum--A work 
 worthy of God.</I> His eyes, which run to and fro through the earth, 
 are now fixed upon Israel, to show himself strong, to show himself a 
 God in their behalf.</P>
