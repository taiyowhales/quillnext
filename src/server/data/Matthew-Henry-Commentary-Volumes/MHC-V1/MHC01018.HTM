 We have an account in this chapter of another interview between 
 God and Abraham, probably within a few days after the former, 
 as the reward of his cheerful obedience to the law of circumcision. 
 Here is, 
 
 I. The kind visit which God made him, and
 the kind entertainment which he gave to that visit,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.
 
 II. The matters discoursed of between them. 
 
 1. The purposes 
 of God's love concerning Sarah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>.
 
 2. The purposes of 
 God's wrath concerning Sodom. 
 
 (1.) The discovery God made 
 to Abraham of his design to destroy Sodom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.
 
 (2.) The intercession Abraham made for Sodom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23-33">ver. 23</A>,
 &c.).</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto 
 him in the plains of Mamre: 
 and he sat in the tent door in the heat 
 of the day;
 &nbsp; 2 And he lift up his eyes 
 and looked, and, lo, three men stood
 by him: and when he saw <I>them,</I> he 
 ran to meet them from the tent-door, 
 and bowed himself toward the ground,
 &nbsp; 3 And said, My Lord, if now I have 
 found favour in thy sight, pass not 
 away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
 &nbsp; 4 Let a little water, I pray you, be 
 fetched, and wash your feet, and rest 
 yourselves under the tree:
 &nbsp; 5 And I 
 will fetch a morsel of bread, and 
 comfort ye your hearts; after that 
 ye shall pass on: for therefore are 
 ye come to your servant. And they 
 said, So do, as thou hast said.
 &nbsp; 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent 
 unto Sarah, and said, Make ready 
 quickly three measures of fine meal, 
 knead <I>it,</I> and make cakes upon the 
 hearth.
 &nbsp; 7 And Abraham ran unto 
 the herd, and fetched a calf tender 
 and good, and gave <I>it</I> unto a young 
 man; and he hasted to dress it.
 &nbsp; 8 And he took butter, and milk, and the 
 calf which he had dressed, and set <I>it</I> 
 before them; and he stood by them 
 under the tree, and they did eat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The appearance of God to Abraham seems 
 to have had in it more of freedom and 
 familiarity, and less of grandeur and majesty, 
 than those we have hitherto read of; 
 and therefore more resembles that great visit 
 which, in the fullness of time, the Son of God 
 was to make to the world, when the Word 
 would be flesh, and appear as one of 
 us. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Abraham expected strangers, and 
 how richly his expectations were answered
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 <I>He sat in the tent-door, in the heat of 
 the day;</I> not so much to repose or divert 
 himself as to seek an opportunity of doing 
 good, by giving entertainment to strangers 
 and travellers, there being perhaps no inns 
 to accommodate them. Note, 
 
 1. We are 
 likely to have the most comfort of those 
 good works to which we are most free and 
 forward. 
 
 2. God graciously visits those in 
 whom he has first raised the expectation of 
 him, and manifests himself to those that wait 
 for him. When Abraham was thus sitting, 
 he saw three men coming towards him. 
 These three men were three spiritual heavenly 
 beings, now assuming human bodies, that 
 they might be visible to Abraham, and conversable 
 with him. Some think that they were 
 all created angels, others that one of them 
 was the Son of God, the angel of the covenant, 
 whom Abraham distinguished from the 
 rest
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 and who is called <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 The apostle improves this for the encouragement 
 of hospitality, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:2">Heb. xiii. 2</A>.
 Those that 
 have been forward to entertain strangers have 
 entertained angels, to their unspeakable honour 
 and satisfaction. Where, upon a prudent 
 and impartial judgment, we see no cause to 
 suspect ill, charity teaches us to hope well 
 and to show kindness accordingly. It is 
 better to feed five drones, or wasps, than to 
 starve one bee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How Abraham entertained those 
 strangers, and how kindly his entertainment 
 was accepted. The Holy Ghost takes particular 
 notice of the very free and affectionate 
 welcome Abraham gave to the strangers. 1. 
 
 He was very complaisant and respectful to 
 them. Forgetting his age and gravity, he 
 <I>ran to meet them</I> in the most obliging manner, 
 and with all due courtesy <I>bowed himself towards 
 the ground,</I> though as yet he knew 
 nothing of them but that they appeared 
 graceful respectable men. Note, Religion 
 does not destroy, but improve, good manners, 
 and teaches us to honour all men. 
 Decent civility is a great ornament to piety. 
 
 2. He was very earnest and importunate for 
 their stay, and took it as a great favour,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) It becomes those whom God 
 has blessed with plenty to be liberal and 
 open-hearted in their entertainments, according 
 to their ability, and (not in compliment, 
 but cordially) to bid their friends welcome. 
 We should take a pleasure in showing kindness 
 to any; for both God and man love a 
 cheerful giver. Who would <I>eat the bread of 
 him that has an evil eye?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:6,7">Prov. xxiii. 6, 7</A>.

 (2.) Those that would have communion with 
 God must earnestly desire it and pray for it. 
 God is a guest worth entertaining. 
 
 3. His 
 entertainment, though it was very free, was 
 yet plain and homely, and there was nothing 
 in it of the gaiety and niceness of our times. 
 His dining-room was an arbour under a tree; 
 no rich table-linen, no side-board set with 

 <A NAME="Page116"> </A>

 plate. His feast was a joint or two of veal, 
 and some cakes baked on the hearth, and 
 both hastily dressed up. Here were no 
 dainties, no varieties, no forced-meats, no 
 sweet-meats, but good, plain, wholesome 
 food, though Abraham was very rich and his 
 guests were very honourable. Note, We 
 ought not to be curious in our diet. Let us 
 be thankful for food convenient, though it 
 be homely and common; and not be desirous 
 of dainties, for they are deceitful meat to 
 those that love them and set their hearts upon 
 them. 
 
 4. He and his wife were both of 
 them very attentive and busy, in accommodating 
 their guests with the best they had. 
 Sarah herself is cook and baker; Abraham 
 runs to fetch the calf, brings out the milk 
 and butter, and thinks it not below him to 
 wait at table, that he might show how heartily 
 welcome his guests were. Note, 
 
 (1.) Those 
 that have real merit need not take state upon 
 them, nor are their prudent condescensions 
 any disparagement to them. 
 
 (2.) Hearty 
 friendship will stoop to any thing but sin. 
 Christ himself has taught us to wash one 
 another's feet, in humble love. Those that 
 thus abase themselves shall be exalted. Here 
 Abraham's faith showed itself in good works; 
 and so must ours, else it is dead, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:21,26">Jam. ii. 21, 26</A>.
 The father of the faithful was famous 
 for charity, and generosity, and good house-keeping; 
 and we must learn of him to <I>do 
 good and to communicate.</I> Job did not eat 
 his morsel alone, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17">Job xxxi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And they said unto him, Where 
 <I>is</I> Sarah thy wife? And he said, 
 Behold, in the tent.
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, 
 I will certainly return unto thee according 
 to the time of life; and, lo, 
 Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And
 Sarah heard <I>it</I> in the tent-door, which 
 <I>was</I> behind him.
 &nbsp; 11 Now Abraham 
 and Sarah <I>were</I> old <I>and</I> well stricken 
 in age; <I>and</I> it ceased to be with Sarah 
 after the manner of women.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore 
 Sarah laughed within herself, saying, 
 After I am waxed old shall I have 
 pleasure, my lord being old also?
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Abraham, 
 Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, 
 Shall I of a surety bear a child, which 
 am old?
 &nbsp; 14 Is any thing too hard 
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? At the time appointed 
 I will return unto thee, according to 
 the time of life, and Sarah shall have 
 a son.
 &nbsp; 15 Then Sarah denied, saying, 
 I laughed not; for she was afraid. 
 And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These heavenly guests (being sent to confirm 
 the promise lately made to Abraham, 
 that he should have a son by Sarah), while 
 they are receiving Abraham's kind entertainment, 
 they return his kindness. He receives 
 angels, and has angels' rewards, a 
 gracious message from heaven, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:41">Matt. x. 41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Care is taken that Sarah should be 
 within hearing. She must conceive by faith, 
 and therefore the promise must be made to 
 her, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11">Heb. xi. 11</A>.
 It was the modest usage 
 of that time that the women did not sit at 
 meat with men, at least not with strangers,
 but confined themselves to their own apartments; 
 therefore Sarah is here out of sight: 
 but she must not be out of hearing. The 
 angels enquire
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 <I>Where is Sarah thy 
 wife?</I> By naming her, they gave intimation 
 enough to Abraham that, though they seemed 
 strangers, yet they very well knew him and 
 his family. By enquiring after her, they 
 showed a friendly kind concern for the 
 family and relations of one whom they found 
 respectful to them. It is a piece of common 
 civility, which ought to proceed from a principle 
 of Christian love, and then it is sanctified. 
 And, by speaking of her (she over-hearing 
 it), they drew her to listen to what 
 was further to be said. <I>Where is Sarah thy 
 wife?</I> say the angels. "<I>Behold in the tent,</I>" says 
 Abraham. "Where should she be else? There 
 she is in her place, as she uses to be, and is 
 now within call." Note, 
 
 1. The daughters of 
 Sarah must learn of her to be <I>chaste, keepers 
 at home,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:5">Tit. ii. 5</A>.
 There is nothing got by 
 gadding. 
 
 2. Those are most likely to receive 
 comfort from God and his promises that are 
 in their place and in the way of their duty, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:8">Luke ii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promise is then renewed and ratified, 
 that she should have a son
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 "<I>I 
 will certainly return unto thee,</I> and visit thee 
 next time with the performance, as now I do 
 with the promise." God will return to those 
 that bid him welcome, that entertain his visits: 
 "I will return thy kindness, <I>Sarah thy wife 
 shall have a son;</I>" it is repeated again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 Thus the promises of the Messiah were 
 often repeated in the Old Testament, for the 
 strengthening of the faith of God's people. 
 We are slow of heart to believe, and therefore 
 have need of line upon line to the same 
 purport. This is that word of promise which 
 the apostle quotes 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:9">Rom. ix. 9</A>),
 as that by the 
 virtue of which Isaac was born. Note, 
 
 1. The same blessings which others have from
 common providence believers have from the
 promise, which makes them very sweet and
 very sure.

 2. The spiritual seed of Abraham 
 owe their life, and joy, and hope, and all, to 
 the promise. They are born by the word of 
 God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23">1 Pet. i. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Sarah thinks this too good news to be 
 true, and therefore cannot as yet find in her 
 heart to believe it: <I>Sarah laughed within herself,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 It was not a pleasing laughter of 
 faith, like Abraham's
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>),
 but it was 
 a laughter of doubting and mistrust. Note, 
 The same thing may be done from very different 
 principles, of which God only, who 
 
 <A NAME="Page117"> </A>

 knows the heart, can judge. The great objection 
 which Sarah could not get over was 
 her age: "<I>I am waxed old,</I> and past childbearing 
 in the course of nature, especially 
 having been hitherto barren, and (which 
 magnifies the difficulty) <I>my lord is old also.</I>" 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. Sarah calls Abraham her 
 <I>lord;</I> it was the only good word in this saying, 
 and the Holy Ghost takes notice of it to 
 her honour, and recommends it to the imitation 
 of all Christian wives. 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:6">1 Pet. iii. 6</A>,
 <I>Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord,</I> in 
 token of respect and subjection. Thus must 
 the wife reverence her husband, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:33">Eph. v. 33</A>.
 And thus must we be apt to take notice of 
 what is spoken decently and well, to the honour 
 of those that speak it, though it may be 
 mixed with that which is amiss, over which 
 we should cast a mantle of love. 
 
 2. Human 
 improbability often sets up in contradiction 
 to the divine promise. The objections of 
 sense are very apt to stumble and puzzle the 
 weak faith even of true believers. It is hard 
 to cleave to the first Cause, when second 
 causes frown. 
 
 3. Even where there is true 
 faith, yet there are often sore conflicts with unbelief, 
 Sarah could say, <I>Lord, I believe</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11">Heb. xi. 11</A>),
 and yet must say, <I>Lord, help my unbelief.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The angel reproves the indecent expressions 
 of her distrust,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 1. Though Sarah was now most kindly and 
 generously entertaining these angels, yet, 
 when she did amiss, they reproved her for it, 
 as Christ reproved Martha in her own house, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:40,41">Luke x. 40, 41</A>.
 If our friends be kind to 
 us, we must not therefore be so unkind to 
 them as to suffer sin upon them. 2. God 
 gave this reproof to Sarah by Abraham her 
 husband. To him he said, <I>Why did Sarah 
 laugh?</I> perhaps because he had not told
 her of the promise which had been given him 
 some time before to this purport, and which, 
 if he had communicated it to her with its ratifications, 
 would have prevented her from 
 being so surprised now. Or Abraham was 
 told of it that he might tell her of it. Mutual 
 reproof, when there is occasion for it, is one 
 of the duties of the conjugal relation. 
 
 3. The 
 reproof itself is plain, and backed with a good 
 reason: <I>Wherefore did Sarah laugh?</I> Note, 
 It is good to enquire into the reason of our 
 laughter, that it may not be the laughter of 
 the fool, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:6">Eccl. vii. 6</A>.
 "Wherefore did I 
 laugh?" Again, Our unbelief and distrust 
 are a great offence to the God of heaven. 
 He justly takes it ill to have the objections 
 of sense set up in contradiction to his promise, 
 as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:18">Luke i. 18</A>.

 4. Here is a question 
 asked which is enough to answer all the cavils 
 of flesh and blood: <I>Is any thing too hard for 
 the Lord?</I> (Heb. <I>too wonderful</I>), that is, 
 
 (1.) Is any thing so secret as to escape his cognizance? 
 No, not Sarah's laughing, though 
 it was only <I>within herself.</I> Or, 
 
 (2.) Is any 
 thing so difficult as to exceed his power? No, 
 not the giving of a child to Sarah in her old age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Sarah foolishly endeavours to conceal 
 her fault
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 <I>She denied, saying, I did 
 not laugh,</I> thinking nobody could contradict 
 her: she told this lie, because <I>she was afraid;</I> 
 but it was in vain to attempt concealing it 
 from an all-seeing eye; she was told, to her 
 shame, <I>Thou didst laugh.</I> Now, 
 
 1. There 
 seems to be in Sarah a retraction of her distrust. 
 Now she perceived, by laying circumstances 
 together, that it was a divine promise 
 which had been made concerning her, she 
 renounced all doubting distrustful thoughts 
 about it. But, 
 
 2. There was withal a sinful 
 attempt to cover a sin with a lie. It is a 
 shame to do amiss, but a greater shame to 
 deny it; for thereby we add iniquity to our 
 iniquity. Fear of a rebuke often betrays us 
 into this snare. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:11">Isa. lvii. 11</A>,
 <I>Whom hast 
 thou feared, that thou hast lied?</I> But we deceive 
 ourselves if we think to impose upon 
 God; he can and will bring truth to light, to 
 our shame. <I>He that covers his sin cannot prosper,</I> 
 for the day is coming which will discover it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And the men rose up from thence, 
 and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham 
 went with them to bring them 
 on the way.
 &nbsp; 17 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, 
 Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
 which I do;
 &nbsp; 18 Seeing that Abraham 
 shall surely become a great and 
 mighty nation, and all the nations of 
 the earth shall be blessed in him?
 &nbsp; 19 For I know him, that he will command 
 his children and his household 
 after him, and they shall keep the 
 way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to do justice and 
 judgment; that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> may bring 
 upon Abraham that which he hath 
 spoken of him.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, 
 Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah 
 is great, and because their 
 sin is very grievous;
 &nbsp; 21 I will go 
 down now, and see whether they have 
 done altogether according to the cry 
 of it, which is come unto me; and if 
 not, I will know.
 &nbsp; 22 And the men 
 turned their faces from thence, and 
 went toward Sodom: but Abraham 
 stood yet before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The messengers from heaven had now 
 despatched one part of their business, which 
 was an errand of grace to Abraham and Sarah, 
 and which they delivered first; but now they 
 have before them work of another nature. 
 Sodom is to be destroyed, and they must do 
 it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>.
 Note, As with the Lord there 
 is mercy, so he is the God to whom vengeance 
 belongs. Pursuant to their commission, we 
 here find, 
 
 1. That <I>they looked towards Sodom</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 they set their faces against it in wrath, 
 as God is said to look unto the host of the 
 Egyptians, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:24">Exod. xiv. 24</A>.
 Note, Though 
 
 <A NAME="Page118"> </A>

 God has long seemed to connive at sinners, 
 from which they have inferred that the Lord 
 does not see, does not regard, yet, when the 
 day of his wrath comes, he will look towards 
 them. 
 
 2. That they <I>went towards Sodom</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 and accordingly we find two of them 
 at Sodom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:1"><I>ch.</I> xix. 1</A>.
 Whether the third was 
 the Lord, before whom Abraham yet stood, 
 and to whom he drew near
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 as most 
 think, or whether the third left them before 
 they came to Sodom, and the Lord before 
 whom Abraham stood was the <I>shechinah,</I> or 
 that appearance of the divine glory which 
 Abraham had formerly seen and conversed 
 with, is uncertain. However, we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The honour Abraham did to his guests: 
 <I>He went with them to bring them on the way,</I> 
 as one that was loth to part with such good 
 company, and was desirous to pay his utmost 
 respects to them. This is a piece of civility 
 proper to be shown to our friends; but it 
 must be done as the apostle directs 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:6">3 John 6</A>),
 <I>after a godly sort.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The honour they did to him; for those 
 that honour God he will honour. God communicated 
 to Abraham his purpose to destroy 
 Sodom, and not only so, but entered into a 
 free conference with him about it. Having 
 taken him, more closely than before, into
 covenant with himself 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1-23"><I>ch.</I> xvii.</A>),
 he here admits 
 him into more intimate communion with 
 himself than ever, as the man of his counsel. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God's friendly thoughts concerning 
 Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>,
 where we have his resolution 
 to make known to Abraham his purpose 
 concerning Sodom, with the reasons of 
 it. If Abraham had not brought them on 
 their way, perhaps he would not have been 
 thus favoured; but he that loves to walk 
 with wise men shall be wise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:20">Prov. xiii. 20</A>.
 See how God is pleased to argue with himself: 
 <I>Shall I hide from Abraham</I> (or, as some 
 read it, <I>Am I concealing from Abraham</I>) <I>that 
 thing which I do?</I> "Can I go about such a 
 thing, and not tell Abraham?" Thus does 
 God, in his counsels, express himself, after 
 the manner of men, with deliberation. But 
 why must Abraham be of the cabinet-council? 
 The Jews suggest that because God had 
 granted the land of Canaan to Abraham and 
 his seed therefore he would not destroy those 
 cities which were a part of that land, without 
 his knowledge and consent. But God here 
 gives two other reasons:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Abraham must know, for he is a friend 
 and a favourite, and one that God has a particular 
 kindness for and great things in store 
 for. He is to become a great nation; and 
 not only so, but in the Messiah, who is to 
 come from his loins, <I>All nations of the earth 
 shall be blessed.</I> Note, <I>The secret of the Lord 
 is with those that fear him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14,Pr+3:32">Ps. xxv. 14; Prov. iii. 32</A>.
 Those who by faith live a life of 
 communion with God cannot but know more 
 of his mind than other people, though not 
 with a prophetical, yet with a prudential 
 practical knowledge. They have a better 
 insight than others into what is present 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9,Ps+107:43">Hos. xiv. 9; Ps. cvii. 43</A>),
 and a better foresight 
 of what is to come, at least so much as suffices 
 for their guidance and for their comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Abraham must know, for he will teach 
 his household: <I>I know Abraham</I> very well, 
 that <I>he will command his children and his 
 household after him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 Consider this, 
 
 [1.] As a very bright part of Abraham's 
 character and example. He not only prayed 
 with his family, but he taught them as a 
 man of knowledge, nay, he commanded them as a 
 man in authority, and was prophet and 
 king, as well as priest, in his own house. 
 Observe, <I>First,</I> God having made the covenant 
 with him and his seed, and his household 
 being circumcised pursuant to that, he 
 was very careful to teach and rule them well. 
 Those that expect family blessings must 
 make conscience of family duty. If our 
 children be the Lord's, they must be nursed 
 for him; if they wear his livery, they must 
 be trained up in his work. <I>Secondly,</I> Abraham 
 took care not only of his children, but 
 of his household; his servants were catechized 
 servants. Masters of families should 
 instruct and inspect the manners of all under 
 their roof. The poorest servants have precious 
 souls that must be looked after. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 Abraham made it his care and business to 
 promote practical religion in his family. He 
 did not fill their heads with matters of nice 
 speculation, or doubtful disputation; but he
 taught them to keep <I>the way of the Lord, and 
 to do judgment and justice,</I> that is, to be serious 
 and devout in the worship of God and to be 
 honest in their dealings with all men. <I>Fourthly,</I> 
 Abraham, herein, had an eye to posterity, 
 and was in care not only that his household 
 with him, but that his household after him, 
 should keep the way of the Lord, that religion 
 might flourish in his family when he 
 was in his grave. <I>Fifthly,</I> His doing this 
 was the fulfilling of the conditions of the 
 promises which God had made him. Those 
 only can expect the benefit of the promises 
 that make conscience of their duty. 
 
 [2.] As 
 the reason why God would make known to 
 him his purpose concerning Sodom, because 
 he was communicative of his knowledge, and 
 improved it for the benefit of those that were 
 under his charge. Note, To him that hath 
 shall be given, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:12,25:29">Matt. xiii. 12; xxv. 29</A>.
 Those that make a good use of their knowledge 
 shall know more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God's friendly talk with Abraham, in 
 which he makes known to him purpose 
 concerning Sodom, and allows him a liberty 
 of application to him about the matter. 
 
 (1.) He tells him of the evidence there was against 
 Sodom: <I>The cry of Sodom is great,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 Note, Some sins, and the sins of some sinners, 
 cry aloud to heaven for vengeance. 
 The iniquity of Sodom was crying iniquity, 
 that is, it was so very provoking that it even 
 urged God to punish. 
 
 (2.) The enquiry he 
 
 <A NAME="Page119"> </A>

 would make upon this evidence: <I>I will go 
 down now and see,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 Not as if there were 
 any thing concerning which God is in doubt, 
 or in the dark; but he is pleased thus to 
 express himself after the manner of men, 
 
 [1.] To show the incontestable equity of all 
 his judicial proceedings. Men are apt to 
 suggest that his way is not equal; but let 
 them know that his judgments are the result 
 of an eternal counsel, and are never rash or 
 sudden resolves. He never punishes upon 
 report, or common fame, or the information 
 of others, but upon his own certain and 
 infallible knowledge. 
 
 [2.] To give example 
 to magistrates, and those in authority, with 
 the utmost care and diligence to enquire into 
 the merits of a cause, before they give judgment 
 upon it. 
 
 [3.] Perhaps the decree is 
 here spoken of as not yet peremptory, that 
 room and encouragement might be given to 
 Abraham to make intercession for them. 
 Thus God looked if there were any to intercede, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16">Isa. lix. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And Abraham drew near, and 
 said, Wilt thou also destroy the 
 righteous with the wicked?
 &nbsp; 24 Peradventure 
 there be fifty righteous 
 within the city: wilt thou also destroy 
 and not spare the place for the 
 fifty righteous that <I>are</I> therein?
 &nbsp; 25 That be far from thee to do after this 
 manner, to slay the righteous with 
 the wicked: and that the righteous 
 should be as the wicked, that be far 
 from thee: Shall not the Judge of all 
 the earth do right?
 &nbsp; 26 And the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, If I find in Sodom fifty 
 righteous within the city, then I will 
 spare all the place for their sakes.
 &nbsp; 27 And Abraham answered and said, 
 Behold now, I have taken upon me 
 to speak unto the Lord, which <I>am but</I> 
 dust and ashes:
 &nbsp; 28 Peradventure 
 there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
 wilt thou destroy all the city 
 for <I>lack of</I> five? And he said, If I 
 find there forty and five, I will not 
 destroy <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 29 And he spake unto 
 him yet again, and said, Peradventure
 there shall be forty found there. And 
 he said, I will not do <I>it</I> for forty's 
 sake.
 &nbsp; 30 And he said <I>unto him,</I> Oh 
 let not the Lord be angry, and I will 
 speak: Peradventure there shall thirty 
 be found there. And he said, I will 
 not do <I>it,</I> if I find thirty there.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken 
 upon me to speak unto the Lord: 
 Peradventure there shall be twenty 
 found there. And he said, I will not 
 destroy <I>it</I> for twenty's sake.
 &nbsp; 32 And 
 he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, 
 and I will speak yet but this once: 
 Peradventure ten shall be found there. 
 And he said, I will not destroy <I>it</I> for 
 ten's sake.
 &nbsp; 33 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went 
 his way, as soon as he had left communing
 with Abraham: and Abraham 
 returned unto his place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Communion with God is kept up by the 
 word and by prayer. In the word God 
 speaks to us; in prayer we speak to him. 
 God had revealed to Abraham his purposes 
 concerning Sodom; now from this Abraham 
 takes occasion to speak to God on Sodom's 
 behalf. Note, God's word then does us good 
 when it furnishes us with matter for prayer 
 and excites us to it. When God has spoken to 
 us, we must consider what we have to say 
 to him upon it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The solemnity of Abraham's address to 
 God on this occasion: <I>Abraham drew near,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 The expression intimates, 
 
 1. A holy 
 concern: <I>He engaged his heart</I> to approach 
 to God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.
 "Shall Sodom be 
 destroyed, and I not speak one good word for 
 it?" 
 
 2. A holy confidence: He drew near 
 <I>with an assurance of faith,</I> drew near <I>as a 
 prince,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:37">Job xxxi. 37</A>.
 Note, When we address 
 ourselves to the duty of prayer, we ought to 
 remember that we are drawing near to God, 
 that we may be filled with a reverence of him, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The general scope of this prayer. It 
 is the first solemn prayer we have upon record 
 in the Bible; and it is a prayer for the 
 sparing of Sodom. Abraham, no doubt, greatly 
 abhorred the wickedness of the Sodomites; 
 he would not have lived among them, as Lot 
 did, if they would have given him the best 
 estate in their country; and yet he prayed 
 earnestly for them. Note, Though sin is to 
 be hated, sinners are to be pitied and prayed 
 for. God delights not in their death, nor 
 should we desire, but deprecate, the woeful 
 day. 
 
 1. He begins with a prayer that the 
 righteous among them might be spared, and 
 not involved in the common calamity, having 
 an eye particularly to just Lot, whose disingenuous 
 carriage towards him he had long 
 since forgiven and forgotten, witness his 
 friendly zeal to rescue him before by his 
 sword and now by his prayers. 
 
 2. He improves 
 this into a petition that all might be 
 spared for the sake of the righteous that were 
 among them, God himself countenancing 
 this request, and in effect putting him upon 
 it by his answer to his first address,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 Note, We must pray, not only for ourselves, 
 but for others also; for we are members of 
 the same body, at least of the same body of 
 mankind. <I>All we are brethren.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular graces eminent in this 
 prayer.</P>

 <A NAME="Page120"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is great faith; and it is the prayer 
 of faith that is the prevailing prayer. His 
 faith pleads with God, orders the cause, and 
 fills his mouth with arguments. He acts 
 faith especially upon the righteousness of 
 God, and is very confident.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That God will not <I>destroy the righteous 
 with the wicked,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 No, <I>that be far from 
 thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 We must never entertain any 
 thought that derogates from the honour of 
 God's righteousness. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] The righteous are mingled with 
 the wicked in this world. Among the best 
 there are, commonly, some bad, and among 
 the worst some good: even in Sodom, one 
 Lot. 
 
 [2.] Though the righteous be among 
 the wicked, yet the righteous God will not, 
 certainly he will not, destroy the righteous with 
 the wicked. Though in this world they may 
 be involved in the same common calamities, 
 yet in the great day a distinction will be made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the righteous shall not <I>be as the 
 wicked,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Though they may suffer with 
 them, yet they do not suffer like them. 
 Common calamities are quite another thing 
 to the righteous than what they are to the 
 wicked, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:7">Isa. xxvii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That <I>the Judge of all the earth will do 
 right;</I> undoubtedly he will, because he is 
 the Judge of all the earth; it is the apostle's 
 argument, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] God is 
 the Judge of all the earth; he gives charge 
 to all, takes cognizance of all, and will pass 
 sentence upon all. 
 
 [2.] That God Almighty 
 never did nor ever will do any wrong to any 
 of the creatures, either by withholding that 
 which is right or by exacting more than is 
 right, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:10,11">Job xxxiv. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is great humility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A deep sense of his own unworthiness
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 <I>Behold now, I have taken upon me to 
 speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and 
 ashes;</I> and again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 He speaks as one 
 amazed at his own boldness, and the liberty 
 God graciously allowed him, considering 
 God's greatness--he is <I>the Lord;</I> and his 
 own meanness--<I>but dust and ashes.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] The greatest of men, the most considerable 
 and deserving, are but dust and 
 ashes, mean and vile before God, despicable, 
 frail, and dying. 
 
 [2.] Whenever we draw 
 near to God, it becomes us reverently to 
 acknowledge the vast distance that there is 
 between us and God. He is the Lord of 
 glory, we are worms of the earth. 
 
 [3.] The 
 access we have to the throne of grace, and 
 the freedom of speech allowed us, are just 
 matter of humble wonder,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:18">2 Sam. vii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) An awful dread of God's displeasure: 
 <I>O let not the Lord be angry</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 and again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] The importunity which 
 believers use in their addresses to God is 
 such that, if they were dealing with a man 
 like themselves, they could not but fear that 
 he would be angry with them. But he with 
 whom we have to do is <I>God and not man;</I> 
 and, whoever he may seem, is not really 
 <I>angry with the prayers of the upright</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4">Ps. lxxx. 4</A>),
 for they are <I>his delight</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>),
 and he is pleased when he is wrestled 
 with. 
 
 [2.] That even when we receive special 
 tokens of the divine favour we ought to 
 be jealous over ourselves, lest we make ourselves 
 obnoxious to the divine displeasure; 
 and therefore we must bring the Mediator 
 with us in the arms of our faith, to atone 
 for <I>the iniquity of our holy things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is great charity. 
 
 (1.) A charitable 
 opinion of Sodom's character: as bad as it 
 was, he thought there were several good 
 people in it. It becomes us to hope the best 
 of the worst places. Of the two it is better 
 to err in that extreme. 
 
 (2.) A charitable 
 desire of Sodom's welfare: he used all his 
 interest at the throne of grace for mercy for 
 them. We never find him thus earnest in 
 pleading with God for himself and his family, 
 as here for Sodom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here are great boldness and believing 
 confidence. 
 
 (1.) He took the liberty to pitch 
 upon a certain number of righteous ones 
 which he supposed might be in Sodom. 
 Suppose there be fifty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 (2.) He advanced 
 upon God's concessions, again and 
 again. As God granted much, he still 
 begged more, with the hope of gaining his 
 point. 
 
 (3.) He brought the terms as low as 
 he could for shame (having prevailed for 
 mercy if there were but ten righteous ones 
 in five cities), and perhaps so low that he 
 concluded they would have been spared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The success of the prayer. He that 
 thus wrestled prevailed wonderfully; as a 
 prince he had power with God: it was but 
 ask and have. 
 
 1. God's general good-will 
 appears in this, that he consented to spare 
 the wicked for the sake of the righteous. 
 See how swift God is to show mercy; he 
 even seeks a reason for it. See what great 
 blessings good people are to any place, and 
 how little those befriend themselves that 
 hate and persecute them. 
 
 2. His particular 
 favour to Abraham appeared in this, that he 
 did not leave off granting till Abraham left 
 off asking. Such is the power of prayer. 
 Why then did Abraham leave off asking, 
 when he had prevailed so far as to get the 
 place spared if there were but ten righteous
 in it? Either, 
 
 (1.) Because he owned that 
 it deserved to be destroyed if there were not 
 so many; <I>as the dresser of the vineyard,</I> who 
 consented that the barren tree should be cut 
 down if one year's trial more did not make 
 it fruitful, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:9">Luke xiii. 9</A>.
 Or, 
 
 (2.) Because 
 God restrained his spirit from asking any 
 further. When God has determined the 
 ruin of a place, he forbids it to be prayed 
 for, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:16,11:14,14:11">Jer. vii. 16; xi. 14; xiv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is the breaking up of the conference,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 1. <I>The Lord went his way.</I> 
 The visions of God must not be constant in 
 this world, where it is by faith only that we 
 are to set God before us. God did not go 
 away till Abraham had said all he had to 
 
 <A NAME="Page121"> </A>

 say; for he is never weary of hearing prayer, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:1,2">Isa. lix. 1. 2</A>.
 <I>Abraham returned unto his 
 place,</I> not puffed up with the honour done 
 him, nor by these extraordinary interviews 
 taken off from the ordinary course of duty. 
 He returned to his place to observe what 
 that event would be; and it proved that his 
 prayer was heard, and yet Sodom was not 
 spared, because there were not ten righteous 
 in it. We cannot expect too little from man 
 nor too much from God.</P>
