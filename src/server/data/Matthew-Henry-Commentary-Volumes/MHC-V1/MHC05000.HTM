 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT>
 book is a repetition of very much both of the history and of the laws
 contained in the three foregoing books, which repetition Moses
 delivered to Israel (both by word of mouth, that it might affect, and
 by writing, that it might abide) a little before his death. There is no
 new history in it but that of the death of Moses in the last chapter,
 nor any new revelation to Moses, for aught that appears, and therefore
 the style here is not, as before, <I>The Lord spoke unto Moses,
 saying.</I> But the former laws are repeated and commented upon,
 explained and enlarged, and some particular precepts added to them,
 with copious reasonings for the enforcing of them: in this Moses was
 divinely inspired and assisted, so that this is as truly the word of
 the Lord by Moses as that which was spoken to him with an audible voice
 <I>out of the tabernacle of the congregation</I>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:1">Lev. i. 1</A>.

 The Greek interpreters call it <I>Deuteronomy,</I> which signifies the
 <I>second law,</I> or a <I>second edition of the law,</I> not with 
 amendments, for there needed none, but with additions, for the further 
 direction of the people in divers cases not mentioned before. Now, 

 I.  It was much for the honour of the divine law that it should be thus 
 repeated; how great were the things of that law which was thus 
 inculcated, and how inexcusable would those be by whom they were 
 <I>counted as a strange thing!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:12">Hos. viii. 12</A>.

 II. There might be a particular reason for the repeating of it now; the
 men of that generation to which the law was first given were all dead, 
 and a new generation had sprung up, to whom God would have it repeated 
 by Moses himself, that, if possible, it might make a lasting impression 
 upon them. Now that they were just going to take possession of the land 
 of Canaan, Moses must read the articles of agreement to them, that they 
 might know upon what terms and conditions they were to hold and enjoy 
 that land, and might understand that they were upon their good 
 behaviour in it. 

 III. It would be of great use to the people to have those parts of the
 law thus gathered up and put together which did more immediately 
 concern them and their practice; for the laws which concerned the 
 priests and Levites, and the execution of their offices, are not 
 repeated: it was enough for them that they were once delivered.  But, 
 in compassion to the infirmities of the people, the laws of more common 
 concern are delivered a second time. <I>Precept must be upon precept, 
 and line upon line,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:10">Isa. xxviii. 10</A>.

 The great and needful truths of the gospel should be often pressed upon
 people by the ministers of Christ. <I>To write the same things</I> 
 (says Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>)

 <I>to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</I> What God 
 has spoken once we have need to hear twice, to hear many times, and it 
 is well if, after all, it be duly perceived and regarded.  In three 
 ways this book of Deuteronomy was magnified and made honourable:--

 1. The king was to write a copy of it with his own hand, and to read
 therein all the days of his life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:1-19:21"><I>ch.</I> xvii. xviii. xix.</A>

 2. It was to be written upon great stones plastered, at their passing 
 over Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2, 3</A>.

 3. It was to be read publicly every seventh year, at the feast of 
 tabernacles, by the priests, in the audience of all Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:9-13"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 9</A>,

 &c. The gospel is a kind of Deuteronomy, a second law, a remedial law,
 a spiritual law, a law of faith; by it we are under the law of Christ, 
 and it is a law that <I>makes the comers thereunto perfect.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This book of Deuteronomy begins with a brief rehearsal of the most 
 remarkable events that had befallen the Israelites since they came from 
 Mount Sinai. In the fourth chapter we have a most pathetic exhortation 
 to obedience. In the twelfth chapter, and so on to the twenty-seventh, 
 are repeated many particular laws, which are enforced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:1-28:68"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. and xxviii.</A>)

 with promises and threatenings, blessings and curses, formed into a 
 covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:1-30:20"><I>ch.</I> xxix. and xxx.</A>

 Care is taken to perpetuate the remembrance of these things among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:1-29"><I>ch.</I> xxxi.</A>),
 
 particularly by a song 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1-52"><I>ch.</I> xxxii.</A>),

 and so Moses concludes with a blessing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:1-29"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii</A>.

 All this was delivered by Moses to Israel in the last month of his
 life. The whole book contains the history but of two months; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:3,Jos+4:19"><I>ch.</I> i. 3 with Josh. iv. 19</A>,

 the latter of which was the thirty days of Israel's mourning for Moses;
 see how busy that great and good man was to do good when he knew that 
 his time was short, how quick his motion when he drew near his rest. 
 Thus we have more recorded of what our blessed Saviour said and did in 
 the last week of his life than in any other. The last words of eminent 
 persons make or should make deep impressions. Observe, for the honour 
 of this book, that when our Saviour would answer the devil's 
 temptations with, <I>It is written,</I> he fetched all his quotations 
 out of this book,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4,7,10">Matt. iv. 4, 7, 10</A>.</P>
