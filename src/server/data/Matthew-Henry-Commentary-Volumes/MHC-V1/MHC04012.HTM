 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing chapter we had the vexation which the people gave to 
 Moses; in this we have his patience tried by his own relations. 

 I.  Miriam and Aaron, his own brother and sister, affronted him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.
 
 II. God called them to an account for it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>. 

 III. Miriam was smitten with a leprosy for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:10">ver. 10</A>. 

 IV. Aaron submits, and Moses meekly intercedes for Miriam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>. 

 V. She is healed, but put to shame for seven days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:14-16">ver.  14-16</A>. 

 And this is recorded to show that the best persons and families have
 both their follies and their crosses.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
 Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
 Ethiopian woman.
 &nbsp; 2 And they said, Hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> indeed spoken only by Moses?
 hath he not spoken also by us? And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 3 (Now the man Moses <I>was</I> very meek, above all the men which
 <I>were</I> upon the face of the earth.)
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The unbecoming passion of Aaron and Miriam: they <I>spoke against 
 Moses,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 If Moses, that received so much honour from God, yet received so many 
 slights and affronts from men, shall any of us think such trials either 
 strange or hard, and be either provoked or discouraged by them? But who 
 would have thought that disturbance should be created to Moses,

 1. From those that were themselves serious and good; nay, that were 
 eminent in religion, Miriam a prophetess, Aaron the high priest, both 
 of them joint-commissioners with Moses for the deliverance of Israel? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4">Mic. vi. 4</A>,

 <I>I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</I>

 2. From those that were his nearest relations, his own brother and 
 sister, who shone so much by rays borrowed from him?  Thus the spouse 
 complains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6">Cant. i. 6</A>),

 <I>My mother's children were angry with me;</I> and quarrels among
 relations are in a special manner grievous.  <I>A brother offended is 
 harder to be won than a strong city.</I> Yet this helps to confirm the 
 call of Moses, and shows that his advancement was purely by the divine 
 favour, and not by any compact or collusion with his kindred, who 
 themselves grudged his advancement.  Neither did many of our Saviour's 
 kindred believe on him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5">John vii. 5</A>.

 It should seem that Miriam began the quarrel, and Aaron, not having
 been employed or consulted in the choice of the seventy elders, was for 
 the present somewhat disgusted, and so was the sooner drawn in to take 
 his sister's part. It would grieve one to see the hand of Aaron in so 
 many trespasses, but it shows that <I>the law made men priests who had 
 infirmity.</I> Satan prevailed first with Eve, and by her with Adam; 
 see what need we have to take heed of being drawn into quarrels by our 
 relations, for we know not how great a matter a little fire may kindle.  
 Aaron ought to have remembered how Moses stood his friend when God was 
 angry with him for making the golden calf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:20">Deut. ix. 20</A>),

 and not to have rendered him evil for good. Two things they quarrelled
 with Moses about:--

 (1.) About his marriage: some think a late marriage with a Cushite or
 Arabian; others because of Zipporah, whom on this occasion they called, 
 in scorn, an Ethiopian woman, and who, they insinuated, had too great 
 an influence upon Moses in the choice of these seventy elders. Perhaps 
 there was some private falling out between Zipporah and Miriam, which 
 occasioned some hot words, and one peevish reflection introduced 
 another, till Moses and Aaron came to be interested.

 (2.) About his government; not the mismanagement of it, but the
 monopolizing of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Hath the Lord spoken only by Moses?</I> Must <I>he</I> alone have 
 the choice of the persons on whom the spirit of prophecy shall come? 
 <I>Hath he not spoken also by us?</I> Might not we have had a hand in 
 that affair, and preferred our friends, as well as Moses his?" They 
 could not deny that God had spoken by Moses, but it was plain he had 
 sometimes spoken also by them; and that which they intended was to make 
 themselves equal with him, though God had so many ways distinguished 
 him. Note, Striving to be greatest is a sin which easily besets 
 disciples themselves, and it is exceedingly sinful. Even those that are 
 well preferred are seldom pleased if others be better preferred. Those 
 that excel are commonly envied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The wonderful patience of Moses under this provocation. <I>The Lord 
 heard it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but Moses himself took no notice of it, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 he was very meek. He had a great deal of reason to resent the affront; 
 it was ill-natured and ill-timed, when the people were disposed to 
 mutiny, and had lately given him a great deal of vexation with their 
 murmurings, which would be in danger of breaking out again when thus 
 headed and countenanced by Aaron and Miriam; but he, <I>as a deaf man, 
 heard not.</I> When God's honour was concerned, as in the case of the 
 golden calf, no man more zealous than Moses; but, when his own honour 
 was touched, no man more meek: as bold as a lion in the cause of God, 
 but as mild as a lamb in his own cause. God's people are the <I>meek of 
 the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:3">Zeph. ii. 3</A>),

 but some are more remarkable than others for this grace, as Moses, who
 was thus fitted for the work he was called to, which required all the 
 meekness he had and sometimes more.  And sometimes the unkindness of 
 our friends is a greater trial of our meekness than the malice of our 
 enemies. Christ himself records his own meekness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>,

 <I>I am meek and lowly in heart</I>), and the copy of meekness which
 Christ has set was without a blot, but that of Moses was not.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
 unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
 congregation. And they three came out.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
 <I>in</I> the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and
 they both came forth.
 &nbsp; 6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
 you, <I>I</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will make myself known unto him in a vision,
 <I>and</I> will speak unto him in a dream.
 &nbsp; 7 My servant Moses <I>is</I> not so, who <I>is</I> faithful in all mine
 house.
 &nbsp; 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and
 not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall he
 behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
 servant Moses?
 &nbsp; 9 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against them; and he
 departed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses did not resent the injury done him, nor complain of it to God, 
 nor make any appeal to him; but God resented it. He hears all we say in 
 our passion, and is a swift witness of our hasty speeches, which is a 
 reason why we should resolutely bridle our tongues, that we speak not 
 ill of others, and why we should patiently stop our ears, and not take 
 notice of it, if others speak ill of us. <I>I heard not, for thou wilt 
 hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13-15">Ps. xxxviii. 13-15</A>.

 The more silent we are in our own cause the more is God engaged to
 plead it. The accused innocent needs to say little if he knows the 
 judge himself will be his advocate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cause is called, and the parties are summoned forthwith to 
 attend at the door of the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Moses had often shown himself jealous for God's honour, and now God 
 showed himself jealous for his reputation; for <I>those that honour God 
 he will honour,</I> nor will he ever be behind-hand with any that 
 appear for him. Judges of old sat in the gate of the city to try 
 causes, and so on this occasion the <I>shechinah</I> in the cloud of 
 glory stood <I>at the door of the tabernacle,</I> and Aaron and Miriam, 
 as delinquents, were called to the bar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Aaron and Miriam were made to know that great as they were they 
 must not pretend to be equal to Moses, nor set up as rivals with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Were they prophets of the Lord? Of Moses it might be truly said, <I>He 
 more.</I>

 1. It was true that God put a great deal of honour upon the prophets. 
 However men mocked them and misused them, they were the favourites and 
 intimates of heaven. God <I>made himself known to them,</I> either by 
 dreams when they were asleep or by visions when they were awake, and by 
 them made himself known to others. And those are happy, those are 
 great, truly great, truly happy, to whom God <I>makes himself 
 known,</I> Now he does it not by dreams and visions, as of old, but by 
 the <I>Spirit of wisdom and revelation,</I> who makes known those 
 things to babes which <I>prophets and kings</I> desired to see and 
 might not. Hence in the last days, the days of the Messiah, the <I>sons 
 and daughters</I> are said to <I>prophesy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joel ii. 28</A>),

 because they shall be better acquainted with the mysteries of the
 kingdom of grace than even the prophets themselves were; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1,2">Heb. i. 1, 2</A>.

 2. Yet the honour put upon Moses was far greater 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>My servant Moses is not so,</I> he excels them all. To recompense 
 Moses for his meekly and patiently bearing the affronts which Miriam 
 and Aaron gave him, God not only cleared him, but praised him; and took 
 that occasion to give him an encomium which remains upon record to his 
 immortal honour; and thus shall those that are reviled and persecuted 
 for righteousness' sake have a <I>great reward in heaven,</I> Christ 
 will confess them before his Father and the holy angels.

 (1.) Moses was a man of great integrity and tried fidelity. He is
 <I>faithful in all my house.</I> This is put first in his character, 
 because grace excels gifts, love excels knowledge, and sincerity in the 
 service of God puts a greater honour upon a man and recommends him to 
 the divine favour more than learning, abstruse speculations, and an 
 ability to <I>speak with tongues.</I> This is that part of Moses's 
 character which the apostle quotes when he would show that Christ was 
 greater than Moses, making it out that he was so in this chief instance 
 of his greatness; for Moses was faithful only <I>as a servant,</I> but 
 Christ <I>as a son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:2,5,6">Heb. iii. 2, 5, 6</A>.

 God entrusted Moses to deliver his mind in all things to Israel; Israel
 entrusted him to treat for them with God; and he was faithful to both. 
 He said and did every thing in the management of that great affair as 
 became an honest good man, that aimed at nothing else but the honour of 
 God and the welfare of Israel.

 (2.) Moses was therefore honoured with clearer discoveries of God's
 mind, and a more intimate communion with God, than any other prophet 
 whatsoever. He shall, 

 [1.] Hear more from God than any other prophet, more clearly and
 distinctly: <I>With him will I speak mouth to mouth,</I> or <I>face to 
 face</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:11">Exod. xxx. 11</A>),

 <I>as a man speaks to his friend,</I> whom he discourses with freely
 and familiarly, and without any confusion or consternation, such as 
 sometimes other prophets were under; as Ezekiel, and John himself, when 
 God spoke to them. By other prophets God sent to his people reproofs, 
 and predictions of good or evil, which were properly enough delivered 
 in dark speeches, figures, types, and parables; but by Moses he gave 
 laws to his people, and the institution of holy ordinances, which could 
 by no means be delivered by dark speeches, but must be expressed in the 
 plainest and most intelligible manner.

 [2.] He shall see more of God than any other prophet: <I>The similitude
 of the Lord shall behold,</I> as he hath seen it in Horeb, when God 
 proclaimed his name before him.  Yet he saw only the similitude of the 
 Lord, angels and glorified saints always behold the face of our Father.
 Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way peculiar to himself, and
 which set him far above all other prophets; yet <I>he that is least in
 the kingdom of heaven is greater than he,</I> much more does our Lord
 Jesus infinitely excel him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:1-6">Heb. iii. 1</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now let Miriam and Aaron consider who it was that they insulted: 
 <I>Were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? Against my 
 servant, against Moses?</I> so it runs in the original. "How dare you 
 abuse any servant of mine, especially such a servant as Moses, who is a 
 friend, a confidant, and steward of the house?" How durst they speak to 
 the grief and reproach of one whom God had so much to say in 
 commendation of? Might they not expect that God would resent it, and 
 take it as an affront to himself? Note, We have reason to be afraid of 
 saying or doing any thing against the servants of God; it is at our 
 peril if we do, for God will plead their cause, and reckon that what 
 <I>touches them touches the apple of his eye.</I> It is a dangerous 
 thing to <I>offend Christ's little ones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6">Matt. xviii. 6</A>.

 Those are presumptuous indeed that <I>are not afraid to speak evil of
 dignities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:10">2 Pet. ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God, having thus shown them their fault and folly, next shows them 
 his displeasure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The anger of the Lord was kindled against them,</I> of which perhaps 
 some sensible indications were given in the change of the colour of the 
 cloud, or some flashes of lightning from it. But indeed it was 
 indication enough of his displeasure that he departed, and would not so 
 much as hear their excuse, for he needed not, <I>understanding their 
 thoughts afar off;</I> and thus he would show that he was displeased. 
 Note, The removal of God's presence from us is the surest and saddest 
 token of God's displeasure against us. Woe unto us if he depart; and he 
 never departs till we by our sin and folly drive him from us.</P>

 Miriam <I>became</I> leprous, <I>white</I> as snow: and Aaron looked upon
 Miriam, and, behold, <I>she was</I> leprous.
 &nbsp; 11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee,
 lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
 wherein we have sinned.
 &nbsp; 12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half
 consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

 I beseech thee.
 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in

 out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received
 in <I>again.</I>

 people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in <I>again.</I>
 &nbsp; 16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched
 in the wilderness of Paran.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. God's judgment upon Miriam 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The cloud departed from off</I> that part of <I>the tabernacle,</I> 
 in token of God's displeasure, and presently Miriam became leprous; 
 when God goes, evil comes; expect no good when God departs. The leprosy 
 was a disease often inflicted by the immediate hand of God as the 
 punishment of some particular sin, as on Gehazi for lying, on Uzziah 
 for invading the priest's office, and here on Miriam for scolding and 
 making mischief among relations. The plague of the leprosy, it is 
 likely, appeared in her face, so that it appeared to all that saw her 
 that she was struck with it, with the worst of it, she was leprous as 
 snow; not only so white, but so soft, the solid flesh losing its 
 consistency, as that which putrefies does. Her foul tongue (says bishop 
 Hall) is justly punished with a foul face, and her folly in pretending 
 to be a rival with Moses is made manifest to all men, for every one 
 sees his face to be glorious, and hers to be leprous. While Moses needs 
 a veil to hide his glory, Miriam needs one to hide her shame. Note, 
 Those distempers which any way deform us ought to be construed as a 
 rebuke to our pride, and improved for the cure of it, and under such 
 humbling providences we ought to be very humble.  It is a sign that the 
 heart is hard indeed if the flesh be mortified, and yet the lusts of 
 the flesh remain unmortified. It should seem that this plague upon 
 Miriam was designed for an exposition of the law concerning the leprosy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:1-59">Lev. xiii.</A>),

 for it is referred to upon the rehearsal of that law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:8,9">Deut. xxiv. 8, 9</A>.

 Miriam was struck with a leprosy, but not Aaron, because she was first
 in the transgression, and God would put a difference between those that 
 mislead and those that are misled. Aaron's office, though it saved him 
 not from God's displeasure, yet helped to secure him from this token of 
 his displeasure, which would not only have suspended him for the 
 present from officiating, when (there being no priests but himself and 
 his two sons) he could ill be spared, but it would have rendered him 
 and his office mean, and would have been a lasting blot upon his 
 family. Aaron as priest was to be the judge of the leprosy, and his 
 performing that part of his office upon this occasion, when he 
 <I>looked upon Miriam, and behold she was leprous,</I> was a sufficient 
 mortification to him. He was struck through her side, and could not 
 pronounce her leprous without blushing and trembling, knowing himself 
 to be equally obnoxious. This judgment upon Miriam is improvable by us 
 as a warning to take heed of putting any affront upon our Lord Jesus.  
 If she was thus chastised for speaking against Moses, what will become 
 of those that sin against Christ?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Aaron's submission hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>);

 he humbles himself to Moses, confesses his fault, and begs pardon. He 
 that but just now joined with his sister in speaking against Moses is 
 here forced for himself and his sister to make a penitent address to 
 him, and in the highest degree to magnify him (as if he had the power 
 of God to forgive and heal) whom he had so lately vilified. Note, Those 
 that trample upon the saints and servants of God will one day be glad 
 to make court to them; at furthest, in the other world, as the foolish 
 virgins to the wise for a little oil, and the rich man to Lazarus for a 
 little water; and perhaps in this world, as Job's friend to him for his 
 prayers, and here Aaron to Moses. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 In his submission,

 1. He confesses his own and his sister's sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He speaks respectfully to Moses, of whom he had spoken slightly, calls 
 him his lord, and now turns the reproach upon himself, speaks as one 
 ashamed of what he had said: <I>We have sinned, we have done 
 foolishly.</I> Those sin, and do foolishly, who revile and speak evil 
 of any, especially of good people or of those in authority. Repentance 
 is the unsaying of that which we have said amiss, and it had better be 
 unsaid than that we be undone by it.

 2. He begs Moses's pardon: <I>Lay not this sin upon us.</I> Aaron was 
 to bring his gift to the altar, but, knowing that his brother had 
 something against him, he of all men was concerned to reconcile himself 
 to his brother, that he might be qualified to offer his gift. Some 
 think that this speedy submission which God saw him ready to make was 
 that which prevented his being struck with a leprosy as his sister was.  
 
 3. He recommends the deplorable condition of his sister to Moses's
 compassionate consideration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Let her not be as one dead,</I> that is, "Let her not continue so 
 separated from conversation, defiling all she touches, and even to 
 putrefy above ground as one dead." He eloquently describes the misery 
 of her case, to move his pity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The intercession made for Miriam 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 He <I>cried unto the Lord</I> with a loud voice, because the cloud, the 
 symbol of his presence, was removed and stood at some distance, and to 
 express his fervency in this request, <I>Heal her now, O Lord, I 
 beseech thee.</I> By this he made it to appear that he did heartily 
 forgive her the injury she had one him, that he had not accused her to 
 God, nor called for justice against her; so far from this that, when 
 God in tenderness to his honour had chastised her insolence, he was the 
 first that moved for reversing the judgment. By this example we are 
 taught to <I>pray for those that despitefully use us;</I> and not to 
 take pleasure in the most righteous punishment inflicted either by God 
 or man on those that have been injurious to us. Jeroboam's withered 
 hand was restored at the special instance and request of the prophet 
 against whom it had been stretched out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:6">1 Kings xiii. 6</A>.

 So Miriam here was healed by the prayer of Moses, whom she had abused,
 and Abimelech by the prayer of Abraham,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:17">Gen. xx. 17</A>.

 Moses might have stood off, and have said, "She is served well enough,
 let her govern her tongue better next time;" but, not content with 
 being able to say that he had not prayed for the inflicting of the 
 judgment, he prays earnestly for the removal of it.  This pattern of 
 Moses, and that of our Saviour, <I>Father, forgive them,</I> we must 
 study to conform to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The accommodating of this matter so as that mercy and justice might 
 meet together. 

 1. Mercy takes place so far as that Miriam shall be healed; Moses 
 forgives her, and God will. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:10">2 Cor. ii. 10</A>.

 But,

 2.  Justice takes place so far as that Miriam shall be humbled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Let her be shut out from the camp seven days,</I> that she herself 
 might be made more sensible of her fault and penitent for it, and that 
 her punishment might be the more public, and all Israel might take 
 notice of it and take warning by it not to mutiny. If Miriam the 
 prophetess be put under such marks of humiliation for one hasty word 
 spoken against Moses, what may we expect for our murmurings? <I>If this 
 be done in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</I> See how 
 people debase and diminish themselves by sin, stain their glory, and 
 lay their honour in the dust.  When Miriam praised God, we find her at 
 the head of the congregation and one of the brightest ornaments of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20">Exod. xv. 20</A>.

 Now that she quarrelled with God we find her expelled as the filth and
 off-scouring of it. A reason is given for her being put out of the camp 
 for seven days, because thus she ought to <I>accept of the punishment 
 of her iniquity.</I> If her father, her earthly father, had but spit in 
 her face, and so signified his displeasure against her, would she not 
 be so troubled and concerned at it, and so sorry that she had deserved 
 it, as to shut herself up for some time in her room, and not come into 
 his presence, or show her face in the family, being ashamed of her own 
 folly and unhappiness? If such reverence as this be owing to the 
 fathers of our flesh, when they correct us, much more ought we to 
 humble ourselves under the mighty hand of the Father of spirits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.

 Note, When we are under the tokens of God's displeasure for sin, it
 becomes us to take shame to ourselves, and to lie down in that shame, 
 owning that <I>to us belongs confusion of face.</I> If by our own fault 
 and folly we expose ourselves to the reproach and contempt of men, the 
 just censures of the church, or the rebukes of the divine Providence, 
 we must confess that our Father justly spits in our face, and be 
 ashamed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The hindrance that this gave to the people's progress: <I>The people 
 journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 God did not remove the cloud, and therefore they did not remove their
 camp. This was intended,

 1. As a rebuke to the people, who were conscious to themselves of 
 having sinned after the similitude of Miriam's transgression, in 
 speaking against Moses: thus far therefore they shall share in her 
 punishment, that it shall retard their march forward towards Canaan. 
 Many things oppose us, but nothing hinders us in the way to heaven as 
 sin does. 

 2. As a mark of respect to Miriam. If the camp had removed during the 
 days of her suspension, her trouble and shame had been the greater; 
 therefore, in compassion to her, they shall stay till her 
 excommunication be taken off, and she taken in again, it is probable 
 with the usual ceremonies of the cleansing of lepers. Note, Those that 
 are under censure and rebuke for sin ought to be treated with a great 
 deal of tenderness, and not be over-loaded, no, not with the shame they 
 have deserved, not <I>counted as enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:15">2 Thess. iii. 15</A>),

 but <I>forgiven and comforted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:7">2 Cor. ii. 7</A>.

 Sinners must be cast out with grief, and penitents taken in with joy.
 When Miriam was absolved and re-admitted, the people went forward into 
 the wilderness of Paran, which joined up to the south border of Canaan, 
 and thither their next remove would have been if they had not put a bar 
 in their own way.</P>
