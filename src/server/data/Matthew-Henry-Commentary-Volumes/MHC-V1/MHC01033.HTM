 We read, in the former chapter, how Jacob had power with God, 
 and prevailed; here we find what power he had with men too, 
 and how his brother Esau was mollified, and, on a sudden, reconciled 
 to him; for so it is written, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>,
 "When a 
 man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be 
 at peace with him." Here is, 
 
 I. A very friendly meeting between 
 Jacob and Esau,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.
 
 II. Their conference at their meeting, 
 in which they vie with each other in civil and kind expressions. 
 Their discourse is,

 1. About Jacob's family,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.
 
 2. About the present he had sent,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.
 
 3. About the progress 
 of their journey,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.
 
 III. Jacob's settlement in 
 Canaan, his house, ground, and altar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
 looked, and, behold, Esau came,
 and with him four hundred men. And
 he divided the children unto Leah,
 and unto Rachel, and unto the two
 handmaids.
 &nbsp; 2 And he put the handmaids 
 and their children foremost, and
 Leah and her children after, and Rachel 
 and Joseph hindermost.
 &nbsp; 3 And 
 he passed over before them, and bowed 
 himself to the ground seven times, 
 until he came near to his brother.
 &nbsp; 4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced 
 him, and fell on his neck, and 
 kissed him: and they wept.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Jacob discovered Esau's approach,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Some think that his lifting up his eyes 
 denotes his cheerfulness and confidence, in 
 opposition to a dejected countenance; having 
 by prayer committed his case to God, he went 
 on his way, <I>and his countenance was no more 
 sad,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:18">1 Sam. i. 18</A>.
 Note, Those that have 
 cast their care upon God may look before 
 them with satisfaction and composure of 
 mind, cheerfully expecting the issue, whatever 
 it may be; come what will, nothing can 
 come amiss to him whose heart is fixed, 
 trusting in God. Jacob sets himself upon 
 his watch-tower to see what answer God will 
 give to his prayers, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He put his family into the best order 
 he could to receive him, whether he should 
 come as a friend or as an enemy, consulting 
 their decency if he came as a friend and 
 their safety if he came as an enemy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 Observe what a different figure these two 
 brothers made. Esau is attended with a 
 guard of 400 men, and looks big; Jacob is 
 followed by a cumbersome train of women 
 and children that are his care, and he looks 
 tender and solicitous for their safety; and yet 
 Jacob had the birthright, and was to have the 
 dominion, and was every way the better man. 
 Note, It is no disparagement to very great 
 and good men to give a personal attendance 
 to their families, and to their family affairs. 
 Jacob, at the head of his household, set a 
 better example than Esau at the head of his 
 regiment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. At their meeting, the expressions of 
 kindness were interchanged in the best manner 
 that could be between them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jacob bowed to Esau,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Though he 
 feared Esau as an enemy, yet he did obeisance 
 to him as an elder brother, knowing 
 and remembering perhaps that when Abel 
 was preferred in God's acceptance before his 
 elder brother Cain, yet God undertook for 
 him to Cain that he should not be wanting 
 in the duty and respect owing by a younger 
 brother. <I>Unto thee shall be his desire, and 
 thou shalt rule over him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>.
 Note, 
 
 (1.) The way to recover peace where it has been 
 broken is to do our duty, and pay our respects, 
 upon all occasions, as if it had never 
 been broken. It is the remembering and 
 repeating of matters that separates friends 
 and perpetuates the separation. 
 
 (2.) A 
 humble submissive carriage goes a great way 
 towards the turning away of wrath. Many preserve 
 themselves by humbling themselves: 
 the bullet flies over him that stoops.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Esau embraced Jacob
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 <I>He ran 
 to meet him,</I> not in passion, but in love; and, 
 as one heartily reconciled to him, he received 
 him with all the endearments imaginable, <I>embraced 
 him, fell on his neck, and kissed him.</I> 
 Some think that when Esau came out to 
 meet Jacob it was with no bad design, but 
 that he brought his 400 men only for state, 
 that he might pay so much the greater respect 
 to his returning brother. It is certain 
 
 <A NAME="Page198"> </A>

 that Jacob understood the report of his messengers 
 otherwise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:5,6"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 5, 6</A>.
 Jacob was 
 a man of prudence and fortitude, and we 
 cannot suppose him to admit of a groundless 
 fear to such a degree as he did this, nor that 
 the Spirit of God would stir him up to pray 
 such a prayer as he did for deliverance from 
 a merely imaginary danger: and, if there was 
 not some wonderful change wrought upon 
 the spirit of Esau at this time, I see not how 
 wrestling Jacob could be said to obtain such 
 power with men as to denominate him a 
 <I>prince.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) God had the hearts of all 
 men in his hands, and can turn them when 
 and how he pleases, by a secret, silent, but 
 resistless power. He can, of a sudden, convert 
 enemies into friends, as he did two Sauls, 
 one by restraining grace
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:21,25">1 Sam. xxvi. 21, 25</A>),
 the other by renewing grace, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:21,22">Acts ix. 21, 22</A>.

 (2.) It is not in vain to trust in God, 
 and to call upon him in the day of trouble; 
 those that do so often find the issue much 
 better than they expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They both wept. Jacob wept for joy, 
 to be thus kindly received by his brother 
 whom he had feared; and Esau perhaps wept 
 for grief and shame, to think of the bad design 
 he had conceived against his brother, 
 which he found himself strangely and unaccountably 
 prevented from executing.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And he lifted up his eyes, and 
 saw the women and the children; and 
 said, Who <I>are</I> those with thee? And 
 he said, The children which God hath 
 graciously given thy servant.
 &nbsp; 6 Then 
 the handmaidens came near, they and 
 their children, and they bowed themselves.
 &nbsp; 7 And Leah also with her 
 children came near, and bowed themselves: 
 and after came Joseph near 
 and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, What <I>meanest</I> 
 thou by all this drove which I met? 
 And he said, <I>These are</I> to find grace 
 in the sight of my lord.
 &nbsp; 9 And Esau 
 said, I have enough, my brother; keep 
 that thou hast unto thyself.
 &nbsp; 10 And 
 Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now 
 I have found grace in thy sight, then 
 receive my present at my hand: for 
 therefore I have seen thy face, as 
 though I had seen the face of God, 
 and thou wast pleased with me.
 &nbsp; 11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is 
 brought to thee; because God hath 
 dealt graciously with me, and because 
 I have enough. And he urged him, 
 and he took <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And he said, Let 
 us take our journey, and let us go, 
 and I will go before thee.
 &nbsp; 13 And he 
 said unto him, My lord knoweth that 
 the children <I>are</I> tender, and the flocks 
 and herds with young <I>are</I> with me:
 and if men should overdrive them one 
 day, all the flock will die.
 &nbsp; 14 Let my 
 lord, I pray thee, pass over before his 
 servant: and I will lead on softly, according 
 as the cattle that goeth before 
 me and the children be able to endure, 
 until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
 &nbsp; 15 And Esau said, Let me now leave 
 with thee <I>some</I> of the folk that <I>are</I> with 
 me. And he said, What needeth it? let 
 me find grace in the sight of my lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the discourse between the 
 two brothers at their meeting, which is very 
 free and friendly, without the least intimation 
 of the old quarrel. It was the best way 
 to say nothing of it. They converse,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. About Jacob's retinue,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.
 Eleven 
 or twelve little ones, the eldest of them not 
 fourteen years old, followed Jacob closely: 
 <I>Who are these?</I> says Esau. Jacob had sent him 
 an account of the increase of his estate
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 5</A>),
 but made no mention of his children; 
 perhaps because he would not expose 
 them to his rage if he should meet him as an 
 enemy, or would please him with the unexpected 
 sight if he should meet him as a 
 friend: Esau therefore had reason to ask, 
 <I>Who are those with thee?</I> to which common 
 question Jacob returns a serious answer, 
 such as became his character: They are <I>the 
 children which God hath graciously given thy 
 servant.</I> It had been a sufficient answer to 
 the question, and fit enough to be given to 
 profane Esau, if he had only said, "They are 
 my children;" but then Jacob would not 
 have spoken like himself, like a man whose 
 eyes were ever towards the Lord. Note, It 
 becomes us not only to do common actions, 
 but to speak of them, <I>after a godly sort,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:6">3 John 6</A>.
 Jacob speaks of his children, 
 
 1. As God's gifts; they are a <I>heritage of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:2,Ps+112:9.Ps+107:41">Ps. cxxviii. 3; cxii. 9; cvii. 41</A>.

 2. As 
 choice gifts; he hath graciously given them. 
 Though they were many, and now much his 
 care, and as yet but slenderly provided for, 
 yet he accounts them great blessings. His 
 wives and children, hereupon, come up in 
 order, and pay their duty to Esau, as he had 
 done before them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>);
 for it becomes 
 the family to show respect to those to whom 
 the master of the family shows respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. About the present he had sent him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Esau modestly refused it because he 
 had enough, and did not need it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 Note, 
 Those who wish to be considered men of 
 honour will not <I>seem</I> to be mercenary in their 
 friendship: whatever influence Jacob's present 
 had upon Esau to pacify him, he would not 
 have it thought that it had any, and therefore 
 he refused it. His reason is <I>I have 
 
 <A NAME="Page199"> </A>

 enough,</I> I have <I>much</I> (so the word is), so much 
 that he was not willing to take any thing 
 that was his brother's. Note, 
 
 (1.) Many 
 that come short of spiritual blessings, and 
 are out of covenant, yet have much of this 
 world's wealth. Esau had what was promised 
 him, the fatness of the earth and a livelihood 
 by his sword. 
 
 (2.) It is a good thing for 
 those that have much to know that they have 
 enough, though they have not so much as 
 some others have. Even Esau can say, <I>I 
 have enough.</I> 
 
 (3.) Those that are content with 
 what they have must show it by not coveting 
 what others have. Esau bids Jacob keep
 what he had to himself, supposing he had 
 more need of it. Esau, for his part, needs 
 it not, either to supply him, for he was rich, 
 or to pacify him, for he was reconciled: we 
 should take heed lest at any time our covetousness 
 impose upon the courtesy of others, 
 and meanly take advantage of their generosity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jacob affectionately urges him to accept 
 it, and prevails,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 Jacob sent it, 
 through fear
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:20"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 20</A>),
 but, the fear 
 being over, he now importunes his acceptance 
 of it for love, to show that he desired his 
 brother's friendship, and did not merely dread 
 his wrath; two things he urges:--
 
 (1.) The 
 satisfaction he had in his brother's favour, 
 of which he thought himself bound to make 
 this thankful acknowledgment. It is a very 
 high compliment that he passes upon him: <I>I 
 have seen thy face, as though I had seen the 
 face of God,</I> that is, "I have seen thee reconciled 
 to me, and at peace with me, as 
 I desire to see God reconciled." Or the 
 meaning is that Jacob saw God's favour to 
 him in Esau's: it was a token for good to 
 him that God had accepted his prayers. 
 Note, Creature-comforts are comforts indeed 
 to us when they are granted as answers to 
 prayer, and are tokens of our acceptance with 
 God. Again, It is matter of great joy to 
 those that are of a peaceable and affectionate 
 disposition to recover the friendship of those 
 relations with whom they have been at variance. 
 
 (2.) The competency he had of this 
 world's goods: <I>God has dealt graciously with 
 me.</I> Note, If what we have in this world 
 increase under our hands, we must take 
 notice of it with thankfulness, to the glory of 
 God, and own that therein he has dealt graciously 
 with us, better than we deserve. It 
 is he that gives <I>power to get wealth,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:18">Deut. viii. 18</A>.
 He adds, "And <I>I have enough;</I> 
 I have <I>all,</I>" so the word is. Esau's enough 
 was much, but Jacob's enough was all. 
 Note, a godly man, though he have but little 
 in the world, yet may truly say, "I have 
 all," 
 
 [1.] Because he has the God of all, and 
 has all in him; all is yours if you be Christ's,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:22">1 Cor. iii. 22</A>.

 [2.] Because he has the 
 comfort of all. <I>I have all, and abound,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:18">Phil. iv. 18</A>.
 He that has much would have more;
 but he that thinks he has all is sure he has 
 enough. He has all in prospect; he will 
 have all shortly, when he comes to heaven: 
 upon this principle Jacob urged Esau, and 
 he took his present. Note, It is an excellent 
 thing when men's religion makes them generous, 
 free-hearted, and open-handed, scorning 
 to do a thing that is paltry and sneaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. About the progress of their journey. 
 
 1. Esau offers himself to be his guide and 
 companion, in token of sincere reconciliation,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 We never find that Jacob and 
 Esau were so sociable with one another, and 
 so affectionate, as they were now. Note,
 As for God his work is perfect. He made 
 Esau, not only not an enemy, but a friend. 
 This bone that had been broken, being well 
 set, became stronger than ever. Esau has 
 become fond of Jacob's company, courts him 
 to Mount Seir: let us never despair of any,
 nor distrust God in whose hand all hearts 
 are. Yet Jacob saw cause modestly to refuse 
 this offer
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),
 wherein he shows a 
 tender concern for his own family and flocks, 
 like a good shepherd and a good father. He 
 must consider the children, and the flocks
 with young, and not lead the one, nor drive 
 the other, too fast. This prudence and 
 tenderness of Jacob ought to be imitated by 
 those that have the care and charge of young 
 people in the things of God. They must not 
 be over-driven, at first, by heavy tasks in 
 religious services, but led, as they can bear, 
 having their work made as easy to them as 
 possible. Christ, the good Shepherd, does 
 so, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.
 Now Jacob will not desire 
 Esau to slacken his pace, nor force his family 
 to quicken theirs, nor leave them, to keep 
 company with his brother, as many would 
 have done, that love any society better than 
 their own house; but he desires Esau to 
 march before, and promises to follow him 
 leisurely, as he could get forward. Note, 
 It is an unreasonable thing to tie others to 
 our rate; we may come with comfort, at last, 
 to the same journey's end, though we do not 
 journey together, either in the same path or 
 with the same pace. There may be those with
 whom we cannot fall in and yet with 
 whom we need not fall out by the way. 
 Jacob intimates to him that it was his present 
 design to come to him to Mount Seir; and 
 we may presume he did so, after he had 
 settled his family and concerns elsewhere, 
 though that visit is not recorded. Note, 
 When we have happily recovered peace with 
 our friends we must take care to cultivate it, 
 and not to be behind-hand with them in civilities. 
 
 2. Esau offers some of his men to be 
 his guard and convoy,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 He saw Jacob 
 but poorly attended, no servants but his 
 husbandmen and shepherds, no pages or 
 footmen; and therefore, thinking he was as 
 desirous as himself (if he could afford it) to 
 take state upon him, and look great, he 
 would needs lend him some of his retinue, 
 to attend upon him, that he might appear 
 like Esau's brother; but Jacob humbly refuses 
 his offer, only desiring he would not 
 take it amiss that he did not accept it: <I>What 
 
 <A NAME="Page200"> </A>

 needeth it?</I> 
 
 (1.) Jacob is humble, and needs 
 it not for state; he desires not to make a 
 fair show in the flesh, by encumbering himself 
 with a needless retinue. Note, It is the 
 vanity of pomp and grandeur that they are 
 attended with a great deal of which it may be 
 said, <I>What needeth it?</I> 
 
 (2.) Jacob is under 
 the divine protection, and needs it not for 
 safety. Note, Those are sufficiently guarded
 that have God for their guard and are under 
 a convoy of his hosts, as Jacob was. 
 Those need not be beholden to an arm of 
 flesh that have God for their arm every 
 morning. Jacob adds, "Only <I>let me find 
 grace in the sight of my lord;</I> having thy 
 favour, I have all I need, all I desire from 
 thee." If Jacob thus valued the good-will 
 of a brother, much more reason have we to 
 reckon that we have enough if we have the 
 good-will of our God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 So Esau returned that day on 
 his way unto Seir.
 &nbsp; 17 And Jacob 
 journeyed to Succoth, and built him 
 a house, and made booths for his 
 cattle: therefore the name of the place 
 is called Succoth.
 &nbsp; 18 And Jacob came 
 to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which 
 <I>is</I> in the land of Canaan, when he came 
 from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent 
 before the city.
 &nbsp; 19 And he bought a 
 parcel of a field, where he had spread 
 his tent, at the hand of the children 
 of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a 
 hundred pieces of money.
 &nbsp; 20 And he 
 erected there an altar, and called it 
 El-elohe-Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 1. Jacob comes to Succoth. Having 
 in a friendly manner parted with Esau, who 
 had gone to his own country
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 he comes to a place where, it should seem, he 
 rested for some time, set up booths for his 
 cattle, and other conveniences for himself
 and family. The place was afterwards known 
 by the name of Succoth, a city in the tribe 
 of Gad, on the other side Jordan (it signifies 
 <I>booths</I>), that when his posterity afterwards 
 dwelt in houses of stone, they might remember 
 that <I>the Syrian ready to perish</I> was their 
 father, who was glad of booths
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:5">Deut. xxvi. 5</A>);
 such was the rock whence they were 
 hewn. 
 
 2. He comes to Shechem; we read 
 it, to <I>Shalem, a city of Shechem;</I> the critics 
 generally incline to read it appellatively: <I>he 
 came safely, or in peace, to the city of Shechem.</I> 
 After a perilous journey, in which he had 
 met with many difficulties, he came safely, 
 at last, into Canaan. Note, Diseases and 
 dangers should teach us how to value health 
 and safety, and should help to enlarge our 
 hearts in thankfulness, when our going out 
 and coming in have been signally preserved. 
 Here, 
 
 (1.) He buys a field,

 Though the land of Canaan was his by promise, yet, 
 the time for taking possession not having 
 yet come, he is content to pay for his 
 own, to prevent disputes with the present 
 occupants. Note, Dominion is not founded 
 in grace. Those that have heaven on free-cost 
 must not expect to have earth so. 
 
 (2.) He builds an altar,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 [1.] In thankfulness 
 to God, for the good hand of his providence
 over him. He did not content himself 
 with verbal acknowledgments of God's 
 favour to him, but made real ones. 
 
 [2.] That he might keep up religion, and the 
 worship of God, in his family. Note, Where 
 we have a tent God must have an altar, where 
 we have a house he must have a church in 
 it. He dedicated this altar to the honour of 
 <I>El-elohe-Israel--God, the God of Israel,</I> to the 
 honour of God, in general, the only living 
 and true God, the best of beings and first of 
 causes; and to the honour of the God of 
 Israel, as a God in covenant with him. Note, 
 In our worship of God we must be guided 
 and governed by the joint-discoveries both 
 of natural and revealed religion. God had 
 lately called him by the name of <I>Israel,</I> and 
 now he calls God <I>the God of Israel;</I> though 
 he is styled <I>a prince with God,</I> God shall still 
 be a prince with him, his Lord and his God. 
 Note, Our honours then become honours 
 indeed to us when they are consecrated to 
 God's honour; Israel's God is Israel's glory.</P>
