 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Sarah was an hundred and 
 seven and twenty years old: <I>these 
 were</I> the years of the life of Sarah.
 &nbsp; 2 And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the 
 same <I>is</I> Hebron in the land of Canaan: 
 and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, 
 and to weep for her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 
 
 1. Sarah's age,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Almost forty years before, she had called 
 herself old,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:12"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 12</A>.
 Old people will 
 die never the sooner, but may die the better, 
 for reckoning themselves old. 
 
 2. Her death,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 The longest liver must die at last. 
 Abraham and Sarah had lived comfortably 
 together many years; but death parts those 
 whom nothing else could part. The special 
 friends and favourites of Heaven are not exempted 
 from the stroke of death. She died 
 in the land of Canaan, where she had been 
 above sixty years a sojourner. 
 
 3. Abraham's 
 mourning for her; and he was a true 
 mourner. He did not only perform the 
 ceremonies of mourning according to the 
 custom of those times, as the mourners that
 go about the streets, but he did sincerely 
 lament the great loss he had of a good wife, 
 and gave proof of the constancy of his affection 
 to her to the last. Two words are used: 
 he came both to <I>mourn</I> and to <I>weep.</I> His 
 sorrow was not counterfeit, but real. He 
 came to her tent, and sat down by the 
 corpse, there to pay the tribute of his tears, 
 that his eye might affect his heart, and that 
 he might pay the greater respect to the memory 
 of her that was gone. Note, It is not 
 only lawful, but it is a duty, to lament the 
 death of our near relations, both in compliance 
 with the providence of God, who thus 
 calls to weeping and mourning, and in 
 honour to those to whom honour is due. 
 Tears are a tribute due to our deceased 
 friends. When a body is sown, it must 
 be watered. But we must not sorrow as 
 those that have no hope; for we have a good 
 hope through grace both concerning them 
 and concerning ourselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And Abraham stood up from before 
 his dead, and spake unto the sons 
 of Heth, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 I <I>am</I> a stranger 
 and a sojourner with you: give me a
 possession of a buryingplace with you, 
 that I may bury my dead out of my 
 sight.
 &nbsp; 5 And the children of Heth 
 
 <A NAME="Page141"> </A>

 answered Abraham, saying unto him,
 &nbsp; 6 Hear us, my lord: thou <I>art</I> a 
 mighty prince among us: in the choice 
 of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none 
 of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, 
 but that thou mayest bury 
 thy dead.
 &nbsp; 7 And Abraham stood up, 
 and bowed himself to the people of 
 the land, <I>even</I> to the children of Heth.
 &nbsp; 8 And he communed with them, saying, 
 If it be your mind that I should 
 bury my dead out of my sight; hear 
 me, and intreat for me to Ephron the 
 son of Zohar,
 &nbsp; 9 That he may give 
 me the cave of Machpelah, which he 
 hath, which <I>is</I> in the end of his field; 
 for as much money as it is worth he 
 shall give it me for a possession of a 
 buryingplace amongst you.
 &nbsp; 10 And 
 Ephron dwelt among the children of 
 Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered 
 Abraham in the audience of the 
 children of Heth, <I>even</I> of all that went 
 in at the gate of his city, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field 
 give I thee, and the cave that <I>is</I> therein, I 
 give it thee; in the presence of the 
 sons of my people give I it thee: bury 
 thy dead.
 &nbsp; 12 And Abraham bowed 
 down himself before the people of the
 land.
 &nbsp; 13 And he spake unto Ephron 
 in the audience of the people of the 
 land, saying, But if thou <I>wilt give it,</I> 
 I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee 
 money for the field; take <I>it</I> of me, 
 and I will bury my dead there.
 &nbsp; 14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying 
 unto him,
 &nbsp; 15 My lord, hearken 
 unto me: the land <I>is worth</I> four hundred
 shekels of silver; what <I>is</I> that 
 betwixt me and thee? bury therefore 
 thy dead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The humble request which 
 Abraham made to his neighbours, the Hittites, 
 for a burying-place among them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 It was strange he had this to do now; 
 but we are to impute it rather to God's providence 
 than to his improvidence, as appears 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:5">Acts vi. 5</A>,
 where it is said, <I>God gave 
 him no inheritance in Canaan.</I> It were well 
 if all those who take care to provide burying-places 
 for their bodies after death were as 
 careful to provide a resting-place for their 
 souls. Observe here, 
 
 1. The convenient 
 diversion which this affair gave, for the present, 
 to Abraham's grief: He <I>stood up from 
 before his dead.</I> Those that find themselves 
 in danger of over-grieving for their dead relations, 
 and are entering into that temptation, 
 must take heed of poring upon their 
 loss and sitting alone and melancholy. 
 There must be a time of standing up from 
 before their dead, and ceasing to mourn. 
 For, thanks be to God, our happiness is not 
 bound up in the life of any creature. Care 
 of the funeral may, as here, be improved to 
 divert grief for the death at first, when it is 
 most in danger of tyrannizing. Weeping 
 must not hinder sowing. 
 
 2. The argument 
 he used with the children of Heth, which 
 was this: "<I>I am a stranger and a sojourner 
 with you,</I> therefore I am unprovided, and 
 must become a humble suitor to you for a 
 burying-place." This was one occasion 
 which Abraham took to confess that he was 
 a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth; he was 
 not ashamed to own it thus publicly, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13">Heb. xi. 13</A>.
 Note, The death of our relations 
 should effectually remind us that we are not 
 at home in this world. When they are gone, 
 say, "We are going." 
 
 3. His uneasiness 
 till this affair was settled, intimated in that 
 word, <I>that I may bury my dead out of my 
 sight.</I> Note, Death will make those unpleasant 
 to our sight who while they lived 
 were the desire of our eyes. The countenance 
 that was fresh and lively becomes pale 
 and ghastly, and fit to be removed into the 
 land of darkness. While she was in his 
 sight, it renewed his grief, which he would 
 prevent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The generous offer which the children 
 of Heth made to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 They compliment 
 him, 
 
 1. With a title of respect: 
 <I>Thou art a prince of God among us,</I> so the 
 word is; not only great, but good. He 
 called himself a stranger and a sojourner; 
 they call him a great prince; for those that 
 humble themselves shall be exalted. God
 had promised to make Abraham's name 
 great. 
 
 2. With a tender of the best of their 
 burying-places. Note, Even the light of 
 nature teaches us to be civil and respectful 
 towards all, though they be strangers and 
 sojourners. The noble generosity of these 
 Canaanites shames and condemns the closeness, 
 and selfishness, and ill-humour, of 
 many that call themselves Israelites. Observe, 
 These Canaanites would be glad to 
 mingle their dust with Abraham's and to 
 have their last end like his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular proposal which Abraham 
 made to them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.
 He returns 
 them his thanks for their kind offer with all 
 possible decency and respect; though a great 
 man, an old man, and now a mourner, yet 
 he stands up, and bows himself humbly before 
 them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Note, Religion teaches 
 good manners; and those abuse it that place 
 it in rudeness and clownishness. He then 
 pitches upon the place he thinks most convenient, 
 namely, the cave of Machpelah, 
 which probably lay near him, and had not 
 yet been used for a burying-place. The 
 
 <A NAME="Page143"> </A>

 present owner was <I>Ephron.</I> Abraham cannot 
 pretend to any interest in him, but he 
 desires that they would improve theirs with 
 him to get the purchase of that cave, and 
 the field in which it was. Note, A moderate 
 desire to obtain that which is convenient for
 us, by fair and honest means, is not such a 
 coveting of that which is our neighbour's as 
 is forbidden in the tenth commandment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The present which Ephron made to 
 Abraham of his field: <I>The field give I thee,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 Abraham thought he must be entreated 
 to sell it; but, upon the first mention 
 of it, without entreaty, Ephron freely gives 
 it. Some men have more generosity than 
 they are thought to have. Abraham, no 
 doubt, had taken all occasions to oblige his 
 neighbours, and do them any service that 
 lay in his power; and now they return his 
 kindness: for <I>he that watereth shall be watered 
 also himself.</I> Note, If those that profess 
 religion adorn their profession by eminent 
 civility and serviceableness to all, they 
 shall find it will rebound to their own comfort 
 and advantage, as well as to the glory 
 of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Abraham's modest and sincere refusal 
 of Ephron's kind offer,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 Abundance 
 of thanks he returns him for it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 makes his obeisance to him before the people 
 of the land, that they might respect 
 Ephron the more for the respect they saw 
 Abraham give him 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:30">1 Sam. xv. 30</A>),
 but resolves 
 to give him money for the field, even 
 the full value of it. It was not in pride that 
 Abraham refused the gift, or because he 
 scorned to be beholden to Ephron; but, 
 
 1. In justice. Abraham was rich in silver and 
 gold 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:2"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 2</A>)
 and was able to pay for the 
 field, and therefore would not take advantage 
 of Ephron's generosity. Note, Honesty, as 
 well as honour, forbids us to sponge upon 
 our neighbours and to impose upon those 
 that are free. Job reflected upon it with 
 comfort, when he was poor, that he had not 
 <I>eaten the fruits of his land without money,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:39">Job xxxi. 39</A>.

 2. In prudence. He would
 pay for it lest Ephron, when this good humour
 was over, should upbraid him with it,
 and say, <I>I have made Abraham rich</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:23"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 23</A>),
 or lest the next heir should question
 Abraham's title (because that grant was made
 without any consideration), and claim back
 the field. Thus David afterwards refused
 Araunah's offer,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:24">2 Sam. xxiv. 24</A>.
 We know 
 not what affronts we may hereafter receive 
 from those that are now most kind and generous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The price of the land fixed by Ephron 
 but not insisted on: <I>The land is worth four 
 hundred shekels of silver</I> (about fifty pounds 
 of our money), <I>but what is that between me 
 and thee?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 He would rather oblige 
 his friend than have so much money in his 
 pocket. Herein Ephron discovers, 
 
 1. A 
 great contempt of worldly wealth. "What 
 is that between me and thee? It is a small 
 matter, not worth speaking of." Many a 
 one would have said, "It is a deal of money; 
 it will go far in a child's portion." But 
 Ephron says, "What is that?" Note, It is 
 an excellent thing for people to have low and 
 mean thoughts of all the wealth of this world; 
 it is that which is not, and in the abundance 
 of which a man's life does not consist, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:15">Luke xii. 15</A>.

 2. Great courtesy, and obligingness 
 to his friend and neighbour. Ephron was 
 not jealous of Abraham as a resident foreigner, 
 nor envious at him as a man likely to 
 thrive and grow rich. He bore him no ill-will 
 for his singularity in religion, but was 
 much kinder to him than most people now-a-days 
 are to their own brothers: <I>What is 
 that between me and thee?</I> Note, No little 
 thing should occasion demurs and differences 
 between true friends. When we are tempted 
 to be hot in resenting affronts, high in demanding 
 our rights, or hard in denying a 
 kindness, we should answer the temptation 
 with this question: "What is that between 
 me and my friend?"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And Abraham hearkened unto 
 Ephron; and Abraham weighed to 
 Ephron the silver, which he had named 
 in the audience of the sons of Heth, 
 four hundred shekels of silver, current 
 <I>money</I> with the merchant.
 &nbsp; 17 And 
 the field of Ephron, which <I>was</I> in 
 Machpelah, which <I>was</I> before Mamre, 
 the field, and the cave which <I>was</I> 
 therein, and all the trees that <I>were</I> in 
 the field, that <I>were</I> in all the borders 
 round about, were made sure
 &nbsp; 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the 
 presence of the children of Heth, before 
 all that went in at the gate of 
 his city.
 &nbsp; 19 And after this, Abraham 
 buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
 the field of Machpelah before Mamre: 
 the same <I>is</I> Hebron in the land of 
 Canaan.
 &nbsp; 20 And the field, and the 
 cave that <I>is</I> therein, were made sure 
 unto Abraham for a possession of a 
 buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of the treaty 
 between Abraham and Ephron about the 
 burying-place. The bargain was publicly 
 made before all the neighbours, <I>in the presence 
 and audience of the sons of Heth,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 Note, Prudence, as well as justice, directs us 
 to be fair, and open, and above-board, in our 
 dealings. Fraudulent contracts hate the 
 light, and choose to be clandestine; but those 
 that design honestly in their bargains care 
 not who are witnesses to them. Our law 
 countenances sales made in market-overt, 
 and by deed enrolled. Observe, 
 
 1. Abraham, 
 without fraud, covin, or further delay, pays 
 
 <A NAME="Page144"> </A>

 the money,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 He pays it readily, without 
 hesitation,--pays it in full, without diminution,--and 
 pays it by weight, current 
 money with the merchant, without deceit. 
 See how anciently money was used for the 
 help of commerce; and see how honestly 
 money should be paid where it is due. Observe, 
 Though all the land of Canaan was 
 Abraham's by promise, yet, the time of his 
 possessing not having come, what he had 
 now occasion for he bought and paid for. 
 Note, Dominion is not founded in grace. The 
 saints' title to an eternal inheritance does not 
 entitle them to the possessions of this world, 
 nor justify them in doing wrong. 
 
 2. Ephron 
 honestly and fairly makes him a good title to 
 the land,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:17,18,20"><I>v.</I> 17, 18, 20</A>.
 The field, with all 
 its appurtenances, is conveyed to Abraham 
 and his heirs for ever, in open court, not by 
 writing (it does not appear that writing was 
 then used), but by such a public solemn declaration 
 before witnesses as was sufficient to 
 pass it. Note, As that which is bought must
 be honestly paid for, so that which is sold
 must be honestly delivered and secured.

 3. Abraham, thereupon, takes possession, and
 buries Sarah in the cave or vault (whether
 framed by nature or art is not certain) which
 was in the purchased field. It is probable
 that Abraham had buried servants out of his
 family since he came to Canaan, but the graves
 of the common people
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:6">2 Kings xxiii. 6</A>)
 might 
 suffice for them; now that Sarah was dead a 
 peculiar place must be found for her remains. 
 It is worth noting, 
 
 (1.) That a burying-place 
 was the first spot of ground Abraham possessed 
 in Canaan. Note, When we are entering 
 into the world it is good to think of our 
 going out of it; for, as soon as we are born, 
 we begin to die. 
 
 (2.) That it was the only 
 piece of land he ever possessed, though the 
 country was all his own in reversion. Those 
 that have least of this earth find a grave in it. 
 Abraham provided, not cities, as Cain and 
 Nimrod, but a sepulchre, 
 
 [1.] To be a constant 
 memorandum of death to himself and 
 his posterity, that he and they might learn 
 to die daily. This sepulchre is said to be 
 <I>at the end of the field</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 for, whatever our
 possessions are, there is a sepulchre at the end 
 of them. 
 
 [2.] To be a token of his belief 
 and expectation of the resurrection; for why 
 should such care be taken of the body if it 
 be thrown away for ever, and must not rise 
 again? Abraham, in this, said plainly that 
 he sought a better country, that is, a heavenly. 
 Abraham is content to be still flitting, 
 while he lives, but secures a place where, 
 when he dies his flesh may rest in hope.</P>
