 At this chapter begins the famous story of Balak and Balaam, their 
 attempt to curse Israel, and the baffling of that attempt; God's people 
 are long afterwards told to remember what Balak the king of Moab 
 consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, that they 
 might know the righteousness of the Lord,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
 plains of Moab on this side Jordan <I>by</I> Jericho.
 &nbsp; 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
 the Amorites.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they <I>were</I>
 many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
 company lick up all <I>that are</I> round about us, as the ox licketh
 up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor <I>was</I> king
 of the Moabites at that time.
 &nbsp; 5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
 Pethor, which <I>is</I> by the river of the land of the children of
 his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come
 out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and
 they abide over against me:
 &nbsp; 6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
 they <I>are</I> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,
 <I>that</I> we may smite them, and <I>that</I> I may drive them out of the
 land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest <I>is</I> blessed, and he
 whom thou cursest is cursed.
 &nbsp; 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
 the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
 Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will
 bring you word again, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall speak unto me: and the
 princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
 &nbsp; 9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <I>are</I> these with
 thee?
 &nbsp; 10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
 Moab, hath sent unto me, <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 11 Behold, <I>there is</I> a people come out of Egypt, which
 covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;
 peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them
 out.
 &nbsp; 12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
 shalt not curse the people: for they <I>are</I> blessed.
 &nbsp; 13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
 of Balak, Get you into your land: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> refuseth to give
 me leave to go with you.
 &nbsp; 14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak,
 and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The children of Israel have at length finished their wanderings in the 
 wilderness, out of which they went up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:18"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 18</A>),

 and are now encamped in the plains of Moab near Jordan, where they
 continued till they passed through Jordan under Joshua, after the death 
 of Moses. Now we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fright which the Moabites were in upon the approach of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 They needed not to fear any harm from them if they knew (and it is 
 probable that Moses let them know) the orders God had given to Israel 
 not to contend with the Moabites, nor to use any hostility against 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:9">Deut. ii. 9</A>.

 But, if they had any notice of this, they were jealous that it was but
 a sham, to make them secure, that they might be the more easily 
 conquered. Notwithstanding the old friendship between Abraham and Lot, 
 the Moabites resolved to ruin Israel if they could, and therefore they 
 will take it for granted, without any ground for the suspicion, that 
 Israel resolves to ruin them. Thus it is common for those that design 
 mischief to pretend that mischief is designed against them; and their 
 groundless jealousies must be the colour of their causeless malice. 
 They hear of their triumphs over the Amorites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and think that their own house is in danger when their neighbour's is 
 on fire. They observe their multitudes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They were many;</I> and hence infer how easily they would conquer 
 their country, and all about them if some speedy and effectual course 
 were not taken to stop the progress of their victorious arms: "They 
 shall <I>lick up</I> or devour us, and <I>all that are round about 
 us,</I> as speedily and irresistibly <I>as the ox eats up the 
 grass</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 owning themselves to be an unequal match for so formidable an enemy. 
 Therefore they were sorely afraid and distressed themselves; thus were 
 the wicked <I>in great fear where no fear was,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:5">Ps. liii. 5</A>.

 These fears they communicated to their neighbours, the elders of
 Midian, that some measures might be concerted between them for their 
 common safety; for, if the kingdom of Moab fall, the republic of Midian 
 cannot stand long. The Moabites, if they had pleased, might have made a 
 good use of the advances of Israel, and their successes against the 
 Amorites. They had reason to rejoice, and give God and Israel thanks 
 for freeing them from the threatening power of Sihon king of the 
 Amorites, who had taken from them part of their country, and was likely 
 to overrun the rest.  They had reason likewise to court Israel's 
 friendship, and to come in to their assistance; but having forsaken the 
 religion of their father Lot, and being sunk into idolatry, they hated 
 the people of the God of Abraham, and were justly infatuated in their 
 counsels and given up to distress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The project which the king of Moab formed to get the people of 
 Israel cursed, that is, to set God against them, who, he perceived, 
 hitherto fought for them. He trusted more to his arts than to his arms, 
 and had a notion that if he could but get some prophet or other, with 
 his powerful charms, to imprecate evil upon them, and to pronounce a 
 blessing upon himself and his forces, then, though otherwise too weak, 
 he should be able to deal with them. This notion arose, 

 1. Out of the remains of some religion; for it owns a dependence upon
 some visible sovereign powers that rule in the affairs of the children 
 of men and determine them, and an obligation upon us to make 
 application to these powers. 

 2. Out of the ruins of the true religion; for if the Midianites and 
 Moabites had not wretchedly degenerated from the faith and worship of 
 their pious ancestors, Abraham and Lot, they could not have imagined it 
 possible to do any mischief with their curses to a people who alone 
 adhered to the service of the true God, from whose service they had 
 themselves revolted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The court which he made to Balaam the son of Beor, a famous 
 conjurer, to engage him to curse Israel. The Balaam lived a great way 
 off, in that country whence Abraham came, and where Laban lived; but, 
 though it was probable that there were many nearer home that were 
 pretenders to divination, yet none had so great a reputation for 
 success as Balaam, and Balak will employ the best he can hear of, 
 though he send a great way for him, so much is his heart upon this 
 project. And to gain him, 

 1. He makes him his friend, complaining to him, as his confidant, of
 the danger he was in from the numbers and neighbourhood of the camp of 
 Israel: <I>They cover the face of the earth,</I> and they <I>abide over 
 against me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 2. In effect he makes him his god, by the great power he attributes to 
 his word: <I>He whom thou blessest is blessed,</I> and <I>he whom thou 
 cursest is cursed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The learned bishop Patrick inclines to think, with many of the Jewish 
 writers, that Balaam had been a great prophet, who, for the 
 accomplishment of his predictions and the answers of his prayers, both 
 for good and evil, had been looked upon justly as a man of great 
 interest with God; but that, growing proud and covetous, God departed 
 from him, and then, to support his sinking credit, he betook himself to 
 diabolical arts. He is called a <I>prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:16">2 Pet. ii. 16</A>,)

 because he had been one, or perhaps he had raised his reputation from 
 the first by his magical charms, as Simon Magus, who bewitched the 
 people so far that he was called <I>the great power of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:10">Acts viii. 10</A>.

 Curses pronounced by God's prophets in the name of the Lord have
 wonderful effects, as Noah's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25">Gen. ix. 25</A>),

 and Elisha's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:24">2 Kings ii. 24</A>.

 But the curse <I>causeless shall not come</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:2">Prov. xxvi. 2</A>),

 no more than Goliath's, when he <I>cursed David by his gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:43">1 Sam. xvii. 43</A>.

 Let us desire to have the prayers of God's ministers and people for us,
 and dread having them against us; for they are greatly regarded by him 
 who blesseth indeed and curseth indeed. But Balak cannot rely upon 
 these compliments as sufficient to prevail with Balaam, the main 
 inducement is yet behind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 they took <I>the rewards of divination in their hand, the wages of 
 unrighteousness,</I> which he <I>loved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:15">2 Pet. ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The restraint God lays upon Balaam, forbidding him to curse Israel. 
 It is very probable that Balaam, being a curious inquisitive man, was 
 no stranger to Israel's case and character, but had heard that God was 
 with them of a truth, so that he ought to have given the messengers 
 their answer immediately, that he would never curse a people whom God 
 had blessed; but he lodges the messengers, and takes a night's time to 
 consider what he shall do, and to receive instructions from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 When we enter into a parley with temptations we are in great danger of 
 being overcome by them. In the night God comes to him, probably in a 
 dream, and enquires what business those strangers had with him. He 
 knows it, but he will know it from him. Balaam gives him an account of 
 their errand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>),

 and God thereupon charges him not to go with them, or attempt to curse 
 that blessed people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Thus God sometimes, for the preservation of his people, was pleased to 
 speak to bad men, as to Abimelech 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:3">Gen. xx. 3</A>),

 and to Laban,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:24">Gen. xxxi. 24</A>.

 And we read of some that were workers of iniquity, and yet in Christ's
 name prophesied, and <I>did many wondrous works.</I> Balaam is charged 
 not only not to go to Balak, but not to offer to curse this people, 
 which he might have attempted at a distance; and the reason is given: 
 <I>They are blessed.</I> This was part of the blessing of Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>),

 <I>I will curse him that curseth thee;</I> so that an attempt to curse
 them would be not only fruitless, but perilous. Israel had often 
 provoked God in the wilderness, yet he will not suffer their enemies to 
 curse them, for he <I>rewards them not according to their 
 iniquities.</I> The blessedness of those whose sin is covered comes 
 upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:6,7">Rom. iv. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The return of the messengers without Balaam. 

 1. Balaam is not faithful in returning God's answer to the messengers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He only tells them, <I>the Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with 
 you.</I> He did not tell them, as he ought to have done, that Israel 
 was a blessed people, and must by no means be cursed; for then the 
 design would have been crushed, and the temptation would not have been 
 renewed: but he, in effect, desired them to give his humble service to 
 Balak, and let him know that he applauded his project, and would have 
 been very glad to gratify him, but that truly he had the character of a 
 prophet, and must not go without leave from God, which he had not yet 
 obtained, and therefore for the present he must be excused. Note, Those 
 are a fair mark for Satan's temptation that speak diminishingly of 
 divine prohibitions, as if they amounted to no more than the denial of 
 a permission, and as if to go against God's law were only to go without 
 his leave. 

 2. The messengers are not faithful in returning Balaam's answer to
 Balak. All the account they give of it is, <I>Balaam refuseth to come 
 with us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 intimating that he only wanted more courtship and higher proffers; but 
 they are not willing Balak should know that God had signified his 
 disallowance of the attempt. Thus are great men wretchedly abused by 
 the flatteries of those about them, who do all they can to prevent 
 their seeing their own faults and follies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
 than they.
 &nbsp; 16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak
 the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
 coming unto me:
 &nbsp; 17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will
 do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
 curse me this people.
 &nbsp; 18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
 Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot
 go beyond the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, to do less or more.
 &nbsp; 19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night,
 that I may know what the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will say unto me more.
 &nbsp; 20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
 men come to call thee, rise up, <I>and</I> go with them; but yet the
 word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
 &nbsp; 21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
 went with the princes of Moab.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a second embassy sent to Balaam, to fetch him over to 
 curse Israel. It were well for us if we were as earnest and constant in 
 prosecuting a good work, notwithstanding disappointments, as Balak was 
 in pursuing this ill design. The enemies of the church are restless and 
 unwearied in their attempts against it; but he that sits in heaven 
 laughs at them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The temptation Balak laid before Balaam. He contrived to make this 
 assault more vigorous than the former. It is very probable that he sent 
 double money in the hands of his messengers; but, besides that, now he 
 tempted him with honours, laid a bait not only for his covetousness, 
 but for his pride and ambition. How earnestly should we beg of God 
 daily to mortify in us these two limbs of the old man! Those that know 
 how to look with a holy contempt upon worldly wealth and preferment 
 will find it not so hard a matter as most men do to keep a good 
 conscience. See how artfully Balak managed the temptation. 

 1. The messengers he sent were <I>more,</I> and <I>more honourable,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 He sent to this conjurer with as great respect and deference to his 
 quality as if he had been a sovereign prince, apprehending perhaps that 
 Balaam had thought himself slighted in the fewness and meanness of the 
 former messengers. 

 2. The request was very urgent. This powerful prince becomes a suitor
 to him: "<I>Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 no, not God, nor conscience, nor any fear either of sin or shame." 

 3. The proffers were high: "<I>I will promote thee to very great
 honour</I> among the princes of Moab;" nay, he gives him a blank, and 
 he shall write his own terms: <I>I will do whatsoever thou sayest,</I> 
 that is, "I will give thee whatever thou desirest, and observe whatever 
 thou orderest; thy word shall be a law to me,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Thus sinners stick at no pains, spare no cost, and care not how low 
 they stoop, for the gratifying either of their luxury or of their 
 malice; shall we then be stiff and strait-handed in our compliance with 
 the laws of virtue? God forbid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Balaam's seeming resistance of, but real yielding to, this 
 temptation. We may here discern in Balaam a struggle between his 
 convictions and his corruptions. 

 1. His convictions charged him to adhere to the command of God, and he
 spoke their language,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Nor could any man have said better: "<I>If Balak would give me his 
 house full of silver and gold,</I> and that is more than he can give or 
 I can ask, <I>I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God.</I>" See 
 how honourably he speaks of God; he is <I>Jehovah, my God.</I> Note, 
 Many call God theirs that are not his, not <I>truly</I> because not 
 <I>only</I> his; <I>they swear by the Lord, and by Malcham.</I> See how 
 respectfully he speaks of the word of God, as one resolved to stick to 
 it, and in nothing to vary from it, and how slightly of the wealth of 
 this world, as if gold and silver were nothing to him in comparison 
 with the favour of God; and yet, at the same time, the searcher of 
 hearts knew that he loved the wages of unrighteousness. Note, It is an
 easy thing for bad men to speak very good words, and with their mouth 
 to make a show of piety. There is no judging of men by their words. God 
 knows the heart. 

 2. His corruptions at the same time strongly inclined him to go 
 contrary to the command. He seemed to refuse the temptation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 But even then he expressed no abhorrence of it, as Christ did when he 
 had the kingdoms of the world offered him (<I>Get thee hence 
 Satan</I>), and as Peter did when Simon Magus offered him money: <I>Thy
 money perish with thee.</I> But it appears

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 that he had a strong inclination to accept the proffer; for he would 
 further attend, to know what God would say to him, hoping that he might 
 alter his mind and give him leave to go. This was a vile reflection 
 upon God Almighty, as if he could change his mind, and now at last 
 suffer those to be cursed whom he had pronounced blessed, and as if he 
 would be brought to allow what he had already declared to be evil. 
 Surely he thought God <I>altogether such a one as himself.</I> He had 
 already been told what the will of God was, in which he ought to have 
 acquiesced, and not to have desired a re-hearing of that cause which 
 was already so plainly determined. Note, It is a very great affront to
 God, and a certain evidence of the dominion of corruption in the heart, 
 to beg leave to sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The permission God gave him to go, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God came to him, probably by an anger, and told him he might, if he 
 pleased, go with Balak's messengers. <I>So he gave him up to his own 
 heart's lust.</I> "Since thou hast such a mind to go, even go, yet know 
 that <I>the journey thou undertakest shall not be for thy honour;</I> 
 for, though thou hast leave to go, thou shalt not, as thou hopest, have 
 leave to curse, <I>for the word which I shall say unto thee, that thou 
 shalt do.</I>" Note, God has wicked men in a chain; <I>hitherto they 
 shall come</I> by his permission, but no further that he does permit 
 them. Thus he makes the wrath of man to praise him, yet, at the same
 time, restrains the remainder of it. It was in anger that God said to 
 Balaam, "Go with them," and we have reason to think that Balaam himself 
 so understood it, for we do not find him pleading this allowance when 
 God reproved him for going. Note, As God sometimes denies the prayers 
 of his people in love, so sometimes he grants the desires of the wicked 
 in wrath.</P>

 IV. His setting out in the journey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 God gave him leave to go <I>if the men called him,</I> but he was so 
 fond of the journey that we do not find he staid for their calling him, 
 but he himself <I>rose up in the morning,</I> got every thing ready 
 with all speed, and <I>went with the princes of Moab,</I> who were 
 proud enough that they had carried their point. The apostle describes 
 Balaam's sin here to be that he <I>ran greedily into an error for 
 reward,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
 was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 23 And the ass saw the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> standing in the way,
 and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
 the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
 turn her into the way.
 &nbsp; 24 But the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stood in a path of the vineyards,
 a wall <I>being</I> on this side, and a wall on that side.
 &nbsp; 25 And when the ass saw the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, she thrust
 herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the
 wall: and he smote her again.
 &nbsp; 26 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> went further, and stood in a
 narrow place, where <I>was</I> no way to turn either to the right hand
 or to the left.
 &nbsp; 27 And when the ass saw the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, she fell down
 under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
 ass with a staff.
 &nbsp; 28 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
 Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
 these three times?
 &nbsp; 29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
 would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
 &nbsp; 30 And the ass said unto Balaam, <I>Am</I> not I thine ass, upon
 which thou hast ridden ever since <I>I was</I> thine unto this day?
 was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
 &nbsp; 31 Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the
 angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
 hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
 &nbsp; 32 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
 smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
 withstand thee, because <I>thy</I> way is perverse before me:
 &nbsp; 33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
 unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee,
 and saved her alive.
 &nbsp; 34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have sinned;
 for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
 therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
 &nbsp; 35 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
 but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt
 speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the opposition God gave to Balaam in his 
 journey towards Moab; probably the princes had gone before, or gone 
 some other way, and Balaam had pointed out where he would meet them, or 
 where they should stay for him, for we read nothing of them in this 
 part of our narrative, only that Balaam, like a person of some quality, 
 was attended with his two men-honour enough, one would think, for such 
 a man, he needed not be beholden to Balak for promotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is God's displeasure against Balaam for undertaking this 
 journey: God's <I>anger was kindled because he went,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Note,
 
 1. The sin of sinners is not to be thought the less provoking to God 
 because he permits it. We must not think that, because God does not by 
 his providence restrain men from sin, therefore he approves of it, or 
 that it is therefore not hateful to him; he suffers sin, and yet is 
 angry at it. 

 2. Nothing is more displeasing to God than malicious designs against
 his people; he that touches them touches the apple of his eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The way God took to let Balaam know his displeasure against him: 
 <I>An angel stood in the way for an adversary.</I> Now God fulfilled 
 his promise to Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:22">Exod. xxiii. 22</A>),

 <I>I will be an enemy to thy enemies.</I> The holy angels are
 adversaries to sin, and perhaps are employed more than we are aware of 
 in preventing it, particularly in opposing those that have any ill 
 designs against God's church and people, for whom Michael our prince 
 stands up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:1,Da+10:21">Dan. xii. 1; x. 21</A>.

 What a comfort is this to all that wish well to the Israel of God, that
 he never suffers wicked men to form an attempt against them, without 
 sending his holy angels forth to break the attempt and secure his 
 little ones! When the prophet saw the four horns that scattered Judah, 
 at the same time he saw four carpenters that were to fray those horns,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:18-21">Zech. i. 18</A>,

 &c. When the <I>enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will
 lift up a standard against him.</I> This angel was an adversary to 
 Balaam, because Balaam counted him his adversary; otherwise those are 
 really our best friends, and we are so to reckon them, that stop our 
 progress in a sinful way. The angel stood with his sword drawn

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 <I>a flaming sword,</I> like that in the hands of the cherubim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>),

 <I>turning every way.</I> Note, The holy angels are at war with those
 with whom God is angry, for they are the ministers of his justice. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Balaam had notice given him of God's displeasure, by the ass, and 
 this <I>did not startle him.</I> The <I>ass saw the angel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 How vainly did Balaam boast that he was a man whose <I>eyes were 
 open,</I> and that he <I>saw the visions of the Almighty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:3,4"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 3, 4</A>),

 when the ass he rode on saw more than he did, his eyes being blinded
 with covetousness and ambition and dazzled with the rewards of 
 divination! Note, Many have God against them, and his holy angels, but 
 are not aware of it. The <I>ass knows his owner,</I> sees his danger, 
 but Balaam does <I>not know, does not consider,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3">Isa. i. 3</A>.

 <I>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.

 Let none be puffed up with a conceit of visions and revelations, when
 even an ass saw an angel; yet let those be ashamed of their own 
 sottishness, worse than that of the beasts that perish, who, when they 
 are told of the sword of God's wrath drawn against them, while they 
 persist in wicked ways, yet will go on: the ass understood the law of 
 self-preservation better than so; for, to save both herself and her 
 senseless rider,

 (1.) She <I>turned aside out of the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Balaam should have taken the hint of this, and considered whether he 
 was not out of the way of his duty; but, instead of this, he <I>beat 
 her into the way again.</I> Thus those who by wilful sin are running 
 headlong into perdition are angry at those that would prevent their 
 ruin.

 (2.) She had not gone much further before she saw the angel again, and 
 the, to avoid him, <I>ran up to a wall,</I> and <I>crushed her rider's 
 foot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 How many ill accidents are we liable to in travelling upon the road, 
 from which if we are preserved we must own our obligations to the 
 divine Providence, which by the ministry of angels <I>keeps us in all 
 our ways, lest we dash our foot against a stone;</I> but, if we at any 
 time meet with a disaster, it should put us upon enquiring whether our 
 way be right in the sight of God or no. The crushing of Balaam's foot,
 though it was the saving of his life, provoked him so much that he 
 smote his ass the second time, so angry are we apt to be at that which, 
 though a present uneasiness, yet is a real kindness.

 (3.) Upon the next encounter with the angel, the ass fell down under 
 Balaam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 He ought to have considered that there was certainly something 
 extraordinary in this; for his ass was not restive, nor did she use to 
 serve him thus: but it is common for those whose hearts are <I>fully 
 set in them to do evil</I> to push on violently, and break through all 
 the difficulties which Providence lays in their way to give check to 
 them and to stop them in their career. Balaam the third time smote his
 ass, though she had now done him the best piece of service that ever 
 she did him, saving him from the sword of the angel, and by her falling 
 down teaching him to do likewise.

 (4.) When all this would not work upon him, God opened the mouth of the 
 ass, and she spoke to him once and again; and yet neither did this move 
 him: <I>The Lord opened the mouth of the ass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 This was a great miracle, quite above the power of nature, and wrought 
 by the power of the God of nature, who made man's mouth, and taught him 
 to speak, for otherwise (since we learn to speak purely by imitation, 
 and therefore those that are born deaf are consequently dumb) the first 
 man would never have spoken, nor any of his seed. He that made man 
 speak could, when he pleased, make the ass to <I>speak with man's 
 voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:16">2 Pet. ii. 16</A>.

 Here Mr. Ainsworth observes that the devil, when he tempted our first
 parents to sin, employed a subtle serpent, but that God, when he would 
 convince Balaam, employed a silly ass, a creature dull and sottish to a 
 proverb; for Satan corrupts men's minds by the <I>craftiness of those 
 that lie in wait to deceive,</I> but Christ has <I>chosen the foolish 
 things of the world to confound the wise.</I> By a dumb ass God rebukes 
 the madness of the prophet, for he will never want reprovers, but when 
 he pleases can make the stones cry out as witnesses to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:40,Hab+2:11">Luke xix. 40; Hab. ii. 11</A>.

 [1.] The ass complained of Balaam's cruelty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me?</I> Note, The 
 righteous God will not see the meanest and weakest abused; but either 
 they shall be enabled to speak in their own defence or he will some way 
 or other speak for them. If God would not suffer a beast to be wronged, 
 much less a man, a Christian, a child of his own. We cannot <I>open the 
 mouth of the dumb,</I> as God did here, but we may and must <I>open our 
 mouth for the dumb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:8,Job+31:13">Prov. xxxi. 8; Job xxxi. 13</A>.

 The ass's complaint was just: <I>What have I done?</I> Note, When we
 are prompted to smite any with hand or tongue, we should consider what 
 they have done unto us, and what provocation they have given us. We 
 hear it not, but thus the whole creation groans, being burdened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22">Rom. viii. 22</A>.

 It was much that Balaam was not astonished to hear his ass speak, and
 put to confusion: but some think that it was no new thing to him (being 
 a conjurer) to be thus spoken to by his familiars; others rather think 
 that his brutish head-strong passion so blinded him that he could not 
 observe or consider the strangeness of the thing. Nothing besots men 
 worse than unbridled anger. Balaam in his fury <I>wished he had a sword 
 to kill his ass with,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 See his impotency; can he think by his curses to do mischief to Israel 
 that has it not in his power to kill his own ass? This he cannot do, 
 yet he fain would; and what would he get by that, but make himself so 
 much the poorer (as many do), to gratify his passion and revenge? Such 
 was the madness of this false prophet. Here bishop Hall observes, It is 
 ill falling into the hands of those whom the brute-creatures find 
 unmerciful; for <I>a good man regardeth the life of his beast.</I> 

 [2.] The ass reasoned with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 God enabled not only a dumb creature to speak, but a dull creature to 
 speak to the purpose. Three things she argues with him 
 from:--<I>First,</I> His propriety in her: <I>Am not I thy ass?</I> 
 Note, 

 1. God has given to man a dominion over the creatures: they are
 <I>delivered into his hand</I> to be used, and <I>put under his 
 feet</I> to be ruled. 

 2. Even wicked people have a title to the possessions God gives to
 them, which they are not to be wronged of.

 3. The dominion God has given us over the creatures is a good reason
 why we should not abuse them. We are their lords, and therefore must 
 not be tyrants. <I>Secondly,</I> Her serviceableness to him: <I>On
 which thou hast ridden.</I> Note, It is good for us often to consider 
 how useful the inferior creatures are, and have been, to us, that we 
 may be thankful to God, and tender of them. <I>Thirdly,</I> That she 
 was not wont to do so by him, and had never before crushed his foot, 
 nor fallen down under him; he might therefore conclude there was 
 something more than ordinary that made her do so now. Note,

 1. The rare occurrence of an offence should moderate our displeasure
 against an offender. 

 2. When the creatures depart from their wonted obedience to us, we
 should enquire the cause within ourselves, and be humbled for our 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Balaam at length had notice of God's displeasure by the angel, and 
 this did startle him. When God opened his eyes <I>he saw the angel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and then he himself <I>fell flat upon his face,</I> in reverence of 
 that glorious messenger, and in fear of the sword he saw in his hand. 
 God has many ways of breading and bringing down the hard and unhumbled 
 heart.

 (1.) The angel reproved him for his outrageousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore hast thou smitten thy ass?</I> Whether we consider it or
 no, it is certain that God will call us to account for the abuses done 
 to his creatures. Nay, he shows him how much more reason he had to 
 smite upon his breast, and to condemn himself, than to fly out thus 
 against his ass ("<I>Thy way is perverse before me,</I> and then how 
 canst thou expect to prosper?"), and how much wiser his ass was than 
 himself, and how much beholden he was to her that she turned aside; it 
 was for his safety, and not for her own, for had she gone on he had 
 been slain, and she had been saved alive. Note, When our eyes are 
 opened we shall see what danger we are in in a sinful way, and how much 
 it was for our advantage to be crossed in it, and what fools we were to 
 quarrel with our crosses which helped to save our lives.

 (2.) Balaam then seemed to relent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 "<I>I have sinned,</I> sinned in undertaking this journey, sinned in 
 pushing on so violently;" but he excused it with this, that he saw not 
 the angel; yet, now that he did see him, he was willing to go back 
 again. That which was displeasing to God was not so much his going as 
 his going with a malicious design against Israel, and a secret hope 
 that notwithstanding the proviso with which his permission was clogged 
 he might prevail to curse them, and so gratify Balak, and get 
 preferment under him. It does not appear that he was sensible of this 
 wickedness of his heart, or willing to own it, but, when he finds he 
 cannot go forward, he will be content (since there is no remedy) to go 
 back. Here is no sign that his heart is turned, but, if his hands are 
 tied, he cannot help it. Thus many leave their sins only because their 
 sins have left them. There seems to be a reformation of the life, but 
 what will this avail if there be no renovation of the heart?

 (3.) The angel however continued his permission: "<I>Go with the
 men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Go, if thou hast a mind to be made a fool of, and to be shamed before 
 Balak, and all the princes of Moab. <I>Go, only the word that I shall 
 speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak,</I> whether thou wilt or no," 
 for this seems not to be a precept, but a prediction of the event, that 
 he should not only not be able to curse Israel, but should be forced to 
 bless them, which would be more for the glory of God and his own 
 confusion than if he had turned back. Thus God gave him fair warning, 
 but he would not take it; he <I>went with the princes of Balak.</I> For 
 the iniquity of Balaam's covetousness God was wroth, and smote him, but 
 he <I>went on frowardly,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to
 meet him unto a city of Moab, which <I>is</I> in the border of Arnon,
 which <I>is</I> in the utmost coast.
 &nbsp; 37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto
 thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not
 able indeed to promote thee to honour?
 &nbsp; 38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
 now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth
 in my mouth, that shall I speak.
 &nbsp; 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto
 Kirjath-huzoth.
 &nbsp; 40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
 the princes that <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam,
 and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
 might see the utmost <I>part</I> of the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the meeting between Balak and Balaam, confederate enemies 
 to God's Israel; but here they seem to differ in their expectations of 
 the success. 

 1. Balak speaks of it with confidence, not doubting but to gain his
 point now that Balaam had come. In expectation of this, he went out to 
 meet him, even to the utmost border of his country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 partly to gratify his own impatient desire to see one he had such great 
 expectations from, and partly to do honour to Balaam, and so to engage 
 him with his utmost power to serve him. See what respect heathen 
 princes paid to those that had but the name and face of prophets, and 
 pretended to have any interest in heaven; and how welcome one was that 
 came with his mouth full of curses. What a shame is it then that the 
 ambassadors of Christ are so little respected by most, so much despised 
 by some, and that those are so coldly entertained who bring tidings of 
 peace and a blessing! Balak has now nothing to complain of but that 
 Balaam did not come sooner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 And he thinks that he should have considered the importunity Balak had 
 used, <I>Did I not earnestly send to thee?</I> (and the importunity of 
 people inferior to kings has prevailed with many against their 
 inclinations), and that he should also have considered Balak's 
 intentions concerning him: <I>Am not I able to promote thee to 
 honour?</I> Balak, as king, was in his own kingdom the fountain of 
 honour, and Balaam should have his choice of all the preferments that 
 were in his gift; he therefore thinks himself affronted by Balaam's 
 delays, which looked as if he thought the honours he prepared not 
 worthy his acceptance. Note, Promotion to honour is a very tempting 
 bait to many people; and it were well if we would be drawn into the 
 service of God by the honour he sets before us. Why do we delay to come 
 unto him? Is <I>not he able to promote us to honour?</I> 

 2. Balaam speaks doubtfully of the issue, and bids Balak not depend to
 much upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 "<I>Have I now any power at all to say any thing?</I> I have come, but 
 what the nearer am I? Gladly would I curse Israel; but I must not, I 
 cannot, God will not suffer me." He seems to speak with vexation at the 
 hook in his nose and the bridle in his jaws, such as Sennacherib was 
 tied up with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:29">Isa. xxxvii. 29</A>.

 3. They address themselves with all speed to the business. Balaam is
 nobly entertained over night, a sacrifice of thanksgiving is offered to 
 the gods of Moab, for the safe arrival of this welcome guest, and his 
 is treated with a feast upon the sacrifice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 And the next morning, that no time might be lost, Balak takes Balaam in 
 his chariot to the high places of his kingdom, not only because their 
 holiness (such as it was), he thought, might give some advantage to his 
 divinations, but their height might give him a convenient prospect of 
 the camp of Israel, which was to be the butt or mark at which he must 
 shoot his envenomed arrows. And now Balaam is really as solicitous to 
 please Balak as ever he had pretended to be to please God. See what 
 need we have to pray every day, <I>Our Father in heaven, lead us not 
 into temptation.</I></P>
