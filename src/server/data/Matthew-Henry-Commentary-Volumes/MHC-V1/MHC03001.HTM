 This book begins with the laws concerning sacrifices, of which the most 
 ancient were the burnt-offerings, about which God gives Moses 
 instructions in this chapter. Orders are here given how that sort of 
 sacrifice must be managed. 
 
 I. If it was a bullock out of the herd,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:3-9">ver.  3-9</A>.

 II. If it was a sheep or goat, a lamb or kid, out of the flock,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 III. If it was a turtle-dove or a young pigeon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.

 And whether the offering was more or less valuable in itself, if it was
 offered with an upright heart, according to these laws, it was accepted 
 of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
 tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
 man of you bring an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye shall bring your
 offering of the cattle, <I>even</I> of the herd, and of the flock.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. It is taken for granted that people would be inclined to bring 
 offerings to the Lord. The very light of nature directs man, some way 
 or other, to do honour to his Maker, and pay him homage as his Lord. 
 Revealed religion supposes natural religion to be an ancient and early 
 institution, since the fall had directed men to glorify God by 
 sacrifice, which was an implicit acknowledgment of their having 
 received all from God as creatures, and their having forfeited all to 
 him as sinners. A conscience thoroughly convinced of dependence and 
 guilt would be willing to come before God with <I>thousands of 
 rams,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7">Mic. vi. 6, 7</A>.

 2. Provision is made that men should not indulge their own fancies, nor 
 become vain in their imaginations and inventions about their 
 sacrifices, lest, while they pretended to honour God, they should 
 really dishonour him, and do that which was unworthy of him.  Every 
 thing therefore is directed to be done with due decorum, by a certain 
 rule, and so as that the sacrifices might be most significant both of 
 the great sacrifice of atonement which Christ was to offer in the 
 fulness of time and of the spiritual sacrifices of acknowledgment which 
 believers should offer daily. 

 3. God gave those laws to Israel by Moses; nothing is more frequently 
 repeated than this, <I>The Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak unto 
 the children of Israel.</I> God could have spoken it to the children of 
 Israel himself, as he did the ten commandments; but he chose to deliver 
 it to them by Moses, because they had desired he would no more speak to 
 them himself, and he had designed that Moses should, above all the 
 prophets, be a type of Christ, by whom God would in these last days 
 speak to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>.

 By other prophets God sent messages to his people, but by Moses he gave
 them laws; and therefore he was fit to typify him to whom the Father 
 has given all judgment. And, besides, the treasure of divine revelation 
 was always to be put into earthen vessels, that our faith might be 
 tried, and that the excellency of the power might be of God.

 4. God spoke to him out of the tabernacle. As soon as ever the 
 shechinah had taken possession of its new habitation, in token of the 
 acceptance of what was done, God talked with Moses from the mercy-seat, 
 while he attended without the veil, or rather at the door, hearing a 
 voice only; and it is probable that he wrote what he heard at that 
 time, to prevent any mistake, or a slip of memory, in the rehearsal of 
 it. The tabernacle was set up to be a place of communion between God 
 and Israel; there, where they performed their services to God, God 
 revealed his will to them. Thus, by the word and by prayer, we now have 
 fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:4">Acts vi. 4</A>.

 When we speak to God we must desire to hear from him, and reckon it a
 great favour that he is pleased to speak to us. The Lord called to 
 Moses, not to come near (under that dispensation, even Moses must keep 
 his distance), but to attend and hearken to what should be said. A 
 letter less than ordinary in the Hebrew word for <I>called,</I> the 
 Jewish critics tell us, intimates that God spoke in a still small 
 voice. The moral law was given with terror from a burning mountain in 
 thunder and lightning; but the remedial law of sacrifice was given more 
 gently from a mercy-seat, because that was typical of the grace of the 
 gospel, which is the ministration of life and peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If a man were rich and could afford it, it is supposed that he would 
 bring his burnt-sacrifice, with which he designed to honour God, out of 
 his herd of larger cattle. He that considers that God is the best that 
 is will resolve to give him the best he has, else he gives him not the 
 glory due unto his name. Now if a man determined to kill a bullock, not 
 for an entertainment for his family and friends, but for a sacrifice to 
 his God, these rules must be religiously observed:--

 1. The beast to be offered must be a male, and without blemish, and the 
 best he had in his pasture. Being designed purely for the honour of him 
 that is infinitely perfect, it ought to be the most perfect in its 
 kind. This signified the complete strength and purity that were in 
 Christ the dying sacrifice, and the sincerity of heart and 
 unblamableness of life that should be in Christians, who are presented 
 to God as living sacrifices.  But, literally, in Christ Jesus there is 
 neither male nor female; nor is any natural blemish in the body a bar 
 to our acceptance with God, but only the moral defects and deformities 
 introduced by sin into the soul. 

 2. The owner must offer it voluntarily. What is done in religion, so as 
 to please God, must be done by no other constraint than that of love.  
 God accepts the willing people and the cheerful giver. Ainsworth and 
 others read it, not as the principle, but as the end of offering: "Let 
 him offer it <I>for his favourable acceptation before the Lord.</I> Let 
 him propose this to himself as his end in bringing his sacrifice, and 
 let his eye be fixed steadily upon that end--that he may be accepted of 
 the Lord." Those only shall find acceptance who sincerely desire and 
 design it in all their religious services, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>.

 3. It must be offered at the door of the tabernacle, where the brazen 
 altar of burnt-offerings stood, which sanctified the gift, and not 
 elsewhere. He must offer it at the door, as one unworthy to enter, and 
 acknowledging that there is no admission for a sinner into covenant and 
 communion with God, but by sacrifice; but he must offer it at the 
 tabernacle of the congregation, in token of his communion with the 
 whole church of Israel even in this personal service. 

 4. The offerer must put his hand upon the head of his offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "He must put both his hands," say the Jewish doctors, "with all his
 might, between the horns of the beast," signifying thereby,

 (1.) The transfer of all his right to, and interest in, the beast, to 
 God, actually, and by a manual delivery, resigning it to his service. 
 
 (2.) An acknowledgment that he deserved to die, and would have been
 willing to die if God had required it, for the serving of his honour, 
 and the obtaining of his favour. 

 (3.) A dependence upon the sacrifice, as an instituted type of the 
 great sacrifice on which the iniquity of us all was to be laid. The 
 mystical signification of the sacrifices, and especially this rite, 
 some think the apostle means by the doctrine of <I>laying on of 
 hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:2">Heb. vi. 2</A>),

 which typified evangelical faith. The offerer's putting his hand on the
 head of the offering was to signify his desire and hope that it might 
 <I>be accepted from him to make atonement for him.</I> Though the 
 burnt-offerings had not respect to any particular sin, as the 
 sin-offering had, yet they were to make atonement for sin in general; 
 and he that laid his hand on the head of a burnt-offering was to 
 confess that <I>he had left undone what he ought to have done and had 
 done that which he ought not to have done,</I> and to pray that, though 
 he deserved to die himself, the death of his sacrifice might be 
 accepted for the expiating of his guilt.

 5. The sacrifice was to be killed by the priests of Levites, before the
 Lord, that is, in a devout religious manner, and with an eye to God and 
 his honour. This signified that our Lord Jesus was to make his soul, or 
 life, an offering for sin. Messiah the prince must be cut off as a 
 sacrifice, <I>but not for himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 It signified also that in Christians, who are living sacrifices, the
 brutal part must be mortified or killed, the flesh crucified with its 
 corrupt affections and lusts and all the appetites of the mere animal 
 life.

 6.  The priests were to <I>sprinkle the blood upon the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 for, the blood being the life, it was this that made atonement for the 
 soul.  This signified the direct and actual regard which our Lord Jesus 
 had to the satisfaction of his Father's justice, and the securing of 
 his injured honour, in the shedding of his blood; <I>he offered himself 
 without spot to God.</I> It also signified the pacifying and purifying 
 of our consciences by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ upon 
 them by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2,Heb+10:22">1 Pet. i. 2; Heb. x. 22</A>.

 7. The beast was to be flayed and decently cut up, and divided into its 
 several joints or pieces, according to the art of the butcher; and then 
 all the pieces, with the head and the fat (the legs and inwards being 
 first washed), were to be burnt together upon the altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>.
 
 "<I>But to what purpose,</I>" would some say, "<I>was this waste?</I> 
 Why should all this good meat, which might have been given to the poor, 
 and have served their hungry families for food a great while, be burnt 
 together to ashes?" So was the will of God; and it is not for us to 
 object or to find fault with it. When it was burnt for the honour of 
 God, in obedience to his command, and to signify spiritual blessings, 
 it was really better bestowed, and better answered the end of its 
 creation, than when it was used as food for man. We must never reckon 
 that lost which is laid out for God. The burning of the sacrifice 
 signified the sharp sufferings of Christ, and the devout affections 
 with which, as a holy fire, Christians must offer up themselves their 
 whole spirit, soul, and body, unto God. 

 8. This is said to be <I>an offering of a sweet savour,</I> or 
 <I>savour of rest, unto the Lord.</I> The burning of flesh is unsavoury 
 in itself; but this, as an act of obedience to a divine command, and a 
 type of Christ, was well pleasing to God: he was reconciled to the 
 offerer, and did himself take a complacency in that reconciliation. He 
 rested, and was refreshed with these institutions of his grace, as, at 
 first, with his works of creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:17">Exod. xxxi. 17</A>),

 rejoicing therein,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:31">Ps. civ. 31</A>.

 Christ's offering of himself to God is said to be of <I>a 
 sweet-smelling savour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:2">Eph. v. 2</A>),

 and the spiritual sacrifices of Christians are said to be <I>acceptable
 to God, through Christ,</I>

 Here we have the laws concerning the burnt-offerings, which were of the 
 flock or of the fowls. Those of the middle rank, that could not well 
 afford to offer a bullock, would bring a sheep or a goat; and those 
 that were not able to do that should be accepted of God if they brought 
 a turtle-dove or a pigeon. For God, in his law and in his gospel, as 
 well as in his providence, considers the poor. It is observable that 
 those creatures were chosen for sacrifice which were most mild and 
 gentle, harmless and inoffensive, to typify the innocence and meekness 
 that were in Christ, and to teach the innocence and meekness that 
 should be in Christians. Directions are here given, 

 1. Concerning the burnt-offerings of the flock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:10">v. 10</A>.

 The method of managing these is much the same with that of the 
 bullocks; only it is ordered here that the sacrifice should be killed 
 <I>on the side of the altar northward,</I> which, though mentioned here 
 only, was probably to be observed concerning the former, and other 
 sacrifices.  Perhaps on that side of the altar there was the largest 
 vacant space, and room for the priests to turn them in. It was of old 
 observed that <I>fair weather comes out of the north,</I> and that 
 <I>the north wind drives away rain;</I> and by these sacrifices the 
 storms of God's wrath are scattered, and the light of God's countenance 
 is obtained, which is more pleasant than the brightest fairest weather.

 2. Concerning those of the fowls. They must be either turtle-doves 
 (and, if so, "they must be <I>old</I> turtles," say the Jews), or 
 <I>pigeons,</I> and, if so, they must be <I>young</I> pigeons. What was 
 most acceptable at men's tables must be brought to God's altar. In the 
 offering of these fowls,

 (1.) The head must be wrung off, "quite off," say some; others think
 only pinched, so as to kill the bird, and yet leave the head hanging to
 the body. But it seems more likely that it was to be quite separated,
 for it was to be burnt first.

 (2.) The blood was to be <I>wrung out at the side of the altar.</I>

 (3.) The garbages with the feathers were to be thrown by upon the
 dunghill. 

 (4.) The body was to be opened, sprinkled with salt, and then burnt
 upon the altar. "This sacrifice of birds," the Jews say, "was one of 
 the most difficult services the priests had to do," to teach those that 
 minister in holy things to be as solicitous for the salvation of the 
 poor as for that of the rich, and that the services of the poor are as 
 acceptable to God, if they come from an upright heart, as the services 
 of the rich, for he accepts <I>according to what a man hath,</I> and 
 not <I>according to what he hath not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:12">2 Cor. viii. 12</A>.

 The poor man's turtle-doves, or young pigeons, are here said to be
 <I>an offering of a sweet-smelling savour,</I> as much as that of an ox 
 or bullock that hath horns or hoofs. Yet, after all, to <I>love God 
 with all our heart, and to love our neighbour as ourselves, is better 
 than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:33">Mark xii. 33</A>.</P>
