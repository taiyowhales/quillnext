 It is a memorable and very melancholy story which is related in this
 and the following chapter, of the turning back of Israel from the
 borders of Canaan, when they were just ready to set foot in it, and the
 sentencing of them to wander and perish in the wilderness for their
 unbelief and murmuring. It is referred to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7-11">Ps. xcv. 7</A>,

 &c., and improved for warning to Christians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:7-19">Heb. iii. 7</A>,

 &c. In this chapter we have,

 I.  The sending of twelve spies before them into Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. The instructions given to these spies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 III. Their executing their commission according to their instructions,
 and their return from the search, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:21-25">ver. 21-25</A>.

 IV. The report they brought back to the camp of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:26-33">ver. 26</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
 I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
 fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moses by the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent them from the
 wilderness of Paran: all those men <I>were</I> heads of the children
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 And these <I>were</I> their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
 the son of Zaccur.
 &nbsp; 5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
 &nbsp; 6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
 &nbsp; 7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
 &nbsp; 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
 &nbsp; 9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
 &nbsp; 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
 &nbsp; 11 Of the tribe of Joseph, <I>namely,</I> of the tribe of Manasseh,
 Gaddi the son of Susi.
 &nbsp; 12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
 &nbsp; 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
 &nbsp; 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
 &nbsp; 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
 &nbsp; 16 These <I>are</I> the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out
 the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
 &nbsp; 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
 unto them, Get you up this <I>way</I> southward, and go up into the
 mountain:
 &nbsp; 18 And see the land, what it <I>is;</I> and the people that dwelleth
 therein, whether they <I>be</I> strong or weak, few or many;
 &nbsp; 19 And what the land <I>is</I> that they dwell in, whether it <I>be</I>
 good or bad; and what cities <I>they be</I> that they dwell in,
 whether in tents, or in strong holds;
 &nbsp; 20 And what the land <I>is,</I> whether it <I>be</I> fat or lean, whether
 there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and
 bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time <I>was</I> the time of
 the firstripe grapes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. Orders given to send spies to search out the land of Canaan. It is 
 here said, God directed Moses to send them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),

 but it appears by the repetition of the story afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:22">Deut. i. 22</A>)

 that the motion came originally from the people; they came to Moses,
 and said, <I>We will send men before us;</I> and it was the fruit of 
 their unbelief. They would not take God's word that it was a good land, 
 and that he would, without fail, put them in possession of it. They 
 could not trust the pillar of cloud and fire to show them the way to 
 it, but had a better opinion of their own politics than of God's 
 wisdom. How absurd was it for them to send to spy out a land which God 
 himself had spied out for them, to enquire the way into it when God 
 himself had undertaken to show them the way! But thus we ruin ourselves 
 by giving more credit to the reports and representations of sense than 
 to divine revelation; we walk by sight, not by faith; whereas, <I>if 
 we</I> will <I>receive the witness of men,</I> without doubt <I>the 
 witness of God is greater.</I> The people making this motion to Moses, 
 he (perhaps not aware of the unbelief at the bottom of it) consulted 
 God in the case, who bade him gratify the people in this matter, and 
 send spies before them: "Let them walk in their own counsels." Yet God 
 was no way accessory to the sin that followed, for the sending of these 
 spies was so far from being the cause of the sin that if the spies had 
 done their duty, and the people theirs, it might have been the 
 confirmation of their faith, and of good service to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons nominated that were to be employed in this service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:4-15"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 &c.), one of each tribe, that it might appear to be the act of the
 people in general; and rulers, person of figure in their respective 
 tribes, some of the rulers of thousands or hundreds, to put the greater 
 credit upon their embassy. This was designed for the best, but it 
 proved to have this ill effect that the quality of the persons 
 occasioned the evil report they brought up to be the more credited and 
 the people to be the more influenced by it. Some think that they are 
 all named for the sake of two good ones that were among them, Caleb and 
 Joshua. Notice is taken of the change of Joshua's name upon this 
 occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He was Moses's minister, but had been employed, though of the tribe of 
 Ephraim, as general of the forces that were sent out against Amalek. 
 The name by which he was generally called and known in his own tribe 
 was <I>Oshea,</I> but Moses called him <I>Joshua,</I> in token of his 
 affection to him and power over him; and now, it should seem, he 
 ordered others to call him so, and fixed that to be his name 
 henceforward. <I>Oshea</I> signifies a prayer for salvation, <I>Save 
 thou; Joshua</I> signifies a promise of salvation, <I>He will save,</I> 
 in answer to that prayer: so near is the relation between prayers and 
 promises. Prayers prevail for promises, and promises direct and 
 encourage prayers. Some think that Moses designed, by taking the first 
 syllable of the name Jehovah and prefixing it to his name, which turned 
 <I>Hoshea</I> into <I>Jehoshua,</I> to put an honour upon him, and to 
 encourage him in this and all his future services with the assurances 
 of God's presence. Yet after this he is called <I>Hoshea,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:44">Deut. xxxii. 44</A>.

 <I>Jesus</I> is the same name with <I>Joshua,</I> and it is the name of
 our Lord Christ, of whom Joshua was a type as successor to Moses, 
 Israel's captain, and conqueror of Canaan. There was another of the 
 same name, who was also a type of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11">Zech. vi. 11</A>.

 Joshua was the saviour of God's people from the powers of Canaan, but
 Christ is their Saviour from the powers of hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The instructions given to those spies. They were sent into the 
 land of Canaan the nearest way, to traverse the country, and to take 
 account of its present state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Two heads of enquiry were given them in charge, 

 1. Concerning the land itself: <I>See what that is</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 see whether it be <I>good or bad,</I> and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 <I>whether it be fat or lean.</I> All parts of the earth do not share 
 alike in the blessing of fruitfulness; some countries are blessed with 
 a richer soil than others. Moses himself was well satisfied that Canaan 
 was a very good land, but he sent these spies to bring an account of it 
 for the satisfaction of the people; as John Baptist sent to Jesus, to 
 ask whether he was the Christ, not to inform himself, but to inform 
 those he sent. They must take notice whether the air was healthful or 
 no, what the soil was, and what the productions; and, for the better 
 satisfaction of the people, they must bring with them some of the 
 fruits. 

 2. Concerning the inhabitants--their number, few or many--their size
 and stature, whether strong able-bodied men or weak,--their 
 habitations, whether they lived in tents or houses, whether in open 
 villages or in walled towns,--whether the woods were standing as in 
 those countries that are uncultivated, through the unskillfulness and 
 slothfulness of the inhabitants, or whether the woods were cut down, 
 and the country made champaign, for the convenience of tillage.  These 
 were the things they were to enquire about. Perhaps there had not been 
 of late years such commerce between Egypt and Canaan as there was in 
 Jacob's time, else they might have informed themselves of these things 
 without sending men on purpose to search. See the advantage we may 
 derive from books and learning, which acquaint those that are curious 
 and inquisitive with the state of foreign countries, at a much greater 
 distance than Canaan was now from Israel, without this trouble and 
 expense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Moses dismisses the spies with this charge, <I>Be of good 
 courage,</I> intimating, not only that they should be themselves 
 encouraged against the difficulties of this expedition, but that they 
 should bring an encouraging account to the people and make the best of 
 every thing. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, 
 which required good management and resolution, but it was a great trust 
 that was reposed in them, which required that they should be 
 faithful.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness
 of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
 &nbsp; 22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
 Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, <I>were.</I> (Now
 Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
 &nbsp; 23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
 thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
 between two upon a staff; and <I>they brought</I> of the pomegranates,
 and of the figs.
 &nbsp; 24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the
 cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from
 thence.
 &nbsp; 25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty
 days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the survey which the spies made of the 
 promised land. 

 1. They went quite through it, from Zin in the south, to Rehob, near
 Hamath, in the north,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:3,8"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 3, 8</A>.

 It is probable that they did not go altogether in a body, lest they
 should be suspected and taken up, which there would be the more danger 
 of if the Canaanites knew (and one would think they could not but know) 
 how near the Israelites were to them; but they divided themselves into 
 several companies, and so passed unsuspected, as way-faring men.

 2. They took particular notice of Hebron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 probably because near there was the field of Machpelah, where the 
 patriarchs were buried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:2">Gen. xxiii. 2</A>),

 whose dead bodies did, as it were, keep possession of that land for
 their posterity. To this sepulchre they made a particular visit, and 
 found the adjoining city in the possession of the sons of Anak, who are 
 here named. In that place where they expected the greatest 
 encouragements they met with the greatest discouragements. Where the 
 bodies of their ancestors kept possession for them the giants kept 
 possession against them. <I>They ascended by the south, and came to 
 Hebron,</I> that is, "Caleb," say the Jews, "in particular," for to his 
 being there we find express reference, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:9,12,13">Josh. xiv. 9, 12, 13</A>.

 But that others of the spies were there too appears by their
 description of the Anakim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 3. They brought a bunch of grapes with them, and some other of the 
 fruits of the land, as a proof of the extraordinary goodness of the 
 country. Probably they furnished themselves with these fruits when they 
 were leaving the country and returning. The cluster of grapes was so 
 large and so heavy that they hung it upon a bar, and carried it between 
 two of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:23,24"><I>v.</I>  23, 24</A>.

 The place whence they took it was, from this circumstance, called the 
 <I>valley of the cluster,</I> that famous cluster which was to Israel 
 both the earnest and the specimen of all the fruits of Canaan. Such are 
 the present comforts which we have in communion with God, foretastes of 
 the fulness of joy we expect in the heavenly Canaan.  We may see by 
 them what heaven is.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all
 the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness
 of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
 all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
 &nbsp; 27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
 thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and
 this <I>is</I> the fruit of it.
 &nbsp; 28 Nevertheless the people <I>be</I> strong that dwell in the land,
 and the cities <I>are</I> walled, <I>and</I> very great: and moreover we
 saw the children of Anak there.
 &nbsp; 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
 Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
 mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast
 of Jordan.
 &nbsp; 30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us
 go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
 it.
 &nbsp; 31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
 up against the people; for they <I>are</I> stronger than we.
 &nbsp; 32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they
 had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
 through which we have gone to search it, <I>is</I> a land that eateth
 up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it
 <I>are</I> men of a great stature.
 &nbsp; 33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, <I>which come</I>
 of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
 so we were in their sight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a wonder how the people of Israel had patience to stay forty days 
 for the return of their spies, when they were just ready to enter 
 Canaan, under all the assurances of success they could have from the 
 divine power, and a constant series of miracles that had hitherto 
 attended them; but they distrusted God's power and promise, and were 
 willing to be held in suspense by their own counsels, rather than be 
 brought to a certainty by God's covenant. How much do we stand in our 
 own light by our unbelief!  Well, at length the messengers return, but 
 they agree not in their report.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The major part discourage the people from going forward to Canaan; 
 and justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting so 
 much confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God 
 to trust to. It is a righteous thing with God to give those up to 
 strong delusions who will not receive his truth in the love of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe their report. 

 (1.) They could not deny but that the land of Canaan was a very
 fruitful land; the bunch of grapes they brought with them was an ocular 
 demonstration of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 God had promised them a land flowing with milk and honey, and the evil 
 spies themselves own that it is such a land. Thus even out of the mouth 
 of adversaries will God be glorified and the truth of his promise 
 attested. And yet afterwards they contradict themselves, when they say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>It is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof;</I> as if, 
 though it had milk, and honey, and grapes, yet it wanted other 
 necessary provision; some think that there was a great plague in the 
 country at the time they surveyed it, which they ought to have imputed 
 to the wisdom of the divine Providence, which thus lessened the numbers 
 of their enemies, to facilitate their conquests; but they invidiously 
 imputed it to the unwholesomeness of the air, and thence took occasion 
 to disparage the country. For this unreasonable fear of a plague in 
 Canaan, they were justly cut off immediately by a <I>plague in the 
 wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:37"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 37</A>.

 But,

 (2.) They represented the conquest of it as altogether impracticable,
 and that it was to no purpose to attempt it. The people are strong 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 men of a <I>great stature</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>stronger than we,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:31"><I>v.</I>  31</A>.

 The cities are represented as impregnable fortresses: they <I>are 
 walled</I> and <I>very great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 But nothing served their ill purpose more than a description of the 
 giants, on whom they lay a great stress: <I>We saw the children of Anak 
 there</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>),

 and again, we <I>saw the giants,</I> those men of a prodigious size, 
 the <I>sons of Anak,</I> who <I>come of the giants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They spoke as if they were ready to tremble at the mention of them, as 
 they had done at the sight of them. "O these tremendous giants! when we 
 were near them, <I>we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,</I> not 
 only little and weak, but trembling and daunted." Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:20">Job xxxix. 20</A>,

 <I>Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?</I> "Nay, and <I>so we
 were in their sight;</I> they looked upon us with as much scorn and 
 disdain as we did upon them with fear and trembling." So that upon the 
 whole matter they gave it in as their judgment, <I>We are not able to 
 go up against them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and therefore must think of taking some other course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now, even if they had been to judge only by human probabilities, 
 they could not have been excused from the imputation of cowardice. Were 
 not the hosts of Israel very numerous? 600,000 effective men, well 
 marshalled and modelled, closely embodied, and entirely united in 
 interest and affection, constituted as formidable an army as perhaps 
 was ever brought into the field; many a less has done more than perhaps 
 the conquering of Canaan was, witness Alexander's army. Moses, their 
 commander-in-chief, was wise and brave; and if the people had put on 
 resolution, and behaved themselves valiantly, what could have stood 
 before them? It is true the Canaanites were strong, but they were 
 dispersed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Some dwell in the south and others in the mountains;</I> so that by 
 reason of their distance they could not soon get together, and by 
 reason of their divided interests they could not long keep together, to 
 oppose Israel. The country being plentiful would subsist an army, and, 
 though the cities were walled, if they could beat them in the field the 
 strong-holds would fall of course into their hands. And, lastly, as for 
 the giants, their overgrown stature would but make them the better 
 mark, and the bulkiest men have not always the best mettle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. But, though they deserved to be posted for cowards, this was not the 
 worst, the scripture brands them for unbelievers. It was not any human 
 probabilities they were required to depend upon, but, 

 (1.) They had the manifest and sensible tokens of God's presence with
 them, and the engagement of his power for them. The Canaanites were 
 stronger than Israel; suppose they were, but were they stronger than 
 the God of Israel? We are not able to deal with them, but is not God 
 Almighty able? Have we not him in the midst of us? Does not he go 
 before us? And is any thing too hard for him? Were we as grasshoppers 
 before the giants, and are not they less than grasshoppers before God? 
 Their cities are walled against us, but can they be walled against 
 heaven?  Besides this,

 (2.) They had had very great experience of the length and strength of
 God's arm, lifted up and made bare on their behalf. Were not the 
 Egyptians as much stronger than they as the Canaanites were?  And yet, 
 without a sword drawn by Israel or a stroke struck, the chariots and 
 horsemen of Egypt were quite routed and ruined; the Amalekites took 
 them at great disadvantages, and yet they were discomfited. Miracles 
 were at this time their daily bread; were there nothing else, an army 
 so well victualled as theirs was, so constantly, so plentifully, and 
 all on free cost, would have a might advantage against any other force. 
 Nay,

 (3.) They had particular promises made them of victory and success in
 their wars against the Canaanites. God had given Abraham all possible 
 assurances that he would put his seed into possession of that land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18,17:8">Gen. xv. 18; xvii. 8</A>.

 He had expressly promised them by Moses that he would <I>drive out the
 Canaanites</I> from <I>before them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:2">Exod. xxxiii. 2</A>),

 and that he would do it <I>by little and little,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:30">Exod. xxiii. 30</A>.

 And, after all this, for them to say, <I>We are not able to go up
 against them,</I> was in effect to say, "God himself is not able to 
 make his words good." It was in effect to give him the lie, and to tell 
 him he had undertaken more than he could perform. We have a short 
 account of their sin, with which they infected the whole congregation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:24">Ps. cvi. 24</A>.

 They <I>despised the land, they believed not his word.</I> Though, upon
 search, they had found it as good as he had said, <I>a land flowing 
 with milk and honey,</I> yet they would not believe it as sure as he 
 had said, but despaired of having it, though eternal truth itself had 
 engaged it to them. And now this is the representation of the evil 
 spies.</P>

 II. Caleb encouraged them to go forward, though he was seconded by 
 Joshua only 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Caleb stilled the people,</I> whom he saw already put into a ferment 
 even <I>before Moses</I> himself, whose shining face could not daunt 
 them, when they began to grow unruly.  <I>Caleb</I> signifies <I>all 
 heart,</I> and he answered his name, was hearty himself, and would have 
 made the people so if they would have hearkened to him. If Joshua had 
 begun to stem the tide, he would have been suspected of partiality to 
 Moses, whose minister he was; and therefore he prudently left it to 
 Caleb's management at first, who was of the tribe of Judah, the leading 
 tribe, and therefore the fittest to be heard. Caleb had seen and 
 observed the strength of the inhabitants as much as his fellows, and 
 upon the whole matter, 

 1. He speaks very confidently of success: <I>We are well able to
 overcome them,</I> as strong as they are. 

 2. He animates the people to go on, and, his lot lying in the van, he
 speaks as one resolved to lead them on with bravery: "<I>Let us go up 
 at once,</I> one bold step, one bold stroke more, will do our business; 
 it is all our own if we have but courage to make it so: <I>Let us go up 
 and possess it.</I>" He does not say, "Let us go up and conquer it;" he 
 looks upon that to be as good as done already; but, "Let us go up and 
 possess it; there is nothing to be done but to enter, and take the 
 possession which God our great Lord is ready to give us." Note, <I>The 
 righteous are bold as a lion.</I> Difficulties that lie in the way of 
 salvation dwindle and vanish before a lively active faith in the power 
 and promise of God.  <I>All things are possible,</I> if they be but 
 promised, <I>to him that believes.</I></P>
