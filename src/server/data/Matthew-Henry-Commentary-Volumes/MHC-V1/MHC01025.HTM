 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then again Abraham took a wife, 
 and her name <I>was</I> Keturah.
 &nbsp; 2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, 
 and Medan, and Midian, and 
 Ishbak, and Shuah.
 &nbsp; 3 And Jokshan 
 begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the 
 sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and 
 Letushim, and Leummim.
 &nbsp; 4 And the 
 sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, 
 and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. 
 All these <I>were</I> the children of 
 Keturah.
 &nbsp; 5 And Abraham gave all 
 that he had unto Isaac.
 &nbsp; 6 But unto 
 the sons of the concubines, which 
 Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and 
 sent them away from Isaac his son, 
 while he yet lived, eastward, unto the 
 east country.
 &nbsp; 7 And these <I>are</I> the 
 days of the years of Abraham's life 
 which he lived, an hundred threescore 
 and fifteen years.
 &nbsp; 8 Then Abraham 
 gave up the ghost, and died in a good 
 old age, an old man, and full <I>of years</I>; 
 and was gathered to his people.
 &nbsp; 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried 
 him in the cave of Machpelah, in the 
 field of Ephron the son of Zohar the 
 Hittite, which <I>is</I> before Mamre;
 &nbsp; 10 The field which Abraham purchased 
 of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham 
 buried, and Sarah his wife.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abraham lived, after the marriage of Isaac, 
 thirty-five years, and all that is recorded concerning 
 him during the time lies here in a 
 very few verses. We hear no more of God's 
 extraordinary appearances to him or trials of 
 him; for all the days, even of the best and 
 greatest saints, are not eminent days, some 
 slide on silently, and neither come nor go 
 with observation; such were these last days 
 of Abraham. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An account of his children by Keturah, 
 another wife whom he married after the death 
 of Sarah. He had buried Sarah and married 
 Isaac, the two dear companions of his life, 
 and was now solitary. He wanted a nurse, 
 his family wanted a governess, and it was not 
 good for him to be thus alone. He therefore 
 marries Keturah, probably the chief of his 
 maid-servants, born in his house or bought 
 with money. Marriage is not forbidden to 
 old age. By her he had six sons, in whom 
 
 <A NAME="Page153"> </A>

 the promise made to Abraham concerning 
 the great increase of his posterity was in part 
 fulfilled, which, it is likely, he had an eye to 
 this marriage. The strength he received 
 by the promise still remained in him, to show 
 how much the virtue of the promise exceeds 
 the power of nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The disposition which Abraham made 
 of his estate,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 After the birth of these 
 sons, he set his house in order, with prudence 
 and justice. 
 
 1. He made Isaac his heir, as 
 he was bound to do, in justice to Sarah his 
 first and principal wife, and to Rebekah who 
 married Isaac upon the assurance of it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:36"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 36</A>.
 In this <I>all,</I> which he settled upon 
 Isaac, are perhaps included the promise of 
 the land of Canaan, and the entail of the covenant. 
 Or, God having already made him 
 the heir of the promise, Abraham therefore 
 made him heir of his estate. Our affection 
 and gifts should attend God's. 
 
 2. He gave 
 portions to the rest of his children, both to 
 Ishmael, though at first he was sent empty 
 away, and to his sons by Keturah. It was 
 justice to provide for them; parents that do 
 not imitate him in this are worse than infidels. 
 It was prudence to settle them in places distant 
 from Isaac, that they might not pretend 
 to divide the inheritance with him, nor be in 
 any way a care or expense to him. Observe, 
 He did this <I>while he yet lived,</I> lest it should 
 not be done, or not so well done, afterwards. 
 Note, In many cases it is wisdom for men to 
 make their own hands their executors, and 
 what they find to do to do it while they live, 
 as far as they can. These <I>sons of the concubines</I> 
 were sent into the country that lay east 
 from Canaan, and their posterity were called 
 <I>the children of the east,</I> famous for their 
 numbers, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:5,33">Judg. vi. 5, 33</A>.
 Their great increase
 was the fruit of the promise made to
 Abraham, that God would multiply his seed.
 God, in dispensing his blessings, does as
 Abraham did; common blessings he gives to
 the children of this world, as to the sons of
 the bond-woman, but covenant-blessings he
 reserves for the heirs of promise. All that
 he has is theirs, for they are his Isaacs, from
 whom the rest shall be for ever separated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The age and death of Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 He lived 175 years, just 100 years after he
 came to Canaan; so long he was a sojourner
 in a strange country. Though he lived long 
 and lived well, though he did good and could 
 ill be spared, yet he died at last. Observe 
 how his death is here described. 
 
 1. He <I>gave 
 up the ghost.</I> His life was not extorted from 
 him, but he cheerfully resigned it; into the 
 hands of the Father of spirits he committed 
 his spirit. 
 
 2. He <I>died in a good old age, an 
 old man;</I> so God had promised him. His 
 death was his discharge from the burdens of 
 his age: an old man would not <I>so</I> live always. 
 It was also the crown of the glory of his old 
 age. 
 
 3. He was <I>full of years,</I> or full of <I>life</I> 
 (as it might be supplied), including all the 
 conveniences and comforts of life. He did 
 not live till the world was weary of him, but 
 till he was weary of the world; he had had 
 enough of it, and desired no more. <I>Vixi 
 quantum satis est--I have lived long enough.</I> 
 A good man, though he should not die old, 
 dies full of days, satisfied with living here, 
 and longing to live in a better place. 
 
 4. He 
 <I>was gathered to his people.</I> His body was 
 gathered to the congregation of the dead, and 
 his soul to the congregation of the blessed. 
 Note, Death gathers us to our people. Those 
 that are our people while we live, whether 
 the people of God or the children of this world, 
 are the people to whom death will gather us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His burial,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 Here is nothing 
 recorded of the pomp or ceremony of his funeral; 
 only we are told, 
 
 1. Who buried him: 
 <I>His sons Isaac and Ishmael.</I> It was the last 
 office of respect they had to pay to their good 
 father. Some distance there had formerly 
 been between Isaac and Ishmael; but it seems 
 either that Abraham had himself brought 
 them together while he lived, or at least that 
 his death reconciled them. 
 
 2. Where they 
 buried him: in his own burying-place, which 
 he had purchased, and in which he had buried 
 Sarah. Note, Those that in life have been 
 very dear to each other may not only innocently, 
 but laudably, desire to be buried together, 
 that in their deaths they may not be 
 divided, and in token of their hopes of rising 
 together.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And it came to pass after the 
 death of Abraham, that God blessed 
 his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the 
 well Lahai-roi.
 &nbsp; 12 Now these <I>are</I> the 
 generations of Ishmael, Abraham's 
 son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's 
 handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
 &nbsp; 13 And these <I>are</I> the names of the 
 sons of Ishmael, by their names, according 
 to their generations: the firstborn 
 of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, 
 and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
 &nbsp; 14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
 &nbsp; 15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, 
 and Kedemah:
 &nbsp; 16 These <I>are</I> the sons 
 of Ishmael, and these <I>are</I> their names, 
 by their towns, and by their castles; 
 twelve princes according to their nations.
 &nbsp; 17 And these <I>are</I> the years of 
 the life of Ishmael, an hundred and 
 thirty and seven years: and he gave 
 up the ghost and died; and was gathered 
 unto his people.
 &nbsp; 18 And they 
 dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that 
 <I>is</I> before Egypt, as thou goest toward 
 Assyria: <I>and</I> he died in the presence 
 of all his brethren.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Immediately after the account of Abraham's
 death, Moses begins the story of Isaac

 <A NAME="Page154"> </A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 and tells us where he dwelt and how 
 remarkably God blessed him. Note, The 
 blessing of Abraham did not die with him, 
 but survived to all the children of the promise. 
 But he presently digresses from the 
 story of Isaac, to give a short account of Ishmael, 
 forasmuch as he also was a son of 
 Abraham, and God had made some promises 
 concerning him, which it was requisite we 
 should know the accomplishment of. Observe 
 here what is said, 
 
 1. Concerning his 
 children. He had twelve sons, <I>twelve princes</I> 
 they are called
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 heads of families, which 
 in process of time became nations, distinct
 tribes, numerous and very considerable. They
 peopled a very large continent, that lay between
 Egypt and Assyria, called <I>Arabia.</I> The
 names of his twelve sons are recorded. Midian
 and Kedar we often read of in scripture.
 And some very good expositors have taken
 notice of the signification of those three names
 which are put together
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 as containing
 good advice to us all, <I>Mishma, Dumah,</I> and
 <I>Massa,</I> that is, <I>hear, keep silence,</I> and <I>bear;</I>
 we have them together in the same order,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:19">Jam. i:19</A>,
 <I>Be swift to hear, slow to speak, 
 slow to wrath.</I> The posterity of Ishmael had 
 not only tents in the fields, wherein they grew 
 rich in times of peace; but they had towns 
 and castles
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 wherein they fortified 
 themselves in time of war. Now the number 
 and strength of this family were the fruit of 
 the promise made to Hagar concerning Ishmael 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:10"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 10</A>),
 and to Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:20,21:13"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 20 and xxi. 13</A>.
 Note, Many that are strangers 
 to the covenants of promise are yet blessed 
 with outward prosperity for the sake of their 
 godly ancestors. <I>Wealth and riches shall be 
 in their house.</I> 
 
 2. Concerning himself. Here 
 is an account of his age: He <I>lived</I> 137 <I>years</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)
 which is recorded to show the efficacy 
 of Abraham's prayer for him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:18"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 18</A>),
 <I>O that Ishmael might live before thee!</I> Here 
 is also an account of his death; he too <I>was 
 gathered to his people;</I> but it is not said that 
 he was <I>full of days,</I> though he lived to so 
 great an age: he was not so weary of the 
 world, nor so willing to leave it, as his good 
 father was. Those words, <I>he fell in the presence 
 of all his brethren,</I> whether they mean, 
 as we take them, <I>he died,</I> or, as others, <I>his lot 
 fell,</I> are designed to show the fulfilling of that 
 word to Hagar
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:12"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 12</A>),
 <I>He shall dwell 
 in the presence of all his brethren,</I> that is, he 
 shall flourish and be eminent among them, 
 and shall hold his own to the last. Or he 
 died with his friends about him, which is 
 comfortable.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 And these <I>are</I> the generations 
 of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham 
 begat Isaac:
 &nbsp; 20 And Isaac was forty 
 years old when he took Rebekah to 
 wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian 
 of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban 
 the Syrian.
 &nbsp; 21 And Isaac intreated 
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for his wife, because 
 she <I>was</I> barren: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 was intreated of him, and Rebekah his 
 wife conceived.
 &nbsp; 22 And the children 
 struggled together within her; and 
 she said, If <I>it be</I> so, why <I>am</I> I thus? 
 And she went to enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto her, Two 
 nations <I>are</I> in thy womb, and two 
 manner of people shall be separated 
 from thy bowels; and <I>the one</I> people 
 shall be stronger than <I>the other</I> people; 
 and the elder shall serve the 
 younger.
 &nbsp; 24 And when her days to 
 be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
 <I>there were</I> twins in her womb.
 &nbsp; 25 And 
 the first came out red, all over like a 
 hairy garment; and they called his 
 name Esau.
 &nbsp; 26 And after that came 
 his brother out, and his hand took 
 hold on Esau's heel; and his name 
 was called Jacob: and Isaac <I>was</I>
 threescore years old when she bare 
 them.
 &nbsp; 27 And the boys grew: and 
 Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of
 the field; and Jacob <I>was</I> a plain man, 
 dwelling in tents.
 &nbsp; 28 And Isaac loved 
 Esau, because he did eat of <I>his</I> venison:
 but Rebekah loved Jacob.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the birth of 
 Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac and 
 Rebekah: their entrance into the world was 
 (which is not usual) one of the most considerable 
 parts of their story; nor is much related 
 concerning Isaac but what had reference 
 to his father while he lived and to his sons 
 afterwards. For Isaac seems not to have 
 been a man of action, nor much tried, but to 
 have spent his days in quietness and silence. 
 Now concerning Jacob and Esau we are 
 here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they were prayed for. Their parents, 
 after they had been long childless, obtained 
 them by prayer,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 <I>Isaac was 
 forty years old when he was married;</I> though 
 he was an only son, and the person from 
 whom the promised seed was to come, yet he 
 made no haste to marry. He was sixty years 
 old when his sons were born
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 so that, 
 after he was married, he had no child for 
 twenty years. Note, Though the accomplishment 
 of God's promise is always sure, yet it 
 is often slow, and seems to be crossed and 
 contradicted by Providence, that the faith of 
 believers may be tried, their patience exercised, 
 and mercies long waited for may be 
 the more welcome when they come. While 
 this mercy was delayed, Isaac did not approach 
 to a handmaid's bed, as Abraham had 
 done, and Jacob afterwards; for he loved 
 
 <A NAME="Page155"> </A>

 Rebekah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:67"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 67</A>.
 But, 
 
 1. He prayed: 
 he entreated the Lord for his wife. Though 
 God had promised to multiply his family, he 
 prayed for its increase; for God's promises 
 must not supersede, but encourage, our 
 prayers, and be improved as the ground of 
 our faith. Though he had prayed for this 
 mercy very often, and had continued his 
 supplication many years, and it was not 
 granted, yet he did not leave off praying for 
 it; for men ought always to pray, and not to 
 faint 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1">Luke xviii. 1</A>),
 to pray without ceasing, 
 and knock till the door be opened, He prayed 
 <I>for</I> his wife; some read it <I>with</I> his wife. Note, 
 Husbands and wives should pray together, 
 which is intimated in the apostle's caution, 
 that their <I>prayers be not hindered,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1 Pet. iii. 7</A>.
 The Jews have a tradition that Isaac, at length, 
 took his wife with him to mount Moriah, 
 where God had promised that he would multiply 
 Abraham's seed
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 17</A>),
 and there, 
 in his prayer with her and for her, pleaded 
 the promise made in that very place. 
 
 2. God 
 heard his prayer, and was entreated of him. 
 Note, Children are the gift of God. Those 
 that continue instant in prayer, as Isaac did, 
 shall find, at last, that they did not <I>seek in 
 vain,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19">Isa. xlv. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they were prophesied of before 
 they were born, and great mysteries were 
 wrapped up in the prophecies which went 
 before of them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 Long had Isaac 
 prayed for a son; and now his wife is with 
 child of two, to recompense him for his 
 long waiting. Thus God often outdoes our 
 prayers, and gives more than we are able to 
 ask or think. Now Rebekah being with child 
 of these two sons, observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How she was perplexed in her mind 
 concerning her present case: <I>The children 
 struggled together within her.</I> The commotion 
 she felt was altogether extraordinary and 
 made her very uneasy. Whether she was 
 apprehensive that the birth would be her
 death, or whether she was weary of the intestine 
 tumult, or whether she suspected 
 it to be an ill omen, it seems she was ready 
 to wish that either she had not been with 
 child or that she might die immediately, and 
 not bring forth such a struggling brood: <I>If 
 it be so,</I> or, <I>since it is so, Why am I thus?</I> 
 Before, the want of children was her trouble, 
 now, the struggle of the children is no less 
 so. Note, 
 
 (1.) The comforts we are most 
 desirous of are sometimes found to bring 
 along with them more occasion of trouble 
 and uneasiness that we thought of; vanity 
 being written upon all things under the sun, 
 God thus teaches us to read it. 
 
 (2.) We are 
 too apt to be discontented with our comforts, 
 because of the uneasiness that attends 
 them. We know not when we are pleased; 
 we know neither how to want nor how to 
 abound. This struggle between Jacob and
 Esau in the womb represents the struggle
 that is maintained between the kingdom of
 God and the kingdom of Satan, 
 
 [1.] In 
 the world. The seed of the woman and the 
 seed of the serpent have been contending 
 ever since the enmity was put between them 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>),
 and this has occasioned a constant 
 uneasiness among men. Christ himself came 
 to <I>send fire on earth, and this division,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49,51">Luke xii. 49, 51</A>.
 But let not this be offence to
 us. A holy war is better than the peace of
 the devil's palace.

 [2.] In the hearts of believers.
 No sooner is Christ formed in the
 soul than immediately there begins a conflict
 between the flesh and spirit,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:17">Gal. v. 17</A>.
 The stream is not turned without a mighty 
 struggle, which yet ought not to discourage 
 us. It is better to have a conflict with sin 
 than tamely to submit to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What course she took for her relief: 
 <I>She went to enquire of the Lord.</I> Some think 
 Melchizedek was now consulted as an oracle, 
 or perhaps some <I>Urim</I> or <I>Teraphim</I> were now 
 used to enquire of God by, as afterwards in 
 the breast-plate of judgment. Note, The 
 word and prayer, by both which we now enquire 
 of the Lord, give great relief to those 
 that are upon any account perplexed. It is 
 a great relief to the mind to spread our case 
 before the Lord, and ask counsel at his 
 mouth. <I>Go into the sanctuary,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The information given her, upon her 
 enquiry, which expounded the mystery: <I>Two 
 nations are in thy womb,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 She was now 
 pregnant, not only with two children, but two 
 nations, which should not only in their manners 
 and dispositions greatly differ from each other, 
 but in their interests clash and contend with 
 each other; and the issue of the contest 
 should be that the elder should serve the 
 younger, which was fulfilled in the subjection 
 of the Edomites, for many ages, to the house 
 of David, till they revolted, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:8">2 Chron. xxi. 8</A>.
 Observe here, 
 
 (1.) God is a free agent in 
 dispensing his grace; it is his prerogative to 
 make a difference between those who have 
 not as yet themselves done either good or 
 evil. This the apostle infers hence, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:12">Rom. ix. 12</A>.

 (2.) In the struggle between grace and 
 corruption in the soul, grace, the younger, 
 shall certainly get the upper hand at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That when they were born there was 
 a great difference between them, which served 
 to confirm what had been foretold
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 was presage of the accomplishment of it, 
 and served greatly to illustrate the type.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a great difference in their 
 bodies,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Esau, when he was born, was 
 rough and hairy, as if he had been already a 
 grown man, whence he had his name <I>Esau, 
 made,</I> reared already. This was an indication 
 of a very strong constitution, and gave 
 cause to expect that he would be a very robust, 
 daring, active man. But Jacob was 
 smooth and tender as other children. Note, 
 
 (1.) The difference of men's capacities, and 
 consequently of their condition in the world, 
 arises very much from the difference of their 
 natural constitution; some are plainly designed 
 by nature for activity and honour, 
 
 <A NAME="Page156"> </A>

 others as manifestly marked for obscurity. 
 This instance of the divine sovereignty in the 
 kingdom of providence may perhaps help to 
 reconcile us to the doctrine of the divine 
 sovereignty in the kingdom of grace. 
 
 (2.) It is God's usual way to choose the weak 
 things of the world, and to pass by the mighty, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26,27">1 Cor. i. 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was a manifest contest in their 
 births. Esau, the stronger, came forth first; 
 but Jacob's hand <I>took hold of his heel,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>. 
 This signified, 
 
 (1.) Jacob's pursuit of the 
 birthright and blessing; from the first, 
 he reached forth to catch hold of it, and, 
 if possible, to prevent his brother. 
 
 (2.) His prevailing for it at last, that, in process 
 of time, he should undermine his brother, 
 and gain his point. This passage is referred 
 to 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8">Hos. xii. 8</A>),
 and hence he had his name, 
 <I>Jacob, a supplanter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were very unlike in the temper of 
 their minds, and the way of living they 
 chose,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>. 
 They soon appeared to be of 
 very different dispositions. 
 
 (1.) Esau was a 
 man for this world. He was a man addicted 
 to his sports, for he was a hunter; and a
 man who knew how to live by his wits, for 
 he was a cunning hunter. Recreation was 
 his business; he studied the art of it, and 
 spent all his time in it. He never loved a book, 
 nor cared for being within doors; but he was 
 a man of the field, like Nimrod and Ishmael, 
 all for the game, and never well but when he 
 was upon the stretch in pursuit of it: in 
 short, he set up for a gentleman and a soldier. 
 
 (2.) Jacob was a man for the other 
 world. He was not cut out for a statesman, 
 nor did he affect to look great, but he was <I>a 
 plain man, dwelling in tents,</I> an honest man 
 that always meant well, and dealt fairly, that 
 preferred the true delights of solitude and 
 retirement to all the pretended pleasure of 
 busy noisy sports: he dwelt in tents, 
 
 [1.] As a shepherd. He was attached to that
 safe and silent employment of keeping sheep, 
 to which also he bred up his children,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:34"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 34</A>.
 Or, 
 
 [2.] As a student. He frequented 
 the tents of Melchizedek, or Heber, 
 as some understand it, to be taught by them 
 divine things. And this was that son of 
 Isaac on whom the covenant was entailed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their interest in the affections of their 
 parents was likewise different. They had 
 but these two children, and, it seems, one 
 was the father's darling and the other the 
 mother's,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 (1.) Isaac, though he was 
 not a stirring man himself (for when he went 
 into the fields he went to meditate and pray, 
 not to hunt), yet loved to have his son active. 
 Esau knew how to please him, and showed 
 a great respect for him, by treating him often 
 with venison, which gained him the affections 
 of the good old man, and won upon him 
 more than one would have thought. 
 
 (2.) Rebekah was mindful of the oracle of God, 
 which had given the preference to Jacob, and 
 therefore she preferred him in her love. 
 And, if it be lawful for parents to make a 
 difference between their children upon any 
 account, doubtless Rebekah was in the right, 
 that loved him whom God loved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And Jacob sod pottage: and 
 Esau came from the field, and he <I>was</I> 
 faint:
 &nbsp; 30 And Esau said to Jacob, 
 Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
 red <I>pottage;</I> for I <I>am</I> faint: therefore 
 was his name called Edom.
 &nbsp; 31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy 
 birthright.
 &nbsp; 32 And Esau said, Behold, 
 I <I>am</I> at the point to die: and 
 what profit shall this birthright do to 
 me?
 &nbsp; 33 And Jacob said, Swear to 
 me this day; and he sware unto him:
 and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
 &nbsp; 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and 
 pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and 
 drink, and rose up, and went his way: 
 thus Esau despised <I>his</I> birthright.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a bargain made between 
 Jacob and Esau about the birthright, which 
 was Esau's by providence but Jacob's by 
 promise. It was a spiritual privilege, including 
 the excellency of dignity and the 
 excellency of power, as well as the double
 portion,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 3</A>.
 It seemed to be such a 
 birthright as had then the blessing annexed 
 to it, and the entail of the promise. Now see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jacob's pious desire of the birthright, 
 which yet he sought to obtain by indirect 
 courses, not agreeable to his character as a 
 plain man. It was not out of pride or ambition 
 that he coveted the birthright, but with 
 an eye to spiritual blessings, which he had 
 got well acquainted with in his tents, while 
 Esau had lost the scent of them in the field. 
 For this he is to be commended, that he 
 coveted earnestly the best gifts; yet in this 
 he cannot be justified, that he took advantage 
 of his brother's necessity to make him a 
 very hard bargain
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):
 <I>Sell me this day 
 thy birthright.</I> Probably there had formerly 
 been some communication between them 
 about this matter, and then it was not so 
 great a surprise upon Esau as here it seems 
 to be; and, it may be, Esau had sometimes 
 spoken slightly of the birthright and its 
 appurtenances, which encouraged Jacob to 
 make this proposal to him. And, if so, 
 Jacob is, in some measure, excusable in what 
 he did to gain his point. Note, Plain men 
 that have their conversation in simplicity and 
 godly sincerity, and without worldly wisdom, 
 are often found wisest of all for their souls 
 and eternity. Those are wise indeed that are 
 wise for another world. Jacob's wisdom appeared 
 in two things:--
 
 1. He chose the fittest 
 time, took the opportunity when it offered 
 itself, and did not let it slip. 
 
 2. Having 
 made the bargain, he made it sure, and got 
 it confirmed by Esau's oath: <I>Swear to me 
 
 <A NAME="Page157"> </A>

 this day,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 He took Esau when he was 
 in the mind, and would not leave him a 
 power of revocation. In a case of this nature, 
 it is good to be sure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Esau's profane contempt of the birthright, 
 and the foolish sale he made of it. He is 
 called <I>profane Esau</I> for it 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:16">Heb. xii. 16</A>),
 because 
 <I>for one morsel of meat he sold his birthright,</I> 
 as dear a morsel as ever was eaten since the 
 forbidden fruit; and he lived to regret it 
 when it was too late. Never was there such 
 a foolish bargain as this which Esau now 
 made; and yet he valued himself upon his 
 policy, and had the reputation of a cunning 
 man, and perhaps had often bantered his 
 brother Jacob as a weak and simple man. 
 Note, There are those that are penny-wise 
 and pound-foolish, cunning hunters that can 
 out-wit others and draw them into their 
 snares, and yet are themselves imposed upon 
 by Satan's wiles and led captive by him at 
 his will. Again, God often chooses the 
 foolish things of the world, by them to confound 
 the wise. Plain Jacob makes a fool 
 of cunning Esau. Observe the instances of 
 Esau's folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His appetite was very strong,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.
 Poor Jacob had got some bread and pottage
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)
 for his dinner, and was sitting down 
 to it contentedly enough, without venison, 
 when Esau came from hunting, hungry and 
 weary, and perhaps had caught nothing.
 And now Jacob's pottage pleased his eye 
 better than ever his game had done. Give 
 me (says he) some of <I>that red, that red,</I> as it 
 is in the original; it suited his own colour
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 and, in reproach to him for this, he 
 was ever afterwards called <I>Edom, red.</I> Nay, 
 it should seem, he was so faint that he could 
 not feed himself, nor had he a servant at 
 hand to help him, but entreats his brother 
 to feed him. Note, 
 
 (1.) Those that addict 
 themselves to sport <I>weary themselves for very 
 vanity,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:13">Hab. ii. 13</A>.
 They might do the most 
 needful business, and gain the greatest advantages, 
 with half the pains they take, and 
 half the perils they run into, in pursuit of 
 their foolish pleasures. 
 
 (2.) Those that work 
 with quietness are more constantly and comfortably 
 provided for than those that hunt 
 with noise: bread is not always to the wise, 
 but those that trust in the Lord and do good, 
 verily they shall be fed, fed with daily bread; 
 not as Esau, sometimes feasting and sometimes 
 fainting. 
 
 (3.) The gratifying of the 
 sensual appetite is that which ruins thousands 
 of precious souls: surely, if Esau was 
 hungry and faint, he might have got a meal's 
 meat cheaper than at the expense of his birthright; 
 but he was unaccountably fond of the 
 colour of this pottage, and could not deny 
 himself the satisfaction of a mess of it, whatever 
 it cost him. Never better can come of 
 it, when men's <I>hearts walk after their eyes</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:7">Job xxxi. 7</A>),
 and when they serve their 
 own bellies: therefore look not thou upon 
 the wine, or, as Esau, upon the pottage, 
 when it is red, when it gives that colour in 
 the cup, in the dish, which is most inviting, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31">Prov. xxiii. 31</A>.
 If we use ourselves to deny 
 ourselves, we break the forces of most temptations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His reasoning was very weak
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):
 <I>Behold, I am at the point to die;</I> and, if he 
 were, would nothing serve to keep him alive 
 but this pottage? If the famine were now 
 in the land
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:1"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 1</A>),
 as Dr. Lightfoot 
 conjectures, we cannot suppose Isaac so poor, 
 or Rebekah so bad a house-keeper, but that 
 he might have been supplied with food convenient, 
 other ways, and might have saved 
 his birthright: but his appetite has the mastery 
 of him; he is in a longing condition, 
 nothing will please him but this <I>red</I> this <I>red 
 pottage,</I> and, to palliate his desire, he pretends 
 he is at the point to die. If it had 
 been so, was it not better for him to die in 
 honour than to live in disgrace, to die under 
 a blessing than to live under a curse? 
 The birthright was typical of spiritual privileges, 
 those of the church of the first-born. Esau 
 was now tried how he would value them, and 
 he shows himself sensible only of present 
 grievances; may he but get relief against 
 them, he cares not for his birthright. Better 
 principled was Naboth, who would lose 
 his life rather than sell his vineyard, because 
 his part in the earthly Canaan signified his 
 part in the heavenly, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:3">1 Kings xxi. 3</A>.

 (1.) If 
 we look on Esau's birthright as only a temporal 
 advantage, what he said had something 
 of truth in it, namely, that our worldly enjoyments, 
 even those we are most fond of, 
 will stand us in no stead in a dying hour 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6-8">Ps. xlix. 6-8</A>);
 they will not put by the 
 stroke of death, nor ease the pangs nor 
 remove the sting: yet Esau, who set up for 
 a gentleman, should have had a greater and 
 more noble spirit than to sell even such an 
 honour so cheaply. 
 
 (2.) But, being of a 
 spiritual nature, his undervaluing it was the 
 greatest profaneness imaginable. Note, It 
 is egregious folly to part with our interest in 
 God, and Christ, and heaven, for the riches, 
 honours, and pleasures, of this world, as bad 
 a bargain as his that sold a birthright for a 
 dish of broth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Repentance was hidden from his eyes
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):
 <I>He did eat and drink,</I> pleased his 
 palate, satisfied his cravings, congratulated 
 himself on the good meal's meat he had had, 
 and then carelessly rose up and went his 
 way, without any serious reflections upon 
 the bad bargain he had made, or any show 
 of regret. Thus Esau despised his birthright; 
 he used no means at all to get the 
 bargain revoked, made no appeal to his father 
 about it, nor proposed to his brother to compound 
 the matter; but the bargain which his 
 necessity had made (supposing it were so) his 
 profaneness confirmed <I>ex post facto--after 
 the deed;</I> and by his subsequent neglect and 
 contempt he did, as it were, acknowledge a 
 fine, and by justifying himself in what he 
 
 <A NAME="Page158"> </A>

 had done he put the bargain past recall. 
 Note, People are ruined, not so much by 
 doing what is amiss, as by doing it and not 
 repenting of it, doing it and standing to it.</P>
