 The foundation of all religion being laid in our relation to God as 
 our Creator, it was fit that the book of divine revelations which 
 was intended to be the guide, support, and rule, of religion in 
 the world, should begin, as it does, with a plain and full account 
 of the creation of the world--in answer to that first enquiry of a 
 good conscience, "Where is God my Maker?" 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10">Job xxxv. 10</A>).
 Concerning this the pagan philosophers wretchedly blundered, 
 and became vain in their imaginations, some asserting the world's 
 eternity and self-existence, others ascribing it to a fortuitous 
 concourse of atoms: thus "the world by wisdom knew not 
 God," but took a great deal of pains to lose him. The holy 
 scripture therefore, designing by revealed religion to maintain 
 and improve natural religion, to repair the decays of it and supply 
 the defects of it, since the fall, for the reviving of the 
 precepts of the law of nature, lays down, at first, this principle
 of the unclouded light of nature, That this world was, in the
 beginning of time, created by a Being of infinite wisdom and
 power, who was himself before all time and all worlds. The
 entrance into God's word gives this light,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:130">Ps. cxix. 130.</A>.
 
 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:1">first verse</A>

 of the Bible gives us a surer and better, a more satisfying
 and useful, knowledge of the origin of the universe, than
 all the volumes of the philosophers. The lively faith of humble
 Christians understands this matter better than the elevated
 fancy of the greatest wits,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:3">Heb. xi. 3</A>.</P>

 We have three things in this chapter:--I. A general idea given us 
 of the work of creation
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. A particular account of
 the several days' work, registered, as in a journal, distinctly
 and in order. The creation of the light the first day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>;
 of the firmament the second day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>;
 of the sea, the earth, and its fruits, the third day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>;
 of the lights of heaven the fourth day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>;
 of the fish and fowl the fifth day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>;
 of the beasts,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>;
 of man,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>;
 and of food for both the sixth day,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:29,30">ver. 29, 30</A>.

 III. The review and approbation of the whole work,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:31">ver. 31</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the beginning God created the
 heaven and the earth.
 &nbsp; 2 And the earth was without form, and void;
 and darkness <I>was</I> upon the face of the
 deep. And the Spirit of God moved
 upon the face of the waters.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the work of creation 
 in its epitome and in its embryo.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In its epitome, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,
 where we find, to 
 our comfort, the first article of our creed, 
 that <I>God the Father Almighty is the Maker of 
 heaven and earth,</I> and as such we believe in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe, in this verse, four things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The effect produced--<I>the heaven and 
 the earth,</I> that is, the world, including the 
 whole frame and furniture of the universe, 
 the <I>world and all things therein,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24">Acts xvii. 24</A>.
 The world is a great house, consisting of 
 upper and lower stories, the structure stately 
 and magnificent, uniform and convenient, 
 and every room well and wisely furnished. 
 It is the visible part of the creation that 
 Moses here designs to account for; therefore
 he mentions not the creation of angels. But 
 as the earth has not only its surface adorned
 with grass and flowers, but also its bowels
 enriched with metals and precious stones 
 (which partake more of its solid nature and 
 more valuable, though the creation of 
 them is not mentioned here), so the heavens 
 are not only beautified to our eye with glorious 
 lamps which garnish its outside, of whose 
 creation we here read, but they are within replenished 
 with glorious beings, out of our 
 sight, more celestial, and more surpassing 
 them in worth and excellency than the gold 
 or sapphires surpass the lilies of the field. 
 In the visible world it is easy to observe,

 [1.] Great variety, several sorts of beings vastly 
 differing in their nature and constitution from 
 each other. <I>Lord, how manifold are thy works,</I> 
 and all good!

 [2.] Great beauty. The azure 
 sky and verdant earth are charming to the 
 
 eye of the curious spectator, much more the 
 ornaments of both. How transcendent then 
 must the beauty of the Creator be!

 [3.] Great exactness and accuracy. To those 
 that, with the help of microscopes, narrowly 
 look into the works of nature, they appear 
 far more fine than any of the works of art.

 [4.] Great power. It is not a lump of dead 
 and inactive matter, but there is virtue, more 
 or less, in every creature: the earth itself has
 a magnetic power.

 [5.] Great order, a mutual 
 dependence of beings, an exact harmony 
 of motions, and an admirable chain and connection 
 of causes.

 [6.] Great mystery. There 
 are phenomena in nature which cannot be 
 solved, secrets which cannot be fathomed nor 
 accounted for. But from what we see of 
 heaven and earth we may easily enough infer 
 the eternal power and Godhead of the great 
 Creator, and may furnish ourselves with 
 abundant matter for his praises. And let 
 our make and place, as men, remind us of 
 our duty as Christians, which is always to 
 keep heaven in our eye and the earth under 
 our feet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The author and cause of this great 
 work--GOD. The Hebrew word is <I>Elohim,</I> 
 which bespeaks,

 [1.] The power of God the 
 Creator. <I>El</I> signifies <I>the strong God;</I> and 
 what less than almighty strength could bring 
 all things out of nothing?

 [2.] The plurality 
 of persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and 
 Holy Ghost. This plural name of God, in 
 Hebrew, which speaks of him as many though 
 he is one, was to the Gentiles perhaps a savour
 of death unto death, hardening them in 
 their idolatry; but it is to us a savour of life 
 unto life, confirming our faith in the doctrine 
 of the Trinity, which, though but darkly intimated 
 in the Old Testament, is clearly revealed 
 in the New. The Son of God, the 
 eternal Word and Wisdom of the Father, was 
 with him when he made the world 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>),
 nay, we are often told that the world
 was made by him, and nothing made without him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3,10,Eph+3:9,Col+1:16,Heb+1:2">John i. 3, 10; Eph. iii. 9; Col. i. 16; Heb. 1. 2</A>.
 O what high thoughts should 
 this form in our minds of that great God
 whom we draw nigh to in religious worship, 
 and that great Mediator in whose name we 
 draw nigh!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The manner in which this work was 
 effected: <I>God created it,</I> that is, made it out 
 of nothing. There was not any pre-existent 
 matter out of which the world was produced. 
 The fish and fowl were indeed produced out 
 of the waters and the beasts and man out of 
 the earth; but that earth and those waters 
 were made out of nothing. By the ordinary power 
 of nature, it is impossible that any 
 thing should be made out of nothing; no 
 artificer can work, unless he has something 
 to work on. But by the almighty power of 
 God it is not only possible that something 
 should be made of nothing (the God of nature 
 is not subject to the laws of nature), but in 
 the creation it is impossible it should be

 <A NAME="Page3"> </A>

 otherwise, for nothing is more injurious to 
 the honour of the Eternal Mind than the 
 supposition of eternal matter. Thus the excellency 
 of the power is of God and all the glory 
 is to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) When this work was produced: <I>In 
 the beginning,</I> that is, in the beginning of 
 time, when that clock was first set a going: 
 time began with the production of those 
 beings that are measured by time. Before 
 the beginning of time there was none but that 
 Infinite Being that inhabits eternity. Should 
 we ask why God made the world no sooner,
 we should but darken counsel by words without 
 knowledge; for how could there be sooner 
 or later in eternity? And he did make it in 
 the beginning of time, according to his eternal 
 counsels before all time. The Jewish 
 Rabbies have a saying, that there were seven
 things which God created before the world, 
 by which they only mean to express the excellency 
 of these things:--The law, repentance, 
 paradise, hell, the throne of glory, the 
 house of the sanctuary, and the name of the
 Messiah. But to us it is enough to say, <I>In 
 the beginning was the Word,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us learn hence, 
 
 (1.) That atheism
 is folly, and atheists are the greatest fools in
 nature; for they see there is a world that
 could not make itself, and yet they will not
 own there is a God that made it. Doubtless,
 they are without excuse, but the god of this 
 world has blinded their minds. 
 
 (2.) That 
 God is sovereign Lord of all by an incontestable
 right. If he is the Creator, no doubt he
 is the owner and possessor of heaven and
 earth.

 (3.) That with God all things are possible, 
 and therefore happy are the people 
 that have him for their God, and whose help 
 and hope stand in his name, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:2,124:8">Ps. cxxi. 2; cxxiv. 8</A>.

 (4.) That the God we serve is 
 worthy of, and yet is exalted far above, all 
 blessing and praise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:5,6">Neh. ix. 5, 6</A>.
 If he 
 made the world, he needs not our services, 
 nor can be benefited by them 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24,25">Acts xvii. 24, 25</A>),
 and yet he justly requires them, and deserves 
 our praise, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:11">Rev. iv. 11</A>.
 If all is of 
 him, all must be to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the work of creation in its 
 embryo, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 where we have an account of 
 the first matter and the first mover.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A chaos was the first matter. It is 
 here called the earth (though the earth, properly 
 taken, was not made till the third day
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 because it did most resemble that 
 which afterwards was called <I>earth,</I> mere 
 earth, destitute of its ornaments, such a heavy
 unwieldy mass was it; it is also called <I>the 
 deep,</I> both for its vastness and because the 
 waters which were afterwards separated from
 the earth were now mixed with it. This immense 
 mass of matter was it out of which 
 all bodies, even the firmament and visible 
 heavens themselves, were afterwards produced 
 by the power of the Eternal Word.
 The Creator could have made his work perfect 
 at first, but by this gradual proceeding 
 
 he would show what is, ordinarily, the method 
 of his providence and grace. Observe the 
 description of this chaos. 
 
 (1.) There was 
 nothing in it desirable to be seen, for it was 
 <I>without form and void. Tohu</I> and <I>Bohu, confusion</I> 
 and <I>emptiness;</I> so these words are 
 rendered, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:11">Isa. xxxiv. 11</A>.
 It was shapeless, 
 it was useless, it was without inhabitants, 
 without ornaments, the shadow or rough
 draught of things to come, <I>and not the image 
 of the things,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>.
 The earth is almost 
 reduced to the same condition again by the 
 sin of man, under which the creation groans. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:23">Jer. iv. 23</A>,
 <I>I beheld the earth, and lo it 
 was without form, and void.</I> To those who 
 have their hearts in heaven this lower world, 
 in comparison with that upper, still appears 
 to be nothing but confusion and emptiness. 
 There is no true beauty to be seen, no satisfying 
 fulness to be enjoyed, in this earth, but 
 in God only. 
 
 (2.) If there had been any 
 thing desirable to be seen, yet there was no 
 light to see it by; for <I>darkness,</I> thick darkness,
 <I>was upon the face of the deep.</I> God 
 did not create this darkness (as he is said to 
 create the darkness of affliction, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7">Isa. xlv. 7</A>),
 for it was only the want of light, which yet
 could not be said to be wanted till something 
 was made that might be seen by it; nor needs 
 the want of it be much complained of, when 
 there was nothing to be seen but confusion 
 and emptiness. If the work of grace in the 
 soul is a new creation, this chaos represents 
 the state of an unregenerate graceless soul: 
 <I>there</I> is disorder, confusion, and every evil 
 work; it is empty of all good, for it is without 
 God; it is dark, it is darkness itself. 
 This is our condition by nature, till almighty 
 grace effects a blessed change.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The Spirit of God was the first mover: 
 He <I>moved upon the face of the waters.</I> When 
 we consider the earth without form and void,
 methinks it is like the valley full of dead and 
 dry bones. Can these live? Can this confused 
 mass of matter be formed into a beautiful
 world? Yes, if a spirit of life from God 
 enter into it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:9">Ezek. xxxvii. 9</A>.
 Now there is 
 hope concerning this thing; for the Spirit of 
 God begins to work, and, if he work, who or 
 what shall hinder? God is said to make the 
 world by his Spirit, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:6,Job+26:13">Ps. xxxiii. 6; Job xxvi. 13</A>;
 and by the same mighty worker the new 
 creation is effected. He moved upon the 
 face of the deep, as Elijah stretched himself 
 upon the dead child,--as the <I>hen gathers her 
 chickens under her wings,</I> and hovers over 
 them, to warm and cherish them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>,--as
 the eagle stirs up her nest, and <I>flutters</I> 
 over her young (it is the same word that is 
 here used), 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11">Deut. xxxii. 11</A>.
 Learn hence, 
 That God is not only the author of all being, 
 but the fountain of life and spring of motion.  
 Dead matter would be for ever dead if he did 
 not quicken it. And this makes it credible 
 to us that God should raise the dead. That 
 power which brought such a world as this 
 out of confusion, emptiness, and darkness,

 <A NAME="Page4"> </A>

 at the beginning of time, can, at the end of
 time, bring our vile bodies out of the grave, 
 though it is <I>a land of darkness as darkness 
 itself, and without any order</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:22">Job x. 22</A>),
 and can make them glorious bodies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And God said, Let there be
 light: and there was light.
 &nbsp; 4 And
 God saw the light, that <I>it was</I> good:
 and God divided the light from the darkness.
 &nbsp; 5 And God called the
 light Day, and the darkness he called
 Night. And the evening and the 
 morning were the first day.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the 
 first day's work, in which observe, 
 
 1. That 
 the first of all visible beings which God 
 created was light; not that by it he himself 
 might see to work (for the darkness and 
 light are both alike to him), but that by it 
 we might see his works and his glory in 
 them, and might work our works while it is 
 day. The works of Satan and his servants 
 are works of darkness; but he that doeth 
 truth, and doeth good, cometh to the light, 
 and coveteth it, <I>that his deeds may be made
 manifest,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:21">John iii. 21</A>.
 Light is the great 
 beauty and blessing of the universe. Like 
 the first-born, it does, of all visible beings, 
 most resemble its great Parent in purity and 
 power, brightness and beneficence; it is of 
 great affinity with a spirit, and is next to it; 
 though by it we see other things, and are 
 sure that it is, yet we know not its nature,
 nor can describe what it is, or <I>by what way 
 the light is parted,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:19,24">Job xxxviii. 19, 24</A>.
 By the sight of it let us be led to, and assisted 
 in, the believing contemplation of him who 
 is light, infinite and eternal light 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1 John i. 5</A>),
 and the <I>Father of lights</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">Jam. i. 17</A>),
 and who dwells in inaccessible light, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>.
 In the new creation, the first thing 
 wrought in the soul is <I>light:</I> the blessed 
 Spirit captives the will and affections by 
 enlightening the understanding, so coming 
 into the heart by the door, like the good 
 shepherd whose own the sheep are, while 
 sin and Satan, like thieves and robbers, climb 
 up some other way. Those that by sin were 
 darkness by grace become light in the world. 
 
 2. That the light was made by the word of 
 God's power. He said, <I>Let there be light;</I> 
 he willed and appointed it, and it was done 
 immediately: <I>there was light,</I> such a copy as 
 exactly answered the original idea in the 
 Eternal Mind. O the power of the word of 
 God! <I>He spoke, and it was done,</I> done 
 really, effectually, and for perpetuity, not in 
 show only, and to serve a present turn, for 
 <I>he commanded, and it stood fast:</I> with him it 
 was <I>dictum, factum--a word, and a world.</I> 
 The world of God (that is, his will and the 
 good pleasure of it) is quick and powerful. 
 Christ is the Word, the essential eternal 
 Word, and by him the light was produced, 
 for <I>in him was light, and he is the true light, 
 the light of the world,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:9,9:5">John  i. 9; ix. 5.</A>.
 The divine light which shines in sanctified souls 
 is wrought by the power of God, the power 
 of his word and of the Spirit of wisdom and 
 revelation, opening the understanding, scattering 
 the mists of ignorance and mistake, 
 and giving the knowledge of the glory of 
 God in the face of Christ, as at first, <I>God
 commanded the light to shine out of darkness,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.
 Darkness would have been 
 perpetually upon the face of fallen man if the 
 Son of God had not <I>come, and given us an 
 understanding,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>.

 3. That the 
 light which God willed, when it was produced, he 
 approved of: <I>God saw the light that it was 
 good.</I> It was exactly as he designed it, and 
 it was fit to answer the end for which he 
 designed it. It was useful and profitable; 
 the world, which now is a palace, would have 
 been a dungeon without it. It was amiable 
 and pleasant. <I>Truly the light is sweet</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:7">Eccl. xi. 7</A>);
 <I>it rejoiceth the heart,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:30">Prov. xv. 30</A>.
 What God commands he will approve and 
 graciously accept; he will be well pleased 
 with the work of his own hands. That is 
 good indeed which is so in the sight of God, 
 for he sees not as man sees. If the light 
 is good, how good is he that is the fountain 
 of light, from whom we receive it, and to 
 whom we owe all praise for it and all the
 services we do by it! 
 
 4. That God <I>divided 
 the light from the darkness,</I> so put them 
 asunder as that they could never be joined 
 together, or reconciled; for <I>what fellowship 
 has light with darkness?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14">2 Cor. vi. 14</A>.
 And yet he divided time between them, the day 
 for light and the night for darkness, in a constant 
 and regular succession to each other. 
 Though the darkness was now scattered by
 the light, yet it was not condemned to a perpetual
 banishment, but takes its turn with 
 the light, and has its place, because it has its 
 use; for, as the light of the morning befriends 
 the business of the day, so the 
 shadows of the evening befriend the repose 
 of the night, and draw the curtains about 
 us, that we may sleep the better. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:2">Job vii. 2</A>.
 God has thus divided time between 
 light and darkness, because he would daily 
 remind us that this is a world of mixtures 
 and changes. In heaven there is perfect 
 and perpetual light, and no darkness at all; 
 in hell, utter darkness, and no gleam of light.  
 In that world between these two there is a great 
 gulf fixed; but, in this world, they are counterchanged, 
 and we pass daily from one to 
 another, that we may learn to expect the 
 like vicissitudes in the providence of God, 
 peace and trouble, joy and sorrow, and may 
 set the one over-against the other, accommodating
 ourselves to both as we do to the 
 light and darkness, bidding both welcome, 
 and making the best of both. 
 
 5. That God 
 divided them from each other by distinguishing 
 names: <I>He called the light day, and the 
 darkness he called night.</I> He gave them 
 names, as the Lord of both; for <I>the day is

 <A NAME="Page5"> </A>

 his, the night also is his,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:16">Ps. lxxiv. 16</A>.
 He is the Lord of time, and will be so, till day 
 and night shall come to an end, and the 
 stream of time be swallowed up in the ocean 
 of eternity. Let us acknowledge God in the 
 constant succession of day and night, and 
 consecrate both to his honour, by working 
 for him every day and resting in him every 
 night, and meditating in his law day and 
 night. 
 
 6. That this was the first day's 
 work, and a good day's work it was. <I>The 
 evening and the morning were the first day.</I> 
 The darkness of the evening was before the 
 light of the morning, that it might serve for
 a foil to it, to set it off, and make it shine
 the brighter. This was not only the first
 day of the world, but the first day of the
 week. I observe it to the honour of that
 day, because the new world began on the
 first day of the week likewise, in the resurrection
 of Christ, as the light of the world,
 early in the morning. In him the day-spring
 from on high has visited the world;
 and happy are we, for ever happy, if that
 <I>day-star arise in our hearts.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And God said, Let there be
 a firmament in the midst of the waters,
 and let it divide the waters from the
 waters.
 &nbsp; 7 And God made the firmament,
 and divided the waters which
 <I>were</I> under the firmament from the
 waters which <I>were</I> above the firmament:
 and it was so.
 &nbsp; 8 And God
 called the firmament Heaven. And
 the evening and the morning were 
 the second day.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the second 
 day's work, the creation of the firmament, in 
 which observe, 
 
 1. The command of God 
 concerning it: <I>Let there be a firmament,</I> an 
 <I>expansion,</I> so the Hebrew word signifies, like 
 a sheet spread, or a curtain drawn out. This 
 includes all that is visible above the earth, 
 between it and the third heavens: the air, its 
 higher, middle, and lower, regions--the celestial 
 globe, and all the spheres and orbs of 
 light above: it reaches as high as the place 
 where the stars are fixed, for that is called 
 here the <I>firmament of heaven</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),
 and as low as the place where the birds fly, for 
 that also is called the <I>firmament of heaven,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 When God had made the light, he 
 appointed the air to be the receptacle and 
 vehicle of its beams, and to be as a medium 
 of communication between the invisible and 
 the visible world; for, though between heaven 
 and earth there is an inconceivable distance, 
 yet there is not an impassable gulf, as there 
 is between heaven and hell. This firmament 
 is not a wall of partition, but a way of intercourse. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7,37:18,Ps+104:3,Am+9:6">Job xxvi. 7; xxxvii. 18; Ps. civ. 3; Amos ix. 6</A>.

 2. The creation of it.
 Lest it should seem as if God had only commanded 
 it to be done, and some one else had 
 done it, he adds, <I>And God made the firmament.</I> 
 What God requires of us he himself 
 works in us, or it is not done. He that commands 
 faith, holiness, and love, creates them 
 by the power of his grace going along with 
 his word, that he may have all the praise. 
 <I>Lord, give what thou commandest, and then 
 command what thou pleasest.</I> The firmament 
 is said to be <I>the work of God's fingers,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3">Ps. viii. 3</A>.
 Though the vastness of its extent 
 declares it to be the work of his arm stretched 
 out, yet the admirable fineness of its constitution 
 shows that it is a curious piece of art, 
 the work of his fingers. 
 
 3. The use and design 
 of it--to <I>divide the waters from the 
 waters,</I> that is, to distinguish between the 
 waters that are wrapped up in the clouds and 
 those that cover the sea, the waters in the 
 air and those in the earth. See the difference 
 between these two carefully observed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:10,11">Deut. xi. 10, 11</A>,
 where Canaan is upon this account 
 preferred to Egypt, that Egypt was 
 moistened and made fruitful with the waters 
 that are under the firmament, but Canaan 
 with waters from above, out of the firmament, 
 even the dew of heaven, which tarrieth 
 not <I>for the sons of men,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Mic. v. 7</A>.
 God has, 
 in the firmament of his power, chambers, 
 store-chambers, whence he <I>watereth the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:13,Ps+65:9,10">Ps. civ. 13; lxv. 9, 10</A>.
 He has also <I>treasures, 
 or magazines, of snow and hail, which 
 he hath reserved against the day of battle and 
 war,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>.
 O what a great 
 God is he who has thus provided for the 
 comfort of all that serve him and the confusion 
 of all that hate him! It is good having 
 him our friend, and bad having him our 
 enemy. 
 
 4. The naming of it: <I>He called the 
 firmament heaven.</I> It is the visible heaven, 
 the pavement of the holy city; above the 
 firmament God is said to have his throne 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:26">Ezek. i. 26</A>),

 for he has prepared it in the
 heavens; the heavens therefore are said to 
 rule, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26">Dan. iv. 26</A>.
 <I>Is not God in the height of 
 heaven?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:12">Job xxii. 12</A>.
 Yes, he is, and we 
 should be led by the contemplation of the 
 heavens that are in our eye to consider <I>our 
 Father who is in heaven.</I> The height of the 
 heavens should remind us of God's supremacy 
 and the infinite distance there is between 
 us and him; the brightness of the 
 heavens and their purity should remind us of 
 his glory, and majesty, and perfect holiness; 
 the vastness of the heavens, their encompassing 
 of the earth, and the influence they have 
 upon it, should remind us of his immensity 
 and universal providence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And God said, Let the waters
 under the heaven be gathered together
 unto one place, and let the dry <I>land</I>
 appear: and it was so.
 &nbsp; 10 And God
 called the dry <I>land</I> Earth; and the
 gathering together of the waters called
 he Seas: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
 &nbsp; 11 And God said, Let the

 <A NAME="Page6"> </A>

 earth bring forth grass, the herb
 yielding seed, <I>and</I> the fruit tree yielding
 fruit after his kind, whose seed <I>is</I>
 in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
 &nbsp; 12 And the earth brought forth 
 grass, <I>and</I> herb yielding seed after 
 his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, 
 whose seed <I>was</I> in itself, after his 
 kind: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
 &nbsp; 13 And the evening and the morning 
 were the third day.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The third day's work is related in these 
 verses--the forming of the sea and the dry 
 land, and the making of the earth fruitful. 
 Hitherto the power of the Creator had been 
 exerted and employed about the upper part 
 of the visible word; the light of heaven was 
 kindled, and the firmament of heaven fixed: 
 but now he descends to this lower world, the 
 earth, which was designed for the children of 
 men, designed both for their habitation and 
 for their maintenance; and here we have an 
 account of the fitting of it for both, and building 
 of their house and the spreading of their 
 table. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the earth was prepared to be a 
 habitation for man, by the gathering of the 
 waters together, and the making of the dry 
 land to appear. Thus, instead of the confusion 
 which there was 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 when earth and 
 water were mixed in one great mass, behold, 
 now, there is order, by such a separation as 
 rendered them both useful. God said, <I>Let 
 it be so, and it was so;</I> no sooner said than 
 done. 
 
 1. The waters which had covered the 
 earth were ordered to retire, and to gather 
 into one place, namely, those hollows which 
 were fitted and appointed for their reception 
 and rest. The waters, thus cleared, thus 
 collected, and thus lodged, in their proper 
 place, he called <I>seas.</I> Though they are many, 
 in distant regions, and washing several 
 shores, yet, either above ground or under 
 ground, they have communication with each 
 other, and so they are one, and the common 
 receptacle of waters, into which all the rivers 
 flow, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:7">Eccl. i. 7</A>.
 Waters and seas often, in
 scripture, signify troubles and afflictions, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7,69:2,14,15">Ps. xlii. 7; lxix. 2, 14, 15</A>.
 God's own 
 people are not exempted from these in this 
 world; but it is their comfort that they are 
 only waters under the heaven (there are none 
 in heaven), and that they are all in the place 
 that God has appointed them and within 
 the bounds that he has set for them. How 
 the waters were gathered together at first, 
 and how they are still bound and limited by 
 the same Almighty had that first confined them, 
 are elegantly described, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:6-9">Ps. civ. 6-9</A>,
 and are there mentioned as matter of praise.
 <I>Those that go down to the sea in ships</I> ought 
 to acknowledge daily the wisdom, power, 
 and goodness, of the Creator, in making the 
 great waters serviceable to man for trade 
 and commerce; and <I>those that tarry at home</I> 
 must own themselves indebted to him that 
 keeps the sea with bars and doors in its decreed 
 place, and stays its proud waves, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:10,11">Job xxxviii. 10, 11</A>.

 2. The dry land was 
 made to appear, and emerge out of the waters, 
 and was called <I>earth,</I> and <I>given to the children 
 of men.</I> The earth, it seems, was in being 
 before; but it was of no use, because it was 
 under water. Thus many of God's gifts are 
 received in vain, because they are buried; 
 make them to appear, and they become serviceable. 
 We who, to this day, enjoy the 
 benefit of the dry land (though, since this, 
 it was once deluged, and dried again) must 
 own ourselves tenants to, and dependents 
 upon, that God whose <I>hands formed the dry 
 land,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:5,Jon+1:9">Ps. xcv. 5; Jonah i. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the earth was furnished for the 
 maintenance and support of man, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 Present provision was now made, by the immediate 
 products of the upstart earth, which,
 in obedience to God's command, was no 
 sooner made than it became fruitful, and 
 brought forth grass for the cattle and herb 
 for the service of man. Provision was likewise 
 made for time to come, by the perpetuating 
 of the several kinds of vegetables, 
 which are numerous, various, and all curious, 
 and every one <I>having its seed in itself after its 
 kind,</I> that, during the continuance of man 
 upon the earth, food might be fetched out of 
 the earth for his use and benefit. <I>Lord, 
 what is man, that he is thus visited and regarded</I>--that 
 such care should be taken, and 
 such provision made, for the support and 
 preservation of those guilty and obnoxious 
 lives which have been a thousand times 
 forfeited! Observe here, 
 
 1. That not only 
 the earth is the Lord's, but <I>the fulness thereof,</I> 
 and he is the rightful owner and sovereign 
 disposer, not only of it, but of all its furniture. 
 The earth was <I>emptiness</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 but now, by a word's speaking, it has become 
 full of God's riches, and his they are still--<I>his 
 corn and his wine, his wool and his flax,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Hos. ii. 9</A>.
 Though the use of them is allowed 
 to us, the property still remains in 
 him, and to his service and honour they 
 must be used. 
 
 2. That common providence 
 is a continued creation, and in it <I>our Father 
 worketh hitherto.</I> The earth still remains 
 under the efficacy of this command, to bring 
 forth grass, and herbs, and its annual products; 
 and though, being according to the 
 common course of nature, these are not 
 standing miracles, yet they are standing instances 
 of the unwearied power and unexhausted 
 goodness of the world's great Maker 
 and Master. 
 
 3. That though God, ordinarily, 
 makes use of the agency of second 
 causes, according to their nature, yet he 
 neither needs them nor is tied to them; for, 
 though the precious fruits of the earth are 
 usually brought forth by the influences of 
 the sun and moon 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:14">Deut. xxxiii. 14</A>),
 yet here 
 we find the earth bearing a great abundance

 <A NAME="Page7"> </A>

 of fruit, probable ripe fruit, before the sun 
 and moon were made. 
 
 4. That it is good to 
 provide things necessary before we have 
 occasion to use them: before the beasts and 
 man were made, here were grass and herbs 
 prepared for them. God thus dealt wisely 
 and graciously with man; let not man then 
 be foolish and unwise for himself. 
 
 5. That 
 God must have the glory of all the benefit 
 we receive from the products of the earth, 
 either for food or physic. It is he that <I>hears 
 the heavens when they hear the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+2:21,22">Hos. ii. 21, 22</A>.
 And if we have, through grace, an 
 interest in him who is the fountain, when 
 the streams are dried up and the <I>fig-tree doth 
 not blossom</I> we may rejoice in him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And God said, Let there be 
 lights in the firmament of the heaven 
 to divide the day from the night; and 
 let them be for signs, and for seasons, 
 and for days, and years:
 &nbsp; 15 And let 
 them be for lights in the firmament 
 of the heaven to give light upon the 
 earth: and it was so.
 &nbsp; 16 And God 
 made two great lights; the greater 
 light to rule the day, and the lesser 
 light to rule the night: <I>he made</I> the 
 stars also.
 &nbsp; 17 And God set them in 
 the firmament of the heaven to give
 light upon the earth,
 &nbsp; 18 And to 
 rule over the day and over the night, 
 and to divide the light from the darkness: 
 and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
 &nbsp; 19 And the evening and the morning 
 were the fourth day.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the history of the fourth day's 
 work, the creating of the sun, moon, and 
 stars, which are here accounted for, not as 
 they are in themselves and in their own nature, 
 to satisfy the curious, but as they are 
 in relation to this earth, to which they serve 
 as lights; and this is enough to furnish us 
 with matter for praise and thanksgiving. 
 Holy Job mentions this as an instance of the 
 glorious power of God, that <I>by the Spirit he 
 hath garnished the heavens</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:13">Job xxvi. 13</A>);
 and here we have an account of that garniture 
 which is not only so much the beauty of 
 the upper world, but so much the blessing of 
 this lower; for though heaven is high, yet 
 has it respect to this earth, and therefore 
 should have respect from it. Of the creation 
 of the lights of heaven we have an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>,
 where we have 
 
 1. The command given concerning them: 
 <I>Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven.</I> 
 God had said, <I>Let there be light</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 and there was light; but this was, as it were, a 
 chaos of light, scattered and confused: now 
 it was collected and modelled, and made into 
 several luminaries, and so rendered both 
 more glorious and more serviceable. God is 
 the God of order, and not of confusion; and, 
 as he is light, so he is the Father and former 
 of lights. Those lights were to be <I>in the 
 firmament of heaven,</I> that vast expanse which 
 encloses the earth, and is conspicuous to all; 
 for <I>no man, when he has lighted a candle, 
 puts it under a bushel, but on a candlestick</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:16">Luke viii. 16</A>),
 and a stately golden candlestick 
 the firmament of heaven is, from which 
 these candles give light <I>to all that are in the 
 house.</I> The firmament itself is spoken of as 
 having a brightness of its own 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:3">Dan. xii. 3</A>),
 but this was not sufficient to give light to the 
 earth; and perhaps for this reason it is not 
 expressly said of the second day's work, in 
 which the firmament was made, that it was 
 good, because, till it was adorned with these 
 lights on the fourth day, it had not become 
 serviceable to man. 
 
 2. The use they were 
 intended to be of to this earth. 
 
 (1.) They 
 must be for the distinction of times, of day 
 and night, summer and winter, which are 
 interchanged by the motion of the sun, whose 
 rising makes day, his setting night, his approach 
 towards our tropic summer, his recess 
 to the other winter: and thus, <I>under the 
 sun,</I> there is <I>a season to every purpose,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 1</A>.

 (2.) They must be for the direction of 
 actions. They are for signs of the change 
 of weather, that the husbandman may order 
 his affairs with discretion, foreseeing, by the 
 face of the sky, when second causes have begun 
 to work, whether it will be fair or foul, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:2,3">Matt. xvi. 2, 3</A>.
 They do also <I>give light upon 
 the earth,</I> that we may <I>walk</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:9">John xi. 9</A>),
 and <I>work</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:4">John ix. 4</A>).
 according as the duty of 
 every day requires. The lights of heaven do 
 not shine for themselves, nor for the world 
 of spirits above, who need them not; but 
 they shine for us, for our pleasure and advantage. 
 Lord, what is man, that he should 
 be thus regarded! 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3,4">Ps. viii. 3, 4</A>.
 How ungrateful 
 and inexcusable are we, if, when God 
 has set up these lights for us to work by, we 
 sleep, or play, or trifle away the time of business, 
 and neglect the great work we were 
 sent into the world about! The lights of 
 heaven are made to serve us, and they do it 
 faithfully, and shine in their season, without 
 fail: but we are set as lights in this world to 
 serve God; and do we in like manner answer 
 the end of our creation? No, we do 
 not, our light does not shine before God as 
 his lights shine before us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:14">Matt. v. 14</A>.
 We burn our Master's candles, but do not mind 
 our Master's work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In particular, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe, The lights of heaven are the 
 sun, moon, and stars; and all these are the 
 work of God's hands. 
 
 (1.) The sun is 
 the greatest light of all, more than a million 
 times greater than the earth, and the 
 most glorious and useful of all the lamps 
 of heaven, a noble instance of the Creator's 
 wisdom, power, and goodness, and 
 an invaluable blessing to the creatures of 
 this lower world. Let us learn from

 <A NAME="Page8"> </A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-6">Ps. xix. 1-6</A>
 how to give unto God the glory due 
 unto his name, as the Maker of the sun. 
 
 (2.) The moon is a less light, and yet is here 
 reckoned one of the greater lights, because 
 though, in regard to its magnitude and borrowed 
 light, it is inferior to many of the stars, 
 yet, by virtue of its office, as ruler of the 
 night, and in respect of its usefulness to the 
 earth, it is more excellent than they. Those 
 are most valuable that are most serviceable; 
 and those are the greater lights, not that 
 have the best gifts, but that humbly and 
 faithfully do the most good with them. 
 <I>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be 
 your minister,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:26">Matt. xx. 26</A>.
 
 (3.) <I>He made the 
 stars also,</I> which are here spoken of as they 
 appear to vulgar eyes, without distinguishing 
 between the planets and the fixed stars, or 
 accounting for their number, nature, place, 
 magnitude, motions, or influences; for the 
 scriptures were written, not to gratify our 
 curiosity and make us astronomers, but to lead 
 us to God, and make us saints. Now these 
 lights are said to <I>rule</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:16,18"><I>v.</I> 16, 18</A>);
 not that 
 they have a supreme dominion, as God has, 
 but they are deputy-governors, rulers under 
 him. Here the less light, the moon, is said 
 to rule <I>the night;</I> but in 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:9">Ps. cxxxvi. 9</A>
 the stars are mentioned as sharers in that government; 
 <I>The moon and stars to rule by 
 night.</I> No more is meant than that they 
 <I>give light,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35">Jer. xxxi. 35</A>.
 The best and most 
 honourable way of ruling is by giving light 
 and doing good: those command respect that 
 live a useful life, and so shine as lights.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Learn from all this, 
 
 (1.) The sin and 
 folly of that ancient idolatry, the worshipping 
 of the sun, moon, and stars, which, 
 some think, took rise, or countenance at 
 least, from some broken traditions in the patriarchal 
 age concerning the rule and dominion 
 of the lights of heaven. But the 
 account here given of them plainly shows 
 that they are both God's creatures and man's 
 servants; and therefore it is both a great 
 affront to God and a great reproach to ourselves 
 to make deities of them and give them 
 divine honours. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>.

 (2.) The 
 duty and wisdom of daily worshipping that 
 God who made all these things, and made 
 them to be that to us which they are. The 
 revolutions of the day and night oblige us 
 to offer the solemn sacrifice of prayer and 
 praise every morning and evening.</P>

 &nbsp; 22 And God blessed them, saying,

 in the earth.
 &nbsp; 23 And the evening and the
 morning were the fifth day.</FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Each day, hitherto, has produced very 
 noble and excellent beings, which we can 
 never sufficiently admire; but we do not 
 read of the creation of any living creature 
 till the fifth day, of which these verses give 
 us an account. The work of creation not 
 only proceeded gradually from one thing to 
 another, but rose and advanced gradually 
 from that which was less excellent to that 
 which was more so, teaching us to press 
 towards perfection and endeavour that our 
 last works may be our best works. It was 
 on the fifth day that the fish and fowl were 
 created, and both out of the waters. Though 
 there is one kind of flesh of fishes, and 
 another of birds, yet they were made together, 
 and both out of the waters; for the power of 
 the first Cause can produce very different 
 effects from the same second causes. Observe, 
 
 1. The making of the fish and fowl, 
 at first, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 God commanded them to 
 be produced. He said, <I>Let the waters bring 
 forth abundantly;</I> not as if the waters had 
 any productive power of their own, but, "Let 
 them be brought into being, the fish in the 
 waters and the fowl out of them." This 
 command he himself executed: <I>God created 
 great whales,</I> &c. Insects, which perhaps
 are as various and as numerous as any species 
 of animals, and their structure as curious, 
 were part of this day's work, some of them 
 being allied to the fish and others to the 
 fowl. Mr. Boyle (I remember) says he admires 
 the Creator's wisdom and power as 
 much in an ant as in an elephant. Notice is 
 here taken of the various sorts of fish and 
 fowl, each after their kind, and of the great 
 numbers of both that were produced, for the 
 waters brought forth abundantly; and particular 
 mention if made of great whales, the 
 largest of fishes, whose bulk and strength, 
 exceeding that of any other animal, are remarkable 
 proofs of the power and greatness 
 of the Creator. The express notice here 
 taken of the whale, above all the rest, seems 
 sufficient to determine what animal is meant 
 by the Leviathan, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1">Job xli. :1</A>.
 The curious 
 formation of the bodies of animals, their different 
 sizes, shapes, and natures, with the 
 admirable powers of the sensitive life with 
 which they are endued, when duly considered, 
 serve, not only to silence and shame the 
 objections of atheists and infidels, but to 
 raise high thoughts and high praises of God 
 in pious and devout souls, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:25">Ps. civ. 25</A>,
 &c.
 
 2. The blessing of them, in order to their 
 continuance. Life is a wasting thing. Its 
 strength is not the strength of stones. It is 
 a candle that will burn out, if it be not first 
 blown out; and therefore the wise Creator 
 not only made the individuals, but provided

 <A NAME="Page9"> </A>

 for the propagation of the several kinds; <I>God 
 blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 God will bless his own works, and 
 not forsake them; and <I>what he does shall be 
 for a perpetuity,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.
 The power of 
 God's providence preserves all things, as 
 at first his creating power produced them. 
 Fruitfulness is the effect of God's blessing 
 and must be ascribed to it; the multiplying 
 of the fish and fowl, from year to year, is still 
 the fruit of this blessing. Well, let us give 
 to God the glory of the continuance of these 
 creatures to this day for the benefit of man. 
 See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:7,9">Job xii. 7, 9</A>.
 It is a pity that fishing 
 and fowling, recreations innocent in themselves, 
 should ever be abused to divert any 
 from God and their duty, while they are 
 capable of being improved to lead us to the 
 contemplation of the wisdom, power, and 
 goodness, of him that made all these things, 
 and to engage us to stand in awe of him, as 
 the fish and fowl do of us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And God said, Let the earth 
 bring forth the living creature after 
 his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, 
 and beast of the earth after his kind: 
 and it was so.
 &nbsp; 25 And God made 
 the beast of the earth after his kind,

 We have here the first part of the sixth 
 day's work. The sea was, the day before, 
 replenished with its fish, and the air with its 
 fowl; and this day were made the beasts of 
 the earth, the cattle, and the creeping things 
 that pertain to the earth. Here, as before, 
 
 1. <I>The Lord gave the word;</I> he said, <I>Let 
 the earth bring forth,</I> not as if the earth had 
 any such prolific virtue as to produce these 
 animals, or as if God resigned his creating 
 power to it; but, "Let these creatures now 
 come into being upon the earth, and out of 
 it, in their respective kinds, conformable to 
 the ideas of them in the divine counsels concerning 
 their creation." 
 
 2. He also did the 
 work; he made them all after their kind, 
 not only of divers shapes, but of divers natures, 
 manners, food, and fashions--some to 
 be tame about the house, others to be wild 
 in the fields--some living upon grass and 
 herbs, others upon flesh--some harmless, and 
 others ravenous--some bold, and others timorous--some 
 for man's service, and not his 
 sustenance, as the horse--others for his sustenance, 
 and not his service, as the sheep--others 
 for both, as the ox--and some for 
 neither, as the wild beasts. In all this appears 
 the manifold wisdom of the Creator.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 And God said, Let us make man 
 in our image, after our likeness: 
 and let them have dominion over the 
 fish of the sea, and over the fowl of 
 the air, and over the cattle, and over 
 all the earth, and over every creeping 
 thing that creepeth upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 27 So God created man in his <I>own</I> 
 image, in the image of God created 
 he him; male and female created he 
 them.
 &nbsp; 28 And God blessed them, 
 and God said unto them, Be fruitful,
 and multiply, and replenish the earth, 
 and subdue it: and have dominion 
 over the fish of the sea, and over the 
 fowl of the air, and over every living 
 thing that moveth upon the earth.</FONT></P>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the second part of the sixth 
 day's work, the creation of man, which we are, 
 in a special manner, concerned to take notice 
 of, that we may know ourselves. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That man was made last of all the creatures, 
 that it might not be suspected that he 
 had been, any way, a helper to God in the 
 creation of the world: that question must be 
 for ever humbling and mortifying to him, 
 <I>Where wast thou,</I> or any of thy kind, <I>when I 
 laid the foundations of the earth?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:4">Job xxxviii. 4</A>.
 Yet it was both an honour and a favour to 
 him that he was made last: an honour, for 
 the method of the creation was to advance 
 from that which was less perfect to that which 
 was more so; and a favour, for it was not fit 
 he should be lodged in the palace designed 
 for him till it was completely fitted up and 
 furnished for his reception. Man, as soon 
 as he was made, had the whole visible creation 
 before him, both to contemplate and to take 
 the comfort of. Man was made the same 
 day that the beasts were, because his body 
 was made of the same earth with theirs; and, 
 while he is in the body, he inhabits the same 
 earth with them. God forbid that by indulging 
 the body and the desires of it we 
 should make ourselves like the beasts that 
 perish!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That man's creation was a more signal 
 and immediate act of divine wisdom and 
 power than that of the other creatures. The 
 narrative of it is introduced with something 
 of solemnity, and a manifest distinction from 
 the rest. Hitherto, it had been said, "Let 
 there be light," and "Let there be a firmament," 
 and "Let the earth, or waters, bring 
 forth" such a thing; but now the word of 
 command is turned into a word of consultation, 
 "<I>Let us make man,</I> for whose sake the
 rest of the creatures were made: this is a 
 work we must take into our own hands." 
 In the former he speaks as one having authority, 
 in this as one having affection; for 
 his <I>delights were with the sons of men,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31">Prov. viii. 31</A>.
 It should seem as if this were the 
 work which he longed to be at; as if he had 
 said, "Having at last settled the preliminaries, 
 let us now apply ourselves to the 
 business, <I>Let us make man.</I>" Man was to be 
 a creature different from all that had been 
 
 <A NAME="Page10"> </A>

 hitherto made. Flesh and spirit, heaven and 
 earth, must be put together in him, and he 
 must be allied to both worlds. And therefore 
 God himself not only undertakes to make 
 him, but is pleased so to express himself as 
 if he called a council to consider of the 
 making of him: <I>Let us make man.</I> The 
 three persons of the Trinity, Father, Son, and 
 Holy Ghost, consult about it and concur in 
 it, because man, when he was made, was to 
 be dedicated and devoted to Father, Son and 
 Holy Ghost. Into that great name we are, 
 with good reason, baptized, for to that great 
 name we owe our being. Let him rule man 
 who said, <I>Let us make man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That man was made in God's image 
 and after his likeness, two words to express 
 the same thing and making each other the 
 more expressive; <I>image</I> and <I>likeness</I> denote 
 the likest image, the nearest resemblance of 
 any of the visible creatures. Man was not 
 made in the likeness of any creature that 
 went before him, but in the likeness of his 
 Creator; yet still between God and man 
 there is an infinite distance. Christ only is 
 the <I>express</I> image of God's person, as the 
 Son of his Father, having the same nature. 
 It is only some of God's honour that is put 
 upon man, who is God's image only as the 
 shadow in the glass, or the king's impress 
 upon the coin. God's image upon man consists 
 in these three things:--
 
 1. In his nature 
 and constitution, not those of his body (for 
 God has not a body), but those of his soul. 
 This honour indeed God has put upon the 
 body of man, that the Word was made flesh, 
 the Son of God was clothed with a body like 
 ours and will shortly clothe ours with a glory 
 like that of his. And this we may safely say, 
 That he by whom God made the worlds, not 
 only the great world, but man the little 
 world, formed the human body, at the first, 
 according to the platform he designed for 
 himself in the fulness of time. But it is the 
 soul, the great soul, of man, that does especially 
 bear God's image. The soul is a spirit, 
 an intelligent immortal spirit, an influencing 
 active spirit, herein resembling God, the Father 
 of Spirits, and the soul of the world. 
 <I>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.</I> 
 The soul of man, considered in its three 
 noble faculties, understanding, will, and active 
 power, is perhaps the brightest clearest looking-glass 
 in nature, wherein to see God. 
 
 2. In his place and authority: <I>Let us make man 
 in our image, and let him have dominion.</I> As 
 he has the government of the inferior creatures, 
 he is, as it were, God's representative, 
 or viceroy, upon earth; they are not capable 
 of fearing and serving God, therefore God 
 has appointed them to fear and serve man.
 Yet his government of himself by the freedom 
 of his will has in it more of God's image 
 than his government of the creatures. 
 
 3. In 
 his purity and rectitude. God's image upon 
 man consists in knowledge, righteousness, 
 and true holiness, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:24,Col+3:10">Eph. iv. 24; Col. iii. 10</A>.
 He was upright, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:29">Eccl. vii. 29</A>.
 He had an 
 habitual conformity of all his natural powers 
 to the whole will of God. His understanding 
 saw divine things clearly and truly, and 
 there were no errors nor mistakes in his 
 knowledge. His will complied readily and 
 universally with the will of God, without reluctancy 
 or resistance. His affections were 
 all regular, and he had no inordinate appetites 
 or passions. His thoughts were easily 
 brought and fixed to the best subjects, and 
 there was no vanity nor ungovernableness in 
 them. All the inferior powers were subject 
 to the dictates and directions of the superior, 
 without any mutiny or rebellion. Thus holy, 
 thus happy, were our first parents, in having 
 the image of God upon them. And this 
 honour, put upon man at first, is a good
 reason why we should not speak ill one of 
 another 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:9">Jam. iii. 9</A>),
 nor do ill one to another 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>),
 and a good reason why we should 
 not debase ourselves to the service of sin, and 
 why we should devote ourselves to God's 
 service. But how art thou fallen, O son of 
 the morning! How is this image of God 
 upon man defaced! How small are the remains 
 of it, and how great the ruins of it! 
 The Lord renew it upon our souls by his 
 sanctifying grace!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That man was made male and female, 
 and blessed with the blessing of fruitfulness 
 and increase. God said, <I>Let us make man,</I> 
 and immediately it follows, <I>So God created 
 man;</I> he performed what he resolved. With 
 us saying and doing are two things; but they 
 are not so with God. He created him male 
 and female, Adam and Eve--Adam first, out 
 of earth, and Eve out of his side, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:21-23"><I>ch.</I> ii</A>.
 It should seem that of the rest of the creatures 
 God made many couples, but of man <I>did not 
 he make one?</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>),
 though he had the 
 residue of the Spirit, whence Christ gathers 
 an argument against divorce, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:4,5">Matt. xix. 4, 5</A>.
 Our first father, Adam, was confined to one 
 wife; and, if he had put her away, there was 
 no other for him to marry, which plainly intimated
 that the bond of marriage was not to 
 be dissolved at pleasure. Angels were not 
 made male and female, for they were not to 
 propagate their kind 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:34-36">Luke xx. 34-36</A>);
 but man was made so, that the nature might be 
 propagated and the race continued. Fires 
 and candles, the luminaries of this lower 
 world, because they waste, and go out, have 
 a power to light more; but it is not so with 
 the lights of heaven: stars do not kindle 
 stars. God made but one male and one female, 
 that all the nations of men might know 
 themselves to be made of one blood, descendants 
 from one common stock, and might 
 thereby be induced to love one another. 
 God, having made them capable of transmitting 
 the nature they had received, said to 
 them, <I>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish 
 the earth.</I> Here he gave them, 
 
 1. A large 
 inheritance: <I>Replenish the earth;</I> it is this 
 that is bestowed upon the children of men. 
 
 <A NAME="Page11"> </A>

 They were made <I>to dwell upon the face of all 
 the earth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>.
 This is the place in 
 which God has set man to be the servant of 
 his providence in the government of the inferior 
 creatures, and, as it were, the intelligence 
 of this orb; to be the receiver of God's 
 bounty, which other creatures live upon, but 
 do not know it; to be likewise the collector 
 of his praises in this lower world, and to pay 
 them into the exchequer above 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:10">Ps. cxlv. 10</A>);
 and, lastly, to be a probationer for a better 
 state. 
 
 2. A numerous lasting family, to enjoy 
 this inheritance, pronouncing a blessing 
 upon them, in virtue of which their posterity 
 should extend to the utmost corners of the 
 earth and continue to the utmost period of 
 time. Fruitfulness and increase depend upon 
 the blessing of God: Obed-edom had eight 
 sons, <I>for God blessed him,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+26:5">1 Chron. xxvi. 5</A>.
 It is owing to this blessing, which God commanded 
 at first, that the race of mankind is 
 still in being, and that as <I>one generation passeth 
 away another cometh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God gave to man, when he had 
 made him, a dominion over the inferior 
 creatures, <I>over the fish of the sea and over the 
 fowl of the air.</I> Though man provides for 
 neither, he has power over both, much more 
 <I>over every living thing that moveth upon the 
 earth,</I> which are more under his care and
 within his reach. God designed hereby to
 put an honour upon man, that he might find
 himself the more strongly obliged to bring
 honour to his Maker. This dominion is
 very much diminished and lost by the fall;
 yet God's providence continues so much of it
 to the children of men as is necessary to the
 safety and support of their lives, and God's
 grace has given to the saints a new and
 better title to the creature than that which
 was forfeited by sin; for all is ours if we are
 Christ's,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the third part of the sixth 
 day's work, which was not any new creation, 
 but a gracious provision of food for all flesh, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:25">Ps. cxxxvi. 25</A>.
 He that made man and
 beast thus took care to preserve both,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>.
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Food provided for man, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 Herbs and fruits must be his meat, including corn 
 and all the products of the earth; these were 
 allowed him, but (it should seem) not flesh, 
 till after the flood, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:3"><I>ch.</I> ix. 3</A>.
 And before the 
 earth was deluged, much more before it was 
 cursed for man's sake, its fruits, no doubt, 
 were more pleasing to the taste and more 
 strengthening and nourishing to the body 
 than marrow and fatness, and all the portion 
 of the king's meat, are now. See here, 
 
 1. That which should make us humble. As we 
 were made out of the earth, so we are maintained 
 out of it. Once indeed men did eat 
 angels' food, bread from heaven; but they 
 died 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:49">John vi. 49</A>);
 it was to them but as 
 food out of the earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:14">Ps. civ. 14</A>.
 There is 
 meat that endures to everlasting life; the 
 Lord evermore give us this. 
 
 2. That which 
 should make us thankful. The Lord is for 
 the body; from him we receive all the supports 
 and comforts of this life, and to him 
 we must give thanks. He gives us all things 
 richly to enjoy, not only for necessity, but 
 plenty, dainties, and varieties, for ornament 
 and delight. How much are we indebted! 
 How careful should we be, as we live upon 
 God's bounty, to live to his glory! 
 
 3. That 
 which should make us temperate and content 
 with our lot. Though Adam had dominion 
 given him over fish and fowl, yet God 
 confined him, in his food, to herbs and 
 fruits; and he never complained of it. 
 Though afterwards he coveted forbidden 
 fruit, for the sake of the wisdom and knowledge 
 he promised himself from it, yet we
 never read that he coveted forbidden flesh. 
 If God give us food for our lives, let us not, 
 with murmuring Israel, ask food for our 
 lusts,

 II. Food provided for the beasts, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 <I>Doth God take care for oxen?</I> Yes, certainly, 
 he provides food convenient for them, 
 and not for oxen only, which were used in 
 his sacrifices and man's service, but even the 
 young lions and the young ravens are the 
 care of his providence; they ask and have 
 their meat from God. Let us give to God 
 the glory of his bounty to the inferior creatures, 
 that all are fed, as it were, at his table, 
 every day. He is a great housekeeper, a 
 very rich and bountiful one, that satisfies the 
 desire of every living thing. Let this encourage 
 God's people to cast their care upon 
 him, and not to be solicitous respecting what 
 they shall eat and what they shall drink. 
 He that provided for Adam without his 
 care, and still provides for all the creatures 
 without their care, will not let those that 
 trust him want any good thing,

 He that feeds his birds will not starve his 
 babes.</P>

 We have here the approbation and conclusion 
 of the whole work of creation. As for 
 God, his work is perfect; and if he begin 
 he will also make an end, in providence and 
 grace, as well as here in creation. Observe,</P>

 I. The review God took of his work: He 
 <I>saw every thing that he had made.</I> So he 
 does still; all the works of his hands are 
 under his eye. He that made all sees all; 
 he that made us sees us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:1-16">Ps. cxxxix. 1-16</A>.
 Omniscience cannot be separated from omnipotence. 
 <I>Known unto God are all his works,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18">Acts xv. 18</A>.
 But this was the Eternal 
 Mind's solemn reflection upon the copies of 
 its own wisdom and the products of its own 
 power. God has hereby set us an example 
 of reviewing our works. Having given us a
 power of reflection, he expects we should 
 use that power, see our way 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:23">Jer. ii. 23</A>),
 and think of it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:59">Ps. cxix. 59</A>.
 When we have 
 finished a day's work, and are entering upon 
 the rest of the night, we should commune 
 with our own hearts about what we have 
 been doing that day; so likewise when we 
 have finished a week's work, and are entering 
 upon the sabbath-rest, we should thus 
 prepare to meet our God; and when we are 
 finishing our life's work, and are entering 
 upon our rest in the grave, that is a time to 
 bring to remembrance, that we may die repenting, 
 and so take leave of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The complacency God took in his work. 
 When we come to review our works we find, 
 to our shame, that much has been very bad; 
 but, when God reviewed his, all was very 
 good. He did not pronounce it good till he 
 had seen it so, to teach us not to answer a 
 matter before we hear it. The work of 
 creation was a very good work. All that God 
 made was well-made, and there was no flaw 
 nor defect in it. 
 
 1. It was good. Good, for 
 it is all agreeable to the mind of the Creator, 
 just as he would have it to be; when the 
 transcript came to be compared with the 
 great original, it was found to be exact, no 
 errata in it, not one misplaced stroke. Good, 
 for it answers the end of its creation, and is 
 fit for the purpose for which it was designed. 
 Good, for it is serviceable to man, whom God 
 had appointed lord of the visible creation. 
 Good, for it is all for God's glory; there is that 
 in the whole visible creation which is a demonstration 
 of God's being and perfections, and 
 which tends to beget, in the soul of man, a 
 religious regard to him and veneration of 
 him. 
 
 2. It was very good. Of each day's 
 work (except the second) it was said that it 
 was good, but now, it is very good. For, 
 
 (1.) Now man was made, who was the chief of 
 the ways of God, who was designed to be the 
 visible image of the Creator's glory and the 
 mouth of the creation in his praises. 
 
 (2.) Now 
 all was made; every part was good, but all 
 together very good. The glory and goodness, 
 the beauty and harmony, of God's works, 
 both of providence and grace, as this of creation, 
 will best appear when they are perfected. 
 When the top-stone is brought forth we shall 
 cry, <I>Grace, grace, unto it,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7">Zech. iv. 7</A>.
 Therefore judge nothing before the time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The time when this work was concluded: 
 <I>The evening and the morning were the 
 sixth day;</I> so that in six days God made the 
 world. We are not to think but that God 
 could have made the world in an instant. 
 He said that, <I>Let there be light, and there was 
 light,</I> could have said, "Let there be a 
 world," and there would have been a world, 
 <I>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,</I> as at 
 the resurrection, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52">1 Cor. xv. 52</A>.
 But he did 
 it in six days, that he might show himself a 
 free-agent, doing his own work both in his 
 own way and in his own time,--that his wisdom, 
 power, and goodness, might appear to 
 us, and be meditated upon by us, the more 
 distinctly,--and that he might set us an example 
 of working six days and resting the 
 seventh; it is therefore made the reason of 
 the fourth commandment. So much would 
 the sabbath conduce to the keeping up of religion 
 in the world that God had an eye to it 
 in the timing of his creation. And now, as 
 God reviewed his work, let us review our 
 meditations upon it, and we shall find them 
 very lame and defective, and our praises low 
 and flat; let us therefore stir up ourselves, 
 and all that is within us, to <I>worship him that 
 made the heaven, earth, and sea, and the 
 fountains of waters,</I> according to the tenour 
 of the everlasting gospel, which is preached 
 to every nation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7">Rev. xiv. 6, 7</A>.
 All his works, 
 in all places of his dominion, do bless him; 
 and, therefore, <I>bless thou the Lord, O my soul!</I></P>
