 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have four things in the story of this chapter.

 I. A war with
 the king of Sodom and his allies,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.
 II. The captivity 
 of Lot in that war,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:12">ver. 12</A>.
 III. Abram's rescue of Lot from 
 that captivity, with the victory he obtained over the conquerors,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.
 IV. Abram's return from the expedition,
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:17">ver. 17</A>),
 with an account of what passed, 
 
 1. Between him and the king 
 of Salem,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.
 2. Between him and the king of Sodom,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.
 So that here we have that promise to Abram in part 
 fulfilled, that God would make his name great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass in the days 
 of Amraphel king of Shinar,
 Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer 
 king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
 &nbsp; 2 <I>That these</I> made war with 
 Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha 
 king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of 
 Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, 
 and the king of Bela, which is 
 Zoar.
 &nbsp; 3 All these were joined together 
 in the vale of Siddim, which is 
 the salt sea.
 &nbsp; 4 Twelve years they 
 served Chedorlaomer, and in the 
 thirteenth year they rebelled.
 &nbsp; 5 And 
 in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, 
 and the kings that <I>were</I> with 
 him, and smote the Rephaims in 
 Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims 
 in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh
 Kiriathaim,
 &nbsp; 6 And the Horites in 
 their mount Seir, unto El-paran,
 which <I>is</I> by the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 7 And 
 they returned, and came to En-mishpat, 
 which <I>is</I> Kadesh, and smote all the 
 country of the Amalekites, and also the
 Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
 &nbsp; 8 And there went out the 
 king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, 
 and the king of Admah, and 
 the king of Zeboiim, and the king of 
 Bela (the same <I>is</I> Zoar;) and they 
 joined battle with them in the vale of 
 Siddim;
 &nbsp; 9 With Chedorlaomer the 
 king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
 nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, 
 and Arioch king of Ellasar; four 
 kings with five.
 &nbsp; 10 And the vale of 
 Siddim <I>was full of</I> slimepits; and 
 the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah 
 fled, and fell there; and they that remained 
 fled to the mountain.
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 they took all the goods of Sodom and 
 Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and 
 went their way.
 &nbsp; 12 And they took Lot, 
 Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in
 Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the first war 
 that ever we read of in scripture, which 
 (though the wars of the nations make the 
 greatest figure in history) we should not have 
 had the history of if Abram and Lot had not 
 been concerned in it. Now, concerning this 
 war, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parties engaged in it. The invaders 
 were four kings, two of them no less 
 than kings of Shinar and Elam (that is, 
 Chaldea and Persia), yet probably not the 
 sovereign princes of those great kingdoms in 
 their own persons, but either officers under
 them, or rather the heads and leaders of some 
 colonies which came out of those great nations, 
 and settled themselves near Sodom, but retained 
 the names of the countries from which 
 they had their origin. The invaded were the 
 kings of five cities that lay near together in 
 the plain of Jordan, namely, Sodom, Gomorrah, 
 Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar. Four of 
 them are named, but not the fifth, the king
 of Zoar or Bela, either because he was much 
 more mean and inconsiderable or because he
 was much more wicked and inglorious than 
 the rest, and worthy to be forgotten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The occasion of this war was the revolt 
 of the five kings from under the government 
 of Chedorlaomer. Twelve years they served 
 him. Small joy they had of their fruitful 
 land, while thus they were tributaries to a 
 foreign power, and could not call what they 
 had their own. Rich countries are a desirable 
 prey, and idle luxurious countries are 
 an easy prey, to growing greatness. The 
 Sodomites were the posterity of Canaan whom 
 Noah had pronounced a servant to Shem, 
 from whom Elam descended; thus soon did
 that prophecy begin to be fulfilled. In the
 thirteenth year, beginning to be weary of 
 their subjection, they rebelled, denied their 
 tribute, and attempted to shake off the yoke 
 and retrieve their ancient liberties. In the 
 fourteenth year, after some pause and preparation, 
 Chedorlaomer, in conjunction with 
 his allies, set himself to chastise and reduce 
 the rebels, and, since he could not have it 
 otherwise, to fetch his tribute from them on 
 the point of his sword. Note, Pride, covetousness, 
 and ambition, are the lusts from 
 which wars and fightings come. To these 
 insatiable idols the blood of thousands has 
 been sacrificed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The progress and success of the war. 
 The four kings laid the neighbouring countries 
 waste and enriched themselves with the 
 spoil of them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>),
 upon the alarm of 
 which it had been the wisdom of the king of 
 Sodom to submit, and desire conditions of 
 peace; for how could he grapple with an 
 enemy thus flushed with victory? But he 
 would rather venture the utmost extremity 
 than yield, and it sped accordingly. <I>Quos 
 Deus destruet eos dementat--Those whom God 
 means to destroy he delivers up to infatuation.</I> 
 
 1. The forces of the king of Sodom and his 
 allies were routed; and, it should seem, many 
 of them perished in the slime-pits who had 
 escaped the sword,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 In all places we 

 <A NAME="Page95"> </A>

 are surrounded with deaths of various kinds, 
 especially in the field of battle. 
 
 2. The cities 
 were plundered,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 All the goods of 
 Sodom, and particularly their stores and provisions 
 of victuals, were carried off by the 
 conquerors. Note, When men abuse the 
 gifts of a bountiful providence to gluttony 
 and excess, it is just with God, and his usual 
 way, by some judgment or other to strip 
 them of that which they have so abused, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8,9">Hos. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 3. Lot was carried captive,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 They took Lot among the rest, and his goods.
 Now Lot may here be considered,

 (1.) As
 sharing with his neighbours in this common
 calamity. Though he was himself a righteous
 man, and (which is here expressly noticed)
 Abram's brother's son, yet he was involved
 with the rest in all this trouble. Note, <I>All things
 come alike to all,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>.
 The best of 
 men cannot promise themselves an exemption 
 from the greatest troubles in this life; neither 
 from our own piety nor our relation to those that 
 are the favourites of heaven will be our security, 
 when God's judgments are abroad. 
 Note, further, Many an honest man fares the 
 worse for his wicked neighbours. It is therefore 
 our wisdom to separate ourselves, or at 
 least to distinguish ourselves, from them 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:17">2 Cor. vi. 17</A>),
 and so deliver ourselves,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.
 
 (2.) As smarting for the foolish 
 choice he made of a settlement here. This 
 is plainly intimated when it is said, <I>They took 
 Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom.</I> 
 So near a relation of Abram should have 
 been a companion and disciple of Abram, and 
 should have abode by his tents; but, if he 
 choose to dwell in Sodom, he must thank 
 himself if he share in Sodom's calamities. 
 Note, When we go out of the way of our 
 duty we put ourselves from under God's protection, 
 and cannot expect that the choices 
 which are made by our lusts should issue to 
 our comfort. Particular mention is made of 
 their taking Lot's <I>goods,</I> those goods which 
 had occasioned his contest with Abram and 
 his separation from him. Note, It is just 
 with God to deprive us of those enjoyments 
 by which we have suffered ourselves to be 
 deprived of our enjoyment of him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And there came one that had 
 escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; 
 for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre 
 the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and 
 brother of Aner: and these <I>were</I> confederate 
 with Abram.
 &nbsp; 14 And when 
 Abram heard that his brother was 
 taken captive, he armed his trained 
 <I>servants,</I> born in his own house, three
 hundred and eighteen, and pursued 
 <I>them</I> unto Dan.
 &nbsp; 15 And he divided 
 himself against them, he and his servants, 
 by night, and smote them, and 
 pursued them unto Hobah, which <I>is</I> 
 on the left hand of Damascus.
 &nbsp; 16 And he brought back all the goods, 
 and also brought again his brother 
 Lot, and his goods, and the women 
 also, and the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the only military 
 action we ever find Abram engaged in, 
 and this he was prompted to, not by his 
 avarice or ambition, but purely by a principle 
 of charity; it was not to enrich himself, but 
 to help his friend. Never was any military 
 expedition undertaken, prosecuted, and finished, 
 more honourably than this of Abram's. Here 
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tidings brought him of his kinsman's 
 distress. Providence so ordered it 
 that he now sojourned not far off, that he 
 might be a very present help. 
 
 1. He is here 
 called <I>Abram the Hebrew,</I> that is, the son and 
 follower of Heber, in whose family the profession 
 of the true religion was kept up in 
 that degenerate age. Abram herein acted 
 like a Hebrew--in a manner not unworthy 
 of the name and character of a religious professor. 
 
 2. The tidings were brought by one 
 that had escaped with his life for a prey. 
 Probably he was a Sodomite, and as bad as 
 the worst of them; yet knowing Abram's 
 relation to Lot, and concern for him, he implores 
 his help, and hopes to speed for Lot's 
 sake. Note, The worst of men, in the day 
 of their trouble, will be glad to claim 
 acquaintance with those that are wise and 
 good, and so get an interest in them. The 
 rich man in hell called Abram <I>Father;</I> and 
 the foolish virgins made court to the wise for 
 a share of their oil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparations he made for this expedition. 
 The cause was plainly good, his 
 call to engage in it was clear, and therefore, 
 with all speed, he <I>armed his trained servants, 
 born in his house,</I> to the number of <I>three hundred 
 and eighteen</I>--a great family, but a small 
 army, about as many as Gideon's that routed 
 the Midianites, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:7">Judg. vii. 7</A>.
 He drew out 
 his <I>trained</I> servants, or his <I>catechised</I> servants, 
 not only instructed in the art of war, which 
 was then far short of the perfection which 
 later and worse ages have improved it to, but 
 instructed in the principles of religion; for 
 Abram commanded his household to keep 
 the way of the Lord. This shows that Abram 
 was, 
 
 1. A great man, who had so many servants 
 depending upon him, and employed by 
 him, which was not only his strength and 
 honour, but gave him a great opportunity of 
 doing good, which is all that is truly valuable 
 and desirable in great places and great estates. 
 
 2. A good man, who not only served God 
 himself, but instructed all about him in the 
 service of God. Note, Those that have great 
 families have not only many bodies, but many 
 souls besides their own, to take care of and 
 provide for. Those that would be found the 
 followers of Abram must see that their servants 
 be catechised servants. 
 
 3. A wise man 
 
 <A NAME="Page96"> </A>

 for, though he was a man of peace, yet he 
 disciplined his servants for war, not knowing 
 what occasion he might have, some time or 
 other, so to employ them. Note, Though our 
 holy religion teaches us to be for peace, yet 
 it does not forbid us to provide for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His allies and confederates in this expedition. 
 He prevailed with his neighbours, 
 <I>Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre</I> (with whom he 
 kept up a fair correspondence) to go along 
 with him. It was his prudence thus to 
 strengthen his own troops with their auxiliary 
 forces; and probably they saw themselves 
 concerned, in interest, to act, as they could, 
 against this formidable power, lest their own 
 turn should be next. Note, 
 
 1. It is our wisdom 
 and duty to behave ourselves so respectfully 
 and obligingly towards all men as that, 
 whenever there is occasion, they may be willing 
 and ready to do us a kindness. 
 
 2. Those 
 who depend on God's help, yet, in times of 
 distress, ought to make use of men's help, as 
 Providence offers it; else they tempt God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His courage and conduct were very 
 remarkable. 
 
 1. There was a great deal of 
 bravery in the enterprise itself, considering 
 the disadvantages he lay under. What could 
 one family of husbandmen and shepherds do 
 against the armies of four princes, who now 
 came fresh from blood and victory? It was 
 not a vanquished, but a victorious army, that 
 he was to pursue; nor was he constrained 
 by necessity to this daring attempt, but 
 moved to it by generosity; so that, all things 
 considered, it was, for aught I know, as great 
 an instance of true courage as ever Alexander 
 or Caesar was celebrated for. Note, Religion 
 tends to make men, not cowardly, but truly 
 valiant. The righteous is bold as a lion. 
 The true Christian is the true hero. 
 
 2. There 
 was a great deal of policy in the management 
 of it. Abram was no stranger to the stratagems 
 of war: He <I>divided himself,</I> as Gideon 
 did his little army 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:16">Judg. vii. 16</A>),
 that he 
 might come upon the enemy from several 
 quarters at once, and so make his few seem 
 a great many; he made his attack by night, 
 that he might surprise them. Note, Honest 
 policy is a good friend both to our safety and 
 to our usefulness. The serpent's head (provided 
 it be nothing akin to the old serpent) may 
 well become a good Christian's body, especially 
 if it have a dove's eye in it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16">Matt. x. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His success was very considerable, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 He defeated his enemies, and 
 rescued his friends; and we do not find that 
 he sustained any loss. Note, Those that 
 venture in a good cause, with a good heart, 
 are under the special protection of a good 
 God, and have reason to hope for a good issue. 
 Again, It is all one with the Lord <I>to 
 save by many or by few,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:6">1 Sam. xiv. 6</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He rescued his kinsman; twice here he 
 is called his <I>brother Lot.</I> The remembrance 
 of the relation that was between them, both 
 by nature and grace, made him forget the 
 little quarrel that had been between them, in 
 which Lot had by no means acted well towards 
 Abram. Justly might Abram have 
 upbraided Lot with his folly in quarrelling 
 with him and removing from him, and have 
 told him that he was well enough served, he 
 might have known when he was well off; 
 but, in the charitable breast of pious Abram, 
 it is all forgiven and forgotten, and he takes 
 this opportunity to give a real proof of the 
 sincerity of his reconciliation. Note, 
 
 (1.) We ought to be ready, whenever it is in the 
 power of our hands, to succour and relieve 
 those that are in distress, especially our relations 
 and friends. <I>A brother is born for adversity,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:17">Prov. xvii. 17</A>.
 A friend in need is a 
 friend indeed. 
 
 (2.) Though others have been 
 wanting in their duty to us, yet we must not 
 therefore deny our duty to them. Some have 
 said that they can more easily forgive their 
 enemies than their friends; but we shall see 
 ourselves obliged to forgive both if we consider, 
 not only that our God, when we were enemies, 
 reconciled us, but also that he 
 <I>passeth by the transgression of the remnant of 
 his heritage,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18">Mic. vii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He rescued the rest of the captives, for 
 Lot's sake, though they were strangers to 
 him and such as he was under no obligation 
 to at all; nay, though they were Sodomites, 
 sinners before the Lord exceedingly, and 
 though, probably, he might have recovered 
 Lot alone by ransom, yet he brought back 
 all the women, and the people, and their goods,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 Note, As we have opportunity we 
 must do good to all men. Our charity must 
 be extensive, as opportunity offers itself. 
 Wherever God gives life, we must not grudge 
 the help we can give to support it. God does 
 good to the just and unjust, and so must we, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45">Matt. v. 45</A>.
 This victory which Abram obtained 
 over the kings the prophet seems to 
 refer to, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2">Isa. xli. 2</A>,
 <I>Who raised up the righteous 
 man from the east, and made him rule over 
 kings?</I> And some suggest that, as before he 
 had a title to this land by grant, so now by 
 conquest.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This paragraph begins with the mention of 
 the respect which the king of Sodom paid to 
 
 <A NAME="Page97"> </A>

 Abram at his return from the slaughter of
 the kings; but, before a particular account is
 given of this, the story of Melchizedek is
 briefly related, concerning whom observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who he was. He was <I>king of Salem</I>
 and <I>priest of the most high God;</I> and other
 glorious things are said of him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:1-10">Heb. vii. 1</A>,
 &c. 
 
 1. The rabbin, and most of our rabbinical 
 writers, conclude that Melchizedek 
 was Shem the son of Noah, who was king 
 and priest to those that descended from him, 
 according to the patriarchal model. But this 
 is not at all probable; for why should his 
 name be changed? And how came he to 
 settle in Canaan?

 2. Many Christian writers 
 have thought that this was an appearance of 
 the Son of God himself, our Lord Jesus, 
 known to Abram, at this time, by this name, 
 as, afterwards, Hagar called him by another 
 name,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 13</A>.
 He appeared to him as a 
 righteous king, owning a righteous cause, 
 and giving peace. It is difficult to imagine 
 that any mere man should be said to <I>be without 
 father, without mother, and without descent,
 having neither beginning of days nor end of 
 life,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:3">Heb. vii. 3</A>.
 It is witnessed of Melchizedek
 that he liveth, and that he abideth a
 priest continually
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:3,8"><I>v.</I> 3, 8</A>);
 nay
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),
 the apostle makes him of whom these things 
 are spoken to be our Lord who sprang out 
 of Judah. It is likewise difficult to think 
 that any mere man should, at this time, be 
 greater than Abram in the things of God, 
 that Christ should be a priest after the order 
 of any mere man, and that any human priesthood 
 should so far excel that of Aaron as it 
 is certain that Melchizedek's did. 
 
 3. The 
 most commonly received opinion is that Melchizedek 
 was a Canaanitish prince, that 
 reigned in Salem, and kept up the true religion 
 there; but, if so, why his name should 
 occur here only in all the story of Abram, 
 and why Abram should have altars of his 
 own and not attend the altars of his neighbour 
 Melchizedek who was greater than he, 
 seem unaccountable. Mr. Gregory of Oxford 
 tells us that the <I>Arabic Catena,</I> which he builds 
 much upon the authority of, gives this account 
 of Melchizedek, That he was the son of Heraclim, 
 the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, and that 
 his mother's name was Salathiel, the daughter 
 of Gomer, the son of Japheth, the son of Noah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he did. 1. He <I>brought forth 
 bread and wine,</I> for the refreshment of Abram 
 and his soldiers, and in congratulation of 
 their victory. This he did as a king, teaching 
 us to do good and to communicate, and 
 to be given to hospitality, according to our 
 ability; and representing the spiritual provisions 
 of strength and comfort which Christ 
 has laid up for us in the covenant of 
 grace for our refreshment, when we are wearied 
 with our spiritual conflicts. 
 
 2. As priest of 
 the most high God, he blessed Abram, which 
 we may suppose a greater refreshment to 
 Abram than his bread and wine were. Thus 
 God, having raised up his Son Jesus, has 
 sent him to bless us, as one having authority; 
 and those whom he blesses are blessed indeed. 
 Christ went to heaven when he was 
 blessing his disciples 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:51">Luke xxiv. 51</A>);
 for this is what he ever lives to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What he said, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 Two things were said by him:--
 
 1. He blessed Abram 
 from God: <I>Blessed be Abram, blessed of the 
 most high God,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 Observe the titles he 
 here gives to God, which are very glorious. 
 
 (1.) <I>The most high God,</I> which bespeaks his 
 absolute perfections in himself and his sovereign 
 dominion over all the creatures; he is 
 King of kings. Note, It will greatly help 
 both our faith and our reverence in prayer 
 to eye God as the most high God, and to call 
 him so. 
 
 (2.) <I>Possessor of heaven and earth,</I> 
 that is, rightful owner, and sovereign Lord, 
 of all the creatures, because he made them. 
 This bespeaks him a great God, and greatly 
 to be praised 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1</A>),
 and those a happy 
 people who have an interest in his favour and 
 love. 
 
 2. He blessed God for Abram
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 and <I>blessed be the most high God.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) In all our prayers, we must praise God, and 
 join hallelujahs with all our hosannahs. These 
 are the spiritual sacrifices we must offer up 
 daily, and upon particular occasions. 
 
 (2.) God, as the most high God, must have the 
 glory of all our victories, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:15,1Sa+7:10,12,Jdg+5:1,2,2Ch+20:21">Exod. xvii. 15; 1 Sam. vii. 10, 12; Judg. v. 1, 2; 2 Chron. xx. 21</A>.
 In them he shows himself higher 
 than our enemies
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod. xviii. 11</A>),
 and higher 
 than we; for without him we could do nothing. 
 
 (3.) We ought to give thanks for 
 others' mercies as for our own, triumphing 
 with those that triumph. 
 
 (4.) Jesus Christ, 
 our great high priest, is the Mediator both of 
 our prayers and praises, and not only offers 
 up ours, but his own for us. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21">Luke x. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What was done to him: <I>Abram gave 
 him tithes of all,</I> that is, of the spoils, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:4">Heb. vii. 4</A>.
 This may be looked upon, 
 
 1. As a 
 gratuity presented to Melchizedek, by way 
 of return for his tokens of respect. Note, 
 Those that receive kindness should show 
 kindness. Gratitude is one of nature's laws. 
 
 2. As an offering vowed and dedicated to 
 the most high God, and therefore put into 
 the hands of Melchizedek his priest. Note, 
 
 (1.) When we have received some signal 
 mercy from God, it is very fit that we should 
 express our thankfulness by some special 
 act of pious charity. God must always have 
 his dues out of our substance, especially 
 when, by any particular providence, he has 
 either preserved or increased it to us. 
 
 (2.) That the tenth of our increase is a very fit 
 proportion to be set apart for the honour of 
 God and the service of his sanctuary. 
 
 (3.) That Jesus Christ, our great Melchizedek, is 
 to have homage done him, and to be humbly 
 acknowledged by every one of us as our 
 king and priest; and not only the tithe of 
 all, but all we have, must be surrendered 
 and given up to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And the king of Sodom said unto 
 
 <A NAME="Page98"> </A>

 Abram, Give me the persons, and take 
 the goods to thyself.
 &nbsp; 22 And Abram 
 said to the king of Sodom, I have 
 lift up mine hand unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, 
 the most high God, the possessor 
 of heaven and earth,
 &nbsp; 23 That I will 
 not <I>take</I> from a thread even to a 
 shoelatchet, and that I will not take 
 any thing that <I>is</I> thine, lest thou
 shouldest say, I have made Abram 
 rich:
 &nbsp; 24 Save only that which the 
 young men have eaten, and the portion 
 of the men which went with me, 
 Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them 
 take their portion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of what passed 
 between Abram and the king of Sodom, who 
 succeeded him that fell in the battle
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 and thought himself obliged to do this honour 
 to Abram, in return for the good services 
 he had done him. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The king of Sodom's grateful offer to 
 Abram
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 <I>Give me the soul, and take 
 thou the substance;</I> so the Hebrew reads it. 
 Here he fairly begs the persons, but as freely 
 bestows the goods on Abram. Note, 
 
 1. Where a right is dubious and divided, it is 
 wisdom to compound the matter by mutual 
 concessions rather than to contend. The 
 king of Sodom had an original right both to 
 the persons and to the goods, and it would 
 bear a debate whether Abram's acquired 
 right by rescue would supersede his title and 
 extinguish it; but, to prevent all quarrels, 
 the king of Sodom makes this fair proposal. 
 
 2. Gratitude teaches us to recompense to 
 the utmost of our power those that have undergone 
 fatigues, run hazards, and been at 
 expense for our service and benefit. <I>Who 
 goes a warfare at his own charges?</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>.
 Soldiers purchase their pay dearer 
 than any labourers, and are well worthy of 
 it, because they expose their lives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abram's generous refusal of this offer. 
 He not only resigned the persons to him, 
 who, being delivered out of the hand of their 
 enemies, ought to have served Abram, but 
 he restored all the goods too. He would not 
 take <I>from a thread to a shoe-latchet,</I> not the 
 least thing that had ever belonged to the 
 king of Sodom or any of his. Note, A 
 lively faith enables a man to look upon the 
 wealth of this world with a holy contempt, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4">1 John v. 4</A>.
 What are all the ornaments 
 and delights of sense to one that has God 
 and heaven ever in his eye? He resolves 
 even to a thread and a shoe-latchet; for a 
 tender conscience fears offending in a small 
 matter. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Abram ratifies this resolution with a 
 solemn oath: <I>I have lifted up my hand to the 
 Lord that I will not take any thing,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 Here observe, 
 
 (1.) The titles he gives to God, 
 <I>The most high God, the possessor of heaven 
 and earth,</I> the same that Melchizedek had 
 just now used,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 Note, It is good to 
 learn of others how to order our speech concerning 
 God, and to imitate those who speak 
 well in divine things. This improvement we 
 are to make of the conversation of devout 
 good men, we must learn to speak after them. 
 
 (2.) The ceremony used in this oath: <I>I have 
 lifted up my hand.</I> In religious swearing we 
 appeal to God's knowledge of our truth and 
 sincerity and imprecate his wrath if we swear 
 falsely, and the <I>lifting up of the hand</I> is very 
 significant and expressive of both. 
 
 (3.) The 
 matter of the oath, namely, that he would 
 not take any reward from the king of Sodom, 
 was lawful, but what he was not antecedently 
 obliged to. 
 
 [1.] Probably Abram vowed, 
 before he went to the battle, that, if God 
 would give him success, he would, for the 
 glory of God and the credit of his profession, 
 so far deny himself and his own right as to 
 take nothing of the spoils to himself. Note,
 the vows we have made when we are in 
 pursuit of a mercy must be carefully and 
 conscientiously kept when we have obtained 
 the mercy, though they were made against 
 our interest. A citizen of Zion, if he has 
 sworn, whether it be to God or man, though 
 it prove to <I>his own hurt, yet he changeth not,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.
 Or, 
 
 [2.] Perhaps Abram, now 
 when he saw cause to refuse the offer made 
 him, at the same time confirmed his refusal 
 with this oath, to prevent further importunity. 
 Note, <I>First,</I> There may be good reason 
 sometimes why we should debar ourselves of 
 that which is our undoubted right, as St. 
 Paul, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13,1Co+9:12">1 Cor. viii. 13; ix. 12</A>.
 <I>Secondly,</I> That 
 strong resolutions are of good use to put by 
 the force of temptations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He backs his refusal with a good reason: 
 <I>Lest thou shouldest say, I have made 
 Abram rich,</I> which would reflect reproach, 
 
 (1.) Upon the promise and covenant of God, 
 as if they would not have enriched Abram 
 without the spoils of Sodom. And, 
 
 (2.) Upon the piety and charity of Abram, as if 
 all he had in his eye, when he undertook 
 that hazardous expedition, was to enrich 
 himself. Note, 
 
 [1.] We must be very careful 
 that we give no occasion to others to 
 say things which they ought not. 
 
 [2.] The 
 people of God must, for their credit's sake, 
 take heed of doing any thing that looks mean 
 or mercenary, or that savours of covetousness 
 and self-seeking. Probably Abram knew 
 the king of Sodom to be a proud and scornful 
 man, and one that would be apt to turn 
 such a thing as this to his reproach afterwards, 
 though most unreasonably. When
 we have to do with such men, we have need 
 to act with particular caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He limits his refusal with a double proviso,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 In making vows, we ought carefully 
 to insert the necessary exceptions, that 
 we may not afterwards say before the angel, 
 <I>It was an error,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccl. v. 6</A>.
 Abram here 
 
 <A NAME="Page99"> </A>

 excepts, (1.) The food of his soldiers; they 
 were worthy of their meat while they trod 
 out the corn. This would give no colour to 
 the king of Sodom to say that he had enriched 
 Abram. 
 
 (2.) The shares of his allies 
 and confederates: <I>Let them take their portion.</I> 
 Note, Those who are strict in restraining 
 their own liberty yet ought not to impose 
 those restraints upon the liberties of others, 
 nor to judge of them accordingly. We 
 must not make ourselves the standard to 
 measure others by. A good man will deny 
 himself that liberty which he will not deny 
 another, contrary to the practice of the Pharisees, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:4">Matt. xxiii. 4</A>.
 There was not the 
 same reason why Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, 
 should quit their right, that there was why 
 Abram should. They did not make the 
 profession that he made, nor were they, as 
 he was, under the obligation of a vow. They 
 had not the hopes that Abram had of a portion 
 in the other world, and therefore, by all 
 means, <I>let them take their portion</I> of this.</P>
