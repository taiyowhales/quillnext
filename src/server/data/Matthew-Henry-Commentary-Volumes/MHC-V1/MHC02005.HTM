 Moses and Aaron are here dealing with Pharaoh, to get leave of him to
 go and worship in the wilderness. 

 I. They demand leave in the name of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and he answers their demand with a defiance of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. They beg leave in the name of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and he answers their request with further orders to oppress Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 These cruel orders were, 

 1. Executed by the task-masters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 2. Complained of to Pharaoh, but in vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 3. Complained of by the people to Moses

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>),

 and by him to God,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
 hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 2 And Pharaoh said, Who <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I should obey his
 voice to let Israel go? I know not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, neither will I let
 Israel go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses and Aaron, having delivered their message to the elders of
 Israel, with whom they found good acceptance, are now to deal with
 Pharaoh, to whom they come in peril of their lives--<I>Moses</I>
 particularly, who perhaps was out-lawed for killing the Egyptian forty 
 years before, so that if any of the old courtiers should happen to 
 remember that against him now it might cost him his head. Their message 
 itself was displeasing, and touched Pharaoh both in his honour and in his
 profit, two tender points; yet these faithful ambassadors boldly 
 deliver it, whether he will hear or whether he will forbear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their demand is piously bold: <I>Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, 
 Let my people go,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Moses, in treating with the elders of Israel, is directed to call God
 <I>the God of their fathers;</I> but, in treating with Pharaoh, they 
 call him <I>the God of Israel,</I> and it is the first time we find him 
 called so in scripture: he is called <I>the God of Israel,</I> the 
 <I>person</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:20">Gen. xxxiii. 20</A>);

 but here it is Israel, the <I>people.</I> They are just beginning to be
 formed into a people when God is called their God. Moses, it is likely, 
 was directed to call him so, at least it might be inferred from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22"><I>ch.</I> iv. 22</A>,

 <I>Israel is my son.</I> In this great name they deliver their
 message: <I>Let my people go.</I> 

 1. They were God's people, and therefore Pharaoh ought not to detain 
 them in bondage. Note, God will own his own people, though ever so poor 
 and despicable, and will find a time to plead their cause. "The 
 Israelites are slaves in Egypt, but they are my people," says God, "and 
 I will not suffer them to be always trampled upon." See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:4,5">Isa. lii. 4, 5</A>.

 2. He expected services and sacrifices from them, and therefore they
 must have leave to go where they could freely exercise their religion, 
 without giving offence to, or receiving offence from, the Egyptians.
 Note, God delivers his people out of the hand of their enemies, that 
 they may serve him, and serve him cheerfully, that they may hold a 
 feast to him, which they may do, while they have his favour and 
 presence, even in a wilderness, a dry and barren land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pharaoh's answer is impiously bold: <I>Who is the Lord, that I 
 should obey his voice?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Being summoned to surrender, he thus hangs out the flag of defiance,
 hectors Moses and the God that sends him, and peremptorily refuses to 
 let Israel go; he will not treat about it, nor so much as bear the 
 mention of it. Observe, 

 1. How scornfully he speaks of the God of Israel: "<I>Who is 
 Jehovah?</I> I neither know him nor care for him, neither value him nor 
 fear him:" it is a hard name that he never heard of before, but he 
 resolves it shall be no bug-bear to him. Israel was now a despised 
 oppressed people, looked on as the tail of the nation, and, by the 
 character they bore, Pharaoh makes his estimate of their God, and 
 concludes that he made no better a figure among the gods than his 
 people did among the nations. Note, Hardened persecutors are more 
 malicious against God himself than they are against his people. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:23">Isa. xxxvii. 23</A>.

 Again, Ignorance and contempt of God are at the bottom of all the
 wickedness that is in the world. Men know not the Lord, or have very
 low and mean thoughts of him, and therefore they obey not his voice, 
 nor will let any thing go for him.

 2. How proudly he speaks of himself: "<I>That I should obey his 
 voice;</I> I, the king of Egypt, a great people, obey the God of 
 Israel, a poor enslaved people? Shall I, that rule the Israel of God, 
 obey the God of Israel? No, it is below me; I scorn to answer his 
 summons." Note, Those are the children of pride that are the 
 <I>children of disobedience,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:34,Eph+5:6">Job xli. 34; Eph. v. 6</A>.

 Proud men think themselves too good to stoop even to God himself, and
 would not be under control,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+43:2">Jer. xliii. 2</A>.

 Here is the core of the controversy: God must rule, but man will not be
 ruled. "I will have my will done," says God: "But I will do my own 
 will," says the sinner. 

 3. How resolutely he denies the demand: <I>Neither will I let Israel
 go.</I> Note, Of all sinners none are so obstinate, nor so hardly 
 persuaded to leave their sin, as persecutors are.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let
 us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God; lest he fall upon us with
 pestilence, or with the sword.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
 and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
 burdens.
 &nbsp; 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now <I>are</I>
 many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
 &nbsp; 6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
 people, and their officers, saying,
 &nbsp; 7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
 heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
 &nbsp; 8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore,
 ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish <I>ought</I> thereof:
 for they <I>be</I> idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go <I>and</I>
 sacrifice to our God.
 &nbsp; 9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may
 labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Finding that Pharaoh had no veneration at all for God, Moses and Aaron 
 next try whether he had any compassion for Israel, and become humble 
 suitors to him for leave to go and sacrifice, but in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their request is very humble and modest,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They make no complaint of the rigour they were ruled with. They plead
 that the journey they designed was not a project formed among 
 themselves, but that their God had met with them, and called them to 
 it. They beg with all submission: <I>We pray thee.</I> The poor useth 
 entreaties; though God may summon princes that oppress, it becomes us 
 to beseech and make supplication to them. What they ask is very 
 reasonable, only for a short vacation, while they went three days' 
 journey into the desert, and that on a good errand, and 
 unexceptionable: "<I>We will sacrifice unto the Lord our God,</I> as 
 other people do to theirs;" and, <I>lastly,</I> they give a very good 
 reason, "Lest, if we quite cast off his worship, he fall upon us with 
 one judgment or other, and then Pharaoh will lose his vassals."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pharaoh's denial of their request is very barbarous and 
 unreasonable,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:4-9"><I>v.</I> 4-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His suggestions were very unreasonable. 

 (1.) That the people were idle, and that therefore they talked of going 
 to sacrifice. The cities they built for Pharaoh, and the other fruit of 
 their labours, were witnesses for them that they were not idle; yet he 
 thus basely misrepresents them, that he might have a pretence to 
 increase their burdens. 

 (2.) That Moses and Aaron made them idle with vain words,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God's words are here called vain words; and those that called them to
 the best and most needful business are accused of making them idle.
 Note, The malice of Satan has often represented the service and worship 
 of God as fit employment for those only that have nothing else to do, 
 and the business only of the idle; whereas indeed it is the 
 indispensable duty of those that are most busy in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His resolutions hereupon were most barbarous. 

 (1.) Moses and Aaron themselves must get to <I>their burdens</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they are Israelites, and, however God had distinguished them from the
 rest, Pharaoh makes no difference: they must share in the common 
 slavery of their nation. Persecutors have always taken a particular 
 pleasure in putting contempt and hardship upon the ministers of the 
 churches. 

 (2.) The usual tale of bricks must be exacted, without the usual 
 allowance of straw to mix with the clay, or to burn the bricks with, 
 that thus more work might be laid upon the men, which if they 
 performed, they would be broken with labour; and, if not, they would be 
 exposed to punishment.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
 officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
 Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
 &nbsp; 11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
 your work shall be diminished.
 &nbsp; 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land
 of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
 &nbsp; 13 And the taskmasters hasted <I>them,</I> saying, Fulfil your
 works, <I>your</I> daily tasks, as when there was straw.
 &nbsp; 14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
 taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, <I>and</I> demanded,
 Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
 yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Pharaoh's orders are here put in execution; straw is denied, and yet 
 the work not diminished. 

 1. The Egyptian task-masters were very severe. Pharaoh having decreed
 unrighteous decrees, the task-masters were ready to write the 
 grievousness that he had prescribed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1">Isa. x. 1</A>.

 Cruel princes will never want cruel instruments to be employed under
 them, who will justify them in that which is most unreasonable. These 
 task-masters insisted upon the daily tasks, as when there was straw,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 See what need we have to pray that <I>we may be delivered from
 unreasonable and wicked men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:2">2 Thess. iii. 2</A>.

 The enmity of the serpent's seed against the seed of the woman is such
 as breaks through all the laws of reason, honour, humanity, and common 
 justice. 

 2. The people hereby were dispersed throughout all the land of Egypt, 
 to gather stubble,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 By this means Pharaoh's unjust and barbarous usage of them came to be
 known to all the kingdom, and perhaps caused them to be pitied by their 
 neighbours, and made Pharaoh's government less acceptable even to his 
 own subjects: good-will is never got by persecution. 

 3. The Israelite-officers were used with particular harshness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those that were the fathers of the houses of Israel paid dearly for
 their honour; for from them immediately the service was exacted, and 
 they were beaten when it was not performed. See here, 

 (1.) What a miserable thing slavery is, and what reason we have to be 
 thankful to God that we are a free people, and not oppressed. Liberty 
 and property are valuable jewels in the eyes of those whose services 
 and possessions lie at the mercy of an arbitrary power. 

 (2.) What disappointments we often meet with after the raising of our 
 expectations. The Israelites were now lately encouraged to hope for 
 enlargement, but behold greater distresses. This teaches us always to 
 rejoice with trembling. 

 (3.) What strange steps God sometimes takes in delivering his people; 
 he often brings them to the utmost straits when he is just ready to 
 appear for them. The lowest ebbs go before the highest tides; and very 
 cloudy mornings commonly introduce the fairest days,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 God's time to help is when things are at the worst; and Providence
 verifies the paradox, <I>The worse the better.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
 unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
 servants?
 &nbsp; 16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to
 us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants <I>are</I> beaten; but the
 fault <I>is</I> in thine own people.
 &nbsp; 17 But he said, Ye <I>are</I> idle, <I>ye are</I> idle: therefore ye say,
 Let us go <I>and</I> do sacrifice to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 Go therefore now, <I>and</I> work; for there shall no straw be
 given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
 &nbsp; 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see <I>that</I>
 they <I>were</I> in evil <I>case,</I> after it was said, Ye shall not
 minish <I>ought</I> from your bricks of your daily task.
 &nbsp; 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
 came forth from Pharaoh:
 &nbsp; 21 And they said unto them, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> look upon you, and judge;
 because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
 Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their
 hand to slay us.
 &nbsp; 22 And Moses returned unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, Lord, wherefore
 hast thou <I>so</I> evil entreated this people? why <I>is</I> it <I>that</I>
 thou hast sent me?
 &nbsp; 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath
 done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people
 at all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a great strait that the head-workmen were in, when they must 
 either abuse those that were under them or be abused by those that were 
 over them; yet, it should seem, rather than they would tyrannize, they 
 would be tyrannized over; and they were so. In this evil case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How justly they complained to Pharaoh: They <I>came and cried unto
 Pharaoh,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Whither should they go with a remonstrance of their grievances but to
 the supreme power, which is ordained for the protection of the injured? 
 As bad as Pharaoh was his oppressed subjects had liberty to complain to 
 him; there was no law against petitioning: it was a very modest, but 
 moving, representation that they made of their condition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Thy servants are beaten</I> (severely enough, no doubt, when things
 were in such a ferment), and yet <I>the fault is in thy own people,</I> 
 the task-masters, who deny us what is necessary for carrying on our 
 work. Note, It is common for those to be most rigorous in blaming 
 others who are most blameworthy themselves. But what did they get by
 this complaint? It did but make bad worse. 

 1. Pharaoh taunted them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 when they were almost killed with working, he told them they were
 idle: they underwent the fatigue of industry, and yet lay under the 
 imputation of slothfulness, while nothing appeared to ground the charge 
 upon but this, that they said, <I>Let us go and do sacrifice.</I> Note, 
 It is common for the best actions to be mentioned under the worst
 names; holy diligence in the best business is censured by many as a
 culpable carelessness in the business of the world. It is well for us
 that men are not to be our judges, but a God who knows what the
 principles are on which we act. Those that are diligent in doing
 sacrifice to the Lord will, with God, escape the doom of the slothful
 servant, though, with men, they do not. 

 2. He bound on their burdens: <I>Go now and work.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked; what can be expected from
 unrighteous men but more unrighteousness?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How unjustly they complained of Moses and Aaron: <I>The Lord look 
 upon you, and judge,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This was not fair. Moses and Aaron had given sufficient evidence of
 their hearty good-will to the liberties of Israel; and yet, because 
 things succeed not immediately as they hoped, they are reproached as 
 accessaries to their slavery. They should have humbled themselves 
 before God, and taken to themselves the shame of their sin, which 
 turned away good things from them; but, instead of this, they fly in 
 the face of their best friends, and quarrel with the instruments of 
 their deliverance, because of some little difficulties and obstructions 
 they met with in effecting it. Note, Those that are called out to 
 public service for God and their generation must expect to be tried, 
 not only by the malicious threats of proud enemies, but by the unjust 
 and unkind censures of unthinking friends, who judge only by outward 
 appearance and look but a little way before them. Now what did Moses do 
 in this strait? It grieved him to the heart that the event did not 
 answer, but rather contradict, his expectation; and their upbraidings 
 were very cutting, and like a sword in his bones; but, 

 1. He returned to the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 to acquaint him with it, and to represent the case to him: he knew
 that what he had said and done was by divine direction; and therefore 
 what blame is laid upon him for it he considers as reflecting upon God, 
 and, like Hezekiah, spreads it before him as interested in the cause, 
 and appeals to him. Compare this with
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:7-9">Jer. xx. 7-9</A>.

 Note, When we find ourselves, at any time, perplexed and embarrassed in
 the way of our duty, we ought to have recourse to God, and lay open our 
 case before him by faithful and fervent prayer. If we retreat, let us 
 retreat to him, and no further. 

 2. He expostulated with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 He knew not how to reconcile the providence with the promise and the
 commission which he had received. "Is this God's coming down to deliver 
 Israel? Must I, who hoped to be a blessing to them, become a scourge
 to them? By this attempt to get them out of the pit, they are but sunk
 the deeper into it." Now he asks, 

 (1.) <I>Wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people?</I> Note, 
 Even when God is coming towards his people in ways of mercy, he 
 sometimes takes such methods as that they may think themselves but ill 
 treated. The instruments of deliverance, when they aim to help, are 
 found to hinder, and that becomes a trap which, it was hoped, would 
 have been for their welfare, God suffering it to be so that we may 
 learn to cease from man, and may come off from a dependence upon second 
 causes. Note, further, When the people of God think themselves ill 
 treated, they should go to God by prayer, and plead with him, and that 
 is the way to have better treatment in God's good time. 

 (2.) <I>Why is it thou hast sent me?</I> Thus, 

 [1.] He complains of his ill success: "Pharaoh has done evil to this 
 people, and not one step seems to be taken towards their deliverance." 
 Note, It cannot but sit very heavily upon the spirits of those whom God 
 employs for him to see that their labour does no good, and much more to 
 see that it does hurt eventually, though not designedly. It is 
 uncomfortable to a good minister to perceive that his endeavours for 
 men's conviction and conversion do but exasperate their corruptions, 
 confirm their prejudices, harden their hearts, and seal them up under 
 unbelief. This makes them go in the bitterness of their souls, as the 
 prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14">Ezek. iii. 14</A>.

 Or, 

 [2.] He enquires what was further to be done: <I>Why hast thou sent 
 me</I>? that is, "What other method shall I take in pursuance of my 
 commission?" Note, Disappointments in our work must not drive us from 
 our God, but still we must consider why we are sent.</P>
