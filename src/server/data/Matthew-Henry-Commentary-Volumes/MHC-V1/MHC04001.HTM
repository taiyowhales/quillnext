 Israel was now to be formed into a commonwealth, or rather a kingdom; 
 for "the Lord was their King" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:12">1 Sam. xii. 12</A>), 
 their government a theocracy, and Moses under him was king in Jeshurun,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:5">Deut. xxxiii. 5</A>.

 Now, for the right settlement of this holy state, next to the
 institution of good laws was necessary the institution of good order; 
 and account therefore must be taken of the subjects of this kingdom, 
 which is done in this chapter, where we have, 

 I. Orders given to Moses to number the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. Persons nominated to assist him herein,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:5-16">ver. 5-16</A>.

 III. The particular number of each tribe, as it was given in to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:17-43">ver. 17-43</A>.

 IV. The sum total of all together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:44-46">ver. 44-46</A>.

 V. An exception of the Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:47-54">ver. 47</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
 the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first <I>day</I> of the
 second month, in the second year after they were come out of the
 land of Egypt, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
 Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with
 the number of <I>their</I> names, every male by their polls;
 &nbsp; 3 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
 forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their
 armies.
 &nbsp; 4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
 head of the house of his fathers.
 &nbsp; 5 And these <I>are</I> the names of the men that shall stand with
 you: of <I>the tribe of</I> Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.
 &nbsp; 6 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
 &nbsp; 7 Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
 &nbsp; 8 Of Issachar; Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
 &nbsp; 9 Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon.
 &nbsp; 10 Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of
 Ammihud: of Manasseh; Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
 &nbsp; 11 Of Benjamin; Abidan the son of Gideoni.
 &nbsp; 12 Of Dan; Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
 &nbsp; 13 Of Asher; Pagiel the son of Ocran.
 &nbsp; 14 Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
 &nbsp; 15 Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan.
 &nbsp; 16 These <I>were</I> the renowned of the congregation, princes of
 the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here a commission issued out for the numbering of the people 
 of Israel; and David, long after, paid dearly for doing it without a 
 commission. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The date of this commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 (1.) The place: it is given at God's court <I>in the wilderness of 
 Sinai,</I> from his royal palace, <I>the tabernacle of the 
 congregation.</I> 

 (2.) The time: <I>In the second year</I> after they came up out of
 Egypt; we may call it the second year of that reign. The laws in 
 Leviticus were given in the first month of that year; these orders were 
 given in the beginning of the second month.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The directions given for the execution of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 (1.) None were to be numbered but the males, and those only such as 
 were fit for war. None <I>under twenty years old;</I> for, though some 
 such might have bulk and strength enough for military service, yet, in 
 compassion to their tender years, God would not have them put upon it 
 to bear arms. 

 (2.) Nor were any to be numbered who through age, or bodily infirmity,
 blindness, lameness, or chronical diseases, were unfit for war. The 
 church being militant, those only are reputed the true members of it 
 that have enlisted themselves soldiers of Jesus Christ; for our life, 
 our Christian life, is a warfare. 

 (3.) The account was to be taken <I>according to their families,</I>
 that it might not only be known how many they were, and what were their 
 names, but of what tribe and family, or clan, nay, of what particular 
 house every person was; or, reckoning it the muster of an army, to what 
 regiment every man belonged, that he might know his place himself and 
 the government might know where to find him. They were numbered a 
 little before this, when their poll-money was paid for the service of 
 the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:25,26">Exod. xxxviii. 25, 26</A>.

 But it should seem they were not then registered <I>by the house of
 their fathers,</I> as now they were. Their number was the same then
 that it was now: 603,550 men; for as many as had died since then, and 
 were lost in the account, so many had arrived to be twenty years old, 
 and were added to the account. Note, As <I>one generation passeth a way 
 another generation cometh.</I> As vacancies are daily made, so recruits 
 are daily raised to fill up the vacancies, and Providence takes care 
 that, one time or other, in one place or other, the births shall 
 balance the burials, that the race of mankind and the holy seed may not 
 be cut off and become extinct.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Commissioners are named for the doing of this work. Moses and Aaron 
 were to preside 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and one man of every tribe, that was renowned in his tribe, and was 
 presumed to know it well, was to assist in it--<I>the princes of the 
 tribes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, Those that are honourable should study to be serviceable; he that 
 is great, let him be your minister, and show, by his knowing the 
 public, that he deserves to be publicly known. The charge of this 
 muster was committed to him who was the lord-lieutenant of that tribe. 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Why was this account ordered to be taken and kept? For several 
 reasons. 

 1. To prove the accomplishment of the promise made to Abraham, that God
 would <I>multiply his seed exceedingly,</I> which promise was renewed 
 to Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:14">Gen. xxviii. 14</A>),

 that <I>his seed should be as the dust of the earth.</I> Now it appears
 that there did not fail one tittle of that good promise, which was an 
 encouragement to them to hope that the other promise of the land of 
 Canaan for an inheritance should also be fulfilled in its season. When 
 the number of a body of men is only guessed at, upon the view, it is 
 easy for one that is disposed to cavil to surmise that the conjecture 
 is mistaken, and that, if they were to be counted, they would not be 
 found half so many; therefore God would have Israel numbered, that it 
 might be upon record how vastly they were increased in a little time, 
 that the power of God's providence and the truth of his promise may be 
 seen and acknowledged by all. It could not have been expected, in any 
 ordinary course of nature, that seventy-five souls (which was the 
 number of Jacob's family when he went down into Egypt) should in 215 
 years (and it was no longer) multiply into so many hundred thousands. 
 It is therefore to be attributed to an extraordinary virtue in the 
 divine promise and blessing.

 2. It was to intimate the particular care which God himself would take
 of his Israel, and which Moses and the inferior rulers were expected to 
 take of them. God is called the <I>Shepherd of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>.

 Now the shepherds always kept count of their flocks, and delivered them
 by number to their under-shepherds, that they might know if any were 
 missing; in like manner God numbers his flock, that of all which he 
 took into his fold he might lose none but upon a valuable 
 consideration, even those that were sacrificed to his justice.

 3. It was to put a difference between the true born Israelites and the 
 mixed multitude that were among them; none were numbered but 
 Israelites: all the world is but lumber in comparison with those 
 jewels. Little account is made of others, but the saints God has a 
 particular property in and concern for. <I>The Lord knows those that 
 are his</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>),

 <I>knows them by name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Phil. iv. 3</A>.

 The hairs of their head are numbered; but he will say to others, "<I>I
 never knew you,</I> never made any account of you."

 4. It was in order to their being marshalled into several districts,
 for the more easy administration of justice, and their more regular 
 march through the wilderness. It is a rout and a rabble, not an army,
 that is not mustered and put in order.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
 <I>their</I> names:
 &nbsp; 18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the
 first <I>day</I> of the second month, and they declared their
 pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers,
 according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and
 upward, by their polls.
 &nbsp; 19 As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
 wilderness of Sinai.
 &nbsp; 20 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
 generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
 according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male
 from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
 to war;
 &nbsp; 21 Those that were numbered of them, <I>even</I> of the tribe of
 Reuben, <I>were</I> forty and six thousand and five hundred.
 &nbsp; 22 Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their
 families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered
 of them, according to the number of the names, by their polls,

 their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
 number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that
 were able to go forth to war;
 &nbsp; 29 Those that were numbered of them, <I>even</I> of the tribe of
 Issachar, <I>were</I> fifty and four thousand and four hundred.
 &nbsp; 30 Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after
 their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
 number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that
 were able to go forth to war;
 &nbsp; 31 Those that were numbered of them, <I>even</I> of the tribe of
 Zebulun, <I>were</I> fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.
 &nbsp; 32 Of the children of Joseph, <I>namely,</I> of the children of
 Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house
 of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from

 &nbsp; 34 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after
 their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the

 Manasseh, <I>were</I> thirty and two thousand and two hundred.
 &nbsp; 36 Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after

 Naphtali, <I>were</I> fifty and three thousand and four hundred.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the speedy execution of the orders given for the numbering 
 of the people. It was begun the same day that the orders were given, 
 <I>The first day of the second month;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:1,18"><I>v.</I> 18 with <I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, When any work is to be done for God it is good to set about it 
 quickly, while the sense of duty is strong and pressing. And, for aught 
 that appears, it was but one day's work, for many other things were 
 done between this and the twentieth day of this month, when they 
 removed their camp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:11"><I>ch.</I> x. 11</A>.

 Joab was almost ten months numbering the people in David's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:8">2 Sam. xxiv. 8</A>);

 but then they were dispersed, now they lived closely together; then
 Satan proposed the doing of it, now God commanded it. It was the sooner 
 and more easily done now because it had been done but a little while 
 ago, and they needed but review the old books, with the alterations 
 since made, which probably they had kept an account of as they 
 occurred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the particulars here left upon record, we may observe, 

 1. That the numbers are registered in words at length (as I may say),
 and not in figures; to every one of the twelve tribes it is repeated, 
 for the greater ceremony and solemnity of the account, that they were 
 numbered <I>by their generations, after their families, by the house of 
 their fathers, according to the number of the names,</I> to show that 
 every tribe took and gave in the account by the same rule and in the 
 same method, though so many hands were employed in it, setting down the 
 genealogy first, to show that their family descended from Israel, then 
 the families themselves in their order, then dividing each family into 
 the houses, or subordinate families, that branched from it, and under 
 these the names of the particular persons, according to the rules of 
 heraldry. Thus every man might know who were his relations or next of 
 kin, on which some laws we have already met with did depend: besides 
 that the nearer any are to us in relation the more ready we should be 
 to do them good. 

 2. That they all end with hundreds, only Gad with fifty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 but none of the numbers descend to units or tens. Some think it was a 
 special providence that ordered all the tribes just at this time to be 
 even numbers, and no odd or broken numbers among them, to show them 
 that there was something more than ordinary designed in their increase, 
 there being this uncommon in the circumstance of it. It is rather 
 probable that Moses having some time before appointed rulers of 
 hundreds, and rulers of fifties 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:25">Exod. xviii. 25</A>),

 they numbered the people by their respective rulers, which would bring
 the numbers to even hundreds or fifties.

 3. That Judah is the must numerous of them all, more than double to
 Benjamin and Manasseh, and almost 12,000 more than any other tribe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It was Judah whom <I>his brethren must praise</I> because from him 
 Messiah the Prince was to descend; but, because that was a thing at a 
 distance, God did in many ways honour that tribe in the mean time, 
 particularly by the great increase of it, for his sake who was to 
 spring out of Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb. vii. 14</A>)

 in the fulness of time. Judah was to lead the van through the
 wilderness, and therefore was furnished accordingly with greater 
 strength than any other tribe.

 4. Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, are numbered as distinct
 tribes, and both together made up almost as many as Judah; this was in 
 pursuance of Jacob's adoption of them, by which they were equalled with 
 their uncles Reuben and Simeon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:5">Gen. xlviii. 5</A>.

 It was also the effect of the blessing of Joseph, who was to be a
 <I>fruitful bough,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22">Gen. xlix. 22</A>.

 And Ephraim the younger is put first, and is more numerous than
 Manasseh, for Jacob had crossed hands, and foreseen ten thousands of 
 Ephraim and thousands of Manasseh. The fulfilling of this confirms our 
 faith in the spirit of prophecy with which the patriarchs were endued.

 5. When they came down into Egypt Dan had but one son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:23">Gen. xlvi. 23</A>),

 and so his tribe was but one family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:42"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 42</A>.

 Benjamin had then ten sons 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:21">Gen. xlvi. 21</A>),

 yet now the tribe of Dan is almost double in number to that of
 Benjamin. Note, The increasing and diminishing of families do not 
 always go by probabilities. Some are multiplied greatly, and again are 
 diminished, while others that were poor have families made them like a 
 flock,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38,39,41">Ps. cvii. 38, 39, 41</A>;

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:23">Job xii. 23</A>.

 6. It is said of each of the tribes that those were numbered who were
 able to go forth to war, to remind them that they had wars before them, 
 though now they were in peace and met with no opposition. <I>Let not
 him that girdeth on the harness boast as though he had put it 
 off.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>44 These <I>are</I> those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
 numbered, and the princes of Israel, <I>being</I> twelve men: each one
 was for the house of his fathers.
 &nbsp; 45 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
 Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and
 upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;
 &nbsp; 46 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand
 and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sum total at the foot of the account; they were in all 
 600,000 fighting men, and 3550 over. Some think that when this was 
 their number some months before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+38:26">Exod. xxxviii. 26</A>)

 the Levites were reckoned with them, but now that tribe was separated
 for the service of God, yet so many more had by this time attained to 
 the age of twenty years as that still they were the same number, to 
 show that whatever we part with for the honour and service of God it 
 shall certainly be made up to us one way of other. Now we see what a 
 vast body of men they were. Let us consider,

 1. How much went to maintain all these (besides twice as many more, no
 question, of women and children, sick and aged, and the mixed 
 multitude) for forty years together in the wilderness; and they were 
 all at God's finding every day, having their food from the dew of 
 heaven, and not from the fatness of the earth. O what a great and good 
 housekeeper is our God, that has such numbers depending on him and 
 receiving from him every day! 

 2. What work sin makes with a people; within forty years most of them
 would indeed have died of course for the common sin of mankind; for, 
 when sin entered into the world, death came with it, and how great are 
 the desolations which it makes in the earth! But, for the particular 
 sin of unbelief and murmuring, all those that were now numbered, except 
 two, laid their bones under their iniquity, and perished in the 
 wilderness. 

 3. What a great multitude God's spiritual Israel will amount to at
 last; though at one time, and in one place, they seem to be but a

 multitude, innumerable,

 greatly increase. A little one shall become a thousand.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>47 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
 numbered among them.
 &nbsp; 48 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had spoken unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 49 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take
 the sum of them among the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 50 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
 testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things
 that <I>belong</I> to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the
 vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall
 encamp round about the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
 take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
 Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall
 be put to death.
 &nbsp; 52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every
 man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard,
 throughout their hosts.
 &nbsp; 53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
 testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
 children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the
 tabernacle of testimony.
 &nbsp; 54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so did they.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Care is here taken to distinguish from the rest of the tribes the tribe 
 of Levi, which, in the matter of the golden calf, had distinguished 
 itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:26">Exod. xxxii. 26</A>.

 Note, Singular services shall be recompensed with singular honours.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was the honour of the Levites that they were made guardians of 
 the spiritualities; to them was committed the care of the tabernacle 
 and the treasures thereof, both in their camps and in their marches. 

 1. When they moved the Levites were to take down the tabernacle, to
 carry it and all that belonged to it, and then to set it up again in 
 the place appointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:50,51"><I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>.

 It was for the honour of the holy things that none should be permitted 
 to see them, or touch them, but those only who were called of God to 
 the service. Thus we all are unfit and unworthy to have fellowship with 
 God until we are first called by his grace <I>into the fellowship of 
 his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,</I> and so, being the spiritual seed of 
 that great high priest, are made <I>priests to our God;</I> and it is 
 promised that God would take Levites to himself, even from the 
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:21">Isa. lxvi. 21</A>.

 2. When they rested the Levites were to <I>encamp round about the 
 tabernacle</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:50,53"><I>v.</I> 50, 53</A>),

 that they might be near their work, and resident upon their charge, 
 always ready to attend, and that they might be a guard upon the 
 tabernacle, to preserve it from being either plundered or profaned.
 They must pitch round about the tabernacle, <I>that there be no wrath 
 upon the congregation,</I> as there would be if the tabernacle and the 
 charge of it were neglected, or those crowded upon it that were not 
 allowed to come near. Note, Great care must be taken to prevent sin, 
 because the preventing of sin is the preventing of wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was their further honour that as Israel, being a holy people, 
 was not <I>reckoned among the nations,</I> so they, being a holy tribe, 
 were not reckoned among other Israelites, but numbered afterwards by 
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 The service which the Levites were to do about the sanctuary is called 
 (as we render it in the margin) a <I>warfare,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23</A>.

 And, being engaged in that warfare, they were discharged from military
 services, and therefore not numbered with those that were to <I>go out 
 to war.</I> Note, Those that minister about holy things should neither 
 entangle themselves, nor be entangled, in secular affairs. The ministry 
 is itself work enough for a whole man, and all little enough to be 
 employed in it. It is an admonition to ministers to distinguish 
 themselves by their exemplary conversation from common Israelites, not 
 affecting to seem greater, but aiming to be really better, every way 
 better than others.</P>
