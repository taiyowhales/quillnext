 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have a solemn treaty between God and Abram 
 concerning a covenant that was to be established between them. 
 In the former chapter we had Abram in the field with kings; 
 here we find him in the mount with God; and, though there he 
 looked great, yet, methinks, here he looks much greater: that 
 honour have the great men of the world, but "this honour have 
 all the saints." The covenant to be settled between God and 
 Abram was a covenant of promises; accordingly, here is, 
 
 I. A general assurance of God's kindness and good-will to Abram,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 II. A particular declaration of the purposes of his love 
 concerning him, in two things:--
 
 1. That he would give him a 
 numerous issue,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.
 
 2. That he would give him Canaan 
 for an inheritance,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:7-21">ver. 7-21</A>.
 Either an estate without an heir, 
 or an heir without an estate, would have been but a half comfort 
 to Abram. But God ensures both to him; and that which made 
 these two, the promised seed and the promised land, comforts 
 indeed to this great believer was that they were both typical of 
 those two invaluable blessings, Christ and heaven; and so, we 
 have reason to think, Abram eyed them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 After these things the word of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto Abram in
 a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I
 <I>am</I> thy shield, <I>and</I> thy exceeding great
 reward.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 
 
 I. The time when God made 
 this treaty with Abram: <I>After these things.</I> 
 
 1. After that famous act of generous charity 
 which Abram had done, in rescuing his 
 friends and neighbours out of distress, and 
 that, <I>not for price nor reward.</I> After this, 
 God made him this gracious visit. Note, 
 Those that show favour to men shall find 
 favour with God. 
 
 2. After that victory 
 which he had obtained over four kings. 
 Lest Abram should be too much elevated 
 and pleased with that, God comes to him,
 to tell him he had better things in store for 
 him. Note, A believing converse with spiritual 
 blessings is an excellent means to 
 keep us from being too much taken up with 
 temporal enjoyments. The gifts of common 
 providence are not comparable to those of 
 covenant love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The manner in which God conversed 
 with Abram: <I>The word of the Lord came 
 unto Abram</I> (that is, God manifested himself 
 and his will to Abram) <I>in a vision,</I> which 
 supposes Abram awake, and some visible 
 appearances of the Shechinah, or some sensible 
 token of the presence of the divine glory. 
 Note, The methods of divine revelation are 
 adapted to our state in a world of sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The gracious assurance God gave him 
 of his favour to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He called him by name--<I>Abram,</I> which 
 was a great honour to him, and made his 
 name great, and was also a great encouragement 
 and assistance to his faith. Note, 
 God's good word does us good when it is 
 spoken by his Spirit to us in particular, and
 brought to our hearts. The word says, <I>Ho, 
 every one</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>),
 the Spirit says, <I>Ho, 
 such a one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He cautioned him against being disquieted 
 and confounded: <I>Fear not, Abram.</I> 
 Abram might fear lest the four kings he had 
 routed should rally again, and fall upon him 
 to his ruin: "No," says God, "<I>Fear not.</I> 
 Fear not their revenges, nor thy neighbour's 
 envy; I will take care of thee." Note, 
 
 (1.) Where there is great faith, yet there may be 
 many fears, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2 Cor. vii. 5</A>.

 (2.) God takes
 cognizance of his people's fears though ever
 so secret, and <I>knows their souls,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:7">Ps. xxxi. 7</A>.

 (3.) It is the will of God that his people 
 should not give way to prevailing fears, 
 whatever happens. Let the sinners in Sion 
 be afraid, but fear not, Abram.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He assured him of safety and happiness, 
 that he should for ever be, 
 
 (1.) As safe 
 as God himself could keep him: <I>I am thy 
 shield,</I> or, somewhat more emphatically, <I>I 
 am a shield to thee,</I> present with thee, actually 
 caring for thee. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:24">1 Chron. xvii. 24</A>.
 Not only the God of Israel, but a God 
 to Israel. Note, The consideration of this, 
 that God himself is, and will be, a shield to 
 his people to secure them from all destructive 
 evils, a shield ready to them and a shield 
 round about them, should be sufficient to 
 silence all their perplexing tormenting fears. 
 
 (2.) As happy as God himself could make him: 
 I will be <I>thy exceedingly great reward;</I> not only 
 thy rewarder, but thy reward. Abram had generously 
 refused the rewards which the king 
 of Sodom offered him, and here God comes, 
 and tells him he shall be no loser by it. Note, 
 
 [1.] The rewards of believing obedience and 
 self-denial are exceedingly great, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>.

 [2.] God himself is the chosen and promised 
 felicity of holy souls--chosen in this 
 world, promised in a better. He is the <I>portion 
 of their inheritance and their cup.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2 And Abram said, Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>,
 what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
 childless, and the steward of my
 house <I>is</I> this Eliezer of Damascus?
 &nbsp; 3 And Abram said, Behold, to me 
 thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one 
 born in my house is mine heir.
 &nbsp; 4 And, behold, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 <I>came</I> unto him, saying, This shall not 
 be thine heir; but he that shall come 

 <A NAME="Page100"> </A>

 forth out of thine own bowels shall 
 be thine heir.
 &nbsp; 5 And he brought 
 him forth abroad, and said, Look now 
 toward heaven, and tell the stars, if 
 thou be able to number them: and he 
 said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
 &nbsp; 6 And he believed in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and he 
 counted it to him for righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the assurance given to 
 Abram of a numerous offspring which should 
 descend from him, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Abram's repeated complaint,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 This was that which gave occasion to this 
 promise. The great affliction that sat heavy 
 upon Abram was the want of a child; and 
 the complaint of this he here <I>pours out before 
 the Lord, and shows before him his trouble,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+142:2">Ps. cxlii. 2</A>.
 Note, Though we must never 
 complain of God, yet we have leave to complain 
 to him, and to be large and particular 
 in the statement of our grievances; and it is 
 some ease to a burdened spirit to open its 
 case to a faithful and compassionate friend: 
 such a friend God is, whose ear is always 
 open. Now his complaint is four-fold:--
 
 1. That he had no child
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 <I>Behold, to me 
 thou hast given no seed;</I> not only no son, but 
 <I>no seed;</I> if he had had a daughter, from her 
 the promised Messiah might have come, who 
 was to be the seed of the woman; but he 
 had neither son nor daughter. He seems 
 to lay an emphasis on that, <I>to me.</I> His 
 neighbours were full of children, his servants 
 had children born in his house. "But <I>to
 me,</I>" he complains, "thou hast given none;" 
 and yet God had told him he should be a 
 favourite above all. Note, Those that are 
 written childless must see God writing them 
 so. Again, God often withholds those temporal 
 comforts from his own children which 
 he gives plentifully to others that are 
 strangers to him. 
 
 2. That he was never 
 likely to have any, intimated in that <I>I go,</I> or 
 "<I>I am going, childless,</I> going into years, 
 going down the hill apace; nay, I am going 
 out of the world, going the way of all the 
 earth. <I>I die childless,</I>" so the LXX. "I 
 leave the world, and leave no child behind 
 me." 
 
 3. That his servants were for 
 the present and were likely to be to him instead 
 of sons. While he lived, <I>the steward of his 
 house was Eliezer of Damascus;</I> to him he 
 committed the care of his family and estate, 
 who might be faithful, but only as a servant, 
 not as a son. When he died, <I>one born in his 
 house would be his heir,</I> and would bear rule 
 over all that for which he had laboured, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:18,19,21">Eccl. ii. 18, 19, 21</A>.
 God had already told 
 him that he would make of him <I>a great nation</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 2</A>),
 and his <I>seed as the dust of the 
 earth</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:16"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 16</A>);
 but he had left him in 
 doubt whether it should be his seed begotten 
 or his seed adopted, by a son of his loins or 
 only a son of his house. "Now, Lord," 
 says Abram, "if it be only an adopted son, 
 it must be one of my servants, which will 
 reflect disgrace upon the promised seed, that 
 is to descend from him." Note, While promised 
 mercies are delayed our unbelief and 
 impatience are apt to conclude them denied. 
 
 4. That the want of a son was so great a 
 trouble to him that it took away the comfort 
 of all his enjoyments: "<I>Lord, what wilt thou 
 give me?</I> All is nothing to me, if I have 
 not a son." Now, 
 
 (1.) If we suppose that 
 Abram looked no further than a temporal 
 comfort, this complaint was culpable. God 
 had, by his providence, given him some 
 good things, and more by his promise; and 
 yet Abram makes no account of them, because 
 he has not a son. It did very ill 
 become the father of the faithful to say, 
 <I>What wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,</I> 
 immediately after God had said, <I>I am thy 
 shield, and thy exceedingly great reward.</I> 
 Note, Those do not rightly value the advantages 
 of their covenant-relation to God and 
 interest in him who do not think them sufficient 
 to balance the want of any creature-comfort
 whatever. But, 
 
 (2.) If we suppose that 
 Abram, herein, had an eye to the promised
 seed, the importunity of his desire was very 
 commendable: all was nothing to him, if he 
 had not the earnest of that great blessing, 
 and an assurance of his relation to the Messiah, 
 of which God had already encouraged 
 him to maintain the expectation. He has 
 wealth, and victory, and honour; but, while 
 he is kept in the dark about the main matter, 
 it is all nothing to him. Note, Till we 
 have some comfortable evidence of our interest 
 in Christ and the new covenant, we 
 should not rest satisfied with any thing else. 
 "This, and the other, I have; but what will 
 all this avail me, if I go Christless?" Yet 
 thus far the complaint was culpable, that 
 there was some diffidence of the promise at 
 the bottom of it, and a weariness of waiting 
 God's time. Note, True believers sometimes 
 find it hard to reconcile God's promises 
 and his providences, when they seem 
 to disagree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's gracious answer to this complaint. 
 To the first part of the complaint
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 God gave no immediate answer, because 
 there was something of fretfulness in 
 it; but, when he renews his address somewhat 
 more calmly
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 God answered him 
 graciously. Note, If we continue instant in 
 prayer, and yet pray with a humble submission 
 to the divine will, we shall not seek in vain. 
 
 1. God gave him an express promise 
 of a son,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 This that is born in thy 
 house <I>shall not be thy heir,</I> as thou fearest, 
 but one that shall <I>come forth out of thy 
 own bowels shall be thy heir.</I> Note, 
 
 (1.) God makes heirs; he says, "This shall not, 
 and this shall;" and whatever men devise and 
 design, in settling their estates, God's 
 counsel shall stand. 
 
 (2.) God is often better 
 to us than our own fears, and gives the 
 mercy we had long despaired of. 2. To 

 <A NAME="Page101"> </A>
 
 affect him the more with this promise, he 
 took him out, and showed him the stars (this 
 vision being early in the morning, before 
 day), and then tells him, <I>So shall thy seed be,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) So numerous; the stars seem innumerable 
 to a common eye: Abram feared 
 he should have no child at all, but God assured 
 him that the descendants from his 
 loins should be so many as not to be numbered. 
 
 (2.) So illustrious, resembling the 
 stars in splendour; for to <I>them pertained the 
 glory,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.
 Abram's seed, according 
 to his flesh, were like the dust of the earth
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:16"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 16</A>),
 but his spiritual seed are like 
 the stars of heaven, not only numerous, but 
 glorious, and very precious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abram's firm belief of the promise 
 God now made him, and God's favourable 
 acceptance of his faith,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. He <I>believed 
 in the Lord,</I> that is, he believed the truth of 
 that promise which God had now made him, 
 resting upon the irresistible power and the 
 inviolable faithfulness of him that made it. 
 <I>Hath he spoken, and shall he not make it 
 good?</I> Note, Those who would have the 
 comfort of the promises must mix faith with 
 the promises. See how the apostle magnifies 
 this faith of Abram, and makes it a 
 standing example, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:19-21">Rom. iv. 19-21</A>.
 <I>He was not weak in faith; he staggered not at 
 the promise;</I> he was <I>strong in faith; he was 
 fully persuaded.</I> The Lord work such a 
 faith in every one of us! Some think that 
 his believing in the Lord respected, not only 
 the Lord promising, but the Lord promised, 
 the Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new 
 covenant. He <I>believed in him,</I> that is, received 
 and embraced the divine revelation 
 concerning him, and <I>rejoiced to see his day,</I> 
 though at so great a distance, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">John viii. 56</A>.

 2. <I>God counted it to him for righteousness;</I> 
 that is, upon the score of this he was accepted 
 of God, and, as the rest of the patriarchs, 
 by faith he <I>obtained witness that he 
 was righteous,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:4">Heb. xi. 4</A>.
 This is urged in 
 the New Testament to prove that we are 
 justified by faith without the works of the 
 law 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:4,Ga+3:6">Rom. iv. 3; Gal. iii. 6</A>);
 for Abram was 
 so justified while he was yet uncircumcised. 
 If Abram, that was so rich in good works, 
 was not justified by them, but by his faith, 
 much less can we, that are so poor in them. 
 This faith, which was imputed to Abram for 
 righteousness, had lately struggled with unbelief
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 and, coming off a conqueror, it 
 was thus crowned, thus honoured. Note, 
 A fiducial practical acceptance of, and 
 dependence upon, God's promise of grace 
 and glory, in and through Christ, is that 
 which, according to the tenour of the new 
 covenant, gives us a right to all the blessings 
 contained in that promise. All believers are 
 justified as Abram was, and it was his faith 
 that was <I>counted to him for righteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And he said unto him, I <I>am</I> the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that brought thee out of Ur of 
 the Chaldees, to give thee this land 
 to inherit it.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, Lord 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, whereby shall I know that 
 I shall inherit it?
 &nbsp; 9 And he said 
 unto him, Take me an heifer of three 
 years old, and a she goat of three 
 years old, and a ram of three years 
 old, and a turtledove, and a young 
 pigeon.
 &nbsp; 10 And he took unto him 
 all these, and divided them in the
 midst, and laid each piece one against 
 another: but the birds divided he not.
 &nbsp; 11 And when the fowls came down 
 upon the carcases, Abram drove them 
 away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the assurance given to
 Abram of the land of Canaan for an inheritance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God declares his purpose concerning it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Observe here, Abram made no complaint 
 in this matter, as he had done for the 
 want of a child. Note, Those that are sure 
 of an interest in the promised seed will see 
 no reason to doubt of a title to the promised 
 land. If Christ is ours, heaven is 
 ours. Observe again, When he believed 
 the former promise
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 then God explained 
 and ratified this to him. Note, To him that 
 has (improves what he has) more shall be 
 given. Three things God here reminds 
 Abram of, for his encouragement concerning 
 the promise of this good land:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What God is in himself: <I>I am the Lord</I> 
 Jehovah; and therefore, 
 
 (1.) "I may give it 
 to thee, for I am sovereign Lord of all, and 
 have a right to dispose of the whole earth." 
 
 (2.) "I can give it to thee, whatever opposition 
 may be made, though by the sons of 
 Anak." God never promises more than he 
 is able to perform, as men often do. 
 
 (3.) "I 
 will make good my promise to thee." Jehovah 
 is <I>not a man that he should lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he had done for Abram. He had 
 brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, <I>out 
 of the fire of the Chaldees,</I> so some, that is, 
 either from their idolatries (for the Chaldeans 
 worshipped the fire), or from their 
 persecutions. The Jewish writers have a 
 tradition that Abram was cast into a fiery 
 furnace for refusing to worship idols, and 
 was miraculously delivered. It is rather a 
 place of that name. Thence God brought 
 him by an effectual call, brought him with a 
 gracious violence, snatched him as a brand 
 out of the burning. This was, 
 
 (1.) A special 
 mercy: "I brought thee, and left others, 
 thousands, to perish there." <I>God called him 
 alone,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:2">Isa. li. 2</A>.

 (2.) A spiritual mercy, a 
 mercy to his soul, a deliverance from sin and 
 its fatal consequences. If God save our 
 souls, we shall want nothing that is good for 
 us. 
 
 (3.) A fresh mercy, lately bestowed, 
 and therefore should be the more affecting, 
 
 <A NAME="Page102"> </A>

 as that in the preface to the commandments, 
 <I>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Egypt</I> 
 lately.
 
 (4.) A foundation mercy, the beginning 
 of mercy, peculiar mercy to Abram, 
 and therefore a pledge and earnest of further 
 mercy, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:9">Isa. lxvi. 9</A>.
 Observe how God speaks 
 of it as that which he gloried in: <I>I am the 
 Lord that brought thee out.</I> He glories in it 
 as an act both of power and grace; compare 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:22">Isa. xxix. 22</A>,
 where he glories in it, long 
 afterwards. <I>Thus saith the Lord who redeemed</I> 
 Abraham, redeemed him from sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What he intended to do yet further for 
 him: "<I>I brought thee</I> hither, on purpose <I>to 
 give thee this land to inherit it,</I> not only to 
 possess it, but to possess it as an inheritance, 
 which is the sweetest and surest title." 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) The providence of God has secret 
 but gracious designs in all its various dispensations 
 towards good people; we cannot conceive 
 the projects of Providence, till the event 
 shows them in all their mercy and glory. 
 (2.) The great thing God designs in all his 
 dealings with his people is to bring them 
 safely to heaven. They are <I>chosen to salvation</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13">2 Thess. ii. 13</A>),
 <I>called to the kingdom</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:12">1 Thess. ii. 12</A>),
 <I>begotten to the inheritance</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3,4">1 Pet. i. 3, 4</A>),
 and by all <I>made meet</I> for it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12,13,2Co+4:17">Col. i. 12, 13; 2 Cor. iv. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abram desires a sign: <I>Whereby shall 
 I know that I shall inherit it?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 This did not proceed from distrust of God's power 
 or promise, as that of Zacharias; but he 
 desired this, 
 
 1. For the strengthening and 
 confirming of his own faith; he believed
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 but here he prays, <I>Lord, help me</I> 
 against <I>my unbelief. Now</I> he believed, but 
 he desired a sign to be treasured up against 
 an hour of temptation, not knowing how his 
 faith might, by some event or other, be 
 shocked and tried. Note, We all need, and 
 should desire, helps from heaven for the confirming 
 of our faith, and should improve 
 sacraments, which are instituted signs, for 
 that purpose. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:36-40,2Ki+20:8-10,Isa+7:11-12">Judg. vi. 36-40; 2 Kings xx. 8-10; Isa. vii. 11, 12</A>.

 2. For 
 the ratifying of the promise to his posterity, 
 that they also might be brought to believe it. 
 Note, Those that are satisfied themselves 
 should desire that others also may be satisfied 
 of the truth of God's promises. John 
 sent his disciples to Christ, not so much for 
 his own satisfaction as for theirs, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:2,3">Matt. xi. 2, 3</A>.
 Canaan was a type of heaven. Note, 
 It is a very desirable thing to know that we 
 shall inherit the heavenly Canaan, that is, 
 to be confirmed in our belief of the truth of 
 that happiness, and to have the evidences 
 of our title to it more and more cleared up 
 to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God directs Abram to make preparations 
 for a sacrifice, intending by that to 
 give him a sign, and Abram makes preparation 
 accordingly
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>):
 <I>Take me a 
 heifer,</I> &c. Perhaps Abram expected some 
 extraordinary sign from heaven; but God 
 gives him a sign upon a sacrifice. Note, 
 Those that would receive the assurances of 
 God's favour, and would have their faith 
 confirmed, must attend instituted ordinances, 
 and expect to meet with God in them. Observe, 
 
 1. God appointed that each of the 
 beasts used for this service should be three 
 years old, because then they were at their 
 full growth and strength: God must be 
 served with the best we have, for he is the 
 best. 
 
 2. We do not read that God gave Abram 
 particular directions how to manage 
 these beasts and fowls, knowing that he 
 was so well versed in the law and custom of 
 sacrifices that he needed not any particular 
 directions; or perhaps instructions were 
 given him, which he carefully observed, 
 though they are not recorded: at least it was
 intimated to him that they must be prepared 
 for the solemnity of ratifying a covenant; 
 and he well knew the manner of 
 preparing them. 
 
 3. Abram took as God 
 appointed him, though as yet he knew not 
 how these things should become a sign to 
 him. This was not the first instance of 
 Abram's implicit obedience. He divided 
 the beasts in the midst, according to the 
 ceremony used in confirming covenants, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:18,19">Jer. xxxiv. 18, 19</A>,
 where it is said, They 
 cut <I>the calf in twain, and passed between the 
 parts.</I> 
 
 4. Abram, having prepared according 
 to God's appointment, now set himself 
 to wait for the sign God might give him by 
 these, like the prophet upon his watch-tower, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>.
 While God's appearing to own 
 his sacrifice was deferred, Abram continued 
 waiting, and his expectations were raised by 
 the delay; when <I>the fowls came down upon 
 the carcases</I> to prey upon them, as common 
 and neglected things, <I>Abram drove them 
 away</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 believing that the vision would, 
 at the end, <I>speak, and not lie.</I> Note, A very 
 watchful eye must be kept upon our spiritual 
 sacrifices, that nothing be suffered to prey 
 upon them and render them unfit for God's 
 acceptance. When vain thoughts, like these 
 fowls, come down upon our sacrifices, we 
 must drive them away, and not suffer them 
 to lodge within us, but <I>attend on God without 
 distraction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And when the sun was going 
 down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; 
 and, lo, an horror of great darkness 
 fell upon him.
 &nbsp; 13 And he said unto 
 Abram, Know of a surety that thy 
 seed shall be a stranger in a land <I>that 
 is</I> not theirs, and shall serve them; 
 and they shall afflict them four hundred 
 years;
 &nbsp; 14 And also that nation, 
 whom they shall serve, will I 
 judge: and afterward shall they come 
 out with great substance.
 &nbsp; 15 And 
 thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; 
 thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
 &nbsp; 16 But in the fourth generation 
 they shall come hither again: for the 
 iniquity of the Amorites <I>is</I> not yet full.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a full and particular discovery 
 made to Abram of God's purposes 
 concerning his seed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when God came to him with 
 this discovery: <I>When the sun was going down,</I> 
 or <I>declining,</I> about the time of the <I>evening 
 oblation,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:36,Da+9:21">1 Kings xviii. 36; Dan. ix. 21</A>.
 Early in the morning, before day, while the
 stars were yet to be seen, God had given
 him orders concerning the sacrifices
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 and we may suppose it was, at least, his
 morning's work to prepare them and set
 them in order; when he had done this, he
 abode by them, praying and waiting till
 towards evening. Note, God often keeps
 his people long in expectation of the comforts
 he designs them, for the confirmation
 of their faith; but though the answers of 
 prayer, and the performance of promises, 
 come slowly, yet they come surely. <I>At 
 evening time it shall be light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparatives for this discovery. 
 
 1. <I>A deep sleep fell upon Abram,</I> not a common 
 sleep through weariness or carelessness, but 
 a divine ecstasy, like that which the <I>Lord 
 God caused to fall upon Adam</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:21"><I>ch.</I> ii. 21</A>),
 that, being hereby wholly taken off from the 
 view of things sensible, he might be wholly 
 taken up with the contemplation of things 
 spiritual. The doors of the body were locked 
 up, that the soul might be private and retired, 
 and might act the more freely and 
 like itself. 
 
 2. With this sleep, <I>a horror of 
 great darkness fell upon him.</I> How sudden a 
 change! But just before we had him solacing 
 himself in the comforts of God's 
 covenant, and in communion with him; 
 and here a <I>horror of great darkness</I> falls upon 
 him. Note, The children of light do not 
 always walk in the light, but sometimes 
 clouds and darkness are round about them. 
 This great darkness, which brought horror 
 with it, was designed, 
 
 (1.) To strike an awe 
 upon the spirit of Abram, and to possess 
 him with a holy reverence, that the familiarity 
 to which God was pleased to admit 
 him might not breed contempt. Note, Holy 
 fear prepares the soul for holy joy; the 
 spirit of bondage makes way for the spirit of 
 adoption. God wounds first, and then heals;
 humbles first, and then lifts up,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5,6">Isa. vi. 5, 6</A>,
 &c. 
 
 (2.) To be a specimen of the methods 
 of God's dealings with his seed. They must 
 first be in the horror and darkness of Egyptian 
 slavery, and then enter with joy into the 
 good land; and therefore he must have the 
 foretaste of their sufferings, before he had 
 the foresight of their happiness. 
 
 (3.) To be 
 an indication of the nature of that covenant 
 of peculiarity which God was now about 
 to make with Abram. The Old-Testament 
 dispensation, which was founded on that 
 covenant, was a dispensation, 
 
 [1.] Of darkness 
 and obscurity, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13,14">2 Cor. iii. 13, 14</A>.

 [2.] Of dread and horror,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>,
 &c.
</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prediction itself. Several things 
 are here foretold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The suffering state of Abram's seed for a long time,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 Let not Abram flatter 
 himself with the hopes of nothing but 
 honour and prosperity in his family; no, he 
 must know, of a surety, that which he was 
 loth to believe, that the promised seed should 
 be a persecuted seed. Note, God sends the 
 worst first; we must first suffer, and then 
 reign. He also lets us know the worst before 
 it comes, that when it comes it may not be a 
 surprise to us, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:4">John xvi. 4</A>.
 Now we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The particulars of their sufferings. 
 
 [1.] They shall be strangers; so they were, 
 first in Canaan 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:12">Ps. cv. 12</A>)
 and afterwards 
 in Egypt; before they were lords of 
 their own land they were strangers in a 
 strange land. The inconveniences of an unsettled 
 state make a happy settlement the 
 more welcome. Thus the heirs of heaven 
 are first strangers on earth, a land that is 
 not theirs. 
 
 [2.] They shall be servants; so 
 they were to the Egyptians, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:13">Exod. i. 13</A>.
 See how that which was the doom of the 
 Canaanites 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25"><I>ch.</I> ix. 25</A>),
 proves the distress of 
 Abram's seed: they are made to serve, but 
 with this difference, the Canaanites serve 
 under a curse, the Hebrews under a blessing; 
 and the <I>upright shall have dominion in 
 the morning,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>.
 
 [3.] They shall 
 be suffers. Those whom they serve shall 
 afflict them; see 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:11">Exod. i. 11</A>.
 Note, Those 
 that are blessed and beloved of God are 
 often sorely afflicted by wicked men; and 
 God foresees it, and takes cognizance of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The continuance of their sufferings--<I>four 
 hundred years.</I> This persecution began 
 with mocking, when Ishmael, the son of an 
 Egyptian, persecuted Isaac, who was <I>born 
 after the Spirit,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:9,Gal+4:29"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 9; Gal. iv. 29</A>.
 It continued in loathing; for it was an abomination 
 to the Egyptians to eat bread with 
 the Hebrews,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 32</A>;
 and it came at 
 last to murder, the basest of murders, that 
 of their new-born children; so that, more 
 or less, it continued 400 years, though, in 
 extremity, not so many. This was a long 
 time, but a limited time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judgment of the enemies of 
 Abram's seed: <I>That nation whom they shall 
 serve,</I> even the Egyptians, <I>will I judge,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 This points at the plagues of Egypt, 
 by which God not only constrained the 
 Egyptians to release Israel, but punished 
 them for all the hardships they had put upon 
 them. Note, 
 
 (1.) Though God may suffer 
 persecutors and oppressors to trample upon 
 his people a great while, yet he will certainly 
 reckon with them at last; for his <I>day is 
 coming,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:12,13">Ps. xxxvii. 12, 13</A>.

 (2.) The punishing 
 of persecutors is the judging of them: 
 it is a righteous thing with God, and a particular 
 act of justice, to recompense tribulations 
 to those that trouble his people. The 

 <A NAME="Page104"> </A>

 judging of the church's enemies is God's 
 work: <I>I will judge.</I> God can do it, for he is 
 the Lord; he will do it, for he is his people's 
 God, and he has said, <I>Vengeance is mine, I 
 will repay.</I> To him therefore we must leave 
 it, to be done in his way and time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The deliverance of Abram's seed out of 
 Egypt. That great event is here foretold: 
 <I>Afterwards shall they come out with great 
 substance.</I> It is here promised, 
 
 (1.) That 
 they should be enlarged: <I>Afterwards they 
 shall come out;</I> that is, either after they have 
 been afflicted 400 years, when the days of 
 their servitude are fulfilled, or after the 
 Egyptians are judged and plagued, then they 
 may expect deliverance. Note, The destruction 
 of oppressors is the redemption of the 
 oppressed; they will not let God's people go 
 till they are forced to it. 
 
 (2.) That they 
 should be enriched: <I>They shall come out with 
 great substance;</I> this was fulfilled, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:35,36">Exod. xii. 35, 36</A>.
 God took care they should have, not 
 only a good land to go to, but a good stock 
 to carry with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their happy settlement in Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 They shall not only come out of Egypt, but 
 <I>they shall come hither again,</I> hither to the 
 land of Canaan, wherein thou now art. The 
 discontinuance of their possession shall be 
 no defeasance of their right: we must not 
 reckon those comforts lost for ever that are 
 intermitted for a time. The reason why they 
 must not have the land of promise in possession 
 till the fourth generation was because <I>the 
 iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full.</I> 
 Israel cannot be possessed of Canaan till the 
 Amorites be dispossessed; and they are not 
 yet ripe for ruin. The righteous God has 
 determined that they shall not be cut off till 
 they have persisted in sin so long, and arrived 
 at such a pitch of wickedness, that there
 may appear some equitable proportion between 
 their sin and their ruin; and therefore, 
 till it come to that, the seed of Abram 
 must be kept out of possession. Note, 
 
 (1.) The measure of sin fills gradually. Those 
 that continue impenitent in wicked ways are
 treasuring up unto themselves wrath. 
 
 (2.) Some people's measure of sin fills slowly. 
 The Sodomites, who were sinners before the 
 Lord exceedingly, soon filled their measure; 
 so did the Jews, who were, in profession, 
 near to God. But the iniquity of the Amorites 
 was long in the filling up. 
 
 (3.) That 
 this is the reason of the prosperity of wicked
 people; the measure of their sins is not yet 
 full. The wicked <I>live, become old, and are 
 mighty in power,</I> while God is <I>laying up their 
 iniquity for their children,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:7,19">Job xxi. 7, 19</A>.
 See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32,De+32:34">Matt. xxiii. 32; Deut. xxxii. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Abram's peaceful quiet death and 
 burial, before these things should come to 
 pass,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 As he should not live to see 
 that good land in the possession of his family, 
 but must die, as he lived, a stranger in it, 
 so, to balance this, he should not live to see 
 the troubles that should come upon his seed, 
 much less to share in them. This is promised 
 to Josiah, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:20">2 Kings xxii. 20</A>.
 Note, 
 Good men are sometimes greatly favoured 
 by being <I>taken away from the evil to come,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1">Isa. lvii. 1</A>.
 Let this satisfy Abram, that, for his part,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shall <I>go to his fathers in peace.</I> 
 Note, 
 
 [1.] Even the friends and favourites 
 of Heaven are not exempted from the stroke 
 of death. Are we greater than our father 
 Abram, who is dead? 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:53">John viii. 53</A>.

 [2.] Good men die willingly; they are not fetched, 
 they are not forced, but they go; their soul is 
 not required, as the rich fool's 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:20">Luke xii. 20</A>),
 but cheerfully resigned: they would not live 
 always. 
 
 [3.] At death we go to our fathers, 
 to all our fathers that have gone before us to 
 the state of the dead 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:32,33">Job xxi. 32, 33</A>),
 to our 
 godly fathers that have gone before us to 
 the state of the blessed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:23">Heb. xii. 23</A>.
 The former thought helps to take off the terror of 
 death, the latter puts comfort into it. 
 
 [4.] Whenever a godly man dies, he dies in peace. 
 If the way be piety, the end is peace, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:37">Ps. xxxvii. 37</A>.
 Outward peace, to the last, is 
 promised to Abram, peace and truth is his 
 days, whatever should come afterwards 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:19">2 Kings xx. 19</A>);
 peace with God, and everlasting 
 peace, are sure to all the seed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shall be <I>buried in a good old age.</I> 
 Perhaps mention is made of his burial here, 
 where the land of Canaan is promised him, 
 because a burying place was the first possession 
 he had in it. He shall not only die in 
 peace, but die in honour, die, and be buried 
 decently; not only die in peace, but die in 
 season, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:26">Job v. 26</A>.
 Note, 
 
 [1.] Old age is a 
 blessing. It is promised in the fifth commandment; 
 it is pleasing to nature; and it affords a 
 great opportunity for usefulness. 
 
 [2.] Especially, if it be a good old age. Theirs may 
 be called a good old age, <I>First,</I> That are old 
 and healthful, not loaded with such distempers 
 as make them weary of life. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 That are old and holy, old disciples 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:16">Acts xxi. 16</A>),
 whose hoary head is <I>found in
 the way of righteousness</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:31">Prov. xvi. 31</A>),
 old and useful, old and exemplary for godliness; 
 theirs is indeed a good old age.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And it came to pass, that, when 
 the sun went down, and it was dark, 
 behold a smoking furnace, and a 
 burning lamp that passed between 
 those pieces.
 &nbsp; 18 In the same day the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made a covenant with Abram, 
 saying, Unto thy seed have I given 
 this land, from the river of Egypt unto 
 the great river, the river Euphrates:
 &nbsp; 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, 
 and the Kadmonites,
 &nbsp; 20 And the 
 Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the 
 Rephaims,
 &nbsp; 21 And the Amorites, and 
 the Canaanites, and the Girgashites,
 and the Jebusites.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The covenant ratified
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);
 the sign which Abram desired was given, at 
 length, when the sun had gone down, so 
 that it was dark; for that was a dark dispensation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>smoking furnace</I> signified the affliction 
 of his seed in Egypt. They were there 
 in the <I>iron furnace</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:20">Deut. iv. 20</A>),
 the <I>furnace 
 of affliction</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:10">Isa. xlviii. 10</A>),
 labouring 
 in the very fire. They were there in the 
 smoke, their eyes darkened, that they could 
 not see to the end of their troubles, and 
 themselves at a loss to conceive what God 
 would do with them. Clouds and darkness 
 were round about them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>burning lamp</I> denotes comfort in 
 this affliction; and this God showed to 
 Abram, at the same time that he showed 
 him the <I>smoking furnace.</I> 
 
 (1.) Light denotes 
 deliverance out of the furnace; their salvation 
 was as <I>a lamp that burneth,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:1">Isa. lxii. 1</A>.
 When God came down to deliver them, he 
 appeared in a bush that <I>burned, and was not 
 consumed,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:2">Exod. iii. 2</A>.
 
 (2.) The lamp denotes 
 direction in the smoke. God's word 
 was their lamp: this word to Abram was so, 
 it was a light shining in a dark place. Perhaps 
 this burning lamp prefigured the pillar 
 of cloud and fire, which led them out of 
 Egypt, in which God was. 
 
 (3.) The burning 
 lamp denotes the destruction of their enemies 
 who kept them so long in the furnace. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:6">Zech. xii. 6</A>.
 The same cloud that enlightened 
 the Israelites troubled and burned the Egyptians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The passing of these between the 
 pieces was the confirming of the covenant 
 God now made with him, that he might have 
 strong consolation, being fully persuaded 
 that what God promised he would certainly 
 perform. It is probable that the furnace 
 and lamp, which passed between the pieces, 
 burnt and consumed them, and so completed 
 the sacrifice, and testified God's acceptance 
 of it, as of Gideon's 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:21">Judg. vi. 21</A>),
 Manoah's 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19,20">Judg. xiii. 19, 20</A>),
 and Solomon's, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:1">2 Chron. vii. 1</A>.
 So it intimates, 
 
 (1.) That God's covenants
 with man are made by sacrifice 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5">Ps. l. 5</A>),
 by Christ, the great sacrifice: no agreement 
 without atonement. 
 
 (2.) God's acceptance of 
 our spiritual sacrifices is a token for good 
 and an earnest of further favours. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:23">Judg. xiii. 23</A>.
 And by this we may know that he 
 accepts our sacrifices if he kindle in our 
 souls a holy fire of pious and devout affections 
 in them.</P>

 II. The covenant repeated and explained: 
 <I>In that same day,</I> that day never to be forgotten, 
 <I>the Lord made a covenant with Abram,</I> 
 that is, gave a promise to Abram, saying, <I>Unto 
 thy seed have I given this land,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A rehearsal of the grant. He had said 
 before, <I>To thy seed will I give this land,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:7,Ge+13:15"><I>ch.</I> xii. 7; xiii. 15</A>.
 But here he says, <I>I have 
 given it;</I> that is, 
 
 (1.) I have given the promise 
 of it, the charter is sealed and delivered, 
 and cannot be disannulled. Note, God's 
 promises are God's gifts, and are so to be accounted. 
 
 (2.) The possession is as sure, in 
 due time, as if it were now actually delivered 
 to them. What God has promised is as sure 
 as if it were already done; hence, it is said, 
 <I>He that believes hath everlasting life</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>),
 for he shall as surely go to heaven as 
 if he were there already.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A recital of the particulars granted, 
 such as is usual in the grants of lands. He 
 specifies the boundaries of the land intended 
 hereby to be granted,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 And then, for 
 the greater certainty, as is usual in such 
 cases, he mentions in whose tenure and occupation 
 these lands now were. Ten several 
 nations, or tribes, are here spoken of
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>)
 that must be cast out, to make 
 room for the <I>seed of Abram.</I> They were not 
 possessed of all these countries when God 
 brought them into Canaan. The bounds are 
 fixed much narrower, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:2-12">Num. xxxiv. 2, 3</A>.
 &c. But, 
 
 (1.) In David's time, and Solomon's, 
 their jurisdiction extended to the utmost of 
 these limits, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+9:26">2 Chron. ix. 26</A>.

 (2.) It was 
 their own fault that they were not sooner 
 and longer in possession of all these territories. 
 They forfeited their right by their 
 sins, and by their own sloth and cowardice 
 kept themselves out of possession. 
 
 (3.) The 
 land granted is here described in its utmost 
 extent because it was to be a type of the 
 heavenly inheritance, where there is room 
 enough: in our father's house are many 
 mansions. The present occupants are named, 
 because their number, and strength, and 
 long prescription, should be no hindrance to 
 the accomplishment of this promise in its 
 season, and to magnify God's love to Abram 
 and his seed, in giving to that one nation 
 the possessions of many nations, so precious 
 were they in his sight, and so honourable,
