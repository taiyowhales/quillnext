 We are here returning to the story of Abraham; yet that part of 
 it which is here recorded is not to his honour. The fairest marbles 
 have their flaws, and, while there are spots in the sun, we must 
 not expect any thing spotless under it. The scripture, it should 
 be remarked, is impartial in relating the blemishes even of its 
 most celebrated characters. We have here, 
 
 I. Abraham's sin in 
 denying his wife, and Abimelech's sin thereupon in taking her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II. God's discourse with Abimelech in a dream, upon 
 this occasion, wherein he shows him his error
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:3">ver. 3</A>),
 accepts his plea
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>),
 and directs him to make restitution,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">ver. 7</A>.
 
 III. Abimelech's discourse with Abraham, wherein he chides 
 him for the cheat he had put upon him
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),
 and Abraham 
 excuses it as well as he can,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.
 
 IV. The good 
 issue of the story, in which Abimelech restores Abraham his 
 wife 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>),
 and Abraham, by prayer, prevails with God 
 for the removal of the judgment Abimelech was under, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Abraham journeyed from
 thence toward the south country,
 and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur,
 and sojourned in Gerar.
 &nbsp; 2 And Abraham
 said of Sarah his wife, She <I>is</I> my
 sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar
 sent, and took Sarah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. Abraham's removal from Mamre,
 where he had lived nearly twenty years, into 
 the country of the Philistines: <I>He sojourned 
 in Gerar,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 We are not told upon what 
 occasion he removed, whether terrified by the 
 destruction of Sodom, or because the country 
 round was for the present prejudiced by it, 
 or, as some of the Jewish writers say, because 
 he was grieved at Lot's incest with his 
 daughters, and the reproach which the Canaanites 
 cast upon him and his religion, for 
 
 <A NAME="Page128"> </A>

 his kinsman's sake: doubtless there was 
 some good cause for his removal. Note, In 
 a world where we are strangers and pilgrims 
 we cannot expect to be always in the same 
 place. Again, Wherever we are, we must look 
 upon ourselves but as sojourners. 
 
 2. His sin 
 in denying his wife, as before
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:13"><I>ch.</I> xii. 13</A>),
 which was not only in itself such an equivocation 
 as bordered upon a lie, and which, if 
 admitted as lawful, would be the ruin of 
 human converse and an inlet to all falsehood, 
 but was also an exposing of the chastity and 
 honour of his wife, of which he ought to 
 have been the protector. But, besides this, 
 it had here a two-fold aggravation:--
 
 (1.) He had been guilty of this same sin before, 
 and had been reproved for it, and convinced 
 of the folly of the suggestion which induced 
 him to it; yet he returns to it. Note, It is 
 possible that a good man may, not only fall 
 into sin, but relapse into the same sin, 
 through the surprise and strength of temptation 
 and the infirmity of the flesh. Let backsliders 
 repent then, but not despair, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>.

 (2.) Sarah, as it should seem, was 
 now with child of the promised seed, or, at 
 least, in expectation of being so quickly, according 
 to the word of God; he ought therefore 
 to have taken particular care of her 
 now, as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:4">Judg. xiii. 4</A>.

 3. The peril that 
 Sarah was brought into by this means: <I>The 
 king of Gerar sent, and took her</I> to his house, 
 in order to the taking of her to his bed. 
 Note, The sin of one often occasions the sin 
 of others; he that breaks the hedge of God's 
 commandments opens a gap to he knows not 
 how many; the beginning of sin is as the 
 letting forth of water.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 But God came to Abimelech in
 a dream by night, and said to him,
 Behold, thou <I>art but</I> a dead man, for
 the woman which thou hast taken;
 for she <I>is</I> a man's wife.
 &nbsp; 4 But Abimelech 
 had not come near her: and he
 said, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, wilt thou slay also a 
 righteous nation?
 &nbsp; 5 Said he not unto 
 me, She <I>is</I> my sister? and she, even 
 she herself said, He <I>is</I> my brother: 
 in the integrity of my heart and innocency 
 of my hands have I done 
 this.
 &nbsp; 6 And God said unto him in 
 a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
 this in the integrity of thy heart; 
 for I also withheld thee from sinning 
 against me: therefore suffered I thee 
 not to touch her.
 &nbsp; 7 Now therefore 
 restore the man <I>his</I> wife; for he <I>is</I> a
 prophet, and he shall pray for thee, 
 and thou shalt live: and if thou restore 
 <I>her</I> not, know thou that thou shalt 
 surely die, thou, and all that <I>are</I> thine.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It appears by this that God revealed himself 
 by dreams (which evidenced themselves to 
 be divine and supernatural) not only to 
 his servants the prophets, but even to those 
 who were out of the pale of the church and 
 covenant; but then, usually, it was with 
 some regard to God's own people as in Pharaoh's 
 dream, to Joseph, in Nebuchadnezzar's, 
 to Daniel, and here, in Abimelech's, to Abraham 
 and Sarah, for he reproved this king for 
 their sake, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15">Ps. cv. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God gives him notice of his danger
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 his danger of <I>sin,</I> telling him that the woman 
 is a man's wife, so that if he take her he 
 will wrong her husband; his danger of death 
 for this sin: <I>Thou art a dead man;</I> and God's 
 saying so of a man makes him so. Note, 
 Every wilful sinner ought to be told that he 
 is a dead man, as the condemned malefactor, 
 and the patient whose disease is mortal, 
 are said to be so. If thou art a bad man, 
 certainly thou art a dead man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleads ignorance that Abraham and 
 Sarah had agreed to impose upon him, and 
 not to let him know that they were any more 
 than brother and sister,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 See what confidence 
 a man may have towards God when 
 his heart condemns him not, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21">1 John iii. 21</A>.
 If our consciences witness to our integrity, 
 and that, however we may have been cheated 
 into a snare, we have not knowingly and wittingly 
 sinned against God, it will be our rejoicing 
 in the day of evil. He pleads with 
 God as Abraham had done,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 23</A>.
 <I>Wilt thou slay a righteous nation?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 Not such a nation as Sodom, which was indeed 
 justly destroyed, but a nation which, in this 
 matter, was innocent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God gives a very full answer to what 
 he had said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He allows his plea, and admits that what 
 he did he did in the integrity of his heart: 
 <I>Yea, I know it,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Note, It is matter of 
 comfort to those that are honest that God 
 knows their honesty, and will acknowledge 
 it, though perhaps men that are prejudiced 
 against them either cannot be convinced of 
 it or will not own that they are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He lets him know that he was kept 
 from proceeding in the sin merely by the 
 good hand of God upon him: <I>I withheld thee 
 from sinning against me.</I> Abimelech was 
 hereby kept from doing wrong, Abraham 
 from suffering wrong, and Sarah from both. 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) There is a great deal of sin devised 
 and designed that is never executed. As bad 
 as things are in the world, they are not so 
 bad as the devil and wicked men would have 
 them. 
 
 (2.) It is God that restrains men from 
 doing the ill they would do. It is not from 
 him that there is sin, but it is from him that 
 there is not more sin, either by his influence 
 upon men's minds, checking their inclination 
 to sin, or by his providence, taking away the 
 opportunity to sin. 
 
 (3.) It is a great mercy 
 to be hindered from committing sin; of this 
 God must have the glory, whoever is the 
 instrument, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32,33">1 Sam. xxv. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Page129"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He charges him to make restitution: 
 <I>Now therefore,</I> not that thou art better informed, 
 <I>restore the man his wife,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 Note, 
 Ignorance will excuse no longer than it continues. 
 If we have entered upon a wrong 
 course through ignorance this will not 
 excuse our knowingly persisting in it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:3-5">Lev. v. 3-5</A>.
 The reasons why he must be just 
 and kind to Abraham are, 
 
 (1.) Because <I>he is 
 a prophet,</I> near and dear to God, for whom 
 God does in a particular manner concern 
 himself. God highly resents the injuries 
 done to his prophets, and takes them as done 
 to himself. 
 
 (2.) Being a prophet, <I>he shall 
 pray for thee;</I> this is a prophet's reward, 
 and a good reward it is. It is intimated that 
 there was great efficacy in the prayers of a 
 prophet, and that good men should be ready 
 to help those with their prayers that stand in 
 need of them, and should make, at least, this 
 return for the kindnesses that are done them. 
 Abraham was accessory to Abimelech's 
 trouble, and therefore was obliged in justice 
 to pray for him. 
 
 (3.) It is at thy peril if 
 thou do not restore her: <I>Know thou that thou 
 shalt surely die.</I> Note, He that does wrong, 
 whoever he is, prince or peasant, shall certainly 
 receive for the wrong which he has 
 done, unless he repent and make restitution, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:25">Col. iii. 25</A>.
 No injustice can be made passable 
 with God, no, not by Caesar's image 
 stamped upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Therefore Abimelech rose early 
 in the morning, and called all his servants, 
 and told all these things in their 
 ears: and the men were sore afraid.
 &nbsp; 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, 
 and said unto him, What hast thou 
 done unto us? and what have I offended 
 thee, that thou hast brought 
 on me and on my kingdom a great 
 sin? thou hast done deeds unto me 
 that ought not to be done.
 &nbsp; 10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What 
 sawest thou, that thou hast done this 
 thing?
 &nbsp; 11 And Abraham said, Because 
 I thought, Surely the fear of 
 God <I>is</I> not in this place; and they will 
 slay me for my wife's sake.
 &nbsp; 12 And 
 yet indeed <I>she is</I> my sister; she <I>is</I> the 
 daughter of my father, but not the 
 daughter of my mother; and she became 
 my wife.
 &nbsp; 13 And it came to 
 pass, when God caused me to wander 
 from my father's house, that I said 
 unto her, This <I>is</I> thy kindness which 
 thou shalt show unto me; at every
 place whither we shall come, say of 
 me, He <I>is</I> my brother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abimelech, being thus warned of God in a 
 dream, takes the warning, and, as one truly 
 afraid of sin and its consequences, he rises 
 early to obey the directions given him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He has a caution for his servants,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Abraham himself could not be more careful 
 than he was to command his household in 
 this matter. Note, Those whom God has 
 convinced of sin and danger ought to tell 
 others what God has done for their souls, 
 that they also may be awakened and brought 
 to a like holy fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He has a chiding for Abraham. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The serious reproof which Abimelech 
 gave to Abraham,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 His reasoning 
 with Abraham upon this occasion was very 
 strong, and yet very mild. Nothing could 
 be said better; he does not reproach him, 
 nor insult over him, does not say, "Is this 
 your profession? I see, though you will not 
 swear, you will lie. If these be prophets, I 
 will beg to be freed from the sight of them:" 
 but he fairly represents the injury Abraham 
 had done him, and calmly signifies his resentment 
 of it. 
 
 (1.) He calls that sin which 
 he now found he had been in danger of a 
 great sin. Note, Even the light of nature 
 teaches men that the sin of adultery is a very 
 great sin: be it observed, to the shame of 
 many who call themselves Christians, and yet 
 make a light matter of it. 
 
 (2.) He looks 
 upon it that both himself and his kingdom 
 would have been exposed to the wrath of 
 God if he had been guilty of this sin, though 
 ignorantly. Note, The sins of kings often 
 prove the plagues of kingdoms; rulers should 
 therefore, for their people's sake, dread sin. 
 
 (3.) He charges Abraham with doing that 
 which was not justifiable, in disowning his 
 marriage. This he speaks of justly, and yet 
 tenderly; he does not call him a liar and 
 cheat, but tells him he had done <I>deeds that 
 ought not to be done.</I> Note, Equivocation 
 and dissimulation, however they may be palliated, 
 are very bad things, and by no means 
 to be admitted in any case. 
 
 (4.) He takes it 
 as a very great injury to himself and his 
 family that Abraham had thus exposed them 
 to sin: "<I>What have I offended thee?</I> If I
 had been thy worst enemy, thou couldst not 
 have done me a worse turn, nor taken a more 
 effectual course to be revenged on me." 
 Note, We ought to reckon that those do us 
 the greatest unkindness in the world that any 
 way tempt us or expose us to sin, though 
 they may pretend friendship, and offer that 
 which is grateful enough to corrupt 
 nature. 
 
 (5.) He challenges him to assign a 
 cause for his suspecting them as a dangerous 
 people for an honest man to live among: 
 "<I>What sawest thou, that thou hast done this
 thing?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 What reason hadst thou to 
 think that if we had known her to be thy 
 wife thou wouldst have been exposed to any 
 danger by it?" Note, A suspicion of our 
 goodness is justly reckoned a greater affront 
 than a slight upon our greatness.</P>

 <A NAME="Page130"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The poor excuse that Abraham made 
 for himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He pleaded the bad opinion he had of 
 the place,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 He thought within himself 
 (though he could not give any good reason 
 for his thinking so), "<I>Surely the fear of God
 is not in this place,</I> and then they will slay 
 me." 
 
 [1.] Little good is to be expected 
 where no fear of God is. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:1">Ps. xxxvi. 1</A>.
 
 [2.] There are many places and persons that 
 have more of the fear of God in them than 
 we think they have: perhaps they are not 
 called by our dividing name, they do not wear 
 our badges, they do not tie themselves to that 
 which we have an opinion of; and therefore 
 we conclude they have not the fear of God 
 in their hearts, which is very injurious both 
 of Christ and Christians, and makes us obnoxious 
 to God's judgment, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1">Matt. vii. 1</A>.

 [3.] Uncharitableness and censoriousness are sins 
 that are the cause of many other sins. When 
 men have once persuaded themselves concerning 
 such and such that they have not 
 the fear of God, they think this will justify 
 them in the most unjust and unchristian 
 practices towards them. Men would not do 
 ill if they did not first think ill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He excused it from the guilt of a downright 
 lie by making it out that, in a sense, 
 she was his sister,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 Some think she
 was own sister to Lot, who is called his 
 <I>brother Lot</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:16"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16</A>),
 though he was <I>his 
 nephew;</I> so Sarah is called his <I>sister.</I> But 
 those to whom he said, <I>She is my sister,</I> understood 
 that she was so his sister as not to 
 be capable of being his wife; so that it was 
 an equivocation, with an intent to deceive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He clears himself from the imputation 
 of an affront designed to Abimelech in it by 
 alleging that it had been his practice before, 
 according to an agreement between him and 
 his wife, when they first became sojourners
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 "<I>When God caused me to wander
 from my father's house,</I> then we settled this 
 matter." Note, 
 
 [1.] God is to be acknowledged 
 in all our wanderings. 
 
 [2.] Those 
 that travel abroad, and converse much with 
 strangers, as they have need of the wisdom 
 of the serpent, so it is requisite that 
 that wisdom be ever tempered with the 
 innocence of the dove. It may, for aught I 
 know, be suggested that God denied to Abraham 
 and Sarah the blessing of children so 
 long to punish them for this sinful compact 
 if they will not own their marriage, why 
 should God own it? But we may suppose 
 that, after this reproof which Abimelech gave 
 them, they agreed never to do so again, and 
 then presently we read
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 1, 2</A>)
 that <I>Sarah conceived.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And Abimelech took sheep, and 
 oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, 
 and gave <I>them</I> unto Abraham, 
 and restored him Sarah his wife.
 &nbsp; 15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my 
 land <I>is</I> before thee: dwell where it 
 pleaseth thee. 
 &nbsp; 16 And unto Sarah he 
 said, Behold, I have given thy brother 
 a thousand <I>pieces</I> of silver: behold, 
 he <I>is</I> to thee a covering of the eyes, 
 unto all that <I>are</I> with thee, and with 
 all <I>other:</I> thus she was reproved.
 &nbsp; 17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and 
 God healed Abimelech, and his wife, 
 and his maidservants; and they bare <I>children.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had fast 
 closed up all the wombs of the house
 of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's 
 wife.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The kindness of a prince which 
 Abimelech showed to Abraham. See how 
 unjust Abraham's jealousies were. He fancied 
 that if they knew that Sarah was his wife they 
 would kill him; but, when they did know it, 
 instead of killing him they were kind to him, 
 frightened at least to be so by the divine 
 rebukes they were under. 
 
 1. He gives him 
 his royal licence to dwell where he pleased 
 in his country, courting his stay because he 
 gives him his royal gifts
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 <I>sheep and oxen,</I> and
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 <I>a thousand pieces of silver.</I> 
 This he gave when he restored Sarah, either, 
 
 [1.] By way of satisfaction for the wrong he 
 had offered to do, in taking her to his house: 
 when the Philistines restored the ark, being 
 plagued for detaining it, they sent a present 
 with it. The law appointed that when restitution 
 was made something should be added 
 to it, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:5">Lev. vi. 5</A>.
 Or, 
 
 [2.] To engage Abraham's 
 prayers for him; not as if prayers 
 should be bought and sold, but we should 
 endeavour to be kind to those of whose spiritual 
 things we reap, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:11">1 Cor. ix. 11</A>.
 Note, 
 It is our wisdom to get and keep an interest 
 with those that have an interest in heaven, 
 and to make those our friends who are the 
 friends of God. 
 
 [3.] He gives to Sarah good 
 instruction, tells her that her husband (her 
 <I>brother</I> he calls him, to upbraid her with 
 calling him so) must be to her for <I>a covering of 
 the eyes,</I> that is, she must look at no other, 
 nor desire to be looked at by any other. 
 Note, Yoke-fellows must be to each other 
 for a covering of the eyes. The marriage-covenant 
 is a covenant with the eyes, like 
 Job's,

 II. The kindness of a prophet which Abraham 
 showed to Abimelech: he <I>prayed for 
 him,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 This honour God would put 
 upon Abraham that, though Abimelech had 
 restored Sarah, yet the judgment he was 
 under should be removed upon the prayer of 
 Abraham, and not before. Thus God healed 
 Miriam, when Moses, whom she had most 
 affronted, prayed for her 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:13">Num. xii. 13</A>),
 and was reconciled to Job's friends when Job, 
 whom they had grieved, prayed for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:8-10">Job xlii. 8-10</A>),
 and so did, as it were, give 
 it under his hand that he was reconciled to 
 them. Note, The prayers of good men may 
 be a kindness to great men, and ought to be 
 valued.</P>
