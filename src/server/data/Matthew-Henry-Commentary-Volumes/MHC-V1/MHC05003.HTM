 Moses, in this chapter, relates, 

 I. The conquest of Og, king of Bashan, and the seizing of his country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The distribution of these new conquests to the two tribes and a
 half, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 Under certain provisos and limitations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 III. The encouragement given to Joshua to carry on the war which was so
 gloriously begun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 IV. Moses's request to go over into Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>),

 with the denial of that request, but the grant of an equivalent,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the
 king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
 battle at Edrei.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
 him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
 shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
 which dwelt at Heshbon.
 &nbsp; 3 So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God delivered into our hands Og also, the
 king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none
 was left to him remaining.
 &nbsp; 4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
 which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of
 Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
 &nbsp; 5 All these cities <I>were</I> fenced with high walls, gates, and
 bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
 &nbsp; 6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
 Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
 every city.
 &nbsp; 7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for
 a prey to ourselves.
 &nbsp; 8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
 the Amorites the land that <I>was</I> on this side Jordan, from the
 river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
 &nbsp; 9 (<I>Which</I> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites
 call it Shenir;)
 &nbsp; 10 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
 unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
 &nbsp; 11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of
 giants; behold, his bedstead <I>was</I> a bedstead of iron; <I>is</I> it
 not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <I>was</I> the
 length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the
 cubit of a man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another brave country delivered into the hand of Israel, 
 that of Bashan; the conquest of Sihon is often mentioned together with 
 that of Og, to the praise of God, the rather because in these Israel's 
 triumphs began, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:11,136:19,20">Ps. cxxxv. 11; cxxxvi. 19, 20</A>.

 See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they got the mastery of Og, a very formidable prince, 

 1. Very strong, for he was of the remnant of the giants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 his personal strength was extraordinary, a monument of which was 
 preserved by the Ammonites in his bedstead, which was shown as a rarity 
 in their chief city. You might guess at his weight by the materials of 
 his bedstead; it was iron, as if a bedstead of wood were too weak for 
 him to trust to: and you might guess at his stature by the dimensions 
 of it; it was nine cubits long and four cubits broad, which, supposing 
 a cubit to be but half a yard (and some learned men have made it appear
 to be somewhat more), was four yards and a half long, and two yards 
 broad; and if we allow his bedstead to be two cubits longer than 
 himself, and that is as much as we need allow, he was three yards and a 
 half high, double the stature of an ordinary man, and every way 
 proportionable, yet they smote him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, when God pleads his people's cause he can deal with giants as 
 with grasshoppers.  No man's might can secure him against the Almighty. 
 The army of Og was very powerful, for he had the command of sixty 
 fortified cities, besides the unwalled towns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Yet all this was nothing before God's Israel, when they came with 
 commission to destroy him. 

 2. He was very bold and daring: He <I>came out against Israel to
 battle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was wonderful that he did not take warning by the ruin of Sihon, and 
 send to desire conditions of peace; but he trusted to his own strength, 
 and so was hardened to his destruction. Note, Those that are not 
 awakened by the judgments of God upon others, but persist in their 
 defiance of heaven, are ripening apace for the like judgments upon 
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:8">Jer. iii. 8</A>.
 
 God bade Moses not fear him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 If Moses himself was so strong in faith as not to need the caution, yet 
 it is probable that the people needed it, and for them these fresh 
 assurances are designed; "<I>I will deliver him into thy hand;</I> not 
 only deliver thee out of his hand, that he shall not be thy ruin, but 
 deliver him <I>into thy hand,</I> that thou shalt be his ruin, and make 
 him pay dearly for his attempt." He adds, <I>Thou shalt do to him as 
 thou didst to Sihon,</I> intimating that they ought to be encouraged by 
 their former victory to trust in God for another victory, for he is 
 God, and changeth not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they got possession of Bashan, a very desirable country. They 
 took all the cities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and all the spoil of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They made them all their own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 So that now they had in their hands all that fruitful country which lay 
 east of Jordan, from <I>the river Arnon unto Hermon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Their conquering and possessing these countries was intended, not only 
 for the encouragement of Israel in the wars of Canaan, but for the 
 satisfaction of Moses before his death. Since he must not live to see 
 the completing of their victory and settlement, God thus gives him a 
 specimen of it. Thus the Spirit is given to those that believe as the 
 <I>earnest of their inheritance,</I> until the redemption of the 
 purchased possession.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And this land, <I>which</I> we possessed at that time, from
 Aroer, which <I>is</I> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and
 the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the
 Gadites.
 &nbsp; 13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <I>being</I> the kingdom
 of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
 Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
 &nbsp; 14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
 the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
 own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.
 &nbsp; 15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
 &nbsp; 16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
 Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border
 even unto the river Jabbok, <I>which is</I> the border of the children
 of Ammon;
 &nbsp; 17 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <I>thereof,</I> from
 Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <I>even</I> the salt sea,
 under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
 &nbsp; 18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God
 hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed
 before your brethren the children of Israel, all <I>that are</I> meet
 for the war.
 &nbsp; 19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle,
 (<I>for</I> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your
 cities which I have given you;
 &nbsp; 20 Until the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have given rest unto your brethren, as well
 as unto you, and <I>until</I> they also possess the land which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <I>then</I> shall ye
 return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having shown how this country which they were now in was conquered, in 
 these verses he shows how it was settled upon the Reubenites, Gadites, 
 and half the tribe of Manasseh, which we had the story of before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:1-42">Num. xxxii.</A>

 Here is the rehearsal.

 1. Moses specifies the particular parts of the country that were
 allotted to each tribe, especially the distribution of the lot to the 
 half tribe of Manasseh, the subdividing of which tribe is observable. 
 Joseph was divided into Ephraim and Manasseh; Manasseh was divided into 
 one half on the one side Jordan and the other half on the other side: 
 that on the east side Jordan was again divided into two great families, 
 which had their several allotments: Jair,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 Machir, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And perhaps Jacob's prediction of the smallness of that tribe was now 
 accomplished in these divisions and subdivisions. Observe that Bashan 
 is here called <I>the land of the giants,</I> because it had been in 
 their possession, but Og was the last of them. These giants, it seems, 
 had lost their country, and were rooted out of it sooner than any of 
 their neighbours; for those who, presuming upon their strength and 
 stature, had their hand against every man, had every man's hand against 
 them, and went down slain to the pit, though they were the terror of 
 the mighty in the land of the living. 

 2.  He repeats the condition of the grant which they had already agreed
 to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 That they should send a strong detachment over Jordan to lead the van 
 in the conquest of Canaan, who should not return to their families, at 
 least not to settle (though for a time they might retire thither into 
 winter quarters, at the end of a campaign), till they had seen their 
 brethren in as full possession of their respective allotments as they 
 themselves were now in of theirs. They must hereby be taught not to 
 <I>look at their own things only, but at the things of others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:4">Phil. ii. 4</A>.

 It ill becomes an Israelite to be selfish, and to prefer any private
 interest before the public welfare. When we are rest we should desire 
 to see our brethren at rest too, and should be ready to do what we can 
 towards it; for we are not born for ourselves, but are members one of 
 another. A good man cannot rejoice much in the comforts of his family 
 unless withal he sees <I>peace upon Israel,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
 seen all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath done unto these two kings:
 so shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
 &nbsp; 22 Ye shall not fear them: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God he shall fight
 for you.
 &nbsp; 23 And I besought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> at that time, saying,
 &nbsp; 24 O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy
 greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <I>is there</I> in heaven
 or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
 thy might?
 &nbsp; 25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <I>is</I>
 beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
 &nbsp; 26 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
 hear me: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no
 more unto me of this matter.
 &nbsp; 27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
 westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold
 <I>it</I> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
 &nbsp; 28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him:
 for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
 to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
 &nbsp; 29 So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is 

 I. The encouragement which Moses gave to Joshua, who was to succeed him
 in the government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He commanded him not to fear.  This those that are aged and experienced 
 in the service of God should do all they can to strengthen the hands of 
 those that are young, and setting out in religion. Two things he would 
 have him consider for his encouragement:--

 1. What God has done. Joshua had seen what a total defeat God had given
 by the forces of Israel to these two kings, and thence he might easily 
 infer, <I>so shall the Lord do to all the rest of the kingdoms</I> upon 
 which we are to make war.  He must not only infer thence that thus the 
 Lord can do with them all, for his arm is not shortened, but thus he 
 will do, for his purpose is not changed; he that has begun will finish; 
 <I>as for God, his work is perfect.</I> Joshua had seen it with his own 
 eyes. And the more we have seen of the instances of divine wisdom, 
 power, and goodness, the more inexcusable we are if we <I>fear what 
 flesh can do unto us.</I> 

 2. What God had promised. The <I>Lord your God he shall fight for
 you;</I> and that cause cannot but be victorious which the Lord of 
 hosts fights for.  <I>If God be for us, who can be against us</I> so as 
 to prevail? We reproach our leader if we follow him trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prayer which Moses made for himself, and the answer which God 
 gave to that prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His prayer was that, if it were God's will, he might go before 
 Israel over Jordan into Canaan. At that time, when he had been 
 encouraging Joshua to fight Israel's battles, taking it for granted 
 that he must be their leader, he was touched with an earnest desire to 
 go over himself, which expresses itself not in any passionate and 
 impatient complaints, or reflections upon the sentence he was under, 
 but in humble prayers to God for a gracious reversing of it. <I>I 
 besought the Lord.</I> Note, We should never allow any desires in our 
 hearts which we cannot in faith offer up to God by prayer; and what 
 desires are innocent, let them be presented to God. We have not because 
 we ask not.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What he pleads here. Two things:--

 [1.] The great experience which he had had of God's goodness to him in
 what he had done for Israel: "<I>Thou hast begun to show thy servant 
 thy greatness.</I> Lord, perfect what thou hast begun. Thou hast given 
 me to see thy glory in the conquest of these two kings, and the sight 
 has affected me with wonder and thankfulness. O let me see more of the 
 outgoings of my God, my King! This great work, no doubt, will be 
 carried on and completed; let me have the satisfaction of seeing it." 
 Note, the more we see of God's glory in his works the more we shall 
 desire to see. <I>The works of the Lord are great,</I> and therefore 
 are sought out more and more <I>of all those that have pleasure 
 therein.</I> 

 [2.] The good impressions that had been made upon his heart by what he 
 had seen: For <I>what God is there in heaven or earth that can do 
 according to thy works?</I> The more we are affected with what we have 
 seen of God, of his wisdom, power, and goodness, the better we are 
 prepared for further discoveries. Those shall see the works of God that 
 admire him in them.  Moses had thus expressed himself concerning God 
 and his works long before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>),

 and he still continues of the same mind, that there are no works worthy
 to be compared with God's works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:8">Ps. lxxxvi. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he begs: <I>I pray thee let me go over,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 God had said he should not go over; yet he prays that he might, not 
 knowing but that the threatening was conditional, for it was not 
 ratified with an oath, as that concerning the people was, that they 
 should not enter.  Thus Hezekiah prayed for his own life, and David for 
 the life of his child, after both had ben expressly threatened; and the 
 former prevailed, though the latter did not. Moses remembered the time 
 when he had by prayer prevailed with God to recede from the 
 declarations which he had made of his wrath against Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:14">Exod. xxxii. 14</A>.

 And why might he not hope in like manner to prevail for himself? <I>Let
 me go over and see the good land.</I> Not, "Let me go over and be a 
 prince and a ruler there;" he seeks not his own honour, is content to 
 resign the government to Joshua; but, "Let me go to be a spectator of 
 thy kindness to Israel, to see what I believe concerning the goodness 
 of the land of promise." How pathetically does he speak of Canaan, that 
 <I>good land,</I> that <I>goodly mountain!</I> Note, Those may hope to 
 obtain and enjoy God's favours that know how to value them. What he 
 means by <I>that goodly mountain</I> we may learn from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54">Ps. lxxviii. 54</A>,

 where it is said of God's Israel that <I>he brought them to the border
 of his sanctuary, even to this mountain which his right hand had 
 purchased,</I> where it is plainly to be understood of the whole land 
 of Canaan, yet with an eye to the sanctuary, the glory of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God's answer to this prayer had in it a mixture of mercy and 
 judgment, that he might sing unto God of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There was judgment in the denial of his request, and that in 
 something of anger too: <I>The Lord was wroth with me for your 
 sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 God not only sees sin in his people, but is much displeased with it; 
 and even those that are delivered from the wrath to come may yet lie 
 under the tokens of God's wrath in this world, and may be denied some 
 particular favour which their hearts are much set upon.  God is a 
 gracious, tender, loving Father; but he is angry with his children when 
 they do amiss, and denies them many a thing that they desire and are 
 ready to cry for. But how was he wroth with Moses <I>for the sake of 
 Israel?</I> Either, 

 [1.] For that sin which they provoked him to; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:32,33">Ps. cvi. 32, 33</A>.
 
 Or,
 
 [2.] The removal of Moses at that time, when he could so ill be spared, 
 was a rebuke to all Israel, and a punishment of their sin. Or, 

 [3.] It was for their sakes, that it might be a warning to them to take 
 heed of offending God by passionate and unbelieving speeches at any 
 time, after the similitude of his transgression; for, if <I>this were 
 done to such a green tree, what should be done to the dry?</I> He 
 acknowledges that God would not hear him. God had often heard him for 
 Israel, yet he would not hear him for himself. It was the prerogative 
 of Christ, the great Intercessor, to be heard always; yet of him his 
 enemies said, <I>He saved others, himself he could not save,</I> which 
 the Jews would not have upbraided him with had they considered that 
 Moses, their great prophet, prevailed for others, but for himself he 
 could not prevail.  Though Moses, being one of the wrestling seed of 
 Jacob, did not seek in vain, yet he had not the thing itself which he 
 sought for. God may accept our prayers, and yet not grant us the very 
 thing we pray for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is mercy mixed with this wrath in several things:--

 [1.] God quieted the spirit of Moses under the decree that had gone 
 forth by that word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>Let it suffice thee.</I> With this word, no doubt, a divine power
 went to reconcile Moses to the will of God, and to bring him to 
 acquiesce in it. If God does not by his providence give us what we 
 desire, yet, if by his grace he makes us content without it, it comes 
 much to one. "<I>Let it suffice thee</I> to have God for they father, 
 and heaven for thy portion, though thou hast not every thing thou 
 wouldest have in this world. Be satisfied with this, <I>God is 
 all-sufficient.</I>" 

 [2.] He put an honour upon his prayer in directing him not to insist 
 upon this request: <I>Speak no more to me of this matter.</I> It 
 intimates that what God does not think fit to grant we should not think 
 fit to ask, and that God takes such a pleasure in the prayer of the 
 upright that it is no pleasure to him, no, not in any particular 
 instance, to give a denial to it. 

 [3.] He promised him a sight of Canaan <I>from the top of Pisgah,</I>

 Though he should not have the possession of it, he should have the 
 prospect of it; not to tantalize him, but such a sight of it as would 
 yield him true satisfaction, and would enable him to form a very clear 
 and pleasing idea of that promised land. Probably Moses had not only 
 his sight preserved for other purposes, but greatly enlarged for this 
 purpose; for, if he had not had such a sight of it as others could not 
 have from the same place, it would have been no particular favour to 
 Moses, nor the matter of a promise. Even great believers, in this 
 present state, see heaven but at a distance. 

 [4.] He provided him a successor, one who should support the honour of 
 Moses and carry on and complete that glorious work which the heart of 
 Moses was so much upon, the bringing of Israel to Canaan, and settling 
 them there

 <I>Charge Joshua and encourage him</I> in this work. Those to whom God
 gives a charge, he will be sure to give encouragement to. And it is a 
 comfort to the church's friends (when they are dying and going off) to 
 see God's work likely to be carried on by other hands, when they are 
 silent in the dust.</P>
