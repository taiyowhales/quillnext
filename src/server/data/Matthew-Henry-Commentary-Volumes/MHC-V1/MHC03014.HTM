 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former chapter directed the priests how to convict a leper of
 ceremonial uncleanness. No prescriptions are given for his cure; but,
 when God had cured him, the priests are in this chapter directed how to
 cleanse him. The remedy here is only adapted to the ceremonial part of
 his disease; but the authority Christ gave to his ministers was to cure
 the lepers, and so to cleanse them. We have here, 

 I. The solemn declaration of the leper's being clean, with the
 significant ceremony attending it,

 II. The sacrifices which he was to offer to God eight days after,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:10-32">ver. 10-32</A>.

 III. The management of a house in which appeared signs of a
 leprosy,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
 cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:
 &nbsp; 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
 shall look, and, behold, <I>if</I> the plague of leprosy be healed in
 the leper;
 &nbsp; 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
 cleansed two birds alive <I>and</I> clean, and cedar wood, and
 scarlet, and hyssop:
 &nbsp; 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
 in an earthen vessel over running water:
 &nbsp; 6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
 and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
 living bird in the blood of the bird <I>that was</I> killed over the
 running water:
 &nbsp; 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from
 the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
 let the living bird loose into the open field.
 &nbsp; 8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
 shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be
 clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall
 tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
 &nbsp; 9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
 his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
 his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also
 he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. It is supposed that the plague of the leprosy was not an incurable 
 disease. Uzziah's indeed continued to the day of his death, and 
 Gehazi's was entailed upon his seed; but Miriam's lasted only seven 
 days: we may suppose that it often wore off in process of time. Though 
 God contend long, he will <I>not contend for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The judgment of the cure, as well as that of the disease, was 
 referred to the priest. He must go out of the camp to the leper, to see 
 whether his leprosy was healed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And we may suppose the priest did not contract any ceremonial 
 uncleanness by coming near the leper, as another person would. It was 
 in mercy to the poor lepers that the priests particularly had orders to 
 attend them, for <I>the priests' lips should keep knowledge;</I> and 
 those in affliction have need to be instructed both how to bear their 
 afflictions and how to reap benefit by them, have need of the word, in 
 concurrence with the rod, to bring them to repentance; therefore it is 
 well for those that are sick if they have these messengers of the Lord 
 of hosts with them, these interpreters, to <I>show unto them God's 
 uprightness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:23">Job xxxiii. 23</A>.

 When the leper was shut out, and could not go to the priests, it was
 well that the priests might come to him.  <I>Is any sick? Let him send 
 for the elders,</I> the ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:14">Jam. v. 14</A>.

 If we apply it to the spiritual leprosy of sin, it intimates that when
 we withdraw from those who walk disorderly, that they may be ashamed, 
 we must not count them as enemies, but admonish them as brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:15">2 Thess. iii. 15</A>.

 And also that when God by his grace has brought those to repentance who
 were shut out of communion for scandal, they ought with tenderness, and 
 joy, and sincere affection, to be received in again. Thus Paul orders 
 concerning the excommunicated Corinthian that when he had given 
 evidences of his repentance they should forgive him, and comfort him, 
 and <I>confirm their love towards him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:7,8">2 Cor. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 And ministers are entrusted by our Master with the declarative power of
 loosing as well as binding: both must be done with great caution and 
 deliberation, impartially and without respect of persons, with earnest 
 prayer to God for directions, and a sincere regard to the edification 
 of the body of Christ, due care being always taken that sinners may not 
 be encouraged by an excess of lenity, nor penitents discouraged by an 
 excess of severity. Wisdom and sincerity are profitable to direct in 
 this case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. If it was found that the leprosy was healed, the priest must 
 declare it with a particular solemnity. The leper or his friends were 
 to get ready two birds caught for this purpose (any sort of wild birds 
 that were clean), and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop; for all 
 these were to be used in the ceremony. 

 1. A preparation was to be made of blood and water, with which the
 leper must be sprinkled. One of the birds (and the Jews say, if there 
 was any difference, it must be the larger and better of the two) was to 
 be killed over an earthen cup of spring water, so that the blood of the 
 bird might discolour the water.  This (as some other types) had its 
 accomplishment in the death of Christ, when out of his pierced side 
 there came water and blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:34">John xix. 34</A>.

 Thus Christ comes into the soul for its cure and cleansing, <I>not by
 water only, but by water and blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6">1 John v. 6</A>.

 2. The living bird, with a little scarlet wool, and a bunch of hyssop, 
 must be fastened to a cedar stick, dipped in the water and blood, which 
 must be so sprinkled upon him that was to be cleansed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The cedar-wood signified the restoring of the leper to his strength and 
 soundness, for that is a sort of wood not apt to putrefy. The scarlet 
 wool signified his recovering a florid colour again, for the leprosy 
 made him white as snow. And the hyssop intimated the removing of the 
 disagreeable scent which commonly attended the leprosy. The cedar the 
 stateliest plant, and hyssop the meanest, are here used together in 
 this service (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:33">1 Kings iv. 33</A>);

 for those of the lowest rank in the church may be of use in their
 place, as well as those that are most eminent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:2">1 Cor. xii. 2</A>.

 Some make the slain bird to typify Christ <I>dying for our sins,</I>
 and the living bird Christ <I>rising again for our justification.</I> 
 The dipping of the living bird in the blood of the slain bird intimated 
 that the merit of Christ's death was that which made his resurrection 
 effectual for our justification. He took his blood with him into the 
 holy place, and there appeared a lamb as it had been slain. The cedar, 
 scarlet wool, and hyssop, must all be dipped in the blood; for the word 
 and ordinances, and all the operations of the Spirit, receive their 
 efficacy for our cleansing from the blood of Christ. The leper must be 
 sprinkled <I>seven times,</I> to signify a complete purification, in 
 allusion to which David prays, <I>Wash me thoroughly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:2">Ps. li. 2</A>.

 Naaman was directed to wash <I>seven times,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:10">2 Kings v. 10</A>.

 3. The living bird was then to be let loose in the open field, to
 signify that the leper, being cleansed, was now no longer under 
 restraint and confinement, but might take his liberty to go where he 
 pleased. But this being signified by the flight of a bird towards 
 heaven was an intimation to him henceforward to seek the things that 
 are above, and not to spend this new life to which God had restored him 
 merely in the pursuit of earthly things. This typified that glorious 
 liberty of the children of God to which those are advanced who through 
 grace are sprinkled from an evil conscience. Those whose souls before 
 <I>bowed down to the dust</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:25">Ps. xliv. 25</A>),

 in grief and fear, now fly in the open firmament of heaven, and soar
 upwards upon the wings of faith and hope, and holy love and joy.

 4. The priest must, upon this, pronounce him clean. It was requisite
 that this should be done with solemnity, that the leper might himself 
 be the more affected with the mercy of God to him in his recovery, and 
 that others might be satisfied to converse with him. Christ is our 
 priest, to whom the Father has committed all judgment, and particularly 
 the judgment of the leprosy.  By his definitive sentence impenitent 
 sinners will have their everlasting portion assigned them with the 
 unclean 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:14">Job xxxvi. 14</A>),

 out of the holy city; and all that by his grace are cured and cleansed
 shall be received into the camp of the saints, into which no unclean 
 thing shall enter. Those are clean indeed whom Christ pronounces so, 
 and they need not regard what men say of them. But, though Christ was 
 the <I>end of this law for righteousness,</I> yet being in the days of 
 his flesh <I>made under the law,</I> which as yet stood unrepealed, he 
 ordered those lepers whom he had cured miraculously to go and <I>show 
 themselves to the priest,</I> and <I>offer for their cleansing 
 according to the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:4,Lu+17:14">Matt. viii. 4; Luke xvii. 14</A>.

 The type must be kept up till it was answered by its antitype.

 5. When the leper was pronounced clean, he must wash his body and his
 clothes, and shave <I>off all his hair</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 must still tarry seven days out of the camp, and on the seventh day 
 must do it again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The priest having pronounced him clean from the disease, he must make 
 himself as clean as ever he could from all the remains of it, and from 
 all other defilements, and he must take time to do this. Thus those who 
 have the comfort of the remission of their sins, by the sprinkling of 
 the blood of Christ upon their consciences, must with the utmost care 
 and caution <I>cleanse themselves from all filthiness both of flesh and 
 spirit,</I> and thoroughly <I>purge themselves from their old sins;</I> 
 for <I>every one that hath this hope in him will</I> be concerned to 
 <I>purify himself.</I></P>

 offering:

 &nbsp; 19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
 atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
 and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:
 &nbsp; 20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
 offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement
 for him, and he shall be clean.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 I. To complete the purification of the leper, on the eighth day, after 
 the former solemnity performed without the camp, and, as it should 
 seem, before he returned to his own habitation, he was to attend <I>at 
 the door of the tabernacle,</I> and was there to be <I>presented to the 
 Lord,</I> with his offering,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Observe here, 

 1. That the mercies of God oblige us to present ourselves to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>.

 2.  When God has restored us to the liberty of ordinances again, after
 restraint by sickness, distance, or otherwise, we should take the first 
 opportunity of testifying our respect to God, and our affection to his 
 sanctuary, by a diligent improvement of the liberty we are restored to.  
 When Christ had healed the impotent man, he soon after <I>found him in 
 the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>.

 When Hezekiah asks, <I>What is the sign that I shall go up to the house
 of the Lord?</I> he means, "What is the sign that I shall recover?" 
 intimating that if God restored him his health, so that he should be 
 able to go abroad, the house of the Lord should be the first place he 
 would go to.

 3. When we present ourselves before the Lord we must present our
 offerings, devoting to God with ourselves all we have and can do. 

 4.  Both we and our offerings must be presented before the Lord by the
 priest that made us clean, even our Lord Jesus, else neither we nor 
 they can be accepted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Three lambs the cleansed leper was to bring, with a meat-offering, 
 and a log of oil, which was about half a pint. Now, 

 1. Most of the ceremony peculiar to this case was about the
 trespass-offering, the lamb for which was offered first,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 And, besides the usual rites with which the trespass-offering was 
 offered, some of the blood was to be put upon the ear, and thumb, and 
 great toe, of the leper that was to be cleansed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 the very same ceremony that was used in the consecration of the 
 priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:23,24"><I>ch.</I> viii. 23, 24</A>.

 It was a mortification to them to see the same purification necessary
 for them that was for a leper. The Jews say that the leper stood 
 without the gate of the tabernacle and the priest within, and thus the 
 ceremony was performed through the gate, signifying that now he was 
 admitted with other Israelites to attend in the courts of the Lord's 
 house again, and was as welcome as ever; though he had been a leper, 
 and though perhaps the name might stick by him as long as he lived (as 
 we read of one who probably was cleansed by our Lord Jesus, who yet 
 afterwards is called <I>Simon the leper,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:6">Matt. xxvi. 6</A>),

 yet he was as freely admitted as ever to communion with God and man.
 After the blood of the offering had been put with the priest's finger 
 upon the extremities of the body, to include the whole, some of the oil 
 that he brought, which was first waved and then sprinkled before the 
 Lord, was in like manner put in the same places upon the blood. "The 
 blood" (says the learned bishop Patrick) "seems to have been a token of 
 forgiveness, the oil of healing," for God first <I>forgiveth our 
 iniquities</I> and then <I>healeth our diseases,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:3">Ps. ciii. 3</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17">Isa. xxxviii. 17</A>.

 Wherever the blood of Christ is applied for justification the oil of
 the Spirit is applied for sanctification; for these two are inseparable 
 and both necessary to our acceptance with God. Nor shall our former 
 leprosy, if it be healed by repentance, be any bar to these glorious 
 privileges.  Cleansed lepers are as welcome to the blood and the oil as 
 consecrated priests. <I>Such were some of you, but you are washed.</I> 
 When the leper was sprinkled the water must have blood in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 when he was anointed the oil must have blood under it, to signify that 
 all the graces and comforts of the Spirit, all his purifying dignifying 
 influences, are owing to the death of Christ: it is by his blood alone 
 that we are sanctified. 

 2. Besides this there must be a sin-offering and a burnt-offering, a
 lamb for each,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 By each of these offerings, it is said, the priests shall <I>make 
 atonement for him.</I> 

 (1.) His moral guilt shall be removed; the sin for which the leprosy
 was sent shall be pardoned, and all the sins he had been guilty of in 
 his afflicted state. Note, The removal of any outward trouble is then 
 doubly comfortable to us when at the same time God gives us some 
 assurance of the forgiveness of our sins. If we <I>receive the 
 atonement,</I> we have reason to rejoice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>.

 (2.) His ceremonial pollution shall be removed, which had kept him from
 the participation of the holy things. And this is called <I>making an 
 atonement for him,</I> because our restoration to the privileges of 
 God's children, typified hereby, is owing purely to the great 
 propitiation. When the atonement is made for him he shall be clean, 
 both to his own satisfaction and to his reputation among his 
 neighbours; he shall retrieve both his credit and his comfort, and both 
 these true penitents become entitled to, both ease and honour, by their 
 interest in the atonement. The burnt-offering, besides the atonement 
 that was made by it, was a thankful acknowledgment of God's mercy to 
 him: and the more immediate the hand of God was both in the sickness 
 and in the cure the more reason he had thus to give glory to him, and 
 thus, as our Saviour speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:44">Mark i. 44</A>),

 to <I>offer for his cleansing</I> all <I>those things which Moses
 commanded for a testimony unto them.</I></P>

 his cleansing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the gracious provision which the law made for the 
 cleansing of <I>poor lepers.</I> If they were not able to bring three 
 lambs, and three tenth-deals of flour, they must bring one lamb, and 
 one tenth-deal of flour, and, instead of the other two lambs, two 
 turtle-doves or two young pigeons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Here see, 

 1. That the poverty of the person concerned would not excuse him if he 
 brought no offering at all. Let none think that because they are poor 
 God requires no service from them, since he has considered them, and 
 demands that which it is in the power of the poorest to give.  "<I>My 
 son, give me thy heart,</I> and with that the <I>calves of thy lips</I> 
 shall be accepted instead of the <I>calves of the stall.</I>" 

 2. That God expected from those who were poor only according to their
 ability; <I>his commandments are not grievous,</I> nor does he make us 
 to <I>serve with an offering.</I> The poor are as welcome to God's 
 altar as the rich; and, if there be first a willing mind and an honest 
 heart, two pigeons, when they are the utmost a man is able to get, are 
 as acceptable to God as two lambs; for he requires <I>according to what 
 a man has and not according to what he has not.</I> But it is 
 observable that though a meaner sacrifice was accepted from the poor, 
 yet the very same ceremony was used for them as was for the rich; for 
 their souls are as precious and Christ and his gospel are the same to 
 both. Let not us therefore have <I>the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ 
 with respect of persons,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
 for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of
 the land of your possession;
 &nbsp; 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
 saying, It seemeth to me <I>there is</I> as it were a plague in the
 house:
 &nbsp; 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
 before the priest go <I>into it</I> to see the plague, that all that
 <I>is</I> in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
 shall go in to see the house:
 &nbsp; 37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, <I>if</I> the
 plague <I>be</I> in the walls of the house with hollow strakes,
 greenish or reddish, which in sight <I>are</I> lower than the wall;
 &nbsp; 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
 house, and shut up the house seven days:
 &nbsp; 39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
 look: and, behold, <I>if</I> the plague be spread in the walls of the
 house;
 &nbsp; 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
 in which the plague <I>is,</I> and they shall cast them into an
 unclean place without the city:
 &nbsp; 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round
 about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off
 without the city into an unclean place:
 &nbsp; 42 And they shall take other stones, and put <I>them</I> in the
 place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall
 plaster the house.
 &nbsp; 43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
 after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
 scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
 &nbsp; 44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, <I>if</I> the
 plague be spread in the house, it <I>is</I> a fretting leprosy in the
 house: it <I>is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
 timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall
 carry <I>them</I> forth out of the city into an unclean place.
 &nbsp; 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it
 is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
 &nbsp; 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and
 he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
 &nbsp; 48 And if the priest shall come in, and look <I>upon it,</I> and,
 behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house
 was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
 because the plague is healed.
 &nbsp; 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
 wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
 &nbsp; 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
 over running water:
 &nbsp; 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
 scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
 slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
 seven times:
 &nbsp; 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird,
 and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with
 the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
 &nbsp; 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
 open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be
 clean.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the law concerning the leprosy in a house. Now that they were 
 in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, and had no houses, and therefore 
 the law is made only an appendix to the former laws concerning the 
 leprosy, because it related, not to their present state, but to their 
 future settlement. The leprosy in a house is as unaccountable as the 
 leprosy in a garment; but, if we see not what natural causes of it can 
 be assigned, we may resolve it into the power of the God of nature, who 
 here says, <I>I put the leprosy in a house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 as his curse is said to <I>enter into a house,</I> and <I>consume it 
 with the timber and stones thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4">Zech. v. 4</A>.

 Now,

 1. It is supposed that even in Canaan itself, the land of promise,
 their houses might be infected with a leprosy. Though it was a holy 
 land, this would not secure them from this plague, while the 
 inhabitants were many of them so unholy. Thus a place and a name in the 
 visible church will not secure wicked people from God's judgments. 

 2.  It is likewise taken for granted that the owner of the house will
 make the priest acquainted with it, as soon as he sees the least cause 
 to suspect the leprosy in his house: <I>It seemeth to me there is as it 
 were a plague in the house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Sin, where that reigns in a house, is a plague there, as it is in a 
 heart. And masters of families should be aware and afraid of the first 
 appearance of gross sin in their families, and put away the iniquity, 
 whatever it is, far from their tabernacles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:23">Job xxii. 23</A>.

 They should be jealous with a godly jealousy concerning those under
 their charge, lest they be drawn into sin, and take early advice, if it 
 but seem that there is a plague in the house, lest the contagion 
 spread, and many be by it defiled and destroyed.

 3. If the priest, upon search, found that the leprosy had got into the
 house, he must try to cure it, by taking out that part of the building
 that was infected,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>.

 This was like cutting off a gangrened limb, for the preservation of the 
 rest of the body.  Corruption should be purged out in time, before it 
 spread; for <I>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. If thy right 
 hand offend thee, cut it off.</I> 

 4. If yet it remained in the house, the whole house must be pulled
 down, and all the materials carried to the dunghill,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>.

 The owner had better be without a dwelling than live in one that was 
 infected. Note, The leprosy of sin, if it be obstinate under the 
 methods of cure, will at last be the ruin of families and churches. If 
 Babylon will not be healed, she shall be forsaken and abandoned, and 
 (according to the law respecting the leprous house), they shall not 
 <I>take of her a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9,26">Jer. li. 9, 26</A>.

 The remainders of sin and corruption in our mortal bodies are like this
 leprosy in the house; after all our pains in scraping and plastering, 
 we shall never be quite clear of it, till the earthly house of this 
 tabernacle be dissolved and taken down; when we are dead we shall be 
 free from sin, and not till then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:7">Rom. vi. 7</A>.

 5. If the taking out the infected stones cured the house, and the
 leprosy did not spread any further, then the house must be cleansed; 
 not only aired, that it might be healthful, but purified from the 
 ceremonial pollution, that it might be fit to be the habitation of an 
 Israelite.  The ceremony of its cleansing was much the same with that 
 of cleansing a leprous person,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>,

 &c. This intimated that the house was smitten for the man's sake (as 
 bishop Patrick expresses it), and he was to look upon himself as 
 preserved by divine mercy. The houses of Israelites are said to be 
 <I>dedicated</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5">Deut. xx. 5</A>),

 for they were a holy nation, and therefore they ought to keep their
 houses pure from all ceremonial pollutions, that they might be fit for 
 the service of that God to whom they were devoted. And the same care 
 should we take to reform whatever is amiss in our families, that we and 
 our houses may serve the Lord; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:2">Gen. xxxv. 2</A>.

 Some have thought the leprosy in the house was typical of the idolatry
 of the Jewish church, which did strangely cleave to it; for, though 
 some of the reforming kings took away the infected stones, yet still it 
 broke out again, till by the captivity of Babylon God took down the 
 house, and carried it to an unclean land; and this proved an effectual 
 cure of their inclination to idols and idolatrous worships.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>54 This <I>is</I> the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
 scall,
 &nbsp; 55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
 &nbsp; 56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:
 &nbsp; 57 To teach when <I>it is</I> unclean, and when <I>it is</I> clean: this
 <I>is</I> the law of leprosy.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the conclusion of this law concerning the leprosy. There is no 
 repetition of it in Deuteronomy, only a general memorandum given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:8">Deut. xxiv. 8</A>),

 <I>Take heed in the plague of leprosy.</I> We may see in this law,

 1. The gracious care God took of his people Israel, for to them only
 this law pertained, and not to the Gentiles. When Naaman the Syrian was 
 cured of his leprosy he was not bidden to show himself to the priest, 
 though he was cured in Jordan, as the Jews that were cured by our 
 Saviour were.  Thus those who are entrusted with the key of discipline 
 in the church judge those only <I>that are within;</I> but <I>those 
 that are without God judgeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:12,13">1 Cor. v. 12, 13</A>.

 2. The religious care we ought to take of ourselves, to keep our minds
 from the dominion of all sinful affections and dispositions, which are 
 both their disease and their defilement, that we may be fit for the 
 service of God. We ought also to avoid all bad company, and, as much as 
 may be, to avoid coming within the danger of being infected by it. 
 <I>Touch not the unclean thing, saith the Lord, and I will receive 
 you,</I>
