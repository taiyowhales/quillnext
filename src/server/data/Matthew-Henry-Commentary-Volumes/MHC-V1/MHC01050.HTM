 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Joseph fell upon his father's 
 face, and wept upon him, and 
 kissed him.
 &nbsp; 2 And Joseph commanded 
 his servants the physicians to 
 embalm his father: and the physicians 
 embalmed Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 And forty 
 days were fulfilled for him; for so 
 are fulfilled the days of those which 
 are embalmed: and the Egyptians 
 mourned for him threescore and ten 
 days.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the days of his 
 mourning were past, Joseph spake
 unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, 
 If now I have found grace in your eyes, 
 speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, 
 saying,
 &nbsp; 5 My father made me 
 swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave 
 which I have digged for me in the 
 land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury
 me. Now therefore let me go up, I 
 pray thee, and bury my father, and I 
 will come again.
 &nbsp; 6 And Pharaoh said, 
 Go up, and bury thy father, according 
 as he made thee swear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Joseph is here paying his last respects to 
 his deceased father. 
 
 1. With tears and 
 kisses, and all the tender expressions of a 
 filial affection, he takes leave of the deserted 
 body,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Though Jacob was old and decrepit, 
 and must needs die in the course of 
 nature--though he was poor comparatively, 
 and a constant charge to his son Joseph, 
 yet such an affection he had for a loving father, 
 and so sensible was he of the loss of a prudent, 
 pious, praying father, that he could not 
 part with him without floods of tears. Note, 
 As it is an honour to die lamented, so it is 
 the duty of survivors to lament the death of 
 those who have been useful in their day, 
 though for some time they may have survived 
 their usefulness. The departed soul is out 
 of the reach of our tears and kisses, but with 
 them it is proper to show our respect to the 
 poor body, of which we look for a glorious 
 and joyful resurrection. Thus Joseph showed 
 his faith in God, and love to his father, by 
 kissing his pale and cold lips, and so giving 
 an affectionate farewell. Probably the rest 
 of Jacob's sons did the same, much moved, 
 no doubt, with his dying words. 
 
 2. He 
 ordered the body to be embalmed
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 not only because he died in Egypt, and that was 
 the manner of the Egyptians, but because he 
 was to be carried to Canaan, which would be 
 a work of time, and therefore it was necessary 
 the body should be preserved as well as 
 it might be from putrefaction. See how vile 
 our bodies are, when the soul has forsaken 
 them; without a great deal of art, and pains, 
 and care, they will, in a very little time, become 
 noisome. If the body have been dead 
 four days, by that time it is offensive. 
 
 3. He 
 observed the ceremony of solemn mourning 
 for him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Forty days were taken up in 
 embalming the body, which the Egyptians 
 (they say) had an art of doing so curiously 
 as to preserve the very features of the face 
 unchanged; all this time, and thirty days 
 more, seventy in all, they either confined 
 themselves and sat solitary, or, when they 
 went out, appeared in the habit of close 
 mourners, according to the decent custom 
 of the country. Even the Egyptians, many of 
 them, out of the great respect they had for 
 Joseph (whose good offices done for the king 
 and country were now fresh in remembrance), 
 put themselves into mourning for his father: 
 as with us, when the court goes into mourning, 
 those of the best quality do so too. 
 About ten weeks was the court of Egypt in 
 mourning for Jacob. Note, What they did 
 in state, we should do in sincerity, <I>weep with 
 those that weep,</I> and mourn with those that 
 mourn, as being ourselves also in the body. 
 
 4. He asked and obtained leave of Pharaoh 
 to go to Canaan, thither to attend the funeral 
 of his father,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.
 
 (1.) It was a piece of 
 necessary respect to Pharaoh that he would not 
 go without leave; for we may suppose 
 that, though his charge about the corn was 
 long since over, yet he continued a prime-minister 
 of state, and therefore would not be 
 so long absent from his business without licence. 
 
 (2.) He observed a decorum, in employing 
 some of the royal family, or some of 
 the officers of the household, to intercede for 
 this licence, either because it was not proper 
 for him in the days of his mourning to come 
 into the presence-chamber, or because he 
 would not presume too much upon his own 
 interest. Note, Modesty is a great ornament 
 to dignity. 
 
 (3.) He pleaded the obligation 
 his father had laid upon him, by an oath, to 
 bury him in Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 It was not from 
 pride or humour, but from his regard to an 
 indispensable duty, that he desired it. All 
 nations reckon that oaths must be performed, 
 and the will of the dead must be observed. 
 
 (4.) He promised to return: <I>I will come 
 again.</I> When we return to our own houses 
 from burying the bodies of our relations, we 
 say, "We have left them behind;" but, if 
 their souls have gone to our heavenly Father's 
 house, we may say with more reason, "They 
 have left us behind." 
 
 (5.) He obtained leave
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 <I>Go and bury thy father.</I> Pharaoh was 
 willing his business should stand still so long; 
 but the service of Christ is more needful, 
 and therefore he would not allow one that 
 had work to do for him to go first and bury 
 his father; no, <I>Let the dead bury their dead,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:22">Matt. viii. 22</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And Joseph went up to bury his 
 father: and with him went up all the 
 servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his 
 house, and all the elders of the land 
 of Egypt,
 &nbsp; 8 And all the house of 
 Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's 
 house: only their little ones, 
 and their flocks, and their herds, they 
 left in the land of Goshen.
 &nbsp; 9 And 
 there went up with him both chariots 
 and horsemen: and it was a very great 
 company.
 &nbsp; 10 And they came to the 
 threshingfloor of Atad, which <I>is</I>
 beyond Jordan, and there they mourned 
 with a great and very sore lamentation: 
 and he made a mourning for his 
 father seven days.
 &nbsp; 11 And when the 
 inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, 
 saw the mourning in the floor of 
 Atad, they said, This <I>is</I> a grievous 
 mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore 
 the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, 
 which <I>is</I> beyond Jordan.
 &nbsp; 12 And his sons did unto him according 
 as he commanded them:
 &nbsp; 13 For his 
 sons carried him into the land of Canaan, 
 and buried him in the cave of 
 the field of Machpelah, which Abraham 
 bought with the field for a possession 
 of a buryingplace of Ephron 
 the Hittite, before Mamre.
 &nbsp; 14 And 
 Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and 
 his brethren, and all that went up with 
 him to bury his father, after he had 
 buried his father.

 We have here an account of Jacob's funeral. 
 Of the funerals of the kings of Judah, 
 usually, no more is said than this, <I>They 
 were buried with their fathers in the city of 
 David:</I> but the funeral of the patriarch Jacob 
 is more largely and fully described, to 
 show how much better God was to him 
 than he expected (he had spoken more than 
 once of dying for grief, and going to the 
 grave bereaved of his children, but, behold, 
 he dies in honour, and is followed to the 
 grave by all his children), and also because his
 orders concerning his burial were given and 
 observed in faith, and in expectation both of 
 the earthly and of the heavenly Canaan. 
 Now, 
 
 1. It was a stately funeral. He was 
 attended to the grave, not only by his own 
 family, but by the courtiers, and all the great 
 men of the kingdom, who, in token of their 
 gratitude to Joseph, showed this respect to 
 his father for his sake, and did him honour 
 at his death. Though the Egyptians had 
 had an antipathy to the Hebrews, and had 
 looked upon them with disdain
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32"><I>ch.</I> xliii. 32</A>),
 yet now, that they were better acquainted 
 with them, they began to have a respect for 
 them. Good old Jacob had conducted himself 
 so well among them as to gain universal 
 esteem. Note, Professors of religion should 
 endeavour, by wisdom and love, to remove 
 the prejudices which many may have conceived 
 against them because they do not 
 know them. There went abundance of chariots 
 and horsemen, not only to attend them 
 a little way, but to go through with them. 
 Note, The decent solemnities of funerals, 
 according to a man's situation, are very commendable; 
 and we must not say of them, <I>To 
 what purpose is this waste?</I> See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:2,Lu+7:12">Acts viii. 2; Luke vii. 12</A>.
 
 2. It was a sorrowful funeral
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>);
 standers-by took notice of it as 
 a grievous mourning. Note, The death of 
 good men is a great loss to any place, and 
 ought to be greatly lamented. Stephen dies 
 a martyr, and yet devout men make great lamentations 
 for him. The solemn mourning 
 for Jacob gave a name to the place, <I>Abel-Mizraim, 
 the mourning of the Egyptians,</I> 
 which served for a testimony against the next 
 generation of the Egyptians, who oppressed 
 the posterity of this Jacob to whom their 
 ancestors showed such respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And when Joseph's brethren saw 
 that their father was dead, they said, 
 Joseph will peradventure hate us, and 
 will certainly requite us all the evil 
 which we did unto him.
 &nbsp; 16 And they 
 sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, 
 Thy father did command before he 
 died, saying,
 &nbsp; 17 So shall ye say unto 
 Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, 
 the trespass of thy brethren, and their 
 sin; for they did unto thee evil: and 
 now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass 
 of the servants of the God of thy father. 
 And Joseph wept when they 
 spake unto him.
 &nbsp; 18 And his brethren 
 also went and fell down before his 
 face; and they said, Behold, we <I>be</I> 
 thy servants.
 &nbsp; 19 And Joseph said 
 unto them, Fear not: for <I>am</I> I in the 
 place of God?
 &nbsp; 20 But as for you, ye 
 thought evil against me; <I>but</I> God 
 meant it unto good, to bring to pass, 
 as <I>it is</I> this day, to save much people 
 alive.
 &nbsp; 21 Now therefore fear ye not: 
 I will nourish you, and your little 
 ones. And he comforted them, and 
 spake kindly unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the settling of a good correspondence 
 between Joseph and his brethren, 
 now that their father was dead. Joseph 
 was at court, in the royal city; his 
 brethren were in Goshen, remote in the 

 <A NAME="Page268"> </A>

 country; yet the keeping up of a good understanding,
 and a good affection, between 
 them, would be both his honour and their 
 interest. Note, When Providence has removed 
 the parents by death, the best methods 
 ought to be taken, not only for the 
 preventing of quarrels among the children 
 (which often happen about the dividing of 
 the estate), but for the preserving of acquaintance 
 and love, that unity may continue 
 even when that centre of unity is taken 
 away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joseph's brethren humbly make their 
 court to him for his favour. 1. They began 
 to be jealous of Joseph, not that he had 
 given them any cause to be so, but the consciousness 
 of guilt, and of their own inability 
 in such a case to forgive and forget, 
 made them suspicious of the sincerity and 
 constancy of Joseph's favour
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 <I>Joseph 
 will peradventure hate us.</I> While their father 
 lived, they thought themselves safe under 
 his shadow; but now that he was dead they 
 feared the worst from Joseph. Note, A 
 guilty conscience exposes men to continual 
 frights, even where no fear is, and makes 
 them suspicious of every body, as Cain,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:14"><I>ch.</I> iv. 14</A>.
 Those that would be fearless must 
 keep themselves guiltless. If our heart reproach 
 us not, then have we confidence both 
 towards God and man. 
 
 2. They humbled 
 themselves before him, confessed their fault, 
 and begged his pardon. They did it by 
 proxy
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);
 they did it in person,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 Now that the sun and moon had set, the 
 eleven stars did homage to Joseph, for the 
 further accomplishment of his dream. They 
 speak of their former offence with fresh regret: 
 <I>Forgive the trespass.</I> They throw 
 themselves at Joseph's feet, and refer themselves 
 to his mercy: <I>We are thy servants.</I>
 Thus we must bewail the sins we committed 
 long ago, even those which we hope through 
 grace are forgiven; and, when we pray to 
 God for pardon, we must promise to be his 
 servants. 
 
 3. They pleaded their relation to 
 Jacob and to Jacob's God. 
 
 (1.) To Jacob, 
 urging that he directed them to make this 
 submission, rather because he questioned 
 whether they would do their duty in humbling 
 themselves than because he questioned whether 
 Joseph would do his duty in forgiving 
 them; nor could he reasonably expect Joseph's 
 kindness to them unless they thus 
 qualified themselves for it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 <I>Thy father 
 did command.</I> Thus, in humbling ourselves 
 to Christ by faith and repentance, we may
 plead that it is the command of his Father,
 and our Father, that we do so.

 (2.) To
 Jacob's God. They plead
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 <I>We</I> are
 the <I>servants of the God of thy father;</I> not
 only children of the same Jacob, but worshippers
 of the same Jehovah. Note, 
 Though we must be ready to forgive all that 
 are any way injurious to us, yet we must 
 especially take heed of bearing malice towards 
 any that are the servants of the God 
 of our father: such we should always treat 
 with a peculiar tenderness; for we and they 
 have the same Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joseph, with a great deal of compassion, 
 confirms his reconciliation and affection 
 to them; his compassion appears,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 <I>He 
 wept when they spoke to him.</I> These were 
 tears of sorrow for their suspicion of him, 
 and tears of tenderness upon their submission. 
 In his reply, 
 
 1. He directs them to 
 look up to God in their repentance
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 <I>Am I in the place of God?</I> He, in his great 
 humility, thought they showed him too 
 much respect, as if all their happiness were 
 bound up in his favour, and said to them, 
 in effect, as Peter to Cornelius, "<I>Stand up, 
 I myself also am a man.</I> Make your peace 
 with God, and then you will find it an easy 
 matter to make your peace with me." Note, 
 When we ask forgiveness of those whom we 
 have offended we must take heed of putting 
 them in the place of God, by dreading their 
 wrath and soliciting their favour more than 
 God's. "Am I in the place of God, to whom 
 alone vengeance belongs? No, I will leave 
 you to his mercy." Those that avenge 
 themselves step into the place of God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19">Rom. xii. 19</A>.
 
 2. He extenuates their fault, from 
 the consideration of the great good which 
 God wonderfully brought out of it, which, 
 though it should not make them the less 
 sorry for their sin, yet might make him the 
 more willing to forgive it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 <I>You 
 thought evil</I> (to disappoint the dreams), <I>but 
 God meant it unto good,</I> in order to the fulfilling 
 of the dreams, and the making of 
 Joseph a greater blessing to his family than 
 otherwise he could have been. Note, When 
 God makes use of men's agency for the 
 performance of his counsels, it is common 
 for him to mean one thing and them another, 
 even the quite contrary, but God's 
 counsel shall stand. See
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.
 Again, 
 God often brings good out of evil, and promotes 
 the designs of his providence even by 
 the sins of men; not that he is the author of 
 sin, far be it from us to think so; but his 
 infinite wisdom so overrules events, and 
 directs the chain of them, that, in the issue, 
 that ends in his praise which in its own nature 
 had a direct tendency to his dishonour; 
 as the putting of Christ to death,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.
 This does not make sin the less sinful, nor 
 sinners the less punishable, but it redounds 
 greatly to the glory of God's wisdom. 
 
 3. He assures them of the continuance of his 
 kindness to them: <I>Fear not; I will nourish 
 you,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 See what an excellent spirit 
 Joseph was of, and learn of him to render 
 good for evil. He did not tell them they 
 were upon their good behaviour, and he 
 would be kind to them if he saw they conducted 
 themselves well; no, he would not 
 thus hold them in suspense, nor seem jealous 
 of them, though they had been suspicious of 
 him: <I>He comforted them,</I> and, to banish 
 all their fears, <I>he spoke kindly to them.</I> Note, 

 <A NAME="Page269"> </A>
 
 Broken spirits must be bound up and encouraged. 
 Those we love and forgive we 
 must not only do well for but speak 
 kindly to.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, 
 and his father's house: and Joseph 
 lived an hundred and ten years.
 &nbsp; 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children 
 of the third <I>generation:</I> the children 
 also of Machir the son of Manasseh 
 were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
 &nbsp; 24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, 
 I die: and God will surely visit you, 
 and bring you out of this land unto 
 the land which he sware to Abraham, 
 to Isaac, and to Jacob.
 &nbsp; 25 And Joseph 
 took an oath of the children of 
 Israel, saying, God will surely visit 
 you, and ye shall carry up my bones 
 from hence.
 &nbsp; 26 So Joseph died, <I>being</I> 
 an hundred and ten years old: and
 they embalmed him, and he was put 
 in a coffin in Egypt.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The prolonging of Joseph's 
 life in Egypt: he lived to be <I>a hundred and 
 ten years old,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 Having honoured his 
 father, his days were long in the land which, 
 for the present, God had given him; and it 
 was a great mercy to his relations that God 
 continued him so long, a support and comfort 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The building up of Joseph's family: 
 he lived to see his great-grand-children by 
 both his sons
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 and probably he saw 
 his two sons solemnly owned as heads of 
 distinct tribes, equal to any of his brethren. 
 It contributes much to the comfort of aged 
 parents if they see their posterity in a flourishing 
 condition, especially if with it they 
 see peace upon Israel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:6">Ps. cxxviii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The last will and testament of Joseph 
 published in the presence of his brethren, 
 when he saw his death approaching. Those 
 that were properly his brethren perhaps 
 were some of them dead before him, as 
 several of them were older than he; but to 
 those of them who yet survived, and to the 
 sons of those who were gone, who stood up 
 in their fathers' stead, he said this. 
 
 1. He 
 comforted them with the assurance of their 
 return to Canaan in due time: <I>I die, but 
 God will surely visit you,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 To this 
 purport Jacob had spoken to him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:21"><I>ch.</I> xlviii. 21</A>.
 Thus must we comfort others with the 
 same comforts with which we ourselves have 
 been comforted of God, and encourage them 
 to rest on those promises which have been 
 our support. Joseph was, under God, both 
 the protector and the benefactor of his brethren; 
 and what would become of them now 
 that he was dying? Why, let this be their 
 comfort, <I>God will surely visit you.</I> Note, 
 God's gracious visits will serve to make up 
 the loss of our best friends. They die; but 
 we may live, and live comfortably, if we 
 have the favour and presence of God with 
 us. He bids them be confident: <I>God will 
 bring you out of this land,</I> and therefore, 
 
 (1.) They must not hope to settle there, nor look 
 upon it as their rest for ever; they must set 
 their hearts upon the land of promise, and 
 call that their home. 
 
 (2.) They must not 
 fear sinking, and being ruined there; probably 
 he foresaw the ill usage they would 
 meet with there after his death, and therefore 
 gives them this word of encouragement: 
 "<I>God will bring you</I> in triumph <I>out of this 
 land</I> at last." Herein he has an eye to the 
 promise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:13,14"><I>ch.</I> xv. 13, 14</A>,
 and, in God's name, 
 assures them of the performance of it. 
 
 2. For a confession of his own faith, and a 
 confirmation of theirs, he charges them to keep 
 him unburied till that day, that glorious day, 
 should come, when they should be settled in 
 the land of promise,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 He makes them 
 promise him with an oath that they would 
 bury him in Canaan. In Egypt they buried 
 their great men very honourably and with 
 abundance of pomp; but Joseph prefers a 
 significant burial in Canaan, and that deferred 
 too almost 200 years, before a magnificent 
 one in Egypt. Thus Joseph, by faith 
 in the doctrine of the resurrection and the 
 promise of Canaan, gave <I>commandment concerning 
 his bones,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:22">Heb. xi. 22</A>.
 He dies in 
 Egypt; but lays his bones at stake that God 
 will surely visit Israel, and bring them to 
 Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The death of Joseph, and the reservation 
 of his body for a burial in Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 He was <I>put in a coffin in Egypt,</I> but 
 not buried till his children had received their 
 inheritance in Canaan,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32">Josh. xxiv. 32</A>.
 Note, 
 
 1. If the separate soul, at death, do but return 
 to its rest with God, the matter is not 
 great though the deserted body find not at 
 all, or not quickly, its rest in the grave. 
 
 2. Yet care ought to be taken of the dead bodies 
 of the saints, in the belief of their resurrection;
 for there is a covenant with the dust, 
 which shall be remembered, and a commandment 
 is given concerning the bones.</P>
