 The next ceremonial uncleanness is that of the leprosy, concerning
 which the law was very large and particular; we have the discovery of
 it in this chapter, and the cleansing of the leper in the next.
 Scarcely any one thing in all the levitical law takes up so much room
 as this. 

 I. Rules are here given by which the priest must judge whether the man 
 had the leprosy or no, according as the symptom was that appeared.

 1. If it was a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>.

 2. If it was a bile, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.

 3. If it was in inflammation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:24-28">ver.  24-28</A>. 

 4. If it was in the head or beard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:29-37">ver. 29-37</A>.

 5. If it was a bright spot,

 6.  If it was in a bald head,

 II.  Direction is given how the leper must be disposed of,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
 scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <I>like</I>
 the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
 priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
 &nbsp; 3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
 flesh: and <I>when</I> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the
 plague in sight <I>be</I> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <I>is</I> a
 plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
 pronounce him unclean.
 &nbsp; 4 If the bright spot <I>be</I> white in the skin of his flesh, and
 in sight <I>be</I> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be
 not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <I>him that hath</I>
 the plague seven days:
 &nbsp; 5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,
 behold, <I>if</I> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <I>and</I> the
 plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up
 seven days more:
 &nbsp; 6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
 behold, <I>if</I> the plague <I>be</I> somewhat dark, <I>and</I> the plague
 spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it
 <I>is but</I> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
 &nbsp; 7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
 hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen
 of the priest again:
 &nbsp; 8 And <I>if</I> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in
 the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <I>is</I> a
 leprosy.
 &nbsp; 9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
 brought unto the priest;
 &nbsp; 10 And the priest shall see <I>him</I>: and, behold, <I>if</I> the rising
 <I>be</I> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
 <I>there be</I> quick raw flesh in the rising;
 &nbsp; 11 It <I>is</I> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the
 priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up:
 for he <I>is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the
 leprosy cover all the skin of <I>him that hath</I> the plague from his
 head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;
 &nbsp; 13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, <I>if</I> the
 leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce <I>him</I>
 clean <I>that hath</I> the plague: it is all turned white: he <I>is</I>
 clean.
 &nbsp; 14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
 &nbsp; 15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
 be unclean: <I>for</I> the raw flesh <I>is</I> unclean: it <I>is</I> a leprosy.
 &nbsp; 16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white,
 he shall come unto the priest;
 &nbsp; 17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <I>if</I> the plague
 be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <I>him</I> clean
 <I>that hath</I> the plague: he <I>is</I> clean.

 I. Concerning the plague of leprosy we may observe in general, 

 1. That it was rather an uncleanness than a disease; or, at least, so
 the law considered it, and therefore employed not the physicians but 
 the priests about it. Christ is said to cleanse lepers, not to cure 
 them.  We do not read of any that died of the leprosy, but it rather 
 buried them alive, by rendering them unfit for conversation with any 
 but such as were infected like themselves. Yet there is a tradition 
 that Pharaoh, who sought to kill Moses, was the first that ever was 
 struck with this disease, and that he died of it. It is said to have 
 begun first in Egypt, whence it spread into Syria. It was very well 
 known to Moses, when he put his own hand into his bosom and took it out 
 leprous.  

 2. That it was a plague inflicted immediately by the hand of God, and 
 came not from natural causes, as other diseases; and therefore must be 
 managed according to a divine law. Miriam's leprosy, and Gehazi's, and 
 king Uzziah's, were all the punishments of particular sins: and, if 
 generally it was so, no marvel there was so much care taken to 
 distinguish it from a common distemper, that none might be looked upon 
 as lying under this extraordinary token of divine displeasure but those 
 that really were so. 

 3.  That it is a plague not now known in the world; what is commonly
 called the leprosy is of a quite different nature. This seems to have 
 been reserved as a particular scourge for the sinners of those times 
 and places. The Jews retained the idolatrous customs they had learnt in 
 Egypt, and therefore God justly caused this with some others of the 
 diseases of Egypt to follow them. Yet we read of Naaman the Syrian, who 
 was a leper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:1">2 Kings v. 1</A>.

 4. That there were other breakings-out in the body which did very much
 resemble the leprosy, but were not it, which might make a man sore and 
 loathsome and yet not ceremonially unclean. Justly are our bodies 
 called vile bodies, which have in them the seeds of so many diseases, 
 by which the lives of so many are made bitter to them. 

 5.  That the judgment of it was referred to the priests. Lepers were
 looked upon as stigmatized by the justice of God, and therefore it was 
 left to his servants the priests, who might be presumed to know his 
 mark best, to pronounce who were lepers and who were not. All the Jews 
 say, "Any priest, though disabled by a blemish to attend the sanctuary, 
 might be a judge of the leprosy, provided the blemish were not in his 
 eye. And he might" (they say) "take a common person to assist him in 
 the search, but the priest only must pronounce the judgment." 

 6. That it was a figure of the moral pollution of men's minds by sin,
 which is the leprosy of the soul, defiling to the conscience, and from 
 which Christ alone can cleanse us; for herein the power of his grace 
 infinitely transcends that of the legal priesthood, that the priest 
 could only convict the leper (for by the law is the knowledge of sin), 
 but Christ can cure the leper, he can take away sin.  <I>Lord, if thou 
 wilt, thou canst make me clean,</I> which was more than the priests 
 could do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:2">Matt. viii. 2</A>.

 Some think that the leprosy signified, not so much sin in general as a
 state of sin, by which men are separated from God (their spot not being 
 the spot of God's children), and scandalous sin, for which men are to 
 be shut out from the communion of the faithful. It is a work of great 
 importance, but of great difficulty, to judge of our spiritual state: 
 we have all cause to suspect ourselves, being conscious to ourselves of 
 sores and spots, but whether clean or unclean is the question. A man 
 might have a scab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and yet be clean: the best have their infirmities; but, as there were
 certain marks by which to know that it was a leprosy, so there are 
 characters of such as are in the gall of bitterness, and the work of 
 ministers is to declare the judgment of leprosy and to assist those 
 that suspect themselves in the trial of their spiritual state, 
 remitting or retaining sin. And hence the keys of the kingdom of heaven 
 are said to be given to them, because they are to separate between the 
 precious and the vile, and to judge who are fit as clean to partake of 
 the holy things and who as unclean must be debarred from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Several rules are here laid down by which the judgment of the 
 priest must be governed. 

 1. If the sore was but <I>skin-deep,</I> it was to be hoped it was not
 the <I>leprosy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But, if it was <I>deeper than the skin,</I> the man must be pronounced 
 unclean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The infirmities that consist with grace do not sink deep into the soul, 
 but <I>the mind</I> still <I>serves the law of God,</I> and the 
 <I>inward man delights in it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:22,25">Rom. vii. 22, 25</A>.

 But if the matter be really worse than it shows, and the inwards be
 infected, the case is dangerous.

 2. If the sore <I>be at a stay,</I> and do not <I>spread,</I> it is no
 leprosy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 But if it <I>spread much abroad,</I> and continue to do so after 
 several inspections, the case is bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 If men do not grow worse, but a stop be put to the course of their sins 
 and their corruptions be checked, it is to be hoped they will grow 
 better; but if sin get ground, and they become worse every day, they 
 are going downhill. 

 3. If there was <I>proud raw flesh</I> in the rising, the priest needed
 not to wait any longer, it was certainly a leprosy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Nor is there any surer indication of the badness of a man's spiritual 
 state than the heart's rising in self-conceit, confidence in the flesh, 
 and resistance of the reproofs of the word and strivings of the Spirit. 
 
 4. If the eruption, whatever it was, <I>covered all the skin</I> from
 head to foot, it was no leprosy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>);

 for it was an evidence that the vitals were sound and strong, and 
 nature hereby helped itself, throwing out what was burdensome and 
 pernicious. There is hope in the small-pox when they come out well: so 
 if men freely confess their sins, and hide them not, there is no danger 
 comparable to theirs that cover their sins. Some gather this from it, 
 that there is more hope of the profane than of hypocrites. The 
 publicans and harlots went into the kingdom of heaven before scribes 
 and Pharisees. In one respect, the sudden breakings-out of passion, 
 though bad enough, are not so dangerous as malice concealed. Others 
 gather this, that, if we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged; if we 
 see and own that there is <I>no health in us, no soundness in our 
 flesh,</I> by reason of sin, we shall <I>find grace in the eyes of the 
 Lord.</I> 

 5.  The priest must take time in making his judgment, and not give it
 rashly. If the matter looked suspicious, he must shut up the patient 
 seven days, and then seven days more, that his judgment might be 
 <I>according to truth.</I> This teaches all, both ministers and people, 
 not to be hasty in their censures, nor to judge any thing <I>before the 
 time.</I> If <I>some men's sins go before unto judgment,</I> the sins 
 of others <I>follow after,</I> and so men's good works; therefore let 
 nothing be done <I>suddenly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:22,24,25">1 Tim. v. 22, 24, 25</A>.

 6. If the person suspected was found to be clean, yet he must <I>wash
 his clothes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 because he had been under the suspicion, and there had been in him that 
 which gave ground for the suspicion. Even the prisoner that is 
 acquitted must go down on his knees. We have need to be washed in the 
 blood of Christ from our spots, though they be not leprosy-spots; for 
 who can say, <I>I am pure from sin?</I> though there are those who 
 through grace are <I>innocent from the great transgression.</I></P>

 boil, and is healed,
 &nbsp; 19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
 bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the
 priest;
 &nbsp; 20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it <I>be</I> in sight
 lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
 priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <I>is</I> a plague of leprosy
 broken out of the boil.
 &nbsp; 21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <I>there be</I> no
 white hairs therein, and <I>if</I> it <I>be</I> not lower than the skin,
 but <I>be</I> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven
 days:
 &nbsp; 22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
 shall pronounce him unclean: it <I>is</I> a plague.
 &nbsp; 23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, <I>and</I> spread not,
 it <I>is</I> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
 &nbsp; 24 Or if there be <I>any</I> flesh, in the skin whereof <I>there is</I> a

 bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

 deeper than the skin; it <I>is</I> a leprosy broken out of the
 burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it
 <I>is</I> the plague of leprosy.
 &nbsp; 26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, <I>there be</I> no
 white hair in the bright spot, and it <I>be</I> no lower than the
 <I>other</I> skin, but <I>be</I> somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut
 him up seven days:
 &nbsp; 27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <I>and</I> if
 it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
 pronounce him unclean: it <I>is</I> the plague of leprosy.
 &nbsp; 28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, <I>and</I> spread not
 in the skin, but it <I>be</I> somewhat dark; it <I>is</I> a rising of the
 burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <I>is</I> an
 inflammation of the burning.
 &nbsp; 29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
 &nbsp; 30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it
 <I>be</I> in sight deeper than the skin; <I>and there be</I> in it a yellow
 thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <I>is</I> a
 dry scall, <I>even</I> a leprosy upon the head or beard.
 &nbsp; 31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
 behold, it <I>be</I> not in sight deeper than the skin, and <I>that
 there is</I> no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up <I>him
 that hath</I> the plague of the scall seven days:
 &nbsp; 32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
 and, behold, <I>if</I> the scall spread not, and there be in it no
 yellow hair, and the scall <I>be</I> not in sight deeper than the
 skin;
 &nbsp; 33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and
 the priest shall shut up <I>him that hath</I> the scall seven days
 more:
 &nbsp; 34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
 and, behold, <I>if</I> the scall be not spread in the skin, nor <I>be</I>
 in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
 him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
 &nbsp; 35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his
 cleansing;
 &nbsp; 36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
 be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair;
 he <I>is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and <I>that</I> there
 is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he <I>is</I>
 clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The priest is here instructed what judgment to make if there was any 
 appearance of a leprosy, either, 

 1. In an old ulcer, or bile, that has been healed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 &c. When old sores, that seemed to be cured, break out again, it is to 
 be feared there is a leprosy in them; such is the danger of those who, 
 having escaped the pollutions of the world, are again <I>entangled 
 therein and overcome.</I> Or, 

 2. In a burn by accident, for this seems to be meant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 &c. The burning of strife and contention often proves the occasion of
 the rising up and breaking out of that corruption which witnesses to
 men's faces that they are unclean. 

 3. In a scall-head. And in this commonly the judgment turned upon a
 very small matter. If the hair in the scall was black, it was a sign of 
 soundness; if yellow, it was an indication of a leprosy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:30-37"><I>v.</I> 30-37</A>.

 The other rules in these cases are the same with those mentioned 
 before. In reading of these several sorts of ailments, it will be good 
 for us, 

 1.  To lament the calamitous state of human life, which lies exposed to
 so many grievances. What troops of diseases are we beset with on every 
 side! and they all entered by sin.  

 2. To give thanks to God if he has never afflicted us with any of these
 sores: if the constitution is healthful, and the body lively and easy, 
 we are bound to glorify God with our bodies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
 bright spots, <I>even</I> white bright spots;
 &nbsp; 39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <I>if</I> the bright
 spots in the skin of their flesh <I>be</I> darkish white; it <I>is</I> a
 freckled spot <I>that</I> groweth in the skin; he <I>is</I> clean.
 &nbsp; 40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he <I>is</I> bald;
 <I>yet is</I> he clean.
 &nbsp; 41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his
 head toward his face, he <I>is</I> forehead bald: <I>yet is</I> he clean.
 &nbsp; 42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
 reddish sore; it <I>is</I> a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
 his bald forehead.
 &nbsp; 43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, <I>if</I> the
 rising of the sore <I>be</I> white reddish in his bald head, or in his
 bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
 &nbsp; 44 He is a leprous man, he <I>is</I> unclean: the priest shall
 pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <I>is</I> in his head.
 &nbsp; 45 And the leper in whom the plague <I>is,</I> his clothes shall be
 rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
 upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
 &nbsp; 46 All the days wherein the plague <I>shall be</I> in him he shall
 be defiled; he <I>is</I> unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the
 camp <I>shall</I> his habitation <I>be.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 If the leprosy of sin have seized the head, if the judgment be 
 corrupted, and wicked principles which countenance and support wicked 
 practices, be embraced, it is an <I>utter uncleanness,</I> from which 
 few are ever cleansed. Soundness in the faith keeps the leprosy from 
 the head, and saves conscience from being shipwrecked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Directions what must be done with the convicted leper. When the 
 priest, upon mature deliberation, had solemnly pronounced him
 unclean,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must pronounce himself so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 He must put himself into the posture of a mourner and cry, <I>Unclean, 
 unclean.</I> The leprosy was not itself a sin, but it was a sad token 
 of God's displeasure and a sore affliction to him that was under it.  
 It was a reproach to his name, put a full stop to his business in the 
 world, cut him off from conversation with his friends and relations, 
 condemned him to banishment till he was cleansed, shut him out from the 
 sanctuary, and was, in effect, the ruin of all the comfort he could 
 have in this world. Heman, it would seem, either was a leper or alludes 
 to the melancholy condition of a leper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:8-18">Ps. lxxxviii. 8</A>,

 &c. He must therefore,

 (1.) Humble himself under the mighty hand of God, not insisting upon
 his cleanness when the priest had pronounced him unclean, but 
 justifying God and accepting the <I>punishment of his iniquity.</I> He 
 must signify this by <I>rending his clothes, uncovering</I> his head, 
 and <I>covering his upper lip,</I> all tokens of shame and confusion of 
 face, and very significant of that self-loathing and self-abasement 
 which should fill the hearts of penitents, the language of which is 
 self-judging. Thus must we take to ourselves the shame that belongs to 
 us, and with broken hearts call ourselves by our own name, <I>Unclean, 
 unclean</I>--heart unclean, life unclean, unclean by original 
 corruption, unclean by actual transgression--unclean, and therefore 
 worthy to be for ever excluded from communion with God, and all hope of 
 happiness in him. <I>We are all as an unclean thing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:6">Isa. lxiv. 6</A>)--unclean,

 and therefore undone, if infinite mercy do not interpose.

 (2.) He must give warning to others to take heed of coming near him.
 Wherever he went, he must cry to those he saw at a distance, "<I>I am 
 unclean, unclean,</I> take heed of touching me." Not that the leprosy 
 was catching, but by the touch of a leper ceremonial uncleanness was 
 contracted. Every one therefore was concerned to avoid it; and the 
 leper himself must give notice of the danger. And this was all that the 
 law could do, in that it was weak through the flesh; it taught the 
 leper to cry, <I>Unclean, unclean,</I> but the gospel has put another 
 cry into the lepers' mouths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:12,13">Luke xvii. 12, 13</A>,

 where we find ten lepers crying with a loud voice, <I>Jesus, Master,
 have mercy on us.</I> The law only shows us our disease; the gospel 
 shows us our help in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must then be shut out of the camp, and afterwards, when they came 
 to Canaan, out of the city, town, or village, where he lived, and 
 <I>dwell alone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 associating with none but those that were lepers like himself. When 
 king Uzziah became a leper, he was banished from his palace, and 
 <I>dwelt in a separate house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:21">2 Chron. xxvi. 21</A>.

 And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:3">2 Kings vii. 3</A>.

 This typified the purity which ought to be preserved in the gospel
 church, by the solemn and authoritative exclusion of scandalous 
 sinners, that hate to be reformed, from the communion of the faithful.  
 <I>Put away from among yourselves that wicked person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:13">1 Cor. v. 13</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up <I>it
 that hath</I> the plague seven days:
 &nbsp; 51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
 plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the

 plague <I>is</I> a fretting leprosy; it <I>is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof,
 in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
 is: for it <I>is</I> a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
 fire.
 &nbsp; 53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
 spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in
 any thing of skin;
 &nbsp; 54 Then the priest shall command that they wash <I>the thing</I>

 &nbsp; 55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
 washed: and, behold, <I>if</I> the plague have not changed his colour,
 and the plague be not spread; it <I>is</I> unclean; thou shalt burn it
 in the fire; it <I>is</I> fret inward, <I>whether</I> it <I>be</I> bare within
 or without.
 &nbsp; 56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague <I>be</I>
 somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out
 of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of
 the woof:
 &nbsp; 57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp,
 or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it <I>is</I> a spreading

 from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be
 clean.
 &nbsp; 59 This <I>is</I> the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
 woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
 skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the law concerning the plague of leprosy in a garment, whether 
 linen or woollen. A leprosy in a garment, with discernible indications 
 of it, the colour changed by it, the garment fretted, the nap worn off, 
 and this in some one particular part of the garment, and increasing 
 when it was shut up, and not to be got out by washing is a thing which 
 to us now is altogether unaccountable. The learned confess that it was 
 a sign and a miracle in Israel, an extraordinary punishment inflicted 
 by the divine power, as a token of great displeasure against a person 
 or family. 

 1. The process was much the same with that concerning a leprous person.
 The garment suspected to be tainted was not to be burnt immediately, 
 though, it may be, there would have been no great loss of it; for in no 
 case must sentence be given merely upon a surmise, but it must be 
 <I>shown to the priest.</I> If, upon search, it was found that there 
 was a <I>leprous spot</I> (the Jews say no bigger than a bean), it must 
 be <I>burnt,</I> or at least that part of the garment in which the spot 
 was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:52,57"><I>v.</I> 52, 57</A>.

 If the cause of the suspicion was gone, it must be <I>washed,</I> and 
 then might be used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 2. The signification also was much the same, to intimate the great 
 malignity there is in sin: it not only defiles the sinner's conscience, 
 but it brings a stain upon all his employments and enjoyments, all he 
 has and all he does. <I>To those that are defiled and unbelieving is 
 nothing pure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 And we are taught hereby to hate even <I>the garments spotted with the
 flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:23">Jude 23</A>.

 Those that make their
 clothes servants to their pride and lust may see them thereby tainted 
 with a leprosy, and doomed to the fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:18-24">Isa. iii. 18-24</A>.

 But the ornament of <I>the hidden man of the heart is
 incorruptible,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 The robes of righteousness never fret nor are moth-eaten.</P>
