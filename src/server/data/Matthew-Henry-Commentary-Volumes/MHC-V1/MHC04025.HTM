 Israel, having escaped the curse of Balaam, here sustains a great deal 
 of damage and reproach by the counsel of Balaam, who, it seems, before 
 he left Balak, put him into a more effectual way than that which Balak 
 thought of to separate between the Israelites and their God. "The Lord 
 will not be prevailed with by Balaam's charms to ruin them; try if they 
 will not be prevailed with by the charms of the daughters of Moab to 
 ruin themselves." None are more fatally bewitched than those that are 
 bewitched by their own lusts. Here is, 

 I. The sin of Israel; they were enticed by the daughters of Moab both
 to whoredom and to idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The punishment of this sin by the hand of the magistrate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>)

 and by the immediate hand of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:9">ver. 9</A>.

 III.  The pious zeal of Phinehas in slaying Zimri and Cozbi, two
 impudent sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:6,8,14,15">ver.  6, 8, 14, 15</A>.

 IV. God's commendation of the zeal of Phinehas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 V.  Enmity put between the Israelites and the Midianites, their
 tempters, as at first between the woman and the serpent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:16-18">ver. 16</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
 whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
 &nbsp; 2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
 and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
 &nbsp; 3 And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
 people, and hang them up before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against the sun, that
 the fierce anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> may be turned away from Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
 his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The sin of Israel, to which they were enticed by the daughters of 
 Moab and Midian; they were guilty both of corporal and spiritual 
 whoredoms, for <I>Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Not all, nor the most, but very many, were taken in this snare.  Now 
 concerning this observe,

 1. That Balak, by the advice of Balaam, <I>cast this stumbling-block
 before the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:14">Rev. ii. 14</A>.

 Note, Those are our worst enemies that draw us to sin, for that is the
 greatest mischief any man can do us. If Balak had drawn out his armed 
 men against them to fight them, Israel had bravely resisted, and no 
 doubt had been more than conquerors; but now that he sends his 
 beautiful women among them, and invites them to his idolatrous feasts, 
 the Israelites basely yield, and are shamefully overcome: those are 
 smitten with this harlots that could not be smitten with his sword.  
 Note, We are more endangered by the charms of a smiling world than by 
 the terrors of a frowning world.

 2. That the daughters of Moab were their tempters and conquerors. Ever
 since Eve was first in the transgression the fairer sex, though the 
 weaker, has been a snare to many; yea strong men have been wounded and 
 slain by the lips of the strange woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:26">Prov. vii. 26</A>),

 witness Solomon, whose wives were shares and nets to him

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:26">Eccl. vii. 26</A>.

 3. That whoredom and idolatry went together. They first defiled and
 debauched their consciences, by committing lewdness with the women, and 
 then were easily drawn, in complaisance to them, and in contempt of the 
 God of Israel, to bow down to their idols. And they were more likely to 
 do so if, as it is commonly supposed, and seems probable by the joining 
 of them together, the uncleanness committed was a part of the worship 
 and service performed to Baal-peor. Those that have broken the fences 
 of modesty will never be held by the bonds of piety, and those that 
 have dishonoured themselves by fleshly lusts will not scruple to 
 dishonour God by idolatrous worships, and for this they are justly 
 given up yet further to vile affections. 

 4. That by eating of the idolatrous sacrifices they <I>joined
 themselves to Baal-peor</I> to whom they were offered, which the 
 apostle urges as a reason why Christians should not <I>eat things 
 offered to idols,</I> because thereby they had fellowship with the 
 devils to whom they were offered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:20">1 Cor. x. 20</A>.

 It is called <I>eating the sacrifices of the dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:28">Ps. cvi. 28</A>),

 not only because the idol itself was a dead thing, but because the
 person represented by it was some great hero, who since his death was 
 deified, as saints in the Roman church are canonized.

 5.  It was great aggravation of the sin that <I>Israel abode in
 Shittim,</I> where they had the land of Canaan in view, and were just 
 ready to enter and take possession of it. It was the highest degree of 
 treachery and ingratitude to be false to their God, whom they had found 
 so faithful to them, and to eat of idol-sacrifices when they were ready 
 to be feasted so richly on God's favours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's just displeasure against them for this sin. Israel's 
 whoredoms did that which all Balaam's enchantments could not do, they 
 set God against them; now he was <I>turned to be their enemy, and 
 fought against them.</I> So many of the people, nay, so many of the 
 princes, were guilty, that the sin became national, and for it God was 
 wroth with the whole congregation. 

 1. A plague immediately broke out, for we read of the staying of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and of the number that died of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but no mention of the beginning of it, which therefore must be implied 
 in those words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>),

 <I>The anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.</I> It is said 
 expressly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:29">Ps. cvi. 29</A>),

 <I>The plague broke in.</I> Note, Epidemical diseases are the fruits of
 God's anger, and the just punishments of epidemical sins; one infection 
 follows the other. The plague, no doubt, fastened on those that were 
 most guilty, who were soon made to pay dearly for their forbidden 
 pleasures; and though now God does not always plague such sinners, as 
 he did here, yet that word of God will be fulfilled, <I>If any man 
 defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:17">1 Cor. iii. 17</A>.

 2. The ringleaders are ordered to be put to death by the hand of public 
 justice, which will be the only way to stay the plague 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Take the heads of the people</I> (that is, of that part of the 
 people that went out of the camp of Israel into the country of Moab, to 
 join in their idolatries)--<I>take them and hang them up before the 
 sun,</I> as sacrifices to God's justice, and for a terror to the rest 
 of the people. The judges must first order them to be <I>slain with the 
 sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and their dead bodies must be hanged up, that the stupid Israelites, 
 seeing their leaders and princes so severely punished for their 
 whoredom and idolatry, without any regard to their quality, might be 
 possessed with a sense of the evil of the sin and the terror of God's 
 wrath against them. Ringleaders in sin ought to be made examples of 
 justice.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
 unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and
 in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
 who <I>were</I> weeping <I>before</I> the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
 priest, saw <I>it,</I> he rose up from among the congregation, and
 took a javelin in his hand;
 &nbsp; 8 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
 both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
 her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
 hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he
 was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
 children of Israel in my jealousy.
 &nbsp; 12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
 &nbsp; 13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, <I>even</I> the
 covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for
 his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, <I>even</I> that
 was slain with the Midianitish woman, <I>was</I> Zimri, the son of
 Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
 &nbsp; 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain <I>was</I>
 Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he <I>was</I> head over a people, <I>and</I> of
 a chief house in Midian.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a remarkable contest between wickedness and righteousness, 
 which shall be most bold and resolute; and righteousness carries the 
 day, as no doubt it will at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Never was vice more daring than it was in Zimri, <I>a prince of a 
 chief house</I> in the tribe of Simeon. Such a degree of impudence in 
 wickedness had he arrived at that he publicly appeared leading a 
 Midianitish harlot (and a harlot of quality too like himself, a 
 <I>daughter of a chief house in Midian</I>) in the sight of Moses, and 
 all the good people of Israel. He did not think it enough to go out 
 with his harlot to worship the gods of Moab, but, when he had done 
 that, he brought her with him to dishonour the God of Israel. He not 
 only owned her publicly as his friend, and higher in his favour then 
 any of the daughters of Israel, but openly went with her <I>into the 
 tent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The word signifies such a booth or place of retirement as was designed 
 and fitted up for lewdness. Thus he <I>declared his sin as Sodom,</I> 
 as was so far from blushing for it that he rather prided himself in it, 
 and gloried in his shame. All the circumstances concurred to make it 
 exceedingly sinful, exceedingly shameful.

 1. It was an affront to the justice of the nation, and bade defiance to
 that.  The judges were ordered to put the criminals to death, but he 
 thought himself too great for them to meddle with, and, in effect, bade 
 them touch him if they durst. He had certainly cast off all fear of God 
 who stood in no awe of the powers which he had ordained to be <I>a 
 terror to evil-doers.</I> 

 2. It was an affront to the religion of the nation, and put a contempt 
 upon that. Moses, and the main body of the congregation, who kept their 
 integrity, <I>were weeping at the door of the tabernacle,</I> lamenting 
 the sin committed and deprecating the plague begun; they were 
 <I>sanctifying a fast</I> in a solemn assembly, weeping <I>between the 
 porch and the altar,</I> to turn away the wrath of God from the 
 congregation. Then comes Zimri among them, with his harlot in his hand, 
 to banter them, and, in effect, to tell them that he was resolved to 
 fill the measure of sin as fast as they emptied it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Never was virtue more daring than it was in Phinehas. Being aware 
 of the insolence of Zimri, which it is probable, all the congregation 
 took notice of, in a holy indignation at the offenders he rises up from 
 his prayers, takes his sword or half-pike, follows those impudent 
 sinners into their tent, and stabs them both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 It is not at all difficult to justify Phinehas in what he did; for, 
 being now heir-apparent to the high-priesthood, no doubt he was one of 
 those judges of Israel whom Moses had ordered, by the divine 
 appointment, to slay all those whom they knew to have joined themselves 
 to Baal-peor, so that this gives no countenance at all to private 
 persons, under pretence of zeal against sin, to put offenders to death, 
 who ought to be prosecuted by due course of law. The civil magistrate 
 is the avenger, to <I>execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,</I> and 
 no private person may take his work out of his hand. Two ways God 
 testified his acceptance of the pious zeal of Phinehas:--

 1. He immediately put a stop to the plague, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Their weeping and praying prevailed not till this piece of necessary 
 justice was done. If magistrates do not take care to punish sin, God 
 will; but their justice will be the best prevention of his judgment, as 
 in the case of Achan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:13">Josh. vii. 13</A>.

 2. He put an honour upon Phinehas. Though he did no more than it was 
 his duty to do as a judge, yet because he did it with extraordinary 
 zeal against sin, and for the honour of God and Israel, and did it when 
 the other judges, out of respect to Zimri's character as a prince, were 
 afraid, and declined doing it, therefore God showed himself 
 particularly well pleased with him, and it <I>was counted to him for 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:31">Ps. cvi. 31</A>.

 There is nothing lost by venturing for God.  If Zimri's relations bore
 him a grudge for it, and his friends might censure him as indiscreet in 
 this violent and hasty execution, what needed he care, while God 
 accepted him? In a good thing we should be zealously affected.

 (1.) Phinehas, upon this occasion, though a young man, is pronounced
 his country's patriot and best friend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He has <I>turned away my wrath from the children of Israel.</I> So much 
 does God delight in showing mercy that he is well pleased with those 
 that are instrumental in turning away his wrath.  This is the best 
 service we can do to our people; and we may contribute something 
 towards it by our prayers, and by our endeavours in our places to 
 <I>bring the wickedness of the wicked to an end.</I>

 (2.) The priesthood is entailed by covenant upon his family. It was
 designed him before, but now it was confirmed to him, and, which added 
 much to the comfort and honour of it, it was made the recompence of his 
 pious zeal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 It is here called <I>an everlasting priesthood,</I> because it should 
 continue to the period of the Old-Testament dispensation, and should 
 then have its perfection and perpetuity in the unchangeable priesthood 
 of Christ, who is <I>consecrated for evermore.</I> By the <I>covenant 
 of peace</I> given him, some understand in general a promise of long 
 life and prosperity, and all good; it seems rather to be meant 
 particularly of the covenant of priesthood, for that is called the 
 <I>covenant of life and peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:5">Mal. ii. 5</A>),

 and was made for the preservation of peace between God and his people.
 Observe how the reward answered the service. By executing justice he 
 had <I>made an atonement for the children of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and therefore he and his shall henceforward be employed in making 
 atonement by sacrifice. He <I>was zealous for his God,</I> and 
 therefore he shall have the covenant of <I>an everlasting 
 priesthood.</I> Note, It is requisite that ministers should be not only 
 for God, but zealous for God. It is required of them that they do more 
 than others for the support and advancement of the interests of God's 
 kingdom among men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 17 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
 &nbsp; 18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
 beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi,
 the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain
 in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had punished the Israelites for their sin with a plague; as a 
 Father he corrected his own children with a rod. But we read not that 
 any of the Midianites died of the plague; God took another course with 
 them, and punished them with the sword of an enemy, not with the rod of 
 a father. 

 1. Moses, though the meekest man, and far from a spirit of revenge, is
 ordered to <I>vex the Midianites and smite them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, We must set ourselves against that, whatever it is, which is an 
 occasion of sin to us, though it be a right eye or a right hand that 
 thus offends us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29,30">Matt. v. 29, 30</A>.

 This is that holy indignation and revenge which godly sorrow worketh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>.

 2. The reason given for the meditating of this revenge is because they 
 <I>vex you with their wiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, Whatever draws us to sin should be a vexation to us, as a thorn 
 in the flesh. The mischief which the Midianites did to Israel by 
 enticing them to whoredom must be remembered and punished with as much 
 severity as that which the Amalekites did in fighting with them when 
 they came out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14">Exod. xvii. 14</A>.

 God will certainly reckon with those that do the devil's work in
 tempting men to sin. See further orders given in this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 2</A>.</P>
