 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
 it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
 sheep.

 nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
 &nbsp; 4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
 be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
 &nbsp; 5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
 shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of
 the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard,
 shall he make restitution.
 &nbsp; 6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
 corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
 <I>therewith;</I> he that kindled the fire shall surely make
 restitution.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are the laws,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning theft, which are these:--

 1. If a man steal any cattle (in which the wealth of those times
 chiefly consisted), and they be found in his custody, he must restore 
 double, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Thus he must both satisfy for the wrong and suffer for the crime. But 
 it was afterwards provided that if the thief were touched in 
 conscience, and voluntarily confessed it, before it was discovered or 
 enquired into by any other, then he should only make restitution of 
 what he had stolen, and add to it a fifth part, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:4,5">Lev. vi. 4, 5</A>.

 2. If he had killed or sold the sheep or ox he had stolen, and thereby
 persisted in his crime, he must restore <I>five oxen for an ox, and 
 four sheep for a sheep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 more for an ox than for a sheep because the owner, besides all the 
 other profit, lost the daily labour of his ox. This law teaches us that 
 fraud and injustice, so far from enriching men, will impoverish them: 
 if we unjustly get and keep that which is another's, it will not only 
 waste itself, but it will consume that which is our own. 

 3. If he was not able to make restitution, he must be sold for a slave,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The court of judgment was to do it, and it is probable that the person 
 robbed had the money.  Thus with us, in some cases, felons are 
 transported into plantations where alone Englishmen know what slavery 
 is. 

 4. If a thief broke a house in the night, and was killed in the doing 
 of it, his blood was upon his own head, and should not be required at 
 the hand of him that shed it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 As he that does an unlawful act bears the blame of the mischief that 
 follows to others, so likewise of that which follows to himself. A 
 man's house is his castle, and God's law, as well as man's, sets a 
 guard upon it; he that assaults it does so at his peril. Yet, if it was 
 in the day-time that the thief was killed, he that killed him must be 
 accountable for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 unless it was in the necessary defence of his own life. Note, We ought 
 to be tender of the lives even of bad men; the magistrate must afford 
 us redress, and we must not avenge ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning trespass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He that wilfully put his cattle into his neighbour's field must make 
 restitution of the best of his own. Our law makes a much greater 
 difference between this and other thefts than the law of Moses did. The 
 Jews hence observed it as a general rule that restitution must always 
 be made of the best, and that no man should keep any cattle that were 
 likely to trespass upon his neighbours or do them any damage. We should 
 be more careful not to do wrong than not to suffer wrong, because to 
 suffer wrong is only an affliction, but to do wrong is a sin, and sin 
 is always worse than affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning damage done by fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He that designed only the burning of thorns might become accessory to 
 the burning of corn, and should not be held guiltless. Men of hot and 
 eager spirits should take heed, lest, while they pretend only to pluck 
 up the tares, they root out the wheat also. If the fire did mischief, 
 he that kindled it must answer for it, though it could not be proved 
 that he designed the mischief. Men must suffer for their carelessness, 
 as well as for their malice. We must take heed of beginning strife; 
 for, though it seem but little, we know not how great a matter it may 
 kindle, the blame of which we must bear, if, with the madman, we cast 
 fire-brands, arrows, and death, and pretend we mean no harm. It will 
 make us very careful of ourselves, if we consider that we are 
 accountable, not only for the hurt we do, but for the hurt we occasion 
 through inadvertency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
 keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
 found, let him pay double.
 &nbsp; 8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
 be brought unto the judges, <I>to see</I> whether he have put his hand
 unto his neighbour's goods.
 &nbsp; 9 For all manner of trespass, <I>whether it be</I> for ox, for ass,
 for sheep, for raiment, <I>or</I> for any manner of lost thing, which
 <I>another</I> challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
 come before the judges; <I>and</I> whom the judges shall condemn, he
 shall pay double unto his neighbour.
 &nbsp; 10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
 sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven
 away, no man seeing <I>it:</I>
 &nbsp; 11 <I>Then</I> shall an oath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be between them both, that
 he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
 owner of it shall accept <I>thereof,</I> and he shall not make <I>it</I>
 good.
 &nbsp; 12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
 the owner thereof.
 &nbsp; 13 If it be torn in pieces, <I>then</I> let him bring it <I>for</I>
 witness, <I>and</I> he shall not make good that which was torn.
 &nbsp; 14 And if a man borrow <I>ought</I> of his neighbour, and it be
 hurt, or die, the owner thereof <I>being</I> not with it, he shall
 surely make <I>it</I> good.
 &nbsp; 15 <I>But</I> if the owner thereof <I>be</I> with it, he shall not make
 <I>it</I> good: if it <I>be</I> an hired <I>thing,</I> it came for his hire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These laws are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning trusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:7-13"><I>v.</I> 7-13</A>.

 If a man deliver goods, suppose to a carrier to be conveyed, or to a 
 warehouse-keeper to be preserved, or cattle to a farmer to be fed, upon 
 a valuable consideration, and if a special confidence be reposed in the 
 person they are lodged with, in case these goods be stolen or lost, 
 perish or be damaged, if it appear that it was not by any fault of the 
 trustee, the owner must stand to the loss, otherwise he that has been 
 false to this trust must be compelled to make satisfaction. The trustee 
 must aver his innocence upon oath before the judges, if the case was 
 such as afforded no other proof, and they were to determine the matter 
 according as it appeared.  This teaches us, 

 1. That we ought to be very careful of every thing we are entrusted 
 with, as careful of it, though it be another's, as if it were our own. 
 It is unjust and base, and that which all the world cries shame on, to 
 betray a trust. 

 2. That there is such a general failing of truth and justice upon earth 
 as gives too much occasion to suspect men's honesty whenever it is 
 their interest to be dishonest. 

 3. That <I>an oath for confirmation is an end of strife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:16">Heb. vi. 16</A>.

 It is called an <I>oath for the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 because to him the appeal is made, not only as to a witness of truth, 
 but as to an avenger of wrong and falsehood. Those that had offered 
 injury to their neighbour by doing any unjust thing, yet, it might be 
 hoped, had not so far debauched their consciences as to profane an oath 
 of the Lord, and call the God of truth to be witness to a lie: perjury 
 is a sin which natural conscience startles at as much as any other. The 
 religion of an oath is very ancient, and a plain indication of the 
 universal belief of a God, and a providence, and a judgment to come. 

 4. That magistracy is an ordinance of God, designed, among other
 intentions, to assist men both in discovering rights disputed and 
 recovering rights denied; and great respect ought to be paid to the 
 determination of the judges. 

 5. That there is no reason why a man should suffer for that which he 
 could not help: masters should consider this, in dealing with their 
 servants, and not rebuke that as a fault which was a mischance, and 
 which they themselves, had they been in their servants' places, could 
 not have prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning loans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 If a man (suppose) lent his team to his neighbour, if the owner was 
 with it, or was to receive profit for the loan of it, whatever harm 
 befel the cattle the owner must stand to the loss of: but if the owner 
 was so kind to the borrower as to lend it to him gratis, and put such a 
 confidence in him as to trust it from under his own eye, then, if any 
 harm happened, the borrower must make it good. Let us learn hence to be 
 very careful not to abuse any thing that is lent us; it is not only 
 unjust, but base and disingenuous, inasmuch as it is rendering evil for 
 good; we should much rather choose to lose ourselves than that any 
 should sustain loss by their kindness to us. <I>Alas, master! for it 
 was borrowed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:5">2 Kings vi. 5</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Ex22_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie
 with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
 &nbsp; 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
 pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
 &nbsp; 18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
 &nbsp; 19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
 &nbsp; 20 He that sacrificeth unto <I>any</I> god, save unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> only,
 he shall be utterly destroyed.
 &nbsp; 21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
 were strangers in the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
 &nbsp; 23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto
 me, I will surely hear their cry;
 &nbsp; 24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
 sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
 fatherless.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law that he who debauched a young woman should be obliged to marry 
 her,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 If she was betrothed to another, it was death to debauch her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:23,24">Deut. xxii. 23, 24</A>);

 but the law here mentioned respects her as single. But, if the father
 refused her to him, he was to give satisfaction in money for the injury 
 and disgrace he had done her. This law puts an honour upon marriage and 
 shows likewise how improper a thing it is that children should marry 
 without their parents' consent: even here, where the divine law 
 appointed the marriage, both as a punishment to him that had done wrong 
 and a recompence to her that had suffered wrong, yet there was an 
 express reservation for the father's power; if he denied his consent, 
 it must be no marriage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law which makes witchcraft a capital crime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Witchcraft not only gives that honour to the devil which is due to God 
 alone, but bids defiance to the divine Providence, wages war with God's 
 government, and puts his work into the devil's hand, expecting him to 
 do good and evil, and so making him indeed <I>the god of this 
 world;</I> justly therefore was it punished with death, especially 
 among a people that were blessed with a divine revelation, and cared 
 for by divine Providence above any people under the sun. By our law, 
 consulting, covenanting with, invocating, or employing, any evil 
 spirit, to any intent whatsoever, and exercising any enchantment, 
 charm, or sorcery, whereby hurt shall be done to any person whatsoever, 
 is made felony, without benefit of clergy; also pretending to tell 
 where goods lost or stolen may be found, or the like, is an iniquity 
 punishable by the judge, and the second offence with death. The justice 
 of our law herein is supported by the law of God recorded here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Unnatural abominations are here made capital; such beasts in the 
 shape of men as are guilty of them are unfit to live 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Whosoever lies with a beast shall die.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Idolatry is also made capital, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God having declared himself jealous in this matter, the civil powers 
 must be jealous in it too, and utterly destroy those persons, families, 
 and places of Israel, that worshipped any god, save the Lord: this law 
 might have prevented the woeful apostasies of the Jewish nation in 
 after times, if those that should have executed it had not been 
 ringleaders in the breach of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A caution against oppression. Because those who were empowered to 
 punish other crimes were themselves most in danger of this, God takes 
 the punishing of it into his own hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Strangers must not be abused 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 not wronged in judgment by the magistrates, not imposed upon in 
 contracts, nor must any advantage be taken of their ignorance or 
 necessity; no, nor must they be taunted, trampled upon, treated with 
 contempt, or upbraided with being strangers; for all these were 
 vexations, and would discourage strangers from coming to live among 
 them, or would strengthen their prejudices against their religion, to 
 which, by all kind and gentle methods, they should endeavour to 
 proselyte them. The reason given why they should be kind to strangers 
 is, "<I>You were strangers in Egypt,</I> and knew what it was to be 
 vexed and oppressed there," Note, 

 (1.) Humanity is one of the laws of religion, and obliges us
 particularly to be tender of those that lie most under disadvantages 
 and discouragements, and to extend our compassionate concern to 
 strangers, and those to whom we are not under the obligations of 
 alliance or acquaintance. Those that are strangers to us are known to 
 God, and he preserves them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:9">Ps. cxlvi. 9</A>.

 (2.) Those that profess religion should study to oblige strangers, that
 they may thereby recommend religion to their good opinion, and take 
 heed of doing any thing that may tempt them to think ill of it or its 
 professors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:12">1 Pet. ii. 12</A>.

 (3.) Those that have themselves been in poverty and distress, if
 Providence enrich and enlarge them, ought to show a particular 
 tenderness towards those that are now in such circumstances as they 
 were in formerly, doing now by them as they then wished to be done 
 by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Widows and fatherless must not be abused 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>You shall not afflict them,</I> that is, "You shall comfort and 
 assist them, and be ready upon all occasions to show them kindness." In 
 making just demands from them, their condition must be considered, who 
 have lost those that should deal for them, and protect them; they are 
 supposed to be unversed in business, destitute of advice, timorous, and 
 of a tender spirit, and therefore must be treated with kindness and 
 compassion; no advantage must be taken against them, nor any hardship 
 put upon them, from which a husband or a father would have sheltered 
 them. For, 
 
 (1.) God takes particular cognizance of their case,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Having no one else to complain and appeal to, they will <I>cry unto 
 God,</I> and he will be sure <I>to hear them;</I> for his law and his 
 providence are guardians to the widows and fatherless, and if men do 
 not pity them, and will not hear them, he will. Note, It is a great 
 comfort to those who are injured and oppressed by men that they have a 
 God to go to who will do more than <I>give them the hearing;</I> and it 
 ought to be a terror to those who are oppressive that they have the cry 
 of the poor against them, which God will hear. Nay, 

 (2.) He will severely reckon with those that do oppress them. Though
 they escape punishments from men, God's righteous judgments will pursue 
 and overtake them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Men that have a sense of justice and honour will espouse the injured 
 cause of the weak and helpless; and shall not the righteous God do it?  
 Observe the equity of the sentence here passed upon those that oppress 
 the widows and fatherless: their wives shall become widows, and their 
 children fatherless; and the Lord is known by these judgments, which he 
 sometimes executes still.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 If thou lend money to <I>any of</I> my people <I>that is</I> poor by
 thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou
 lay upon him usury.
 &nbsp; 26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
 shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:
 &nbsp; 27 For that <I>is</I> his covering only, it <I>is</I> his raiment for his
 skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
 crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I <I>am</I> gracious.
 &nbsp; 28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
 people.
 &nbsp; 29 Thou shalt not delay <I>to offer</I> the first of thy ripe
 fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou
 give unto me.
 &nbsp; 30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, <I>and</I> with thy
 sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day
 thou shalt give it me.
 &nbsp; 31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat <I>any</I>
 flesh <I>that is</I> torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
 the dogs.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law against extortion in lending. 

 1. They must not receive use for money from any that borrowed for 
 necessity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 as in that case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:5,7">Neh. v. 5, 7</A>.

 And such provision the law made for the preservation of estates to
 their families by the year of jubilee that a people who had little 
 concern in trade could not be supposed to borrow money but for 
 necessity, and therefore it is generally forbidden among themselves; 
 but to a stranger, whom yet they might not oppress, they were allowed 
 to lend upon usury: this law, therefore, in the strictness of it, seems 
 to have been peculiar to the Jewish state; but, in the equity of it, it 
 obliges us to show mercy to those of whom we might take advantage, and 
 to be content to share, in loss as well as profit, with those we lend 
 to, if Providence cross them; and, upon this condition, it seems as 
 lawful to receive interest for my money, which another takes pains with 
 and improves, but runs the hazard of, in trade, as it is to receive 
 rent for my land, which another takes pains with and improves, but runs 
 the hazard of, in husbandry. 

 2. They must not take a poor man's bed-clothes in pawn; but, if they 
 did, must restore them by bed-time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 Those who lie soft and warm themselves should consider the hard and 
 cold lodgings of many poor people, and not do any thing to make bad 
 worse, or to add affliction to the afflicted.</P>

 II. A law against the contempt of authority 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt not revile the gods,</I> that is, the <I>judges</I> and 
 <I>magistrates,</I> for their executing these laws; they must do their 
 duty, whoever suffer by it. Magistrates ought not to fear the reproach 
 of men, nor their revilings, but to despise them as long as they keep a 
 good conscience; but those that do revile them for their being a terror 
 to evil works and workers reflect upon God himself, and will have a 
 great deal to answer for another day. We find those under a black 
 character, and a heavy doom, that <I>despise dominion, and speak evil 
 of dignities,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:8">Jude 8</A>.

 Princes and magistrates are our fathers, whom the fifth commandment
 obliges us to honour and forbids us to revile.  St. Paul applies this 
 law to himself, and owns that he ought not to <I>speak evil of the 
 ruler of his people;</I> no, not though the ruler was then his most 
 unrighteous persecutor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:5">Acts xxiii. 5</A>;

 III. A law concerning the offering of their first-fruits to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.
 
 It was appointed before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:1-22"><I>ch.</I> xiii</A>),

 and it is here repeated: <I>The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
 unto me;</I> and much more reason have we to give ourselves, and all we 
 have, to God, who <I>spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for 
 us all.</I> The first ripe of their corn they must not delay to offer. 
 There is danger, if we delay our duty, lest we wholly omit it; and by 
 slipping the first opportunity, in expectation of another, we suffer 
 Satan to cheat us of all our time. Let not young people delay to offer 
 to God the first-fruits of their time and strength, lest their delays 
 come, at last, to be denials, through the deceitfulness of sin, and the 
 more convenient season they promise themselves never arrive. Yet it is 
 provided that the firstlings of their cattle should not be dedicated to 
 God till they were past seven days old, for then they began to be good 
 for something. Note, God is the first and best, and therefore must have 
 the first and best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A distinction put between the Jews and all other people: <I>You 
 shall be holy men unto me;</I> and one mark of that honourable 
 distinction is appointed in their diet, which was, that they should not 
 <I>eat any flesh that was torn of beasts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 not only because it was unwholesome, but because it was paltry, and 
 base, and covetous, and a thing below those who were holy men unto God, 
 to eat the leavings of the beasts of prey. We that are sanctified to 
 God must not be curious in our diet; but we must be conscientious, not 
 feeding ourselves without fear, but eating and drinking by rule, the 
 rule of sobriety, to the glory of God.</P>
