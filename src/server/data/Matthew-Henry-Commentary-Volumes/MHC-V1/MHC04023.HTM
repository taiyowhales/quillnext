 In this chapter we have Balak and Balaam busy at work to do Israel a 
 mischief, and, for ought that appears, neither Moses nor the elders of 
 Israel know any thing of the matter, nor are in a capacity to break the 
 snare; but God, who keeps Israel, and neither slumbers nor sleeps, 
 baffles the attempt, without any intercession or contrivance of theirs. 
 Here is, 
 
 I. The first attempt to curse Israel. 

 1. The preparation made for it by sacrifice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. The contrary instruction God gave Balaam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 3. The blessing Balaam was compelled to pronounce upon Israel, instead
 of a curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 4. The great disappointment of Balak, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 II. The second attempt, in the same manner made, and in the same manner
 frustrated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:13-26">ver. 13-26</A>.

 III. Preparations made for a third attempt
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>),

 the issue of which we have in the next chapter.</P>

 1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
 prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
 offered on <I>every</I> altar a bullock and a ram.
 3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and
 I will go: peradventure the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will come to meet me: and
 whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high
 place.
 4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
 seven altars, and I have offered upon <I>every</I> altar a bullock and
 a ram.
 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
 unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
 6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
 sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
 7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
 hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
 <I>saying,</I> Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.
 8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
 defy, <I>whom</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not defied?
 9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
 behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
 reckoned among the nations.
 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the
 fourth <I>part</I> of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous,
 and let my last end be like his!
 11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
 took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed
 <I>them</I> altogether.
 12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath put in my mouth?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Great preparation made for the cursing of Israel. That which was 
 aimed at was to engage the God of Israel to forsake them, and either to 
 be on Moab's side or to stand neuter. O the sottishness of 
 superstition, to imagine that God will be at men's beck! Balaam and 
 Balak think to bribe him with altars and sacrifices, offered without 
 any warrant or institution of his: as if he would <I>eat the flesh of 
 bulls or drink the blood of goats.</I> Ridiculous nonsense, to think 
 that these would please God, and gain his favour, when there could be 
 in them no exercise either of faith or obedience! Yet, it should seem, 
 they offered these sacrifices to the God of heaven the supreme 
 <I>Numen--Divinity,</I> and not to any of their local deities. But the 
 multiplying of altars was an instance of their degeneracy from the 
 religion of their ancestors, and their apostasy to idolatry; for those 
 that multiplied altars multiplied gods. <I>Ephraim made many altars to 
 sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:11">Hos. viii. 11</A>.

 <I>Thus they liked not to retain God in their knowledge, but became
 vain in their imaginations;</I> and yet presumptuously expected hereby 
 to gain God over to them from Israel, who had his sanctuary among them, 
 and his anointed altar. Observe here,

 1. How very imperious Balaam was, proud to have the command of a king
 and to give law to princes. Such is the spirit of that wicked one who 
 exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped. 
 With what authority does Balaam give orders! <I>Build me here</I> (in 
 the place I have pitched upon) <I>seven altars,</I> of stone or turf. 
 Thus he covers his malice against Israel with a show of devotion, but 
 his sacrifice was an abomination, being brought with such a <I>wicked 
 mind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:27">Prov. xxi. 27</A>.

 That which he aimed at was not to honour God with the sacrifices of
 righteousness, but to enrich himself with the wages of unrighteousness.

 2. How very obsequious Balak was. The altars were presently built, and 
 the sacrifices prepared, the best of the sort, <I>seven bullocks and 
 seven rams.</I> Balak makes no objection to the charge, nor does he 
 snuff at it, or think it either a weariness or a disparagement to 
 <I>stand by his burnt-offering</I> as Balaam ordered him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The turning of the curse into a blessing, by the overruling power 
 of God, in love to Israel, which is the account Moses gives of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:5">Deut. xxiii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God puts the blessing into the mouth of Balaam. While the sacrifices 
 were burning, Balaam retired; he <I>went solitary,</I> into some dark 
 grove on the top of the high place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,

 marg. Thus much he knew, that solitude gives a good opportunity for 
 communion with God; those that would meet with him must retire from the 
 world, and the business and conversation of it, and love to be private, 
 reckoning themselves never less alone than when alone, because the 
 Father is with them. Enter therefore into thy closet, and shut the 
 door, and be assured that God will meet thee if thou <I>seek him in the 
 due order.</I> But Balaam retired with a peradventure only, having some 
 thoughts that God might meet him; but being conscious to himself of 
 guilt, and knowing that God had lately met him in anger, he had reason 
 to speak doubtfully: <I>Peradventure the Lord will come to meet me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>But let not such a man think that he shall receive any</I> favour 
 from God. Nay, it should seem, though he pretended to go and meet with 
 God, he really designed to use enchantments; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 1</A>.

 But, whatever he intended.  God designed to serve his own glory by him,
 and therefore <I>met Balaam,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>What communion has light with darkness?</I> No friendly communion, 
 we may be sure. Balaam's way was still perverse, and God was still an 
 adversary to him; but, Balak having chosen him for his oracle, God 
 would constrain him to utter such a confession, to the honour of god 
 and Israel, as should render those for ever inexcusable who should 
 appear in arms against them. When Balaam was aware that God met him, 
 probably by an angel, he boasted of his performances: <I>I have 
 prepared seven altars, and offered upon every altar a bullock and a 
 ram.</I> How had he done it? It cost him nothing; it was done at 
 Balak's expense; yet,

 (1.) He boasts of it, as if he had done some mighty thing. The acts of
 devotion which are done in hypocrisy are commonly reflected upon with 
 pride and vain glory. Thus the Pharisee went up to the temple to boast 
 of his religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11,12">Luke xviii. 11, 12</A>.

 (2.) He insists upon it as a reason why God should gratify him in his
 desire to curse Israel, as if now he had made God his debtor, and might 
 draw upon him for what he pleased. He thinks God is so much beholden to 
 him for these sacrifices that the least he can do in recompense for 
 them is to sacrifice his Israel to the malice of the king of Moab. 
 Note, It is a common cheat that wicked people put upon themselves, to 
 think that by the shows of piety they may prevail with God to 
 countenance them, and connive at them, in their greatest immoralities, 
 especially in persecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>.

 However, thought the sacrifice was an abomination, God took the
 occasion of Balaam's expectation to <I>put a word into his mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>for the answer of the tongue if from the Lord,</I> and thus he would 
 show how much those are mistaken who say, <I>With our tongue we will 
 prevail, our lips are our own,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:4">Ps. xii. 4</A>.

 He that made man's mouth knows how to manage it, and to serve his own
 purposes by it. This speaks terror to daring sinners, that <I>set their 
 mouth against the heavens. God can make their own tongues to fall upon 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 And it speaks comfort to God's witnesses, whom at any time he calls out
 to appear for him; if God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, who 
 would have defied God and Israel, surely he will not be wanting to 
 those who desire to glorify God and edify his people by their 
 testimony, but it <I>shall be given them in that same hour what they 
 should speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Balaam pronounces the blessing in the ears of Balak. He found him 
 <I>standing by his burnt-sacrifice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 closely attending it, and earnestly expecting the success. Those that
 wold have an answer of peace from God must abide by the sacrifice, and 
 <I>attend on the Lord without distraction, not weary in well doing.</I> 
 Balaam, having fixed himself in the place appointed for his denouncing 
 curses against Israel, which perhaps he had drawn up in form ready to 
 deliver, takes up his parable, and it proves a blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He pronounces Israel safe and happy, and so blesses them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He pronounces them safe, and out of the reach of his envenomed
 darts. 

 [1.] He owns that the design was to curse them, that Balak sent for him
 out of his own country, and that he came, with that intent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The message sent to him was, <I>Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy 
 Israel.</I> Balak intended to make war upon them, and he would have 
 Balaam to bless his arms, and to prophesy and pray for the ruin of 
 Israel.

 [2.] He owns the design defeated, and his own inability to accomplish
 it. He could not so much as give them an ill word or an ill wish: 
 <I>How shall I curse those whom God has not cursed?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Not that therefore he would not do it, but therefore he could not do 
 it. This is a fair confession, <I>First,</I> Of the weakness and
 impotency of his own magic skill, for which others valued him so much, 
 and doubtless he valued himself no less. He was the most celebrated man 
 of that profession, and yet owns himself baffled. God had warned the 
 Israelites not to use divination 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:31">Lev. xix. 31</A>),

 and this providence gave them a reason for that law, by showing them
 the weakness and folly of it. As they had seen the magicians of Egypt 
 befooled, so, here, the great conjurer of the east. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12-14">Isa. xlvii. 12-14</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is a confession of the sovereignty and dominion of
 the divine power. He owns that he could do no more than God would 
 suffer him to do, for God could overrule all his purposes, and turn his 
 counsels headlong.  <I>Thirdly,</I> It is a confession of the 
 inviolable security of the people of God. Note,

 1. God's Israel are owned and blessed of him. He has not cursed them,
 for they are delivered from the curse of the law; he has not defied 
 them, nor rejected or abandoned them, though mean and vile. 

 2. Those that have the good-will of Heaven have the ill-will of hell; 
 the serpent and this seed have an enmity to them. 

 3. Though the enemies of God's people may prevail far against them, yet
 they cannot curse them; that is, they cannot do them any real mischief, 
 much less a ruining mischief, for they cannot <I>separate them from the 
 love of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:39">Rom. viii. 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He pronounces them happy in three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Happy in their peculiarity, and distinction from the rest of the 
 nations: <I>From the top of the rock I see him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 And it seems to have been a great surprise to him that whereas, it is 
 probable, they were represented to him as a rude and disorderly rabble, 
 that infested the countries round about in rambling parties, he was 
 them a regular incorporated camp, in which appeared all the marks of 
 discipline and good order; he saw them a people dwelling alone, and 
 foresaw they would continue so, and their singularity would be their 
 unspeakable honour.  Persons of quality we call person of 
 <I>distinction;</I> this was Israel's praise, though their enemies 
 turned it to their reproach, that they differed from all the 
 neighbouring nations, not only in their religion and sacred rites, but 
 in their diet, and dress, and common usages, as a people called out of 
 the world, and not to be conformed to it. They never lost their 
 reputation till they <I>mingled among the heathen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:35">Ps. cvi. 35</A>.

 Note, It is the duty and honour of those that are dedicated to God to
 be separated from the world, and not to walk according to the course 
 and custom of it. Those who make conscience of peculiar duties may take 
 the comfort of peculiar privileges, which it is probable Balaam has an 
 eye to here. God's Israel shall not stand upon a level with other 
 nations, but be dignified above them all, as a people near to God, and 
 set apart for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Happy in their numbers, not so few and despicable as they were 
 represented to him, but an innumerable company, which made them both 
 honourable and formidable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Who can count the dust of Jacob?</I> The number of the people was 
 the thing that Balak was vexed at 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:3"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 3</A>):

 <I>Moab was afraid of them, because they were many;</I> and God does
 here by Balaam promote that fear and vexation, foretelling their 
 further increase.  Balak would have him see <I>the utmost part of the 
 people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:41"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 41</A>),

 hoping the more he saw of them the more he would be exasperated against
 them, and throw about his curses with the more keenness and rage; but 
 it proved quite contrary: instead of being angry at their numbers, he 
 admired them. The better acquainted we are with God's people the better 
 opinion we have of them. He takes notice of the number, <I>First,</I> 
 Of the <I>dust of Jacob;</I> that is, the people of Jacob, concerning 
 whom it was foretold that they should be as the dust for number,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:14">Gen. xxviii. 14</A>.

 Thus he owns the fulfilling of the promise made to the fathers, and
 expects that it should be yet further accomplished. Perhaps it was part 
 of David's fault in numbering the people that he offered to count the 
 dust of Jacob, which God had said should be innumerable. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of the <I>fourth part of Israel,</I> alluding to the 
 form of their camp, which was cast into four squadrons, under four 
 standards. Note, God's Israel are a very great body, his spiritual 
 Israel are so, and they will appear to be so when they shall all be 
 gathered together unto him in the great day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Happy in their end: <I>Let me die the death of the righteous</I> 
 Israelites, that are in covenant with God, and let my <I>last end, or 
 future state, be like theirs, or my recompence,</I> namely, in the 
 other world. Here, <I>First,</I> It is taken for granted that death is 
 the end of all men; the righteous themselves must die: and it is good 
 for us to think of this with application, as Balaam himself does here, 
 speaking of his own death. <I>Secondly,</I> he goes upon the 
 supposition of the soul's immortality, and a different state on the 
 other side death, to which this is a noble testimony, and an evidence 
 of its being anciently known and believed. For how could the death of 
 the righteous be more desirable than the death of the wicked upon any 
 other account than as it involved happiness in another world, since in 
 the manner and circumstances of dying we see <I>all things come alike 
 to all? Thirdly,</I> He pronounces the righteous truly blessed, not 
 only while they live, but when they die, which makes their death not 
 only more desirable than the death of others, but even more desirable 
 than life itself; for in that sense his wish may be taken. Not only, 
 "When I do die, let me die the death of the righteous;" but, "I could 
 even now be willing to die, on condition that I might <I>die the death 
 of the righteous,</I> and reach my end this moment, provided it might 
 be like his." Very near the place where Balaam now was, on one of the 
 mountains of Moab, not long after this, Moses died, and to that perhaps 
 God, who put this word into his mouth, designed it should have a 
 reference, that by it Moses might be encouraged to go up and die such a 
 death as Balaam himself wished to die. <I>Fourthly,</I> He shows his 
 opinion of religion to be better than his resolution; there are many 
 who desire to die the death of the righteous, but do not endeavour to 
 live the life of the righteous. Gladly would they have their end like 
 theirs, but not their way. They would be saints in heaven, but not 
 saints on earth. This is the <I>desire of the slothful, which kills 
 him, because his hands refuse to labour.</I> This of Balaam's is only a 
 wish, not a prayer, and it is a vain wish, being only a wish for the 
 end, without any care for the means. Thus far this blessing goes, even 
 to death, and beyond it, as far as the last end. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are told, 

 1. How Balak fretted at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He pretended to honour the Lord with his sacrifices, and to wait for 
 the answer God would send him; and yet, when it did not prove according 
 to his mind, he forgot God, and flew into a great passion against 
 Balaam, as if it had been purely his doing: "<I>What hast thou done 
 unto me!</I> How hast thou disappointed me!" Sometimes God makes the 
 enemies of his church a vexation one to another, while he that sits in 
 heaven laughs at them, and the efforts of their impotent malice.

 2. How Balaam was forced to acquiesce in it. He submits because he
 cannot help it, and yet humours the thing with no small address, as if 
 he had been peculiarly conscientious, answering Balak with the gravity 
 of a prophet: <I>Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord has 
 put in my mouth?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Thus a confession of God's overruling power is extorted from a wicked 
 prophet, to the further confusion of a wicked prince.</P>

 13 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
 another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see
 but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and
 curse me them from thence.
 14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
 Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram
 on <I>every</I> altar.
 15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
 while I meet <I>the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT></I> yonder.
 16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
 said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
 17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
 offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto
 him, What hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spoken?
 18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
 hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
 19 God <I>is</I> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of
 man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do
 <I>it?</I> or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
 20 Behold, I have received <I>commandment</I> to bless: and he hath
 blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
 21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
 perverseness in Israel: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God <I>is</I> with him, and the
 shout of a king <I>is</I> among them.

 23 Surely <I>there is</I> no enchantment against Jacob, neither <I>is
 there</I> any divination against Israel: according to this time it
 shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
 24 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift
 up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat
 <I>of</I> the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
 25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
 bless them at all.
 26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
 saying, All that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> speaketh, that I must do?
 27 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
 thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
 thou mayest curse me them from thence.
 28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
 toward Jeshimon.
 29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
 prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
 30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and
 a ram on <I>every</I> altar.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Preparation made the second time, as before, for the cursing of 
 Israel.

 1. The place is changed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Balak fancied that Balaam, having so full a prospect of the whole camp 
 of Israel, <I>from the top of the rocks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 was either so enamoured with the beauty of it that he would not curse 
 them or so affrighted with the terror of it that he durst not; and 
 therefore he would bring him to another place, form which he might see 
 only some part of them, which would appear more despicable, and that 
 part at least which would lie in view he hoped he might obtain leave to 
 curse, and so by degrees he should get ground against them, intending, 
 no doubt, if he had gained this point, to make his attack on that part 
 of the camp of Israel which Balaam now had in his eye, and into which 
 he was to throw the fireballs of his curses.  See how restless and 
 unwearied the church's enemies are in their malicious attempts to ruin 
 it; they leave no stone unturned, no project untried, to compass it. O 
 that we were as full of contrivance and resolution in prosecuting good 
 designs for the glory of God!

 2. The sacrifices are repeated, new altars are built, a bullock and a 
 ram offered on every altar, and Balak attends his sacrifice as closely 
 as ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Were we thus earnest to obtain the blessing as Balak was to procure a 
 curse (designedly upon Israel, but really upon himself and his people), 
 we should not grudge the return both of the charge and of the labour of 
 religious exercises.

 3. Balaam renews his attendance on God, and God meets him the second
 time, and puts another word into his mouth, not to reverse the former, 
 but to ratify it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 If God said not to Balaam, <I>Seek in vain,</I> much less will he say 
 so to <I>any of the seed of Jacob,</I> who shall surely find him, not 
 only as Balaam, their instructor and oracle, but their bountiful 
 rewarder. When Balaam returned Balak was impatient to know what message 
 he had: "<I>What hath the Lord spoken?</I> Are there any better tidings 
 yet, any hopes of speeding?" This should be our enquiry when we come to 
 hear the word of God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:35">Jer. xxiii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A second conversion of the curse into a blessing by the overruling 
 power of God; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the 
 former, and quite cuts off all hopes of altering it. Balak having been 
 so forward to ask what the Lord had spoken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 Balaam now addresses himself particularly to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Rise up, Balak, and hear.</I> It was a message from God that he had 
 to deliver, and it is required of Balak, though a king, that he attend 
 (<I>hear</I> and <I>hearken,</I> with a close application of mind, let 
 not a word slip), and also that he attend with reverence: <I>Rise up, 
 and hear.</I> His successor Eglon, when he was to receive a message 
 from God, <I>rose out of his seat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:20">Judg. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Two things Balaam in this discourse informs Balak of, sorely to his 
 grief and disappointment:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he had no reason to hope that he should ruin Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It would be to no purpose to attempt to ruin them, and he would 
 deceive himself if he expected it, for three reasons:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Because God is unchangeable: <I>God is not a man that he 
 should lie,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Men change their minds, and therefore break their words; they lie, 
 because they repent. But God does neither. He never changes his mind, 
 and therefore never recalls his promise. Balaam had owned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that he could not alter God's counsel, and thence he infers here that 
 God himself would not alter it; such is the imperfection of man, and 
 such the perfection of God. It is impossible for God to lie, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:18">Heb. vi. 18</A>.

 And, when in scripture he is said to <I>repent,</I> it is not meant of
 any change of his mind (for <I>he is in one mind, and who can turn 
 him?</I>) but only of the change of his way. This is a great truth, 
 that with God there is no <I>variableness nor shadow of turning.</I> 
 Now here,

 1. He appeals to Balak himself concerning it: "<I>Hath he said, and
 shall he not do it?</I> Said it in his own purpose, and shall he not 
 perform it in his providence, according to the counsel of his will? 
 Hath he spoken in his word, in his promise, and shall he not make it 
 good? Can we think otherwise of God than that he is unchangeably one 
 with himself and true to his word? All his decrees are unalterable,
 and all his promises inviolable." 

 2. He applies this general truth to the case in hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>He hath blessed and I cannot reverse it,</I> that is, "I cannot 
 prevail with him to reverse it." Israel were of old a blessed people, a 
 seed that the Lord had blessed; the blessing of Abraham came upon them; 
 they were born under the blessing of the covenant, and born to the 
 blessing of Canaan, and therefore they could not be cursed, unless you 
 could suppose that the God of eternal truth should break his word, and 
 become false to himself and his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Because Israel are at present unblamable: <I>he has 
 not beheld iniquity in Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Not but that there was iniquity in Jacob, and God saw it; but,

 1. There was not such a degree of iniquity as might provoke God to
 abandon them and give them up to ruin. As bad as they were, they were 
 not so bad as this. 

 2. There was no idolatry among them, which is in a particular manner 
 called iniquity and perverseness; we have found nothing of that kind in 
 Israel since the golden calf, and therefore, though they were in other 
 instances very provoking, yet God would not cast them off. Balaam knew 
 that nothing would separate between them and God but sin. While God saw 
 no reigning sin among them, he would send no destroying curse among 
 them; and therefore, as long as they kept in with God, he despaired of 
 ever doing them any mischief. Note, While we keep from sin we keep from 
 harm. Some give another sense of those words; they read it thus: <I>He 
 has not beheld wrong offered to Jacob, nor will he see any grievance 
 done to Israel,</I> that is, "He has not nor will he permit it, or 
 allow it; he will not see Israel injured, but he will right them, and 
 avenge their quarrel." Note, God will not bear to see any injury done 
 to his church and people; for what is done against them he takes as 
 done against himself, and will reckon for it accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Because the power of both was irresistible. He shows 
 Balak that there was no contending with them, it was to no purpose to 
 attempt it; for, 

 1. They had the presence of God with them: "<I>The Lord his God is with
 him</I> in a particular manner, and not provoked to withdraw from him." 
 
 2. They had the joy of that presence, and were always made to triumph 
 in it: <I>The shout</I> or alarm <I>of a king is among them.</I> They 
 shout against their enemies, as sure of victory and success, glorying 
 continually in God as their King and conqueror for them. 

 3. They had had the experience of the benefit of God's presence with
 them, and his power engaged for them; for God <I>brought them out of 
 Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The power which had done that could never be restrained, never 
 resisted; and, having begun so gloriously, he would no doubt finish 
 gloriously.

 4. While they had God's presence with them they had the strength of a
 unicorn, able to make head against all that opposed them. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:8"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 8</A>.

 Such is the strength which the God of Israel gives unto his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] From all this he infers that it was to no purpose for him to think 
 of doing them a mischief by all the arts he could use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 <I>First,</I> He owns himself baffled. Surely there is no enchantment 
 against Jacob so as to prevail. The curses of hell can never take place 
 against the blessings of heaven. Not but that attempts of this kind 
 would be made, but they would certainly be fruitless and ineffectual. 
 Some observe that <I>Jacob</I> denotes the church low and afflicted, 
 <I>Israel</I> denotes it prosperous and advanced; but be the church 
 high or low, be her friends few or many, let second causes smile or 
 frown, it comes all to one: no weapon formed against it shall prosper. 
 Note, God easily can, and certainly will, baffle and disappoint all the 
 devices and designs of the powers of darkness against his church, so 
 that they shall not prevail to destroy it. <I>Secondly,</I> He foresees 
 that this would be remembered in time to come. <I>According to this 
 time,</I> that is, with reference to this we are now about, it shall be 
 said concerning Jacob and Israel, and said by them, <I>What hath God 
 wrought!</I> What great things hath God done for his people! It shall 
 be said with wonder, joy, and thankfulness, and a challenge to the 
 neighbouring nations to produce any similar instances of the care of 
 their gods for them. Note, The defeating of the designs of the church's 
 enemies ought to be had in everlasting remembrance to the glory of God. 
 <I>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun.</I> What Balaam says 
 here concerning the pre-eminence of the God of Israel above all the 
 gods of the Gentiles perhaps Moses refers to when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:31">Deut. xxxii. 31</A>),

 <I>Their rock is not as our rock, even our enemies themselves being
 judges,</I> Balaam particularly. Balak therefore has no hopes of 
 ruining Israel. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Balaam shows him that he had more reason to fear being ruined by 
 them, for they were likely to make bloody work among his neighbours; 
 and, if he and his country escaped, it was not because he was too great 
 for them to meddle with, but because he fell not within their 
 commission 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Behold, and tremble; the people that now have lain for some time 
 closely encamped do but repose themselves for a while like a lion 
 couchant, but shortly they <I>shall rise up as a great lion,</I> a lion 
 rampant, that <I>shall not lie down till he eat of the prey, and drink 
 the blood of the slain.</I> This seems to point at the victories he 
 foresaw they would obtain over the Canaanites, that they would never 
 lay down their arms till they had made a complete conquest of the land 
 they had now in view; and, when his neighbour's house was on fire, he 
 had reason to think his own in danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now what was the issue of this disappointment?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Balak and Balaam were both of them sick of the cause. 

 [1.] Balak is now willing to have his conjurer silenced. Since he
 cannot say what he would have him, he wishes him to say nothing: 
 "<I>Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If thou canst not curse them, I beseech thee not to bless them. If 
 thou canst no assist and encourage my forces, yet do not oppose and 
 dispirit them" Note, God can make those that depart from him weary of 
 the <I>multitude of their counsels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:13,57:10">Isa. xlvii. 13; lvii. 10</A>.

 [2.] Balaam is still willing to own himself overruled, and appeals to
 what he had said in the beginning of this enterprise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:38"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 38</A>):

 <I>All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 This sows, <I>First,</I> In general, that the way of man is not in 
 himself; there are many devices in man's heart, but God's counsels 
 shall stand. <I>Secondly,</I> In particular, that, as no weapon formed
 against the church shall prosper, so every tongue that rises against 
 her in judgment god will control and condemn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:17">Isa. liv. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet they resolve to make another attempt. They think it scorn to 
 be baffled, and therefore pursue the design, though it be only to their 
 further confusion. And now the third time, 

 [1.] They change the place. Balak is at last convinced that it is not
 Balaam's fault, on whom, before, he had laid the blame, but that really 
 he was under a divine check, and therefore now he hopes to bring him to 
 a place whence God might at least permit him to curse them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 Probably he and Balaam were the more encouraged thus to repeat their 
 attempt because God had the second time allowed Balaam to go, though he 
 had forbidden him the first time. Since by repeated trials they had 
 carried that point, they hope in like manner to carry this. Thus 
 because sinners are borne with, and sentence against their evil works 
 is not executed speedily, their hearts are the more fully set in them 
 to do evil. The place to which Balak now took Balaam was the top of 
 Peor, the most eminent high place in all his country, where, it is 
 probable, Baal was worshipped, and it was thence called 
 <I>Baal-peor.</I> He chose this place with a hope, either, 
 <I>First,</I> That it being the residence (as he fancied) of Baal, the 
 god of Moab, Jehovah the God of Israel would not, or could not, come 
 hither to hinder the operation; or, <I>Secondly,</I> That, it being a 
 place acceptable to his god, it would be so to the Lord, and there he 
 would be brought into a good humour. Such idle conceits have foolish 
 men of God, and so vain are their imaginations concerning him. Thus
 the Syrians fancied the Lord to be God of the hills, but not of the 
 valleys 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:28">1 Kings xx. 28</A>),

 as if he were more powerful in one place than he is in every place.

 [2.] They repeat their sacrifice, seven bullocks and seven rams, upon
 seven altars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 Thus do they persevere in their expensive oblations, though they had no 
 promise on which to build their hopes of speeding. Let not us 
 therefore, who have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak 
 and not lie, be discouraged by delays, but continue instant in prayer, 
 and not faint, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1">Luke xviii. 1</A>.</P>
