 Much ado there was to bring Moses to his work, and when the ice was
 broken, some difficulty having occurred in carrying it on, there was no
 less ado to put him forward in it. Witness this chapter, in which, 

 I. God satisfies Moses himself in an answer to his complaints in the
 close of the foregoing chapter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He gives him fuller instructions than had yet been given him what
 to say to the children of Israel, for their satisfaction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>),

 but to little purpose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:9">ver. 9</A>.

 III. He sends him again to Pharaoh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.
 
 But Moses objects against

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:12">ver. 12</A>),

 upon which a very strict charge is given to him and his brother to
 execute their commission with vigour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:13">ver. 13</A>.

 IV. Here is an abstract of the genealogy of the tribes of Reuben and
 Simeon, to introduce that of Levi, that the pedigree of Moses and Aaron
 might be cleared

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:14-25">ver. 14-25</A>),

 and then the chapter concludes with a repetition of so much of the
 preceding story as was necessary to make way for the following
 chapter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
 do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and
 with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
 &nbsp; 2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
 <I>the name of</I> God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
 known to them.
 &nbsp; 4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
 them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
 they were strangers.
 &nbsp; 5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
 whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
 covenant.
 &nbsp; 6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
 and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
 with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:
 &nbsp; 7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you
 a God: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, which
 bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
 &nbsp; 8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
 did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
 will give it you for an heritage: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
 hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
 bondage.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God silences Moses's complaints with the assurance of success in 
 this negotiation, repeating the promise made him in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:20"><I>ch.</I> iii. 20</A>,

 <I>After that, he will let you go.</I> When Moses was at his wit's end,
 wishing he had staid in Midian, rather than have come to Egypt to make
 bad worse--when he was quite at a loss what to do--<I>Then the Lord
 said unto Moses,</I> for the quieting of his mind, "<I>Now shalt thou 
 see what I will do to Pharaoh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 now that the affair has come to a crisis, things are as bad as they can 
 be, Pharaoh is in the height of pride and Israel in the depth of 
 misery, now is my time to appear." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5">Ps. xii. 5</A>,

 <I>Now will I arise.</I> Note, Man's extremity is God's opportunity of
 helping and saving. Moses had been expecting what God would do; but now 
 he shall see what he will do, shall see his day at length,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:1">Job xxiv. 1</A>.

 Moses had been trying what he could do, and could effect nothing.
 "Well," says God, "now thou shalt see what <I>I</I> will do; let me 
 alone to deal with this proud man,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12,13">Job xl. 12, 13</A>.

 Note, Then the deliverance of God's church will be accomplished, when
 God takes the work into his own hands. <I>With a strong hand,</I> that 
 is, being forced to it by a strong hand, <I>he shall let them go.</I> 
 Note, As some are brought to their duty by the strong hand of God's 
 grace, who are made willing in the day of his power, so others by the 
 strong hand of his justice, breaking those that would not bend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives him further instructions, that both he and the people of 
 Israel might be encouraged to hope for a glorious issue of this affair. 
 Take comfort,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From God's name, Jehovah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He begins with this, <I>I am Jehovah,</I> the same with, <I>I am that
 I am,</I> the fountain of being, and blessedness, and infinite 
 perfection. The patriarchs knew this name, but they did not know him in 
 this matter by that which this name signifies. God would now be known 
 by his name <I>Jehovah,</I> that is, 

 (1.) A God performing what he had promised, and so inspiring confidence 
 in his promises. 

 (2.) A God perfecting what he had begun, and finishing his own work.  
 In the history of the creation, God is never called Jehovah till the 
 heavens and the earth were finished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:4">Gen. ii. 4</A>.

 When the salvation of the saints is completed in eternal life, then he
 will be known by his name Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:13">Rev. xxii. 13</A>);

 in the mean time they shall find him, for their strength and support,
 <I>El-shaddai, a God all-sufficient,</I> a God that is enough and will 
 be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:20">Mic. vii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From his covenant: <I>I have established my covenant,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, The covenants God makes he establishes; they are made as firm as 
 the power and truth of God can make them. We may venture our all upon 
 this bottom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. From his compassions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel;</I> he means 
 their groaning on occasion of the late hardships put upon them. Note, 
 God takes notice of the increase of his people's calamities, and
 observes how their enemies grow upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. From his present resolutions,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Here is line upon line, to assure them that they should be brought 
 triumphantly out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and should be put in possession of the land of Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I will bring you out. I will rid you. I will redeem you. I will 
 bring you into the land of Canaan,</I> and <I>I will give it to 
 you.</I> Let man take the shame of his unbelief, which needs such 
 repetitions; and let God have the glory of his condescending grace, 
 which gives us such repeated assurances for our satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. From his gracious intentions in all these, which were great, and 
 worthy of him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 (1.) He intended their happiness: <I>I will take you to me for a 
 people,</I> a peculiar people, and <I>I will be to you a God;</I> more 
 than this we need not ask, we cannot have, to make us happy. 

 (2.) He intended his own glory: <I>You shall know that I am the 
 Lord.</I> God will attain his own ends, nor shall we come short of them 
 if we make them our chief end too. Now, one would think, these good 
 words, and comfortable words, should have revived the drooping 
 Israelites, and cause them to forget their misery; but, on the 
 contrary, their miseries made them regardless of God's promises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>They harkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit.</I> That is,

 [1.] They were so taken up with their troubles that they did not heed 
 him. 

 [2.] They were so cast down with their late disappointment that they 
 did not believe him. 

 [3.] They had such a dread of Pharaoh's power and wrath that they durst
 not themselves move in the least towards their deliverance. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> Disconsolate spirits often put from them the comforts 
 they are entitled to, and stand in their own light.  See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:12">Isa. xxviii. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Strong passions oppose strong consolations. By 
 indulging ourselves in discontent and fretfulness, we deprive ourselves 
 of the comfort we might have both from God's word and from his 
 providence, and must thank ourselves if we go comfortless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
 children of Israel go out of his land.
 &nbsp; 12 And Moses spake before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Behold, the
 children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall
 Pharaoh hear me, who <I>am</I> of uncircumcised lips?
 &nbsp; 13 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them
 a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
 Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. God sends Moses the second time to Pharaoh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 upon the same errand as before, to command him, at his peril, that he 
 <I>let the children of Israel go.</I> Note, God repeats his precepts 
 before he begins his punishments. Those that have often been called in 
 vain to leave their sins must yet be called again and again, whether 
 they will hear or whether they will forbear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1">Ezek. iii. 11</A>.

 God is said to <I>hew</I> sinners by his prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:5">Hos. vi. 5</A>),

 which denotes the repetition of the strokes.  <I>How often would I have
 gathered you?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Moses makes objections, as one discouraged, and willing to give up 
 the cause,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
  
 He pleads,
 
 1. The unlikelihood of Pharaoh's hearing: "<I>Behold the children of
 Israel have not hearkened unto me;</I> they give no heed, no credit, to 
 what I have said; how then can I expect that Pharaoh should hear me? If 
 the anguish of their spirit makes them deaf to that which would compose 
 and comfort them, much more will the anger of his spirit, his pride and 
 insolence, make him deaf to that which will but exasperate and provoke 
 him." If God's professing people hear not his messengers, how can it be 
 thought that his professed enemy should? Note, The frowardness and 
 untractableness of those that are called Christians greatly discourage 
 ministers, and make them ready to despair of success in dealing with 
 those that are atheistical and profane. We would be instrumental to 
 unite Israelites, to refine and purify them, to comfort and pacify 
 them; but, if they hearken not to us, how shall we prevail with those 
 in whom we cannot pretend to such an interest? But with God all things 
 are possible. 

 2. He pleads the unreadiness and infirmity of his own speaking: <I>I am 
 of uncircumcised lips;</I> it is repeated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He was conscious to himself that he had not the gift of utterance, had 
 no command of language; his talent did not lie that way. To this 
 objection God had given a sufficient answer before, and therefore he 
 ought not to have insisted upon it, for the sufficiency of grace can 
 supply the defects of nature at any time.  Note, Though our infirmities 
 ought to humble us, yet they ought not to discourage us from doing our 
 best in any service we have to do for God.  His strength is made 
 perfect in our weakness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God again joins Aaron in commission with Moses, and puts an end to 
 the dispute by interposing his own authority, and giving them both a 
 solemn charge, upon their allegiance to their great Lord, to execute it 
 with all possible expedition and fidelity. When Moses repeats his 
 baffled arguments, he shall be argued with no longer, but God gives him 
 a charge, and Aaron with him, both to the children of Israel and to 
 Pharaoh,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, God's authority is sufficient to answer all objections, and binds 
 us to obedience, without murmuring or disputing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:14">Phil. ii. 14</A>.

 Moses himself has need to be charged, and so has Timothy,

 I. We have here a genealogy, not an endless one, such as the apostle 
 condemns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:4">1 Tim. i. 4</A>),

 for it ends in those two great patriots Moses and Aaron, and comes in
 here to show that they were Israelites, bone of their bone and flesh of
 their flesh whom they were sent to deliver, raised up unto them of
 their brethren, as Christ also should be, who was to be the prophet and
 priest, the Redeemer and lawgiver, of the people of Israel, and whose
 genealogy also, like this, was to be carefully preserved. The heads of
 the houses of three of the tribes are here named, agreeing with the
 accounts we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:1-34">Gen. 46</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot thinks that Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, are thus dignified 
 here by themselves for this reason, because they were left under marks 
 of infamy by their dying father, Reuben for his incest and Simeon and 
 Levi for their murder of the Shechemites; and therefore Moses would put 
 this particular honour upon them, to magnify God's mercy in their 
 repentance and remission, as a pattern to those that should afterwards 
 believe: the two former seem rather to be mentioned only for the sake 
 of a third, which was Levi, from whom Moses and Aaron descended, and 
 all the priests of the Jewish church. Thus was the tribe of Levi 
 distinguished betimes. Observe here, 

 1. That Kohath, from whom Moses and Aaron, and all the priests,
 derived their pedigree, was a younger son of Levi,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, The grants of God's favours do not go by seniority of age and 
 priority of birth, but the divine sovereignty often prefers the younger 
 before the elder, so crossing hands. 

 2. That the ages of Levi, Kohath, and Amram, the father, grandfather, 
 and great grandfather, of Moses, are here recorded; they all lived to a 
 great age, Levi to 137, Kohath to 133, and Amram to 137. Moses himself 
 came much short of them, and fixed seventy or eighty for the ordinary 
 stretch of human life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>);

 for now that God's Israel was multiplied and had become a great nation,
 and divine revelation was by the hand of Moses committed to writing and 
 no longer trusted to tradition, the two great reasons for the long 
 lives of the patriarchs had ceased, and therefore henceforward fewer 
 years must serve men. 

 3. That Aaron married Elisheba (the same name with that of the wife of 
 Zecharias, Elizabeth, as Miriam is the same with Mary), daughter of 
 Amminadab, one of the chief of the fathers of the tribe of Judah; for 
 the tribes of Levi and Judah often intermarried,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 4. It must not be omitted that Moses has recorded the marriage of his 
 father Amram with Jochebed his own aunt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 and it appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:59">Num. xxvi. 59</A>

 that it must be taken strictly for his father's own sister, at least by
 the half blood. This marriage was afterwards forbidden as incestuous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:12">Lev. xviii. 12</A>),

 which might be looked upon as a blot upon his family, though before
 that law; yet Moses does not conceal it, for he sought not his own 
 praise, but wrote with a sincere regard to truth, whether it smiled or 
 frowned upon him. 

 5. He concludes it with a particular mark of honour on the persons he 
 is writing of, though he himself was one of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 These are <I>that Moses and Aaron</I> whom God pitched upon to be his 
 plenipotentiaries in this treaty. These were those to whom <I>God 
 spoke</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 and who <I>spoke to Pharaoh</I> on Israel's behalf,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Note, Communion with God and serviceableness to his church are things 
 that, above any other, put true honour upon men. Those are great indeed 
 with whom God converses and whom he employs on his service. Such were 
 that Moses and Aaron; and something of this honour have all his saints, 
 who are made to our God kings and priests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the close of the chapter Moses returns to his narrative, from 
 which he had broken off somewhat abruptly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and repeats, 

 1. The charge God had given him to deliver his message to Pharaoh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Speak all that I say unto thee,</I> as a faithful ambassador. Note,
 Those that go on God's errand must not shun to declare <I>the whole 
 counsel of God.</I> 
 
 2. His objection against it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Note, Those that have at any time spoken unadvisedly with their lips
 ought often to reflect upon it with regret, as Moses seems to do 
 here.</P>
