 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
 forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they <I>into</I> the
 wilderness of Sinai.
 &nbsp; 2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come <I>to</I> the
 desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
 Israel camped before the mount.
 &nbsp; 3 And Moses went up unto God, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called unto him out
 of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
 Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
 &nbsp; 4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and <I>how</I> I bare
 you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
 &nbsp; 5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
 covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
 people: for all the earth <I>is</I> mine:
 &nbsp; 6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
 nation. These <I>are</I> the words which thou shalt speak unto the
 children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
 laid before their faces all these words which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded
 him.
 &nbsp; 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the
 people unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The date of that great charter by which Israel was incorporated. 

 1. The time when it bears date

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)--<I>in

 the third month</I> after they came out of Egypt. It is computed that 
 the law was given just fifty days after their coming out of Egypt, in 
 remembrance of which the feast of Pentecost was observed the fiftieth 
 day after the passover, and in compliance with which the Spirit was 
 poured out upon the apostles at the feast of pentecost, fifty days 
 after the death of Christ. In Egypt they had spoken of a three days' 
 journey into the wilderness to the place of their sacrifice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:3"><I>ch.</I> v. 3</A>),

 but it proved to be almost a two months' journey; so often are we out 
 in the calculation of times, and things prove longer in the doing than 
 we expected. 

 2.  The place whence it bears date--from <I>Mount Sinai,</I> a place 
 which nature, not art, had made eminent and conspicuous, for it was the 
 highest in all that range of mountains.  Thus God put contempt upon 
 cities, and palaces, and magnificent structures, setting up his 
 pavilion on the top of a high mountain, in a waste and barren desert, 
 there to carry on this treaty. It is called <I>Sinai,</I> from the 
 multitude of thorny bushes that overspread it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The charter itself. Moses was called up the mountain (on the top of 
 which God had pitched his tent, and at the foot of which Israel had 
 pitched theirs), and was employed as the mediator, or rather no more 
 than the messenger of the covenant: <I>Thus shalt thou say to the house 
 of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Here the learned bishop Patrick observes that the people are called by 
 the names both of <I>Jacob</I> and <I>Israel,</I> to remind them that 
 those who had lately been as low as Jacob when he went to Padan-aram 
 had now grown as great as God made him when he came thence (justly 
 enriched with the spoils of him that had oppressed him) and was called 
 <I>Israel.</I> Now observe, 

 1. That the maker, and first mover, of the covenant, is God himself. 
 Nothing was said nor done by this stupid unthinking people themselves 
 towards this settlement; no motion made, no petition put up for God's 
 favour, but this blessed charter was granted <I>ex mero motu--purely 
 out of God's own good-will.</I> Note, In all our dealings with God, 
 free grace anticipates us with the blessings of goodness, and all our 
 comfort is owing, not to our knowing God, but rather to our being 
 <I>known of him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>.

 <I>We love him,</I> visit him, and covenant with him, <I>because he
 first loved us,</I> visited us, and covenanted with us. God is the 
 Alpha, and therefore must be the Omega.  

 2. That the matter of the covenant is not only just and 
 unexceptionable, and such as puts no hardship upon them, but kind and 
 gracious, and such as gives them the greatest privileges and advantages 
 imaginable.

 (1.) He reminds them of what he had done for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He had righted them, and avenged them upon their persecutors and 
 oppressors: "<I>You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians,</I> how 
 many lives were sacrificed to Israel's honour and interests:" He had 
 given them unparalleled instances of his favour to them, and his care 
 of them: <I>I bore you on eagles' wings,</I> a high expression of the 
 wonderful tenderness God had shown for them. It is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11,12">Deut. xxxii. 11, 12</A>.

 It denotes great speed. God not only came upon the wing for their
 deliverance (when the set time was come, he rode on a cherub, and did 
 fly), but he hastened them out, as it were, upon the wing. He did it 
 also with great ease, with the strength as well as with the swiftness 
 of an eagle: those that faint not, nor are weary, are said to <I>mount 
 up with wings as eagles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:31">Isa. xl. 31</A>.

 Especially, it denotes God's particular care of them and affection to
 them. Even Egypt, that iron furnace, was the nest in which these young 
 ones were hatched, where they were first formed as the embryo of a 
 nation; when, by the increase of their numbers, they grew to some 
 maturity, they were carried out of that nest. Other birds carry their 
 young in their talons, but the eagle (they say) upon her wings, so that 
 even those archers who shoot flying cannot hurt the young ones, unless 
 they first shoot through the old one. Thus, in the Red Sea, the pillar 
 of cloud and fire, the token of God's presence, interposed itself 
 between the Israelites and their pursuers (lines of defence which could 
 not be forced, a wall which could not be penetrated): yet this was not 
 all; their way so paved, so guarded, was glorious, but their end much 
 more so: <I>I brought you unto myself.</I> They were brought not only 
 into a state of liberty and honour, but into covenant and communion 
 with God.  This, this was the glory of their deliverance, as it is of 
 ours by Christ, that he died, <I>the just for the unjust, that he might 
 bring us to God.</I> This God aims at in all the gracious methods of 
 his providence and grace, to bring us back to himself, from whom we 
 have revolted, and to bring us home to himself, in whom alone we can be 
 happy. He appeals to themselves, and their own observation and 
 experience, for the truth of what is here insisted on: <I>You have seen 
 what I did;</I> so that they could not disbelieve God, unless they 
 would first disbelieve their own eyes. They saw how all that was done 
 was purely the Lord's doing. It was not they that reached towards God, 
 but it was he that brought them to himself. Some have well observed 
 that the <I>Old-Testament church</I> is said to be borne upon eagles' 
 wings, denoting the power of that dispensation, which was carried on 
 with <I>a high hand an out-stretched arm;</I> but the <I>New-Testament 
 church</I> is said to be gathered by the Lord Jesus, <I>as a hen 
 gathers her chickens under her wings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>),

 denoting the grace and compassion of that dispensation, and the
 admirable condescension and humiliation of the Redeemer. 

 (2.) He tells them plainly what he expected and required from them in
 one word, obedience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that they should <I>obey his voice indeed and keep his covenant.</I> 
 Being thus saved by him, that which he insisted upon was that they 
 should be ruled by him. The reasonableness of this demand is, long 
 after, pleaded with them, that <I>in the day he brought them out of the 
 land of Egypt</I> this was the condition of the covenant, <I>Obey my 
 voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:23">Jer. vii. 23</A>);

 and this he is said to protest earnestly to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:4,7">Jer. xi. 4, 7</A>. 

 Only obey <I>indeed,</I> not in profession and promise only, not in
 pretence, but in sincerity. God had shown them real favours, and 
 therefore required real obedience. 

 (3.) He assures them of the honour he would put upon them, and the
 kindness he would show them, in case they did thus keep his covenant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>Then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me.</I> He does not specify 
 any one particular favour, as giving them the land of Canaan, or the 
 like, but expresses it in that which was inclusive of all happiness, 
 that he would be to them a God in covenant, and they should be to him a 
 people.  

 [1.] God here asserts his sovereignty over, and propriety in, the whole
 visible creation: <I>All the earth is mine.</I> Therefore he needed 
 them not; he that had so vast a dominion was great enough, and happy 
 enough, without concerning himself for so small a demesne as Israel 
 was. All nations on the earth being his, he might choose which he 
 pleased for his peculiar, and act in a way of sovereignty. 

 [2.] He appropriates Israel to himself, <I>First,</I> As a people dear
 unto him. <I>You shall be a peculiar treasure;</I> not that God was 
 enriched by them, as a man is by his treasure, but he was pleased to 
 value and esteem them as a man does his treasure; they were <I>precious 
 in his sight and honourable</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>);

 he <I>set his love upon them</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7">Deut. vii. 7</A>),

 took them under his special care and protection, as a treasure that is
 kept under lock and key. He looked upon the rest of the world but as 
 trash and lumber in comparison with them. By giving them divine 
 revelation, instituted ordinances, and promises inclusive of eternal 
 life, by sending his prophets among them, and pouring out his Spirit 
 upon them, he distinguished them from, and dignified them above, all 
 people. And this honour have all the saints; they are unto God a 
 <I>peculiar people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:4">Tit. ii. 14</A>),

 his when he <I>makes up his jewels.  Secondly,</I> As a people devoted
 to him, to his honour and service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a <I>kingdom of priests,</I> a <I>holy nation.</I> All the Israelites, 
 if compared with other people, were priests unto God, so near were they 
 to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:14">Ps. cxlviii. 14</A>),

 so much employed in his immediate service, and such intimate communion
 they had with him. When they were first made a free people it was that 
 they might <I>sacrifice to the Lord their God,</I> as <I>priests;</I> 
 they were under God's immediate government, and the tendency of the 
 laws given them was to distinguish them from others, and engage them 
 for God as a holy nation.  Thus all believers are, through Christ, made 
 to our God kings and priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>),

 <I>a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Israel's acceptance of this charter, and consent to the conditions 
 of it. 

 1. Moses faithfully delivered God's message to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 He <I>laid before their faces all those words;</I> he not only 
 explained to them what God had given him in charge, but he put it to 
 their choice whether they would accept these promises upon these terms 
 or no. His laying it to their faces denotes his laying it to their 
 consciences. 

 2.  They readily agreed to the covenant proposed. They would oblige 
 themselves to obey the voice of God, and take it as a great favour to 
 be made a kingdom of priests to him. They answered together as one man, 
 <I>nemine contradicente--without a dissentient voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.</I> Thus they strike the 
 bargain, accepting the Lord to be to them a God, and giving up 
 themselves to be to him a people. O that there had been such a heart in 
 them! 

 3. Moses, as a mediator, returned the words of the people to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Thus Christ, the Mediator between us and God, as a prophet reveals 
 God's will to us, his precepts and promises, and then as a priest 
 offers up to God our spiritual sacrifices, not only of prayer and 
 praise, but of devout affections and pious resolutions, the work of his 
 own Spirit in us. Thus he is that blessed <I>days-man who lays his hand 
 upon us both.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
 cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
 believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and
 sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their
 clothes,
 &nbsp; 11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
 Sinai.
 &nbsp; 12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about,
 saying, Take heed to yourselves, <I>that ye</I> go <I>not</I> up into the
 mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount
 shall be surely put to death:
 &nbsp; 13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
 stoned, or shot through; whether <I>it be</I> beast or man, it shall
 not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to
 the mount.
 &nbsp; 14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
 sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
 &nbsp; 15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
 come not at <I>your</I> wives.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. God intimates to Moses his purpose of coming down upon mount Sinai, 
 in some visible appearance of his glory, in <I>a thick cloud</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 for he said that he would <I>dwell in the thick darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:1">2 Chron. vi. 1</A>),

 and make this his pavilion
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:11">Ps. xviii. 11</A>),

 <I>holding back the face of his throne</I> when he set it upon <I>mount
 Sinai, and spreading a cloud upon it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:9">Job xxvi. 9</A>.

 This thick cloud was to prohibit curious enquiries into things secret,
 and to command an awful adoration of that which was revealed. God would 
 come down <I>in the sight of all the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 though they should see no manner of similitude, yet they should see so 
 much as would convince them that God was among them of a truth. And so 
 high was the top of mount Sinai that it is supposed that not only the 
 camp of Israel, but even the countries about, might discern some 
 extraordinary appearance of glory upon it, which would strike a terror 
 upon them. It seems also to have been particularly intended to put an 
 honour upon Moses: <I>That they may hear when I speak with thee, and 
 believe thee for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus the correspondence was to be first settled by a sensible 
 appearance of the divine glory, which was afterwards to be carried on 
 more silently by the ministry of Moses. In like manner, the Holy Ghost 
 descended visibly upon Christ at his baptism, and all that were present 
 heard God speak to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),

 that afterwards, without the repetition of such visible tokens, they
 might believe him. So likewise the Spirit descended in cloven tongues 
 upon the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:3">Acts ii. 3</A>),

 that they might be believed. Observe, When the people had declared
 themselves willing to obey the voice of God, then God promised they 
 should hear his voice; for, if any man be resolved to <I>do his will, 
 he shall know it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He orders Moses to make preparation for this great solemnity, 
 giving him two days' time for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must <I>sanctify the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as Job, before this, sent and <I>sanctified his sons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">Job i. 5</A>.

 He must raise their expectation by giving them notice what God would
 do, and assist their preparation by directing them what they must do.  
 "<I>Sanctify them,</I>" that is, "Call them off from their worldly 
 business, and call them to religious exercises, meditation and prayer, 
 that they may receive the law from God's mouth with reverence and 
 devotion. <I>Let them be ready,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, When we are to attend upon God in solemn ordinances it concerns 
 us to sanctify ourselves, and to get ready beforehand. Wandering 
 thoughts must be gathered in, impure affections abandoned, disquieting 
 passions suppressed, nay, and all cares about secular business, for the 
 present, dismissed and laid by, that our hearts may be <I>engaged to 
 approach unto God.</I> Two things particularly prescribed as signs and 
 instances of their preparation:--

 (1.) In token of their cleansing themselves from all sinful pollutions,
 that they might be holy to God, they must <I>wash their clothes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 and they did so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 not that God regards our clothes; but while they were washing their 
 clothes he would have them think of washing their souls by repentance 
 from the sins they had contracted in Egypt and since their deliverance. 
 It becomes us to appear in clean clothes when we wait upon great men; 
 so clean hearts are required in our attendance on the great God, who 
 sees them as plainly as men see our clothes. This is absolutely 
 necessary to our acceptably worshipping God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6,Isa+1:16-18,Heb+10:22">Ps. xxvi. 6; 
 Isa. i. 16-18; Heb. x. 22</A>.

 (2.) In token of their devoting themselves entirely to religious
 exercises, upon this occasion, they must abstain even from lawful 
 enjoyments during these three days, and not <I>come at their wives,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:5">1 Cor. vii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must <I>set bounds about the mountain,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Probably he drew a line, or ditch, round at the foot of the hill, which 
 none were to pass upon pain of death. This was to intimate, 

 (1.) That humble awful reverence which ought to possess the minds of
 all those that worship God. We are mean creatures before a great 
 Creator, vile sinners before a holy righteous Judge; and therefore a 
 godly fear and shame well become us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28,Ps+2:11">Heb. xii. 28; Ps. ii. 11</A>.

 (2.) The distance at which worshippers were kept, under that
 dispensation, which we ought to take notice of, that we may the more

 3. He must order the people to attend upon the summons that should be 
 given

 "<I>When the trumpet soundeth long</I> then let them take their places 
 at the foot of the mount, and so sit down at God's feet," as it is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:3">Deut. xxxiii. 3</A>.

 Never was so great a congregation called together, and preached to, at
 once, as this was here. No one man's voice could have reached so many, 
 but the voice of God did.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
 there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
 mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all
 the people that <I>was</I> in the camp trembled.
 &nbsp; 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
 with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
 &nbsp; 18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the
 smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
 &nbsp; 19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
 louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
 mount: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called Moses <I>up</I> to the top of the mount;
 and Moses went up.
 &nbsp; 21 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people,
 lest they break through unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to gaze, and many of them
 perish.
 &nbsp; 22 And let the priests also, which come near to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 sanctify themselves, lest the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> break forth upon them.
 &nbsp; 23 And Moses said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, The people cannot come up to
 mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the
 mount, and sanctify it.
 &nbsp; 24 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
 shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests
 and the people break through to come up unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, lest he
 break forth upon them.
 &nbsp; 25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, at length, comes that memorable day, that terrible day of the 
 Lord, that day of judgment, in which <I>Israel heard the voice of the 
 Lord God</I> speaking to them <I>out of the midst of the fire, and 
 lived,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33">Deut. iv. 33</A>.

 Never was there such a sermon preached, before nor since, as this which
 was here preached to the church in the wilderness. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preacher was God himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The Lord descended in fire,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>The Lord came down upon mount Sinai.</I> The <I>shechinah,</I> or 
 glory of the Lord, appeared in the sight of all the people; he <I>shone 
 forth from mount Paran with ten thousands of his saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>),

 that is, attended, as the divine Majesty always is, by a multitude of
 the holy angels, who were both to grace the solemnity and to assist at 
 it. Hence the law is said to be given <I>by the disposition of 
 angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:53">Acts vii. 53</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pulpit (or throne rather) was mount Sinai, hung with a <I>thick 
 cloud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 covered with <I>smoke</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and made to <I>quake</I> greatly.  Now it was that the earth 
 <I>trembled at the presence of the Lord,</I> and the <I>mountains 
 skipped like rams</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps. cxiv. 4, 7</A>),

 that Sinai itself, though rough and rocky, <I>melted from before the
 Lord God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:5">Judg. v. 5</A>.

 Now it was that the <I>mountains saw him, and trembled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:10">Hab. iii. 10</A>),

 and were witnesses against a hard-hearted unmoved people, whom nothing
 would influence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The congregation was called together by the <I>sound of a trumpet, 
 exceedingly loud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and <I>waxing louder and louder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This was done by the ministry of the angels, and we read of trumpets 
 sounded by angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:6">Rev. viii. 6</A>.

 It was the <I>sound of the trumpet that made all the people
 tremble,</I> as those who knew their own guilt, and who had reason to 
 expect that the sound of this trumpet was to them the <I>alarm of 
 war.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Moses brought the hearers to the place of meeting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He that had led them out of the bondage of Egypt now led them to 
 receive the law from God's mouth. Public persons are indeed public 
 blessings when they lay out themselves in their places to promote the 
 public worship of God. Moses, at the head of an assembly worshipping 
 God, was as truly great as Moses at the head of an army in the 
 field.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The introductions to the service were <I>thunders and 
 lightnings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These were designed to strike an awe upon the people, and to raise and 
 engage their attention. Were they asleep? The thunders would awaken 
 them. Were they looking another way? The lightnings would engage them 
 to turn their faces towards him that spoke to them. Thunder and 
 lightning have natural causes, but the scripture directs us in a 
 particular manner to take notice of the power of God, and his terror, 
 in them. Thunder is the voice of God, and lightning the fire of God, 
 proper to engage the senses of sight and hearing, those senses by which 
 we receive so much of our information.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Moses is God's minister, who is spoken to, to command silence, and 
 keep the congregation in order: <I>Moses spoke,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Some think it was now that he said, <I>I exceedingly fear and quake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:21">Heb. xii. 21</A>);

 but God stilled his fear by his distinguishing favour to him, in
 calling him up to the top of the mount

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 by which also he tried his faith and courage. No sooner had Moses got 
 up a little way towards the top of the mount than he was sent down 
 again to keep the people from <I>breaking through to gaze,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Even the priests or princes, the heads of the houses of their fathers, 
 who officiated for their respective families, and therefore are said to 
 <I>come near to the Lord</I> at other times, must now keep their 
 distance, and conduct themselves with a great deal of caution. Moses 
 pleads that they needed not to have any further orders given them, 
 effectual care being taken already to prevent any intrusions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 But God, who knew their wilfulness and presumption, and what was now in
 the hearts of some of them, hastens him down with this in charge, that 
 neither the priests nor the people should offer to force the lines that 
 were set, to <I>come up unto the Lord,</I> but Moses and Aaron on, the 
 men whom God delighted to honour. Observe, 

 1. What it was that God forbade them--breaking through to gaze; enough 
 was provided to awaken their consciences, but they were not allowed to 
 gratify their vain curiosity.  They might see, but not gaze. Some of 
 them, probably, were desirous to see some similitude, that they might 
 know how to make an image of God, which he took care to prevent, for 
 they <I>saw no manner of similitude,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:5">Deut. iv. 5</A>.

 Note, In divine things we must not covet to know more than God would
 have us know; and he has allowed us as much as is good for us. A desire 
 of forbidden knowledge was the ruin of our first parents. Those that 
 would be wise above what is written, and intrude into those things 
 which they have not seen, need this admonition, that they <I>break not 
 through to gaze.</I> 

 2. Under what penalty it was forbidden: <I>Lest the Lord break forth 
 upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>),

 and <I>many of them perish.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The restraints and warnings of the divine law are all intended for
 our good, and to keep us out of that danger into which we should 
 otherwise, by our own folly, run ourselves. 

 (2.) It is at our peril if we break the bounds that God has set us, and
 intrude upon that which he has not allowed us; the Bethshemites and 
 Uzzah paid dearly for their presumption. And, even when we are called 
 to approach God, we must remember that he is in heaven and we upon 
 earth, and therefore it behoves us to exercise reverence and godly 
 fear.</P>
