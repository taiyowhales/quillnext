 1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: <I>of</I>
 shittim wood shalt thou make it.
 &nbsp; 2 A cubit <I>shall be</I> the length thereof, and a cubit the
 breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits <I>shall
 be</I> the height thereof: the horns thereof <I>shall be</I> of the same.
 &nbsp; 3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof,
 and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and
 thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
 &nbsp; 4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
 it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
 thou make <I>it;</I> and they shall be for places for the staves to
 bear it withal.
 &nbsp; 5 And thou shalt make the staves <I>of</I> shittim wood, and overlay
 them with gold.
 &nbsp; 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that <I>is</I> by the ark of
 the testimony, before the mercy seat that <I>is</I> over the
 testimony, where I will meet with thee.
 &nbsp; 7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning:
 when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
 &nbsp; 8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
 incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> throughout
 your generations.
 &nbsp; 9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
 sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
 offering thereon.
 &nbsp; 10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once
 in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
 in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
 generations: it <I>is</I> most holy unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders given concerning the altar of incense are, 

 1. That it was to be made of wood, and covered with gold, pure gold, 
 about a yard high and half a yard square, with horns at the corners, a 
 golden cornice round it, with rings and staves of gold, for the 
 convenience of carrying it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:1-5"><I>v.</I> 1-5</A>.

 It does not appear that there was any grate to this altar for the ashes 
 to fall into, that they might be taken away; but, when they burnt 
 incense, a golden censer was brought with coals in it, and placed upon 
 the altar, and in that censer the incense was burnt, and with it all 
 the coals were taken away, so that no coals nor ashes fell upon the 
 altar. The measure of the altar of incense in Ezekiel's temple is 
 double to what it is here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+41:22">Ezek. xli. 22</A>),

 and it is there called <I>an altar of wood,</I> and there is no mention
 of gold, to signify that the incense, in gospel times, should be 
 spiritual, the worship plain, and the service of God enlarged, for 
 <I>in every place incense should be offered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>.

 2. That it was to be placed before the veil, on the outside of that
 partition, but before the mercy-seat, which was within the veil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 For though he that ministered at the altar could not see the 
 mercy-seat, the veil interposing, yet he must look towards it, and 
 direct his incense that way, to teach us that though we cannot with our 
 bodily eyes see the throne of grace, that blessed mercy-seat (for it is 
 such a throne of glory that God, in compassion to us, holds back the 
 face of it, and spreads a cloud upon it), yet we must in prayer by 
 faith set ourselves before it, direct our prayer, and look up. 

 3. That Aaron was to burn sweet incense upon this altar, every morning 
 and every evening, about half a pound at a time, which was intended, 
 not only to take away the ill smell of the flesh that was burnt daily 
 on the brazen altar, but for the honour of God, and to show the 
 acceptableness of his people's services to him, and the pleasure which 
 they should take in ministering to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 As by the offerings on the brazen altar satisfaction was made for what 
 had been done displeasing to God, so, by the offering on this, what 
 they did well was, as it were, recommended to the divine acceptance; 
 for our two great concerns with God are to be acquitted from guilt and 
 accepted as righteous in his sight. 

 4. That nothing was to be offered upon it but incense, nor any incense 
 but that which was appointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God will have his own service done according to his own appointment,
 and not otherwise. 

 5. That this altar should be purified with the blood of the 
 sin-offering put upon the <I>horns of it,</I> every year, upon <I>the 
 day of atonement,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:18,19">Lev. xvi. 18, 19</A>.

 The high priest was to take this in his way, as he came out from the
 holy of holies. This was to intimate to them that the sins of the 
 priests who ministered at this altar, and of the people for whom they 
 ministered, put a ceremonial impurity upon it, from which it must be 
 cleansed by the blood of atonement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This incense-altar typified, 

 1. The mediation of Christ. The brazen altar in the court was a type of 
 Christ dying on earth; the golden altar in the sanctuary was a type of 
 Christ interceding in heaven, in virtue of his satisfaction. This altar 
 was before the mercy-seat; for Christ always appears in the presence of 
 God for us; he is our <I>advocate with the father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1 John ii. 1</A>),

 and his intercession is unto God of a sweet-smelling savour. This altar
 had a crown fixed to it; for Christ intercedes as king. <I>Father, I 
 will,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 2. The devotions of the saints, whose prayers are said to be set forth
 before God as incense,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps. cxli. 2</A>.

 As the smoke of the incense ascended, so much our desires towards God
 rise in prayer, being kindled with the fire of holy love and other 
 pious affections. When the priest was burning incense the people were 
 praying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:10">Luke i. 10</A>),

 to signify that prayer is the true incense.  This incense was offered
 daily, it was a perpetual incense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 for we must pray always, that is, we must keep up stated times for 
 prayer every day, morning and evening, at least, and never omit it, but 
 thus pray without ceasing. The lamps were dressed or lighted at the 
 same time that the incense was burnt, to teach us that the reading of 
 the scriptures (which are our light and lamp) is a part of our daily 
 work, and should ordinarily accompany our prayers and praises. When we 
 speak to God we must hear what God says to us, and thus the communion 
 is complete. The devotions of sanctified souls are well-pleasing to 
 God, of a sweet-smelling savour; the prayers of saints are compared to 
 sweet odours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:8">Rev. v. 8</A>),

 but it is the incense which Christ adds to them that makes them
 acceptable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3">Rev. viii. 3</A>),

 and his blood that atones for the guilt which cleaves to our best
 services. And, if the heart and life be not holy, even <I>incense is an 
 abomination</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:13">Isa. i. 13</A>),

 and he that offers it is <I>as if he blessed an idol,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3">Isa. lxvi. 3</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after
 their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his
 soul unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when thou numberest them; that there be no
 plague among them, when <I>thou</I> numberest them.
 &nbsp; 13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
 are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a
 shekel <I>is</I> twenty gerahs:) an half shekel <I>shall be</I> the
 offering of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
 twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give
 less than half a shekel, when <I>they</I> give an offering unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to make an atonement for your souls.
 &nbsp; 16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
 Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of
 the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of
 Israel before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to make an atonement for your souls.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some observe that the repetition of those words, <I>The Lord spoke unto 
 Moses,</I> here and afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:17,22,34"><I>v.</I> 17, 22, 34</A>),

 intimates that God did not deliver these precepts to Moses in the 
 mount, in a continued discourse, but with many intermissions, giving 
 him time either to write what was said to him or at least to charge his 
 memory with it. Christ gave instructions to his disciples as they were 
 able to hear them.  Moses is here ordered to levy money upon the people 
 by way of poll, so much a head, for the service of the tabernacle. This 
 he must do when he numbered the people. Some think that it refers only 
 to the first numbering of them, now when the tabernacle was set up; and 
 that this tax was to make up what was deficient in the voluntary 
 contributions for the finishing of the work, or rather for the 
 beginning of the service in the tabernacle. Others think that it was 
 afterwards repeated upon any emergency and always when the people were 
 numbered, and that David offended in not demanding it when he numbered 
 the people. But many of the Jewish writers, and others from them, are 
 of opinion that it was to be an annual tribute, only it was begun when 
 Moses first numbered the people. This was that tribute-money which 
 Christ paid, for fear of offending his adversaries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:27">Matt. xvii. 27</A>),

 when yet he showed good reason why he should have been excused. Men
 were appointed in every city to receive this payment yearly. Now, 

 1. The tribute to be paid was <I>half a shekel,</I> about fifteen pence 
 of our money. The rich were not to give more, nor the poor less

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to intimate that the souls of the rich and poor are alike precious, and 
 that God is <I>no respecter of persons,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34,Job+34:19">Acts x. 34; Job xxxiv. 19</A>.

 In other offerings men were to give according to their ability; but
 this, which was the <I>ransom of the soul,</I> must be alike for all;
 for the rich have as much need of Christ as the poor, and the poor are 
 as welcome to him as the rich. They both alike contributed to the 
 maintenance of the temple-service, because both were to have a like 
 interest in it and benefit by it. In Christ and his ordinances <I>rich 
 and poor meet together; the Lord is the Maker,</I> the Lord Christ is 
 the Redeemer of them both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:2">Prov. xxii. 2</A>.

 The Jews say, "If a man refused to pay this tribute, he was not
 comprehended in the expiation." 

 2. this tribute was to be paid as a <I>ransom of the soul, that there 
 might be no plague among them.</I> Hereby they acknowledged that they 
 received their lives from God, that they had forfeited their lives to 
 him, and that they depended upon his power and patience for the 
 continuance of them; and thus they did homage to the God of their 
 lives, and deprecated those plagues which their sins had deserved. 

 3. This money that was raised was to be employed in the service of the 
 tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 with it they bought sacrifices, flour, incense, wine, oil, fuel, salt, 
 priests' garments, and all other things which the whole congregation 
 was interested in. Note, Those that have the benefit of God's 
 tabernacle among them must be willing to defray the expenses of it, and 
 not grudge the necessary charges of God's public worship. Thus we must 
 honour the Lord with our substance, and reckon that best laid out which 
 is laid out in the service of God. Money indeed cannot make an 
 <I>atonement for the soul,</I> but it may be used for the honour of him 
 who has made the atonement, and for the maintenance of the gospel by 
 which the atonement is applied.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 18 Thou shalt also make a laver <I>of</I> brass, and his foot <I>also
 of</I> brass, to wash <I>withal:</I> and thou shalt put it between the
 tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put
 water therein.
 &nbsp; 19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
 thereat:
 &nbsp; 20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
 shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near
 to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
 not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, <I>even</I> to him
 and to his seed throughout their generations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Orders are here given, 

 1. For the making of a laver, or font, of brass, a large vessel, that 
 would contain a good quantity of water, which was to be set near the 
 door of the tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The foot of brass, it is supposed, was so contrived as to receive the 
 water, which was let into it out of the laver by spouts or cocks. They 
 then had a laver for the priests only to wash in, but to us now there 
 is a fountain open for Judah and Jerusalem to wash in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>),

 an inexhaustible <I>fountain of living water,</I> so that it is our own
 fault if we remain in our pollution. 

 2. For the using of this laver.  Aaron and his sons must wash their 
 hands and feet at this laver every time they went in to minister, every 
 morning, at least,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 For this purpose clean water was put into the laver fresh every day. 
 Though they washed themselves ever so clean at their own houses, that 
 would not serve; they must wash at the laver, because that was 
 appointed for washing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:12-14">2 Kings v. 12-14</A>.

 This was designed,

 (1.) To teach them purity in all their ministrations, and to possess
 them with a reverence of God's holiness and a dread of the pollutions 
 of sin.  They must not only wash and be made clean when they were first 
 consecrated, but they must wash and be kept clean whenever they went in 
 to minister. He only shall <I>stand in God's holy place</I> that has 
 <I>clean hands and a pure heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:3,4">Ps. xxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 And,

 (2.) It was to teach us, who are daily to attend upon God, daily to
 renew our repentance for sin and our believing application of the blood 
 of Christ to our souls for remission; for in many things we daily 
 offend and contract pollution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:8,10,Jam+3:2">John xiii. 8, 10; Jam. iii. 2</A>.

 This is the preparation we are to make for solemn ordinances.
 <I>Cleanse your hands and purify your hearts,</I> and then <I>draw nigh 
 to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:8">Jam. iv. 8</A>.

 To this law David alludes in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6">Ps. xxvi. 6</A>,

 <I>I will wash my hands in innocency, so will I compass thine altar, O
 Lord.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh
 five hundred <I>shekels,</I> and of sweet cinnamon half so much,
 <I>even</I> two hundred and fifty <I>shekels,</I> and of sweet calamus two
 hundred and fifty <I>shekels,</I>
 &nbsp; 24 And of cassia five hundred <I>shekels,</I> after the shekel of
 the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:
 &nbsp; 25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
 compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
 anointing oil.
 &nbsp; 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
 therewith, and the ark of the testimony,
 &nbsp; 27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and
 his vessels, and the altar of incense,
 &nbsp; 28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and
 the laver and his foot.
 &nbsp; 29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
 whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
 &nbsp; 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate
 them, that <I>they</I> may minister unto me in the priest's office.
 &nbsp; 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
 This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
 generations.
 &nbsp; 32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye
 make <I>any other</I> like it, after the composition of it: it <I>is</I>
 holy, <I>and</I> it shall be holy unto you.
 &nbsp; 33 Whosoever compoundeth <I>any</I> like it, or whosoever putteth
 <I>any</I> of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his
 people.
 &nbsp; 34 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
 stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; <I>these</I> sweet spices with pure
 frankincense: of each shall there be a like <I>weight:</I>
 &nbsp; 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
 of the apothecary, tempered together, pure <I>and</I> holy:
 &nbsp; 36 And thou shalt beat <I>some</I> of it very small, and put of it
 before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where
 I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
 &nbsp; 37 And <I>as for</I> the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
 make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall
 be unto thee holy for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
 even be cut off from his people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions are here given for the composition of the holy anointing oil 
 and the incense that were to be used in the service of the tabernacle; 
 with these God was to be honoured, and therefore he would appoint the 
 making of them; for nothing comes <I>to</I> God but what comes 
 <I>from</I> him. 

 1. The holy anointing oil is here ordered to be made up the 
 ingredients, and their quantities, are prescribed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 Interpreters are not agreed concerning them; we are sure, in general, 
 they were the best and fittest for the purpose; they must needs be so 
 when the divine wisdom appointed them for the divine honour. It was to 
 be compounded <I>secundum artem--after the art of the apothecary</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 the spices, which were in all nearly half a hundred weight, were to be 
 infused in the oil, which was to be about five or six quarts, and then 
 strained out, leaving an admirable sweet smell in the oil. With this 
 oil God's tent and all the furniture of it were to be anointed; it was 
 to be used also in the consecration of the priests,

 It was to be continued <I>throughout their generations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The tradition of the Jews is that this very oil which was prepared by 
 Moses himself lasted till near the captivity. But bishop Patrick shows 
 the great improbability of the tradition, and supposes that it was 
 repeated according to the prescription here, for Solomon was anointed 
 with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:39">2 Kings i. 39</A>),

 and some other of the kings; and all the high priests with such a
 quantity of it that it ran down to the skirts of the garments; and we 
 read of the making up of this ointment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:30">1 Chron. ix. 30</A>):

 yet all agree that in the second temple there was none of this holy
 oil, which he supposes was owing to a notion they had that it was not 
 lawful to make it up, Providence overruling that want as a presage of 
 the better unction of the Holy Ghost in gospel times, the variety of 
 whose gifts was typified by these several sweet ingredients.  To show 
 the excellency of holiness, there was that in the tabernacle which was 
 in the highest degree grateful both to the sight and to the smell. 
 Christ's name is said to be as <I>ointment poured forth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:3">Cant. i. 3</A>),

 and the good name of Christians better than <I>precious ointment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:1">Eccl. vii. 1</A>.

 2. The incense which was burned upon the golden altar was prepared of
 sweet spices likewise, though not so rare and rich as those of which 
 the anointing oil was compounded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 This was prepared once a year (the Jews say), a pound for each day of 
 the year, and three pounds over for the day of atonement. When it was 
 used, it was to be beaten very small: thus it pleased the Lord to 
 bruise the Redeemer when he offered himself for a sacrifice of a 
 sweet-smelling savour. 

 3. Concerning both these preparations the same law is here given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:32,33,37,38"><I>v.</I> 32, 33, 37, 38</A>),

 that the like should not be made for any common use. Thus God would 
 preserve in the people's minds a reverence for his own institutions, 
 and teach us not to profane nor abuse any thing whereby God makes 
 himself known, as those did who invented to themselves (for their 
 common entertainments) instruments of music like David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:5">Amos vi. 5</A>.

 It is a great affront to God to jest with sacred things, particularly
 to make sport with the word and ordinances of God, or to treat them 
 with lightness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:5">Matt. xxii. 5</A>.

 That which is God's peculiar must not be used as a common thing.</P>
