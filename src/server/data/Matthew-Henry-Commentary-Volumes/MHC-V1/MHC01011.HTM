 The old distinction between the sons of God and the sons of men 
 (professors and profane) survived the flood, and now appeared 
 again, when men began to multiply: according to this distinction 
 we have, in this chapter,

 I. The dispersion of the sons of
 men at Babel 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>),
 where we have, 
 1. Their presumptuous 
 provoking design, which was to build a city and a tower, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. The righteous judgment of God upon them in disappointing
 their design, by confounding their language, and so
 scattering them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 II. The pedigree of the sons of
 God down to Abraham
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:10-26">ver. 10-26</A>),
 with a general account of
 his family, and removal out of his native country,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:27-32">ver. 27</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the whole earth was of one 
 language, and of one speech.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass, as they 
 journeyed from the east, that they 
 found a plain in the land of Shinar; 
 and they dwelt there.
 &nbsp; 3 And they 
 said one to another, Go to, let us 
 make brick, and burn them thoroughly. 
 And they had brick for stone, and 
 slime had they for mortar.
 &nbsp; 4 And 
 they said, Go to, let us build us a city 
 and a tower, whose top <I>may reach</I> 
 unto heaven; and let us make us a 
 name, lest we be scattered abroad 
 upon the face of the whole earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The close of the foregoing chapter tells 
 us that <I>by</I> the sons of Noah, or <I>among</I> 
 the sons of Noah, <I>the nations were divided 
 in the earth after the flood,</I> that is, were 
 distinguished into several tribes or colonies; 
 and, the places having grown too strait for them, 
 it was either appointed by Noah, or agreed 
 upon among his sons, which way each several 
 tribe or colony should steer its course, 
 beginning with the countries that were next 
 them, and designing to proceed further and 
 further, and to remove to a greater distance 
 from each other, as the increase of their several 
 companies should require. Thus was 
 the matter well settled, one hundred years 
 after the flood, about the time of Peleg's 
 birth; but the sons of men, it should seem, 
 were loth to disperse into distant places; they 
 thought the more the merrier and the safer, 
 and therefore they contrived to keep together, 
 and were <I>slack to go to possess the land 
 which the Lord God of their fathers had given 
 them</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:3">Josh. xviii. 3</A>),
 thinking themselves wiser 
 than either God or Noah. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The advantages which befriended their 
 design of keeping together, 
 
 1. They were 
 all of <I>one language,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 If there were any 
 different languages before the flood, yet 
 Noah's only, which it is likely was the same 
 with Adam's, was preserved through the flood, 
 and continued after it. Now, while they all 
 understood one another, they would be the 
 more likely to love one another, and the more 
 capable of helping one another, and the less 
 inclinable to separate one from another. 
 
 2. They found a very convenient commodious 
 place to settle in 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 <I>a plain in the land of 
 Shinar,</I> a spacious plain, able to <I>contain</I> them 
 all, and a <I>fruitful</I> plain, able, according as 
 their present numbers were, to support them 
 all, though perhaps they had not considered 
 what room there would be for them when 
 their numbers should be increased. Note, 
 Inviting accommodations, for the present, 
 often prove too strong temptations to the 
 neglect of both duty and interest, as it respects 
 futurity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method they took to bind themselves 
 to one another, and to settle together 
 in one body. Instead of coveting to enlarge 
 their borders by a peaceful departure under 
 the divine protection, they contrived to fortify 
 them, and, as those that were resolved to 
 wage war with Heaven, they put themselves 
 into a posture of defence. Their unanimous 
 resolution is, <I>Let us build ourselves a city 

 <A NAME="Page79"> </A>
 
 and a tower.</I> It is observable that the first 
 builders of cities, both in the old world 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>),
 and in the new world here, were not 
 men of the best character and reputation: 
 tents served God's subjects to dwell in; 
 cities were first built by those that were 
 rebels against him and revolters from him. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they excited and encouraged one 
 another to set about this work. They said, 
 <I>Go to, let us make brick</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 and again, 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 <I>Go to, let us build ourselves a city;</I> by 
 mutual excitements they made one another 
 more daring and resolute. Note, Great things 
 may be brought to pass when the undertakers 
 are numerous and unanimous, and stir up 
 one another. Let us learn to provoke one 
 another to love and to good works, as sinners 
 stir up and encourage one another to wicked 
 works. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1,Isa+2:3,5,Jer+50:5">Ps. cxxii. 1; Isa. ii. 3, 5; Jer. l. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What materials they used in their building. 
 The country, being plain, yielded neither 
 stone nor mortar, yet this did not discourage 
 them from their undertaking, but they made 
 brick to serve instead of stone, and slime or 
 pitch instead of mortar. See here, 
 
 (1.) What 
 shift those will make that are resolute in 
 their purposes: were we but zealously 
 affected in a good thing, we should not stop 
 our work so often as we do, under pretence 
 that we want conveniences for carrying it on. 
 
 (2.) What a difference there is between men's 
 building and God's; when men build their 
 Babel, brick and slime are their best materials; 
 but, when God builds his Jerusalem, he lays 
 even the <I>foundations of it with sapphires, and 
 all its borders with pleasant stones,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11-12,Re+21:19">Isa. liv. 11, 12; Rev. xxi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. For what ends they built. Some think 
 they intended hereby to secure themselves 
 against the waters of another flood. God 
 had told them indeed that he would not again 
 drown the world; but they would trust to 
 a tower of their own making, rather than to
 a promise of God's making or an ark of his 
 appointing. If, however, they had had this 
 in their eye, they would have chosen to build 
 their tower upon a mountain rather than 
 upon a plain, but three things, it seems, they 
 aimed at in building this tower:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It seems designed for an affront to 
 God himself; for they would build a tower 
 <I>whose top might reach to heaven,</I> which bespeaks 
 a defiance of God, or at least a rivalship 
 with him. They would be <I>like the Most 
 High,</I> or would come as near him as they could, 
 not in holiness but in height. They forgot 
 their place, and, scorning to creep on the 
 earth, resolved to climb to heaven, not by the 
 door or ladder, but some other way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They hoped hereby to make themselves 
 a name; they would do something to 
 be talked of now, and to give posterity to 
 know that there had been such men as they 
 in the world. Rather than die and leave no 
 memorandum behind them, they would leave 
 this monument of their pride, and ambition, 
 and folly. Note, 
 
 [1.] Affectation of honour 
 and a name among men commonly inspires 
 with a strange ardour for great and difficult 
 undertakings, and often betrays to that which 
 is evil and offensive to God. 
 
 [2.] It is just 
 with God to bury those names in the dust 
 which are raised by sin. These Babel-builders 
 put themselves to a great deal of foolish expense 
 to make themselves a name; but they 
 could not gain even this point, for we do not 
 find in any history the name of so much as 
 one of these Babel-builders. Philo Jud&aelig;us 
 says, They engraved every one his name upon 
 a brick, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--as a 
 perpetual memorial;</I> yet neither did this serve 
 their purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They did it to prevent their dispersion: 
 <I>Lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of 
 the earth.</I> "It was done" (says Josephus) 
 "in disobedience to that command 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>),
 <I>Replenish the earth.</I>" God orders them to 
 disperse. "No," say they, "we will not, we 
 will live and die together." In order hereunto, 
 they engage themselves and one another in 
 this vast undertaking. That they might 
 unite in one glorious empire, they resolve to 
 build this city and tower, to be the metropolis 
 of their kingdom and the centre of their unity. 
 It is probable that the band of ambitious 
 Nimrod was in all this. He could 
 not content himself with the command of a 
 particular colony, but aimed at universal 
 monarchy, in order to which, under pretence 
 of uniting for their common safety, he contrives 
 to keep them in one body, that, having 
 them all under his eye, he might not fail 
 to have them under his power. See the daring 
 presumption of these sinners. Here is, 
 
 [1.] A bold opposition to God: "You shall be 
 scattered," says God. "But we will not," 
 say they. <I>Woe unto him that thus strives 
 with his Maker.</I> 
 
 [2.] A bold competition 
 with God. It is God's prerogative to be universal 
 monarch, Lord of all, and King of 
 kings; the man that aims at it offers to step
 into the throne of God, who will not give his 
 glory to another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came down to 
 see the city and the tower, which the 
 children of men builded.
 &nbsp; 6 And the 
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, Behold, the people <I>is</I> one, 
 and they have all one language; and 
 this they begin to do: and now nothing 
 will be restrained from them, 
 which they have imagined to do.
 &nbsp; 7 Go to, let us go down, and there 
 confound their language, that they 
 may not understand one another's 
 speech.
 &nbsp; 8 So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> scattered 
 them abroad from thence upon the 
 face of all the earth: and they left 
 off to build the city.
 &nbsp; 9 Therefore is 
 the name of it called Babel; because

 <A NAME="Page80"> </A>

 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did there confound the 
 language of all the earth: and from 
 thence did the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> scatter them 
 abroad upon the face of all the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the quashing of the project 
 of the Babel-builders, and the turning of the 
 counsel of those froward men headlong, that 
 God's counsel might stand in spite of them. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cognizance God took of the design 
 that was on foot: <I>The Lord came down to see the 
 city,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 It is an expression after the manner 
 of men; he knew it as clearly and fully as men 
 know that which they come to the place to 
 view. Observe, 
 
 1. Before he gave judgment 
 upon their cause, he enquired into it; for 
 God is incontestably just and fair in all his 
 proceedings against sin and sinners, and condemns none 
 unheard. 
 
 2. It is spoken of as 
 an act of condescension in God to take notice 
 even of this building, which the undertakers 
 were so proud of; for he humbles himself 
 to behold the transactions, even the 
 most considerable ones, of this lower world, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:6">Ps. cxiii. 6.</A>.

 3. It is said to be <I>the tower 
 which the children of men built,</I> which intimates, 
 
 (1.) Their weakness and frailty as 
 men. It was a very foolish thing for the 
 children of men, worms of the earth, to defy 
 Heaven, and to provoke the Lord to jealousy. 
 <I>Are they stronger than he?</I> 
 
 (2.) Their sinfulness 
 and obnoxiousness. They were the sons 
 of <I>Adam,</I> so it is in the Hebrew; nay, of that 
 Adam, that sinful disobedient Adam, whose 
 children are by nature children of disobedience, 
 children that are corrupters. 
 
 (3.) Their 
 distinction from the children of God, the professors 
 of religion, from whom these daring 
 builders had separated themselves, and built 
 this tower to support and perpetuate the separation. 
 Pious Eber is not found among 
 this ungodly crew; for he and his are called 
 the children of God, and therefore their souls 
 come not into the secret, nor unite themselves 
 to the assembly, of these children of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The counsels and resolves of the Eternal 
 God concerning this matter; he did not 
 come down merely as a spectator, but as a 
 judge, as a prince, to <I>look upon these proud 
 men, and abase them,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-14">Job xl. 11-14</A>.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He suffered them to proceed a good 
 way in their enterprise before he put a 
 stop to it, that they might have space to 
 repent, and, if they had so much consideration 
 left, might be ashamed of it and weary 
 of it themselves; and if not that their disappointment 
 might be the more shameful, and 
 every one that passed by might laugh at 
 them, saying, <I>These men began to build, and 
 were not able to finish,</I> that so the works of 
 their hands, from which they promised themselves 
 immortal honour, might turn to their 
 perpetual reproach. Note, God has wise and 
 holy ends in permitting the enemies of his glory 
 to carry on their impious projects a great way, 
 and to prosper long in their enterprises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When they had, with much care and 
 toil, made some considerable progress in their 
 building, then God determined to break their 
 measures and disperse them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The righteousness of God, which 
 appears in the considerations upon which 
 he proceeded in this resolution, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 Two things he considered:--
 
 [1.] Their oneness, 
 as a reason why they must be scattered: 
 "<I>Behold, the people are one, and they have all
 one language.</I> If they continue one, much of 
 the earth will be left uninhabited; the power 
 of their prince will soon be exorbitant; wickedness 
 and profaneness will be insufferably 
 rampant, for they will strengthen one another's 
 hands in it; and, which is worst of 
 all, there will be an overbalance to the church, 
 and these children of men, if thus incorporated, 
 will swallow up the little remnant of 
 God's children." Therefore it is decreed that 
 they must not be one. Note, Unity is a policy,
 but it is not the infallible mark of a true 
 church; yet, while the builders of Babel, 
 though of different families, dispositions, and 
 interests, were thus unanimous in opposing 
 God, what a pity is it, and what a shame, that 
 the builders of Sion, though united in one 
 common head and Spirit, should be divided, 
 as they are, in serving God! But marvel not 
 at the matter. Christ came not to send peace. 
 
 [2.] Their obstinacy: <I>Now nothing will be 
 restrained from them;</I> and this is a reason 
 why they must be crossed and thwarted in 
 their design. God had tried, by his commands 
 and admonitions, to bring them off 
 from this project, but in vain; therefore he 
 must take another course with them. See 
 here, <I>First,</I> The sinfulness of sin, and the 
 wilfulness of sinners; ever since Adam would 
 not be restrained from the forbidden tree, his 
 unsanctified seed have been impatient of restraint 
 and ready to rebel against it. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 See the necessity of God's judgments 
 upon earth, to keep the world in some order 
 and to tie the hands of those that will not be 
 checked by law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The wisdom and mercy of God in the 
 methods that were taken for the defeating of 
 this enterprise 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 <I>Go to, let us go down, 
 and there confound their language.</I> This was 
 not spoken to the angels, as if God needed 
 either their advice or their assistance, but 
 God speaks it to himself, or the Father to the 
 Son and Holy Ghost. They said, <I>Go to, let 
 us make brick,</I> and <I>Go to, let us build a tower,</I> 
 animating one another to the attempt; and 
 now God says, <I>Go to, let us confound their 
 language;</I> for, if men stir up themselves to 
 sin, God will stir up himself to take vengeance, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:17,18">Isa. lix. 17, 18</A>.
 Now observe here, 
 
 [1.] The mercy of God, in moderating the 
 penalty, and not making it proportionable to 
 the offence; for <I>he deals not with us according 
 to our sins.</I> He does not say, "<I>Let us go 
 down</I> now in thunder and lightning, and consume 
 those rebels in a moment;" or, "Let 
 the earth open, and swallow up them and 
 
 <A NAME="Page81"> </A>

 their building, and let those go down quickly 
 into hell who are climbing to heaven the 
 wrong way." No; only, "<I>Let us go down,</I> 
 and scatter them." They deserved death, 
 but are only banished or transported; for the 
 patience of God is very great towards a provoking 
 world. Punishments are chiefly reserved 
 for the future state. God's judgments 
 on sinners in this life, compared with those 
 which are reserved, are little more than restraints. 
 
 [2.] The wisdom of God, in pitching 
 upon an effectual expedient to stay 
 proceedings, which was the confounding of 
 their language, that they might not understand 
 one another's speech, nor could they 
 well join hands when their tongues were 
 divided; so that this would be a very proper 
 method both for taking them off from their 
 building (for, if they could not understand 
 one another, they could not help one another) 
 and also for disposing them to scatter; for, 
 when they could not understand one another, 
 they could not take pleasure in one another. 
 Note, God has various means, and effectual 
 ones, to baffle and defeat the projects of
 proud men that set themselves against him, 
 and particularly to divide them among themselves, 
 either by dividing their spirits 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23">Judg. ix. 23</A>),
 or by dividing their tongues, as David 
 prays, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:9">Ps. lv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The execution of these counsels of 
 God, to the blasting and defeating of the 
 counsels of men, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 God made them 
 know <I>whose word should stand, his or theirs,</I> 
 as the expression is, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:28">Jer. xliv. 28</A>.
 Notwithstanding 
 their oneness and obstinacy, God 
 was too hard for them, and wherein they dealt 
 proudly he was above them; for <I>who ever 
 hardened his heart against him and prospered?</I> 
 Three things were done:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their language was confounded. God, 
 who, when he made man, taught him to 
 speak, and put words into his mouth fit to 
 express the conceptions of his mind by, now 
 caused these builders to forget their former 
 language, and to speak and understand a new
 one, which yet was common to those of the 
 same tribe or family, but not to others: those 
 of one colony could converse together, but 
 not with those of another. Now, 
 
 (1.) This 
 was a great miracle, and a proof of the power 
 which God has upon the minds and tongues 
 of men, which he turns as the rivers of water. 
 
 (2.) This was a great judgment upon these 
 builders; for, being thus deprived of the 
 knowledge of the ancient and holy tongue, 
 they had become incapable of communicating 
 with the true church, in which it was retained, 
 and probably it contributed much to their 
 loss of the knowledge of the true God. 
 
 (3.) We 
 all suffer by it, to this day. In all the inconveniences 
 we sustain by the diversity of languages, 
 and all the pains and trouble we are 
 at to learn the languages we have occasion 
 for, we smart for the rebellion of our ancestors 
 at Babel. Nay, and those unhappy 
 controversies which are strifes of words, and 
 arise from our misunderstanding one another's 
 language, for aught I know are owing 
 to this confusion of tongues. 
 
 (4.) The project 
 of some to frame a universal character, 
 in order to a universal language, how desirable 
 soever it may seem, is yet, I think, but 
 a vain thing to attempt; for it is to strive 
 against a divine sentence, by which the languages
 of the nations will be divided while 
 the world stands. 
 
 (5.) We may here lament 
 the loss of the universal use of the Hebrew 
 tongue, which from this time was the vulgar 
 language of the Hebrews only, and continued 
 so till the captivity in Babylon, where, even 
 among them, it was exchanged for the Syriac. 
 
 (6.) As the confounding of tongues divided 
 the children of men and scattered them 
 abroad, so the gift of tongues, bestowed upon 
 the apostles 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-13">Acts ii.</A>),
 contributed greatly to 
 the gathering together of the children of God, 
 who were scattered abroad, and the uniting of 
 them in Christ, that with one mind and one 
 mouth they might glorify God, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6">Rom. xv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their building was stopped: <I>They left 
 off to build the city.</I> This was the effect of 
 the confusion of their tongues; for it not 
 only incapacitated them for helping one another, 
 but probably struck such a damp upon 
 their spirits that they could not proceed, 
 since they saw, in this, the hand of the Lord 
 gone out against them. Note, 
 
 (1.) It is wisdom 
 to leave off that which we see God fights 
 against. 
 
 (2.) God is ale to blast and bring 
 to nought all the devices and designs of 
 Babel-builders. He sits in heaven, and 
 laughs at the counsels of the kings of the 
 earth against him and his anointed; and will 
 force them to confess that there is no wisdom 
 nor counsel against the Lord, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:30,Isa+8:9,10">Prov. xxi. 30; Isa. viii. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 3. The builders were scattered abroad upon 
 the face of the whole earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 They 
 departed in companies, after their families, 
 and after their tongues 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5,20,31"><I>ch.</I> x. 5, 20, 31</A>),
 to the several countries and places allotted to 
 them in the division that had been made, 
 which they knew before, but would not go to 
 take possession of till now that they were 
 forced to it. Observe here, 
 
 (1.) The very 
 thing which they feared came upon them. 
 That dispersion which sought to evade by 
 an act of rebellion they by this act brought 
 upon themselves; for we are most likely to fall 
 into that trouble which we seek to evade by 
 indirect and sinful methods. 
 
 (2.) It was 
 God's work: <I>The Lord scattered them.</I> God's 
 hand is to be acknowledged in all scattering 
 providences; if the family be scattered, relations 
 scattered, churches scattered, it is the 
 Lord's doing. 
 
 (3.) Though they were as
 firmly in league with one another as could
 be, yet the Lord scattered them; for no man
 can keep together what God will put asunder.

 (4.) Thus God justly took vengeance on them 
 for their oneness in that presumptuous attempt 
 to build their tower. Shameful dispersions 
 are the just punishment of sinful

 unions. Simeon and Levi, who had been 
 brethren in iniquity, were divided in Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:5,7,Ps+83:3-13"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 5, 7; Ps. lxxxiii. 3-13</A>.

 (5.) They left behind them a perpetual memorandum 
 of their reproach, in the name given to the 
 place. It was called <I>Babel, confusion.</I> Those 
 that aim at a great name commonly come off 
 with a <I>bad</I> name. 
 
 (6.) The children of men 
 were now finally scattered, and never did, nor 
 ever will, come all together again, till the 
 great day, when the Son of man shall sit 
 upon the throne of his glory, and all nations 
 shall be gathered before him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a genealogy, not an endless 
 genealogy, for here it ends in Abram, the 
 friend of God, and leads further to Christ, 
 the promised seed, who was the son of Abram, 
 and from Abram the genealogy of Christ is 
 reckoned 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:1-17">Matt. i. 1</A>,
 &c.);
 so that put
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:1-32,11:10-26,Mt+1:1-17"><I>ch.</I> v., <I>ch.</I> xi., and Matt. i</A>,
 together, and you have 
 such an entire genealogy of Jesus Christ as 
 cannot be produced, for aught I know, concerning 
 any person in the world, out of his line, 
 and at such a distance from the fountain-head. 
 And, laying these three genealogies 
 together, we shall find that twice ten, 
 and thrice fourteen, generations or descents, 
 passed between the first and second Adam, 
 making it clear concerning Christ that he was 
 not only the Son of Abraham, but the Son of 
 man, and the seed of woman. Observe here, 
 
 1. Nothing is left upon record concerning 
 those of this line but their names and 
 ages, the Holy Ghost seeming to hasten 
 through them to the story of Abram. How 
 little do we know of those that have gone before 
 us in this world, even those that lived in 
 the same places where we live, as we likewise 
 know little of those that are our contemporaries 
 in distant places! we have enough 
 to do to mind the work of our own day, and 
 let God alone to <I>require that which is past,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:15">Eccl. iii. 15</A>.

 2. There was an observable 
 gradual decrease in the years of their lives. 
 Shem reached to 600 years, which yet fell 
 short of the age of the patriarchs before the 
 flood; the next three came short of 500; the 
 next three did not reach to 300; after them 
 we read not of any that attained to 200, except 
 Terah; and, not many ages after this, Moses 
 reckoned seventy, or eighty, to be the utmost 
 men ordinarily arrive at. When the earth 
 began to be replenished, men's lives began to 
 shorten; so that the decrease is to be imputed 
 to the wise disposal of Providence, 
 rather than to any decay of nature. For the 
 elect's sake, men's days are shortened; and, 
 being evil, it is well they are few, and <I>attain 
 not to the years of the lives of our fathers,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:9"><I>ch.</I> xlvii. 9</A>.

 3. Eber, from whom the Hebrews 
 were denominated, was the longest-lived 
 of any that was born after the flood, 
 which perhaps was the reward of his singular 
 piety and strict adherence to the ways of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27 Now these <I>are</I> the generations 
 of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, 
 and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
 &nbsp; 28 And Haran died before his father 
 Terah in the land of his nativity, in 
 Ur of the Chaldees.
 &nbsp; 29 And Abram 
 and Nahor took them wives: the 
 name of Abram's wife <I>was</I> Sarai; and 
 the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, 
 the daughter of Haran, the father of 
 Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
 &nbsp; 30 But Sarai was barren; she <I>had</I> no 
 child.
 &nbsp; 31 And Terah took Abram 
 his son, and Lot the son of Haran 
 his son's son, and Sarai his daughter 
 in law, his son Abram's wife; and 
 they went forth with them from Ur, 
 
 <A NAME="Page83"> </A>

 of the Chaldees, to go into the land 
 of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, 
 and dwelt there.
 &nbsp; 32 And the 
 days of Terah were two hundred and 
 five years: and Terah died in Haran.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here begins the story of Abram, whose 
 name is famous, henceforward, in both Testaments. 
 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His country: <I>Ur of the Chaldees.</I> This 
 was the land of his nativity, an idolatrous 
 country, where even the children of Eber 
 themselves had degenerated. Note, Those 
 who are, through grace, heirs of the land of 
 promise, ought to remember what was the 
 land of their nativity, what was their corrupt 
 and sinful state by nature, the rock out of 
 which they were hewn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His relations, mentioned for his sake, 
 and because of their interest in the following 
 story. 
 
 1. His father was <I>Terah,</I> of whom it 
 is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2">Josh. xxiv. 2</A>)
 that he served other 
 gods, on the other side of the flood, so early 
 did idolatry gain footing in the world, and 
 so hard is it even for those that have some
 good principles to swim against the stream.
 Though it is said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)
 that when Terah 
 was seventy years old he begat Abram, 
 Nahor, and Haran (which seems to tell us 
 that Abram was the eldest son of Terah, and 
 was born in his seventieth year), yet, by 
 comparing 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>,
 which makes Terah to die 
 in his 205<I>th</I> year, with 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:4">Acts vii. 4</A>
 (where it 
 is said that he was but seventy-five 
 years old when he removed from Haran), it 
 appears that he was born in the 130<I>th</I> year 
 of Terah, and probably was his youngest 
 son; for, in God's choices, the last are often 
 first and the first last. We have, 
 
 2. Some 
 account of his brethren. 
 
 (1.) <I>Nahor,</I> out of 
 whose family both Isaac and Jacob had 
 their wives. 
 
 (2.) <I>Haran,</I> the father of Lot, of 
 whom it is here said 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)
 <I>that he died before his father Terah.</I> Note, Children 
 cannot be sure that they shall survive their 
 parents; for death does not go by seniority, 
 taking the eldest first. <I>The shadow of death 
 is without any order,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:22">Job x. 22</A>.
 It is likewise
 said that he died <I>in Ur of the Chaldees,</I> before 
 the happy removal of the family out of that 
 idolatrous country. Note, It concerns us 
 to hasten out of our natural state, lest death
 surprise us in it. 
 
 3. His wife was <I>Sarai,</I> 
 who some think, was the same with Iscah, 
 the daughter of Haran. Abram himself says 
 of her that she was the daughter of his father, 
 but not the daughter of his mother, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:12"><I>ch.</I> xx. 12</A>.
 She was ten years younger than Abram.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His departure out of Ur of the Chaldees, 
 with his father Terah, his nephew Lot, 
 and the rest of his family, in obedience to 
 the call of God, of which we shall read more, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:1-20"><I>ch.</I> xii. 1</A>,
 &c. This chapter leaves them in 
 Haran, or Charran, a place about mid-way 
 between Ur and Canaan, where they dwelt 
 till Terah's head was laid, probably because 
 the old man was unable, through the infirmities 
 of age, to proceed in his journey. 
 Many reach to Charran, and yet fall short of 
 Canaan; they are not far from the kingdom 
 of God, and yet never come thither.</P>
