 Hitherto the levitical law had been chiefly conversant about holy 
 persons, holy things, and holy places; in this chapter we have the 
 institution of holy times, many of which had been mentioned 
 occasionally before, but here they are all put together, only the new 
 moons are not mentioned. All the rest of the feasts of the Lord are, 

 I. The weekly feast of the sabbath,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:3">ver. 3</A>.

 II. The yearly feasts, 

 1. The passover, and the feast of unleavened bread

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>), 

 to which was annexed the offering of the sheaf of firstfruits,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 2. Pentecost,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 3. The solemnities of the seventh month. The feast of trumpets on the
 first day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>),

 the day of atonement on the tenth day

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
 <I>Concerning</I> the feasts of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which ye shall proclaim <I>to
 be</I> holy convocations, <I>even</I> these <I>are</I> my feasts.
 &nbsp; 3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day <I>is</I> the
 sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
 <I>therein</I>: it <I>is</I> the sabbath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in all your dwellings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A general account of the holy times which God appointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and it is only his appointment that can make time holy; for he is the 
 Lord of time, and as soon as ever he had set its wheels a-going it was 
 he that sanctified and blessed one day above the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:3">Gen. ii. 3</A>.

 Man may by his appointment make a good day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:19">Esth. ix. 19</A>),

 but it is God's prerogative to make a holy day; nor is any thing
 sanctified but by the stamp of his institution. As all inherent 
 holiness comes from his special grace, so all adherent holiness from 
 his special appointment. Now, concerning the holy times here ordained, 
 observe,

 1. They are called <I>feasts.</I> The day of atonement, which was one
 of them, was a fast; yet, because most of them were appointed for joy 
 and rejoicing, they are in the general called feasts. Some read it, 
 <I>These are my assemblies,</I> but that is co-incident with 
 <I>convocations.</I> I would rather read it, These are <I>my 
 solemnities;</I> so the word here used is translated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20">Isa. xxxiii. 20</A>),

 where Zion is called the <I>city of our solemnities:</I> and, reading 
 it so here, the day of atonement was as great a solemnity as any of 
 them. 

 2. They are the feasts of the Lord (<I>my feasts</I>), observed to the
 honour of his name, and in obedience to his command. 

 3. They were proclaimed; for they were not to be observed by the
 priests only that attended the sanctuary, but by all the people. And 
 this proclamation was the joyful sound concerning which we read, 
 <I>Blessed are the people that know it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15">Ps. lxxxix. 15</A>.

 4. They were to be sanctified and solemnized with holy convocations,
 that the services of these feasts might appear the more honourable and 
 august, and the people the more unanimous in the performance of them; 
 it was for the honour of God and his institutions, which sought not 
 corners and the purity of which would be best preserved by the public 
 administration of them; it was also for the edification of the people 
 in love that the feasts were to be observed as holy convocations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A repetition of the law of the sabbath in the first place. Though 
 the annual feasts were made more remarkable by the general attendance 
 at the sanctuary, yet these must not eclipse the brightness of the 
 sabbath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 They are here told,

 1. That on that day they must withdraw themselves from all the affairs
 and business of the world. It is a <I>sabbath of rest,</I> typifying 
 our spiritual rest from sin, and in God: <I>You shall do no work 
 therein.</I> On other holy days they were forbidden to do any servile 
 work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but on the sabbath, and the day of atonement (which is also called a 
 sabbath), they were to do no work at all, no, not the dressing of meat. 
 
 2. On that day they must employ themselves in the service of God.

 (1.) It is a <I>holy convocation;</I> that is, "If it lie within your
 reach, you shall sanctify it in a religious assembly: let as many as 
 can come to the door of the tabernacle, and let others meet elsewhere 
 for prayer, and praise, and the reading of the law," as in the schools 
 of the prophets, while prophecy continued, and afterwards in the 
 synagogues. Christ appointed the New-Testament sabbath to be a holy 
 convocation, by meeting his disciples once and again (and perhaps 
 oftener) on the first day of the week.

 (2.) "Whether you have opportunity of sanctifying it in a holy
 convocation or not, yet let it be <I>the sabbath of the Lord in all 
 your dwellings.</I> Put a difference between that day and other days in 
 your families. It is the <I>sabbath of the Lord,</I> the day on which 
 he rested from the work of creation, and on which he has appointed us 
 to rest; let it be observed in all your dwellings, even now that you 
 dwell in tents." Note, God's sabbaths are to be religiously observed in 
 every private house, by every family apart, as well as by many families 
 together in holy convocations. The sabbath of the Lord in our dwellings 
 will be their beauty, strength, and safety; it will sanctify, edify, 
 and glorify them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 These <I>are</I> the feasts of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> holy convocations,
 which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
 &nbsp; 5 In the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the first month at even <I>is</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s passover.
 &nbsp; 6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month <I>is</I> the feast of
 unleavened bread unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: seven days ye must eat unleavened
 bread.
 &nbsp; 7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
 do no servile work therein.
 &nbsp; 8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 seven days: in the seventh day <I>is</I> an holy convocation: ye shall
 do no servile work <I>therein.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
 ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
 the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
 firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
 &nbsp; 11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to be accepted
 for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
 it.
 &nbsp; 12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he
 lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13 And the meat offering thereof <I>shall be</I> two tenth deals of
 fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof <I>shall
 be</I> of wine, the fourth <I>part</I> of an hin.
 &nbsp; 14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
 ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
 unto your God: <I>it shall be</I> a statute for ever throughout your
 generations in all your dwellings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here again the feasts are called the <I>feasts of the Lord,</I> because 
 he appointed them. Jeroboam's feast, which he <I>devised of his own 
 heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:33">1 Kings xii. 33</A>),

 was an affront to God, and a reproach upon the people. These feasts
 were to be proclaimed in their seasons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and the seasons God chose for them were in March, May and September 
 (according to our present computation), not in winter, because 
 travelling would then be uncomfortable, when the days were short, and 
 the ways foul; not in the middle of summer, because then in those 
 countries they were gathering in their harvest and vintage, and could 
 be ill spared from their country business. Thus graciously does God 
 consult our comfort in his appointments, obliging us thereby 
 religiously to regard his glory in our observance of them, and not to 
 complain of them as a burden. The solemnities appointed them were, 

 1. Many and returned frequently, which was intended to preserve in
 them a deep sense of God and religion, and to prevent their inclining 
 to the superstitions of the heathen. God kept them fully employed in 
 his service, that they might not have time to hearken to the 
 temptations of the idolatrous neighbourhood they lived in. 

 2. They were most of them times of joy and rejoicing. The weekly 
 sabbath is so, and all their yearly solemnities, except the day of 
 atonement. God would thus teach them that wisdom's ways are 
 pleasantness, and engage them to his service by encouraging them to be 
 cheerful in it and to sing at their work. Seven days were days of 
 strict rest and holy convocations; the first day and the seventh of the 
 feast of unleavened bread, the day of pentecost, the day of the feast 
 of trumpets, the first day and the eighth of the feast of tabernacles, 
 and the day of atonement: here were six for holy joy and one only for 
 holy mourning. We are commanded to <I>rejoice evermore,</I> but not to 
 be evermore weeping. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A repetition of the law of the passover, which was to be observed on 
 the fourteenth day of the first month, in remembrance of their 
 deliverance out of Egypt and the distinguishing preservation of their 
 first-born, mercies never to be forgotten. This feast was to begin
 with the killing of the paschal lamb, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It was to continue seven days, during all which time they were to eat 
 sad bread, that was unleavened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and the first and last day of the seven were to be days of <I>holy 
 rest</I> and <I>holy convocations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 They were not idle days spent in sport and recreation (as many that are 
 called Christians spend their holy days), but offerings were <I>made by 
 fire unto the Lord</I> at his altar; and we have reason to think that 
 the people were taught to employ their time in prayer, and praise, and 
 godly meditation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An order for the offering of a sheaf of the first-fruits, upon the 
 second day of the feast of unleavened bread; the first is called the 
 <I>sabbath,</I> because it was observed as a sabbath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and, on the morrow after, they had this solemnity. A sheaf or handful
 of new corn was brought to the priest, who was to heave it up, in token 
 of his presenting it to the God of Heaven, and to wave it to and fro 
 before the Lord, as the Lord of the whole earth, and this should be 
 accepted for them as a thankful acknowledgment of God's mercy to them 
 in clothing their fields with corn, and of their dependence upon God, 
 and desire towards him, for the preserving of it to their use. For it 
 was the expression both of prayer and praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 A lamb for a burnt-offering was to be offered with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 As the sacrifice of animals was generally attended with meat-offerings, 
 so this sacrifice of corn was attended with a burnt-offering, that 
 bread and flesh might be set together on God's table. They are 
 forbidden to eat of their new corn till this handful was offered to 
 God; for it was fit, if God and Israel feast together, that he should 
 be served first. And the offering of this sheaf of first-fruits in the
 name of the whole congregation did, as it were, sanctify to them their 
 whole harvest, and give them a comfortable use of all the rest; for 
 then we may <I>eat our bread with joy</I> when we have, in some 
 measure, performed our duty to God, and God has accepted our works, for 
 thus all our enjoyments become clean to us. Now,

 1. This law was given now, though there was no occasion for putting it
 in execution till they came to Canaan: in the wilderness they sowed no 
 corn; but God's feeding them there with <I>bread from heaven</I> 
 obliged them hereafter not to grudge him his share of their bread out 
 of the earth. We find that when they came into Canaan the manna ceased 
 upon the very day that the sheaf of first-fruits was offered; they had 
 eaten of the old corn the day before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:11">Josh. v. 11</A>),

 and then on this day they offered the first-fruits, by which they
 became entitled to the new corn too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 so that there was no more occasion for manna. 

 1. This sheaf of first-fruits was typical of our Lord Jesus, who has
 risen from the dead as the <I>first-fruits of those that slept,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:20">1 Cor. xv. 20</A>.

 That <I>branch of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2">Isa. iv. 2</A>)

 was then presented to him, in virtue of the sacrifice of himself, the
 Lamb of God, and it was accepted for us. It is very observable that our 
 Lord Jesus rose from the dead on the very day that the first-fruits 
 were offered, to show that he was the substance of this shadow.

 3. We are taught by this law to <I>honour the Lord with our substance,
 and with the first-fruits of all our increase,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:9">Prov. iii. 9</A>.

 They were not to eat of their new corn till God's part was offered to
 him out of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 for we must always begin with God, begin our lives with him, begin 
 every day with him, begin every meal with him, begin every affair and 
 business with him; <I>seek first the kingdom of God.</I></P>

 sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave
 offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
 &nbsp; 16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye
 number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of
 two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
 with leaven; <I>they are</I> the firstfruits unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without
 blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams:
 they shall be <I>for</I> a burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with their
 meat offering, and their drink offerings, <I>even</I> an offering made
 by fire, of sweet savour unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
 offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
 peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
 firstfruits <I>for</I> a wave offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with the two
 lambs: they shall be holy to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for the priest.
 &nbsp; 21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, <I>that</I> it may be
 an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
 <I>therein: it shall be</I> a statute for ever in all your dwellings
 throughout your generations.
 &nbsp; 22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
 make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou
 reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest:
 thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I <I>am</I>
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the institution of the feast of <I>pentecost,</I> or 
 <I>weeks,</I> as it is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+16:9">Deut. xvi. 9</A>),

 because it was observed fifty days, or seven weeks, after the passover.
 It is also called the <I>feast of harvest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:16">Exod. xxiii. 16</A>.

 For as the presenting of the sheaf of first-fruits was an introduction
 to the harvest, and gave them liberty to put in the sickle, so they 
 solemnized the finishing of their corn-harvest at this feast.

 1. Then they offered a handful of ears of barley, now they offered
 <I>two loaves of wheaten bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This was leavened. At the passover they ate unleavened bread, because 
 it was in remembrance of the bread they ate when they came out of 
 Egypt, which was unleavened; but now at pentecost it was leavened, 
 because it was an acknowledgment of God's goodness to them in their 
 ordinary food, which was leavened.

 2. With that sheaf of first-fruits they offered only one lamb for a
 burnt-offering, but with these loaves of first-fruits they offered 
 seven lambs, two rams, and one bullock, all for a burnt-offering, so 
 giving glory to God, as the Lord of their land and the Lord of their 
 harvest, by whose favour they lived and to whose praise they ought to 
 live. They offered likewise a kid for a sin-offering, so taking shame 
 to themselves as unworthy of the bread they ate, and imploring pardon 
 for their sins, by which they had forfeited their harvest-mercies, and 
 which they had been guilty of in the receiving of them. And lastly, two 
 lambs for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, to beg a blessing upon the 
 corn they had gathered in, which would be neither sure nor sweet to 
 them without that blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9">Hag. i. 9</A>.

 These were the only peace-offerings that were offered on the behalf of
 the whole congregation, and they were reckoned <I>most holy</I> 
 offerings, whereas other peace-offerings were but <I>holy.</I> All 
 these offerings are here appointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 3. That one day was to be kept with a holy convocation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It was one of the days on which all Israel was to meet God and one 
 another, at the place which the Lord should choose. Some suggest that 
 whereas seven days were to make up the feast of unleavened bread there 
 was only one day appointed for the feast of pentecost, because this was 
 a busy time of the year with them, and God allowed them speedily to 
 return to their work in the country. This annual feast was instituted 
 in remembrance of the giving of the law upon mount Sinai, the fiftieth 
 day after they came out of Egypt. That was the feast which they were 
 told in Egypt must be observed to God in the wilderness, as a memorial 
 of which ever after they kept this feast. But the period and
 perfection of this feast was the pouring out of the Spirit upon the 
 apostles on the day of this feast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1">Acts ii. 1</A>),

 in which the law of faith was given, fifty days after Christ our
 passover was sacrificed for us. And on that day (as bishop Patrick well 
 expresses it) the apostles, having themselves received the 
 <I>first-fruits of the Spirit,</I> begat three thousand souls, through 
 the word of truth, and presented them, as the first-fruits of the 
 Christian church, to God and the Lamb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To the institution of the feast of pentecost is annexed a repetition of 
 that law which we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:9"><I>ch.</I> xix. 9</A>),

 by which they were required to leave the gleanings of their fields, and
 the corn that grew on the ends of the butts, for the poor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Probably it comes in here as a thing which the priests must take 
 occasion to remind the people of, when they brought their first-fruits, 
 intimating to them that to obey even in this small matter was better 
 than sacrifice, and that, unless they were obedient, their offerings 
 should not be accepted. It also taught them that the joy of harvest 
 should express itself in charity to the poor, who must have their due 
 out of what we have, as well as God his. Those that are truly sensible 
 of the mercy they receive from God will without grudging show mercy to 
 the poor.</P>

 &nbsp; 25 Ye shall do no servile work <I>therein</I>: but ye shall offer an
 offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 27 Also on the tenth <I>day</I> of this seventh month <I>there shall
 be</I> a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
 and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
 fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it <I>is</I> a day
 of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your
 God.
 &nbsp; 29 For whatsoever soul <I>it be</I> that shall not be afflicted in
 that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
 &nbsp; 30 And whatsoever soul <I>it be</I> that doeth any work in that same
 day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
 &nbsp; 31 Ye shall do no manner of work: <I>it shall be</I> a statute for
 ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
 &nbsp; 32 It <I>shall be</I> unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall
 afflict your souls: in the ninth <I>day</I> of the month at even, from
 even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

 Here is, 

 I. The institution of the feast of trumpets, on the first day of the 
 seventh month,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 That which was now the seventh month had been reckoned the first month, 
 and the year of jubilee was still to begin with this month 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:8"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 8</A>),

 so that this was their new year's day. It was to be as their other
 yearly sabbaths, a day of holy rest--<I>You shall do no servile work 
 therein;</I> and a day of holy work--<I>You shall offer an offering to 
 the Lord;</I> concerning these particular directions were afterwards 
 given,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:1">Num. xxix. 1</A>.

 That which is here made peculiar to this festival is that it was <I>a
 memorial of blowing of trumpets.</I> They blew the trumpet every new 
 moon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:3">Ps. lxxxi. 3</A>),

 but in the new moon of the seventh month it was to be done with more
 than ordinary solemnity; for they began to blow at sun-rise and 
 continued till sun-set. Now,

 1. This is here said to be a <I>memorial,</I> perhaps of the sound of
 the trumpet upon mount Sinai when the law was given, which must never 
 be forgotten. Some think that it was a memorial of the creation of the 
 world, which is supposed to have been in autumn; for which reason this 
 was, till now, the first month. The mighty word by which God made the 
 world is called <I>the voice of his thunder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7">Ps. civ. 7</A>);

 fitly therefore was it commemorated by blowing of trumpets, or a
 memorial of <I>shouting,</I> as the Chaldee renders it; for, when the 
 <I>foundations of the earth were fastened, all the sons of God shouted 
 for joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:6,7">Job xxxviii. 6, 7</A>.

 2. The Jewish writers suppose it to have a spiritual signification.
 Now at the beginning of the year they were called by this sound of 
 trumpet to shake off their spiritual drowsiness, to search and try 
 their ways, and to amend them: the day of atonement was the ninth day 
 after this; and thus they were awakened to prepare for that day, by 
 sincere and serious repentance, that it might be indeed to them a day 
 of atonement. And they say, "The devout Jews exercised themselves more 
 in good works between the feast of trumpets and the day of expiation 
 than at any other time of the year." 

 3. It was typical of the preaching of the gospel, by which joyful sound
 souls were to be called in to serve God and keep a spiritual feast to 
 him. The conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ is said to
 be by the <I>blowing of a great trumpet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:13">Isa. xxvii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A repetition of the law of the day of atonement, that is, so much 
 of it as concerned the people. 

 1. They must on this day rest from all manner of work, and not only
 from servile works as on other annual festivals; it must be as strict a 
 rest as that of the weekly sabbath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:28,30,31"><I>v.</I> 28, 30, 31</A>.

 The reason is: <I>For it is a day of atonement.</I> Note, The humbling 
 of our souls for sin, and the making of our peace with God, is work 
 that requires the whole man, and the closest application of mind 
 imaginable, and all little enough. He that would do the work of a day 
 of atonement in its day, as it should be done, had need lay aside the 
 thoughts of every thing else. On that day God <I>spoke peace unto his 
 people, and unto his saints;</I> and therefore they must lay aside all 
 their worldly business, that they might the more clearly and the more 
 reverently hear that voice of joy and gladness. Fasting days should be 
 days of rest.

 2. They must afflict their souls, and this upon pain of being cut off
 by the hand of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:27,29,32"><I>v.</I> 27, 29, 32</A>.

 They must mortify the body, and deny the appetites of it, in token of 
 their sorrow for the sins they had committed, and the mortifying of 
 their indwelling corruptions. Every soul must be afflicted, because
 every soul was polluted, and guilty before God; while none have 
 fulfilled the law of innocency none are exempt from the law of 
 repentance, besides that every man must sigh and cry for the 
 <I>abominations of the land.</I>

 3. The entire day must be observed: <I>From even to even you shall
 afflict your souls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 that is, "You shall begin your fast, and the expressions of your 
 humiliation, in the <I>ninth day of the month at even.</I>" They were 
 to leave off all their worldly labour, and compose themselves to the 
 work of the day approaching, some time before sun-set on the ninth day, 
 and not to take any food (except children and sick people) till after 
 sun-set on the tenth day. Note, The eves of solemn days ought to be 
 employed in solemn preparation. When work for God and our souls is to 
 be done, we should not straiten ourselves in time for the doing of it; 
 for how can we spend our time better? Of this sabbath the rule here 
 given is to be understood: <I>From even unto even shall you celebrate 
 your sabbath.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 35 On the first day <I>shall be</I> an holy convocation: ye shall do

 the eighth day <I>shall be</I> a sabbath.

 trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and
 willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your

 shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

 Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of

 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The institution of the feast of tabernacles, which was one of the 
 three great feasts at which all the males were bound to attend, and 
 celebrated with more expressions of joy than any of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As to the directions for regulating this feast, observe, 

 (1.) It was to be observed <I>on the fifteenth day of the seventh
 month</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 but five days after the day of atonement. We may suppose, though they 
 were not all bound to attend on the day of atonement, as on the three 
 great festivals, yet that many of the devout Jews came up so many days 
 before the feast of tabernacles as to enjoy the opportunity of 
 attending on the day of atonement. Now, 

 [1.] The afflicting of their souls on the day of atonement prepared
 them for the joy of the feast of tabernacles. The more we are grieved 
 and humbled for sin, the better qualified we are for the comforts of 
 the Holy Ghost. 

 [2.] The joy of this feast recompensed them for the sorrow of that
 fast; for those that <I>sow in tears</I> shall <I>reap in joy.</I>

 (2.) It was to continue eight days, the first and last of which were to
 be observed as sabbaths, days of holy rest and holy convocations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:35,36,39"><I>v.</I> 35, 36, 39</A>.

 The sacrifices to be offered on these eight days we have a very large 
 appointment of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:12-39">Num. xxix. 12</A>, &c.

 (3.) During the first seven days of this feast all the people were to
 leave their houses, and the women and children in them, and to dwell in 
 booths made of the boughs of thick trees, particularly palm trees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40,42"><I>v.</I> 40, 42</A>.

 The Jews make the taking of the branches to be a distinct ceremony from 
 the making of the booths. It is said, indeed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:15">Neh. viii. 15</A>),

 that they <I>made their booths of the branches of trees,</I> which they
 might do, and yet use that further expression of joy, the carrying of 
 palm-branches in their hands, which appears to have been a token of 
 triumph upon other occasions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:13">John xii. 13</A>),

 and is alluded to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.

 The eighth day some make a distinct feast of itself, but it is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">John vii. 37</A>)

 <I>that great day of the feast;</I> it was the day on which they
 returned from their booths, to settle again in their own houses.

 (4.) They were to <I>rejoice before the Lord God</I> during all the
 time of this feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The tradition of the Jews is that they were to express their joy by 
 dancing, and singing hymns of praise to God, with musical instruments: 
 and not the common people only, but the wise men of Israel, and their 
 elders, were to do it in the court of the sanctuary: for (say they) the 
 joy with which a man rejoices in doing a commandment is really a great 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As to the design of this feast,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was to be kept in remembrance of their dwelling in tents in the 
 wilderness. Thus it is expounded here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>That your generations may know,</I> not only by the written history, 
 but by this ocular tradition, <I>that I made the children of Israel to 
 dwell in booths.</I> Thus it kept in perpetual remembrance, 

 [1.] The meanness of their beginning, and the low and desolate state
 out of which God advanced that people. Note, Those that are comfortably 
 fixed ought often to call to mind their former unsettled state, when 
 they were but little in their own eyes. 

 [2.] The mercy of God to them, that, when they dwelt in tabernacles,
 God not only set up a tabernacle for himself among them, but, with the 
 utmost care and tenderness imaginable, hung a canopy over them, even 
 the cloud that sheltered them from the heat of the sun. God's former 
 mercies to us and our fathers ought to be kept in everlasting 
 remembrance. The eighth day was the great day of this feast, because 
 then they returned to their own houses again, and remembered how, after 
 they had long dwelt in tents in the wilderness, at length they came to 
 a happy settlement in the land of promise, where they dwelt in goodly 
 houses. And they would the more sensibly value and be thankful for the 
 comforts and conveniences of their houses when they had been seven days 
 dwelling in booths. It is good for those that have ease and plenty 
 sometimes to learn what it is to endure hardness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was a feast of in-gathering, so it is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:16">Exod. xxiii. 16</A>.

 When they had gathered in the <I>fruit of their land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 the vintage as well as the harvest, then they were to keep this feast 
 in thankfulness to God for all the increase of the year; and some think 
 that the eighth day of the feast had special reference to this ground 
 of the institution. Note, The joy of harvest ought to be improved for 
 the furtherance of our joy in God. <I>The earth is the Lord's and the 
 fulness thereof,</I> and therefore whatever we have the comfort of he 
 must have the glory of, especially when any mercy is perfected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It was a typical feast. It is supposed by many that our blessed 
 Saviour was born much about the time of this feast; then he left his 
 mansions of light above to <I>tabernacle among us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>), 

 and he dwelt in booths. And the worship of God under the New Testament
 is prophesied of under the notion of keeping the <I>feast of 
 tabernacles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:16">Zech. xiv. 16</A>.

 For,

 [1.] The gospel of Christ teaches us to dwell in tabernacles, to sit
 loose to this world, as those that have here no continuing city, but by 
 faith, and hope and holy contempt of present things, to <I>go out to 
 Christ without the camp,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13,14">Heb. xiii. 13, 14</A>.

 [2.] It teaches us to rejoice before the Lord our God. Those are the
 circumcision, Israelites indeed, that always <I>rejoice in Christ 
 Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>.

 And the more we are taken off from this world the less liable we are to
 the interruption of our joys.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The summary and conclusion of these institutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God appointed these feasts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>),

 <I>besides the sabbaths and your free-will offerings.</I> This teaches 
 us,

 (1.) That calls to extraordinary services will not excuse us from our
 constant stated performances. Within the days of the feast of 
 tabernacles there must fall at least one sabbath, which must be as 
 strictly observed as any other. 

 (2.) That God's institutions leave room for free-will offerings. Not
 that we may invent what he never instituted, but we may repeat what he 
 has instituted, ordinarily, the oftener the better. God is well pleased 
 with a willing people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses declared them to the children of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 He let them know what God appointed, and neither more nor less. Thus 
 Paul delivered to the churches what he had <I>received from the 
 Lord.</I> We have reason to be thankful that the feasts of the Lord, 
 declared unto us, are not so numerous, nor the observance of them so 
 burdensome and costly, as theirs then were, but more spiritual and 
 significant, and surer sweeter earnests of the everlasting feast, at 
 the last in-gathering, which we hope to be celebrating to eternity.</P>
