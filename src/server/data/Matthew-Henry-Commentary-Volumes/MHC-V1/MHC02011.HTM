 Pharaoh had told Moses to get out of his presence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:28"><I>ch.</I> x. 28</A>),

 and Moses had promised this should be the last time he would trouble
 him, yet he resolves to say out what he had to say, before he left him; 
 accordingly, we have in this chapter,

 I. The instructions God had given to Moses, which he was now to
 pursue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 together with the interest Israel and Moses had in the esteem of the
 Egyptians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:3">ver. 3</A>.

 II. The last message Moses delivered to Pharaoh, concerning the death
 of the firstborn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 III. A repetition of the prediction of Pharaoh's hardening his
 heart,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:9">ver. 9</A>),

 and the event answering to it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:10">
 ver. 10</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague
 <I>more</I> upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you
 go hence: when he shall let <I>you</I> go, he shall surely thrust you
 out hence altogether.
 &nbsp; 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
 of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
 silver, and jewels of gold.
 &nbsp; 3 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave the people favour in the sight of the
 Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses <I>was</I> very great in the land of
 Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of
 the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The high favour Moses and Israel were in with God. 1. Moses
 was a favourite of Heaven, for God will not hide from him the thing he 
 will do. God not only makes him his messenger to deliver his errands, 
 but communicates to him his purpose (as the man of his counsel) that he 
 would bring one plague more, and but one, upon Pharaoh, by which he 
 would complete the deliverance of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Moses longed to see an end of this dreadful work, to see Egypt no more 
 plagued and Israel no more oppressed: "Well," says God, "now it is near 
 an end; the warfare shall shortly be accomplished, the point gained; 
 Pharaoh shall be forced to own himself conquered, and to give up the 
 cause." After all the rest of the plagues, God says, <I>I will bring 
 one more.</I> Thus, after all the judgments executed upon sinners in 
 this world, still there is one more reserved to be brought on them in 
 the other world, which will completely humble those whom nothing else 
 would humble. 2. The Israelites were favourites of Heaven; for God
 himself espouses their injured cause, and takes care to see them paid 
 for all their pains in serving the Egyptians. This was the last day of 
 their servitude; they were about to go away, and their masters, who had 
 abused them in their work, would not have defrauded them of their 
 wages, and have sent them away empty; while the poor Israelites were so 
 fond of liberty that they would be satisfied with that, without pay, 
 and would rejoice to get that upon any terms: but he that <I>executeth 
 righteousness and judgment for the oppressed</I> provided that the 
 labourers should not lose their hire, and ordered them to demand it now 
 at their departure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>in jewels of silver and jewels of gold,</I> to prepare for which 
 God, by the plagues, had now made the Egyptians as willing to part with 
 them upon any terms as, before, the Egyptians, by their severities, had 
 made them willing to go upon any terms. Though the patient Israelites 
 were content to lose their wages, yet God would not let them go without 
 them. Note, One way or other, God will give redress to the injured, who 
 in a humble silence commit their cause to him; and he will see to it 
 that none be losers at last by their patient suffering any more than by 
 their services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The high favour Moses and Israel were in with the Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 1. Even the people that has been hated and despised now came to be
 respected; the wonders wrought on their behalf put an honour upon them 
 and made them considerable. How great do they become for whom God thus 
 fights! Thus <I>the Lord gave them favour</I> in the sight of the 
 Egyptians, by making it appear how much he favoured them: he also 
 changed the spirit of the Egyptians towards them, and made them to be 
 pitied of their oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>.

 2. <I>The man Moses was very great.</I> How could it be otherwise when
 they saw what power he was clothed with, and what wonders were wrought 
 by his hand? Thus the apostles, though otherwise despicable men, came 
 to be magnified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:13">Acts v. 13</A>.

 Those that honour God he will honour; and with respect to those that
 approve themselves faithful to him, how meanly soever they may pass 
 through this world, there is a day coming when they will look great, 
 very great, in the eyes of all the world, even theirs who now look upon 
 them with the utmost contempt. Observe, Though Pharaoh hated Moses, 
 there were those of Pharaoh's servants that respected him. Thus in 
 Caesar's household, even Nero's, there were some that had an esteem for 
 blessed Paul,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And Moses said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, About midnight will I go
 out into the midst of Egypt:
 &nbsp; 5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from
 the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
 the firstborn of the maidservant that <I>is</I> behind the mill; and
 all the firstborn of beasts.
 &nbsp; 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
 Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any
 more.
 &nbsp; 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog
 move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
 &nbsp; 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
 down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people
 that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out
 from Pharaoh in a great anger.
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
 you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh:
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
 the children of Israel go out of his land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Warning is here given to Pharaoh of the last and conquering plague 
 which was now to be inflicted. This was the <I>death of all the 
 first-born in</I> Egypt at once, which had been first threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23</A>,

 <I>I will slay thy son, thy first-born</I>), but is last executed; less
 judgments were tried, which, if they had done the work would have 
 prevented this. See how slow God is to wrath, and how willing to be met 
 with in the way of his judgments, and to have his anger turned away, 
 and particularly how precious the lives of men are in his eyes: if the 
 death of their cattle had humbled and reformed them, their children 
 would have been spared; but, if men will not improve the gradual 
 advances of divine judgments, they must thank themselves if they find, 
 in the issue, that the worst was reserved for the last. 1. The plague 
 itself is here particularly foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 The time is fixed--about midnight, the very next midnight, the dead 
 time of the night; when they were all asleep, all their first-born 
 should sleep the sleep of death, not silently and insensibly, so as not 
 to be discovered till morning, but so as to rouse the families at 
 midnight to stand by and see them die. The extent of this plague is 
 described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The prince that was to succeed in the throne was not too high to be 
 reached by it, nor were the slaves at the mill too low to be taken 
 notice of. Moses and Aaron were not ordered to summon this plague; no 
 <I>I will go out, saith the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God;</I> 
 what is hell but this? 2. The special protection which the children of
 Israel should be under, and the manifest difference that should be put 
 between them and the Egyptians. While angels drew their swords against 
 the Egyptians, there should not so much as a dog bark at any of the 
 children of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 An earnest was hereby given of the difference which shall be put in the 
 great day between God's people and his enemies: did men know what a 
 difference God puts, and will put to eternity, between those that serve 
 him and those that serve him not, religion would not seem to them such 
 an indifferent thing as they make it, nor would they act in it with so 
 much indifference as they do. 3. The humble submission which Pharaoh's
 servants should make to Moses, and how submissively they should request 
 him to go

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They shall come down, and bow themselves.</I> Note, The proud 
 enemies of God and his Israel shall be made to fall under at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>),

 and shall be found liars to them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29">Deut. xxxiii. 29</A>.

 When Moses had thus delivered his message, it is said, <I>He went out
 from Pharaoh in a great anger,</I> though he was the meekest of all the 
 men of the earth. Probably he expected that the very threatening of the 
 death of the firstborn would have induced Pharaoh to comply, especially 
 as Pharaoh had complied so far already, and had seen how exactly all 
 Moses's predictions hitherto were fulfilled. But it had not that 
 effect; his proud heart would not yield, no, not to save all the 
 firstborn of his kingdom: no marvel that men are not deterred from 
 vicious courses by the prospects given them of eternal misery in the 
 other world, when the imminent peril they run of the loss of all that 
 is dear to them in this world will not frighten them. Moses, hereupon,
 was provoked to a holy indignation, being grieved (as our Saviour 
 afterwards) for the <I>hardness of his heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5">Mark iii. 5</A>.

 Note, It is a great vexation to the spirits of good ministers to see
 people deaf to all the fair warnings given them, and running headlong 
 upon ruin, notwithstanding all the kind methods taken to prevent it. 
 Thus Ezekiel went in <I>the bitterness of his spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:14">Ezek. iii. 14</A>),

 because God had told him that the house of Israel would not hearken to
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 To be angry at nothing but sin is the way not to sin in anger. Moses, 
 having thus adverted to the disturbance which Pharaoh's obstinacy gave 
 him, (1.) Reflects upon the previous notice God had given him of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken to you.</I> The 
 scripture has foretold the incredulity of those who should hear the 
 gospel, that it might not be a surprise nor stumbling-block to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:37,38,Ro+10:16">John xii. 37, 38; Rom. x. 16</A>.

 Let us think never the worse of the gospel of Christ for the slights
 men generally put upon it, for we were told before what cold 
 entertainment it would meet with. (2.) He recapitulates all he had said 
 before to this purport

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that Moses did all these wonders, as they are here related, before 
 Pharaoh (he himself was an eye-witness of them), and yet he could not 
 prevail, which was a certain sign that God himself had, in a way of 
 righteous judgment, hardened his heart. Thus the Jews' rejection of the 
 gospel of Christ was so gross an absurdity that it might easily be 
 inferred from it that <I>God had given them the spirit of slumber,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>.</P>
