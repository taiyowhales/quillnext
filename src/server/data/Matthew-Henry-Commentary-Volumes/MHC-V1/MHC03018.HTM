 Here is, 

 I. A general law against all conformity to the corrupt usages of the
 heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Particular laws,

 1. Against incest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:6-18">ver. 6-18</A>.

 2. Against beastly lusts, and barbarous idolatries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>.

 III. The enforcement of these laws from the ruin of the Canaanites,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt,
 shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan,
 whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in
 their ordinances.
 &nbsp; 4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
 therein: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
 if a man do, he shall live in them: I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After divers ceremonial institutions, God here returns to the 
 enforcement of moral precepts. The former are still of use to us as 
 types, the latter still binding as laws. We have here, 

 1. The sacred authority by which these laws are enacted: <I>I am the
 Lord your God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:1,4,30"><I>v.</I> 1, 4, 30</A>),

 and <I>I am the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:5,6,21"><I>v.</I> 5, 6, 21</A>.

 "The Lord, who has a right to rule all; your God, who has a peculiar 
 right to rule you." Jehovah is the fountain of being, and therefore the 
 fountain of power, whose we are, whom we are bound to serve, and who is 
 able to punish all disobedience. "Your God to whom you have consented, 
 in whom you are happy, to whom you lie under the highest obligations 
 imaginable, and to whom you are accountable."

 2. A strict caution to take heed of retaining the relics of the
 idolatries of Egypt, where they had dwelt, and of receiving the 
 infection of the idolatries of Canaan, whither they were now going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Now that God was by Moses teaching them his ordinances there was 
 <I>aliquid dediscendum--something to be unlearned,</I> which they had 
 sucked in with their milk in Egypt, a country noted for idolatry: 
 <I>You shall not do after the doings of the land of Egypt.</I> It would 
 be the greatest absurdity in itself to retain such an affection for 
 their house of bondage as to be governed in their devotions by the 
 usages of it, and the greatest ingratitude to God, who had so 
 wonderfully and graciously delivered them. Nay, as if governed by a 
 spirit of contradiction, they would be in danger, even after they had 
 received these ordinances of God, of admitting the wicked usages of the 
 Canaanites and of inheriting their vices with their land. Of this 
 danger they are here warned, <I>You shall not walk in their 
 ordinances.</I> Such a tyrant is custom that their practices are called 
 <I>ordinances,</I> and they became rivals even with God's ordinances, 
 and God's professing people were in danger of receiving law from them.

 3. A solemn charge to them to <I>keep God's judgments, statutes, and
 ordinances,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 To this charge, and many similar ones, David seems to refer in the many 
 prayers and professions he makes relating to God's laws in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119">119th Psalm</A>.

 Observe here,

 (1.) The great rule of our obedience--God's statutes and judgments.
 These we must <I>keep to walk therein.</I> We must keep them in our 
 books, and keep them in our hands, that we may practise them in our 
 hearts and lives. <I>Remember God's commandments to do them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:18">Ps. ciii. 18</A>.

 We must keep in them as our way to travel in, keep to them as our rule
 to work by, keep them as our treasure, as the apple of our eye, with 
 the utmost care and value.

 (2.) The great advantage of our obedience: <I>Which if a man do, he
 shall live in them,</I> that is, "he shall be happy here and 
 hereafter." We have reason to thank God,

 [1.] That this is still in force as a promise, with a very favourable
 construction of the condition. If we keep God's commandments in 
 sincerity, though we come short of sinless perfection, we shall find 
 that the way of duty is the way of comfort, and will be the way to 
 happiness. Godliness has the <I>promise of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8">1 Tim. iv. 8</A>.

 Wisdom has said, <I>Keep my commandments and live:</I> and <I>if
 through the Spirit we mortify the deeds of the body</I> (which are to 
 us as the usages of Egypt were to Israel) <I>we shall live.</I>

 [2.] That it is not so in force in the nature of a covenant as that the
 least transgression shall for ever exclude us from this life. The 
 apostle quotes this twice as opposite to the faith which the gospel 
 reveals. It is the description of the <I>righteousness which is by the 
 law, the man that doeth them shall live</I> <B><I>en 
 autois</I></B>--<I>in them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:5">Rom. x. 5</A>),

 and is urged to prove that <I>the law is not of faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:12">Gal. iii. 12</A>.

 The alteration which the gospel has made is in the last word: still
 <I>the man that does them shall live,</I> but not live <I>in them;</I> 
 for the law could not give life, because we could not perfectly keep 
 it; it was <I>weak through the flesh,</I> not in itself; but now <I>the 
 man that does them</I> shall <I>live by the faith of the Son of 
 God.</I> He shall owe his life to the grace of Christ, and not to the 
 merit of his own works; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:21,22">Gal. iii. 21, 22</A>.

 <I>The just shall live,</I> but they shall live <I>by faith,</I> by
 virtue of their union with Christ, who is their life.</P>

 These laws relate to the seventh commandment, and, no doubt, are 
 obligatory on us under the gospel, for they are consonant to the very 
 light and law of nature: one of the articles, that of a man's having 
 his father's wife, the apostle speaks of as a sin <I>not so much as 
 named among the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>.

 Though some of the incests here forbidden were practised by some
 particular persons among the heathen, yet they were disallowed and 
 detested, unless among those nations who had become barbarous, and were 
 quite given up to vile affections. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That which is forbidden as to the relations here specified is 
 <I>approaching to them to uncover their nakedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is chiefly intended to forbid the marrying of any of these 
 relations. Marriage is a divine institution; this and the sabbath, the 
 eldest of all, of equal standing with man upon the earth: it is 
 intended for the comfort of human life, and the decent and honourable 
 propagation of the human race, such as became the dignity of man's 
 nature above that of the beasts. It is <I>honourable in all,</I> and 
 these laws are for the support of the honour of it. It was requisite 
 that a divine ordinance should be subject to divine rules and 
 restraints, especially because it concerns a thing wherein the corrupt 
 nature of man is as apt as in any thing to be wilful and impetuous in 
 its desires, and impatient of check. Yet these prohibitions, besides 
 their being enacted by an incontestable authority, are in themselves 
 highly reasonable and equitable. 

 (1.) By marriage two were to become one flesh, therefore those that
 before were in a sense one flesh by nature could not, without the 
 greatest absurdity, become one flesh by institution; for the 
 institution was designed to unite those who before were not united. 
 
 (2.) Marriage puts an equality between husband and wife. "Is she not
 thy companion taken out of thy side?" Therefore, if those who before 
 were superior and inferior should intermarry (which is the case in most 
 of the instances here laid down), the order of nature would be taken 
 away by a positive institution, which must by no means be allowed. The 
 inequality between master and servant, noble and ignoble, is founded in 
 consent and custom, and there is no harm done if that be taken away by 
 the equality of marriage; but the inequality between parents and 
 children, uncles and nieces, aunts and nephews, either by blood or 
 marriage, is founded in nature, and is therefore perpetual, and cannot 
 without confusion be taken away by the equality of marriage, the 
 institution of which, though ancient, is subsequent to the order of 
 nature. 

 (3.) No relations that are equals are forbidden, except brothers and
 sisters, by the whole blood or half blood, or by marriage; and in this 
 there is not the same natural absurdity as in the former, for Adam's 
 sons must of necessity have married their own sisters; but it was 
 requisite that it should be made by a positive law unlawful and 
 detestable, for the preventing of sinful familiarities between those 
 that in the days of their youth are supposed to live in a house 
 together, and yet cannot intermarry without defeating one of the 
 intentions of marriage, which is the enlargement of friendship and 
 interest. If every man married his own sister (as they would be apt to 
 do from generation to generation if it were lawful), each family would 
 be a world to itself, and it would be forgotten that <I>we are members 
 one of another.</I> It is certain that this has always been looked upon 
 by the more sober heathen as a most infamous and abominable thing; and 
 those who had not this law yet were herein a law to themselves. The 
 making use of the ordinance of marriage for the patronizing of 
 incestuous mixtures is so far from justifying them, or extenuating 
 their guilt, that it adds the guilt of profaning an ordinance of God, 
 and prostituting that to the vilest of purposes which was instituted 
 for the noblest ends. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Uncleanness, committed with any of these relations out of marriage, 
 is likewise, without doubt, forbidden here, and no less intended than 
 the former: as also all lascivious carriage, wanton dalliance, and 
 every thing that has the appearance of this evil. Relations must love 
 one another, and are to have free and familiar converse with each 
 other, but it must be with all purity; and the less it is suspected of 
 evil by others the more care ought the persons themselves to take that 
 <I>Satan do not get advantage against them,</I> for he is a very subtle 
 enemy, and seeks all occasions against us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The relations forbidden are most of them plainly described; and it 
 is generally laid down as a rule that what relations of a man's own he 
 is bound up from marrying the same relations of his wife he is likewise 
 forbidden to marry, for they two are one. That law which forbids 
 marrying a brother's wife 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 had an exception peculiar to the Jewish state, that, if a man died 
 without issue, his brother or next of kin should marry the widow, and 
 raise up seed to the deceased 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5">Deut. xxv. 5</A>),

 for reasons which held good only in that commonwealth; and therefore
 now that those reasons have ceased the exception ceases, and the law is 
 in force, that a man must in no case marry his brother's widow. That 
 article

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)
 
 which forbids a man to <I>take a wife to her sister</I> supposes a 
 connivance at polygamy, as some other laws then did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:10,De+21:15">Exod. xxi. 10; Deut. xxi. 15</A>),

 but forbids a man's marrying two sisters, as Jacob did, because between
 those who had before been equal there would be apt to arise greater 
 jealousies and animosities than between wives that were not so nearly 
 related. If the sister of the wife be taken for the concubine, or 
 secondary wife, nothing can be more vexing in her life, or as long as 
 she lives.</P>

 &nbsp; 20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's

 &nbsp; 21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through <I>the

 &nbsp; 27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
 which <I>were</I> before you, and the land is defiled;)
 &nbsp; 28 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as
 it spued out the nations that <I>were</I> before you.
 &nbsp; 29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even
 the souls that commit <I>them</I> shall be cut off from among their

 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A law to preserve the honour of the marriage-bed, that it should not
 be unseasonably used 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 nor invaded by an adulterer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law against that which was the most unnatural idolatry, causing 
 their children to <I>pass through the fire to Moloch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Moloch (as some think) was the idol in and by which they worshipped the 
 sun, that great fire of the world; and therefore in the worship of it 
 they made their own children either sacrifices to this idol, burning 
 them to death before it, or devotees to it, causing them to pass 
 between two fires, as some think, or to be thrown through one, to the 
 honour of this pretended deity, imagining that the consecrating of but 
 one of their children in this manner to Moloch would procure good 
 fortune for all the rest of their children. Did idolaters thus give 
 their own children to false gods, and shall we think any thing too dear 
 to be dedicated to, or to be parted with for, the true God? See how 
 this sin of Israel (which they were afterwards guilty of, 
 notwithstanding this law) is aggravated by the relation which they and 
 their children stood in to God. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20">Ezek. xvi. 20</A>,

 <I>Thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne
 unto me, and these thou hast sacrificed.</I> Therefore it is here 
 called <I>profaning the name of their</I> God; for it looked as if they 
 thought they were under greater obligations to Moloch than to Jehovah; 
 for to him they offered their cattle only, but to Moloch their 
 children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A law against unnatural lusts, sodomy and bestiality, sins not to 
 be named nor thought of without the utmost abhorrence imaginable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 Other sins level men with the beasts, but these sink them much lower. 
 That ever there should have been occasion for the making of these laws, 
 and that since they are published they should ever have been broken, is 
 the perpetual reproach and scandal of human nature; and the giving of 
 men up to these vile affections was frequently the punishment of their 
 idolatries; so the apostle shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24">Rom. i. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Arguments against these and the like abominable wickednesses. He
 that has an indisputable right to command us, yet because he will deal 
 with us as men, and <I>draw with the cords of a man,</I> condescends to 
 reason with us. 

 1. Sinners defile themselves with these abominations: <I>Defile not
 yourselves in any of these things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 All sin is defiling to the conscience, but these are sins that have a 
 peculiar turpitude in them. Our heavenly Father, in kindness to us, 
 requires of us that we keep ourselves clean, and do not wallow in the 
 dirt.

 2. <I>The souls that commit them shall be cut off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 And justly; for, <I>if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God 
 destroy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:17">1 Cor. iii. 17</A>.

 Fleshly lusts war against the soul, and will certainly be the ruin of
 it if God's mercy and grace prevent not.

 3. <I>The land is defiled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If such wickednesses as these be practised and connived at, the land is 
 thereby made unfit to have God's tabernacle in it, and the pure and 
 holy God will withdraw the tokens of his gracious presence from it. It 
 is also rendered unwholesome to the inhabitants, who are hereby 
 infected with sin and exposed to plagues and it is really nauseous and 
 loathsome to all good men in it, as the wickedness of Sodom was to the 
 soul of righteous Lot.

 4. These have been the abominations of the former inhabitants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:24,27"><I>v.</I> 24, 27</A>.

 Therefore it was necessary that these laws should be made, as antidotes
 and preservatives from the plague are necessary when we go into an 
 infected place. And therefore they should not practise any such things, 
 because the nations that had practised them now lay under the curse of 
 God, and were shortly to fall by the sword of Israel. They could not 
 but be sensible how odious those people had made themselves who 
 wallowed in this mire, and how they stank in the nostrils of all good 
 men; and shall a people sanctified and dignified as Israel was make 
 themselves thus vile? When we observe how ill sin looks in others we 
 should use this as an argument with ourselves with the utmost care and 
 caution to preserve our purity.

 5. For these and the like sins the Canaanites were to be destroyed;
 these filled the measure of the Amorites' iniquity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:16">Gen. xv. 16</A>),

 and brought down that destruction of so many populous kingdoms which 
 the Israelites were now shortly to be not only the spectators, but the 
 instruments of: <I>Therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Note, The tremendous judgments of God, executed on those that are 
 daringly profane and atheistical, are intended as warnings to those who 
 profess religion to take heed of every thing that has the least 
 appearance of, or tendency towards, profaneness or atheism. Even the 
 ruin of the Canaanites is an admonition to the Israelites not to do 
 like them. Nay, to show that not only the Creator is provoked, but the 
 creation burdened, by such abominations as these, it is added

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>The land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.</I> The very ground 
 they went upon did, as it were, groan under them, and was sick of them, 
 and not easy till it had discharged itself of these <I>enemies of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:24">Isa. i. 24</A>.

 This bespeaks the extreme loathsomeness of sin; sinful man indeed
 <I>drinks in iniquity like water,</I> but the harmless part of the 
 creation even heaves at it, and rises against it.  Many a house and 
 many a town have spued out the wicked inhabitants, as it were, with 
 abhorrence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:16">Rev. iii. 16</A>.

 Therefore take heed, saith God, <I>that the land spue not you out
 also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It was secured to them, and entailed upon them, and yet they must 
 expect that, if they made the vices of the Canaanites their own, with 
 their land their fate would be the same. Note, Wicked Israelites are as 
 abominable to God as wicked Canaanites, and more so, and will be as 
 soon spued out, or sooner. Such a warning as was here given to the 
 Israelites is given by the apostle to the Gentile converts, with 
 reference to the rejected Jews, in whose room they were substituted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:19">Rom. xi. 19</A>,

 &c.); they must take heed of falling <I>after the same example of
 unbelief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:11">Heb. iv. 11</A>.

 Apply it more generally; and let it deter us effectually from all
 sinful courses to consider how many they have been the ruin of. Lay the 
 ear of faith to the gates of the bottomless pit, and hear the doleful 
 shrieks and outcries of damned sinners, whom earth has spued out and 
 hell has swallowed, that find themselves undone, for ever undone, by 
 sin; and tremble lest this be your portion at last. God's threatenings 
 and judgments should frighten us from sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The chapter concludes with a sovereign antidote against this 
 infection: <I>Therefore you shall keep my ordinance that you commit not 
 any one of these abominable customs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 This is the remedy prescribed. Note,

 1. Sinful customs are abominable customs, and their being common and
 fashionable does not make them at all the less abominable nor should we 
 the less abominate them, but the more; because the more customary they 
 are the more dangerous they are. 

 2. It is of pernicious consequence to admit and allow of any one sinful
 custom, because one will make way for many, <I>Uno absurdo dato, mille 
 sequuntur--Admit but a single absurdity, you invite a thousand.</I> The 
 way of sin is downhill. 

 3. A close and constant adherence to God's ordinances is the most
 effectual preservative from the infection of gross sin. The more we 
 taste of the sweetness and feel of the power of holy ordinances the 
 less inclination we shall have to the forbidden pleasures of sinners' 
 abominable customs. It is the grace of God only that will secure us, 
 and that grace is to be expected only in the use of the means of grace. 
 Nor does God ever leave any to their own hearts' lusts till they have 
 first left him and his institutions.</P>
