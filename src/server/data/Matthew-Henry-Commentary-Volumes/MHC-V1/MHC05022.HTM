 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
 and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
 again unto thy brother.
 &nbsp; 2 And if thy brother <I>be</I> not nigh unto thee, or if thou know
 him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
 shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
 shalt restore it to him again.
 &nbsp; 3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
 do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
 which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise:
 thou mayest not hide thyself.
 &nbsp; 4 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
 the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him
 to lift <I>them</I> up again.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kindness that was commanded to be shown in reference to an enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:4,5">Exod. xxxiii. 4</A>,

 &c.) is here required to be much more done for a neighbour,
 though he were not an Israelite, for the law is consonant to natural 
 equity. 

 1. That strayed cattle should be brought back, either to the owner or
 to the pasture out of which they had gone astray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 This must be done in pity to the very cattle, which, while they
 wandered, were exposed; and in civility and respect to the owner, nay, 
 and in justice to him, for it was doing as we would be done by, which 
 is one of the fundamental laws of equity. Note, Religion teaches us to 
 be neighbourly, and to be ready to do all good offices, as we have 
 opportunity, to all men. In doing this,

 (1.) They must not mind trouble, but, if they knew who the owner was,
 must take it back themselves; for, if they should only send notice to
 the owner to come and look after it himself, some mischief might befal
 it ere he could reach it.

 (2.) They must not mind expense, but, if they knew not who the owner
 was, must take it home and feed it till the owner was found. If such
 care must be taken of a neighbour's ox or ass going astray, much more
 of himself going astray from God and his duty; we should do our utmost
 to convert him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:19">Jam. v. 19</A>),

 and restore him, considering ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>.

 2. That lost goods should be brought to the owner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The Jews say, "He that found the lost goods was to give public notice
 of them by the common crier three or four times," according to the 
 usage with us; if the owner could not be found, he that found the goods 
 might convert them to his own use; but (say some learned writers in 
 this case) he would do very well to give the value of the goods to the 
 poor.

 3. That cattle in distress should be helped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This must be done both in compassion to the brute-creatures (for a
 <I>merciful man regardeth the life of a beast,</I> though it be not his 
 own) and in love and friendship to our neighbour, not knowing how soon 
 we may have occasion for his help. If one member may say to another, "I 
 have at present no need of thee," it cannot say, "I never shall."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
 neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so
 <I>are</I> abomination unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 6 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
 tree, or on the ground, <I>whether they be</I> young ones, or eggs,
 and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt
 not take the dam with the young:
 &nbsp; 7 <I>But</I> thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the
 young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and <I>that</I> thou
 mayest prolong <I>thy</I> days.
 &nbsp; 8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
 battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
 house, if any man fall from thence.
 &nbsp; 9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
 fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
 vineyard, be defiled.
 &nbsp; 10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
 &nbsp; 11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, <I>as</I> of
 woollen and linen together.
 &nbsp; 12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
 vesture, wherewith thou coverest <I>thyself.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are several laws in these verses which seem to stoop very low, and 
 to take cognizance of things mean and minute. Men's laws commonly do 
 not so: <I>De minimis non curat lex--The law takes no cognizance of
 little things;</I> but because God's providence extends itself to the 
 smallest affairs, his precepts do so, that even in them we may be <I>in 
 the fear of the Lord,</I> as we are under his eye and care. And yet the 
 significancy and tendency of these statutes, which seem little, are 
 such that, notwithstanding their minuteness, being fond among the 
 things of God's law, which he has written to us, they are to be 
 accounted great things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The distinction of sexes by the apparel is to be kept up, for the 
 preservation of our own and our neighbour's chastity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Nature itself teaches</I> that a difference be made between them in
 <I>their hair</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:14">1 Cor. xi. 14</A>),

 and by the same rule in their clothes, which therefore ought not to be
 confounded, either in ordinary wear or occasionally. To befriend a 
 lawful escape or concealment it may be done, but whether for sport or 
 in the acting of plays is justly questionable. 

 1. Some think it refers to the idolatrous custom of the Gentiles: in
 the worship of Venus, women appeared in armour, and men in women's 
 clothes; this, as other such superstitious usages, is here said to be 
 <I>an abomination to the Lord.</I> 

 2. It forbids the confounding of the dispositions and affairs of the
 sexes: men must not be effeminate, nor do the women's work in the 
 house, nor must women be viragos, pretend to <I>teach, or usurp 
 authority,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:11,12">1 Tim. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 Probably this confounding of garments had been used to gain opportunity
 of committing uncleanness, and is therefore forbidden; for those that 
 would be kept from sin must keep themselves from all occasions of it 
 and approaches to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In taking a bird's-nest, the dam must be let go, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The Jews say, "This is the least of all the commandments of the law of
 Moses," and yet the same promise is here made to the observance of it 
 that is made to the keeping of the fifth commandment, which is one of 
 the greatest, <I>that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest 
 prolong thy days;</I> for, as disobedience in a small matter shows a 
 very great contempt of the law, so obedience in a small matter shows a 
 very great regard to it. He that let go a bird out of his hand (which 
 was worth two in the bush) purely because God bade him, in that made it 
 to appear that he <I>esteemed all God's precepts concerning all things 
 to be right,</I> and that he could deny himself rather than sin against 
 God. But <I>doth God take care</I> for birds?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9">1 Cor. ix. 9</A>.

 Yes, certainly; and perhaps to this law our Saviour alludes. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:6">Luke xii. 6</A>,

 <I>Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is 
 forgotten before God?</I> This law, 

 1. Forbids us to be cruel to the brute-creatures, or to take a pleasure
 in destroying them. Though God has made us <I>wiser than the fowls of 
 heaven,</I> and given us <I>dominion over them,</I> yet we must not 
 abuse them nor rule them with rigour. <I>Let go the dam</I> to breed 
 again; <I>destroy it not, for a blessing is in it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.

 2. It teaches us compassion to those of our own kind, and to abhor the
 thought of every thing that looks barbarous, and cruel, and 
 ill-natured, especially towards those of the weaker and tender sex, 
 which always ought to be treated with the utmost respect, in 
 consideration of the sorrows wherein they bring forth children. It is 
 spoken of as an instance of the most inhuman cruelty that <I>the mother 
 was dashed to pieces upon her children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:14">Hos. x. 14</A>),

 and that the <I>women with child were ripped open,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:13">Amos i. 13</A>.

 3. It further intimates that we must not take advantage against any,
 from their natural affection and the tenderness of their disposition, 
 to do them an injury. The dam could not have been taken if her concern 
 for her eggs or young (unlike to the ostrich) had not detained her upon 
 the next when otherwise she could easily have secured herself by 
 flight.  Now, since it is a thousand pities that she should fare the 
 worse for that which is her praise, the law takes care that she shall 
 be let go.  The remembrance of this may perhaps, some time or other, 
 keep us from doing a hard or unkind thing to those whom we have at our 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In building a house, care must be taken to make it safe, that none 
 might receive mischief by falling from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The roofs of their houses were flat for people to walk on, as appears
 by many scriptures; now lest any, through carelessness, should fall off 
 them, they must compass them with battlements, which (the Jews say) 
 must be three feet and a half high; if this were not done, and mischief 
 followed, the owner, by his neglect, brought the guilt of blood upon 
 his house. See here,

 1. How precious men's lives are to God, who protects them, not only by
 his providence, but by his law. 

 2. How precious, therefore, they ought to be to us, and what care we
 should take to prevent hurt from coming to any person. The Jews say 
 that by the equity of this law they were obliged (and so are we too) to 
 fence, or remove, every thing by which life may be endangered, as to 
 cover draw-wells, keep bridges in repair, and the like, lest, if any 
 perish through our omission, their blood be required at our hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Odd mixtures are here forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Much of this we met with before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:19">Lev. xix. 19</A>.

 There appears not any thing at all of moral evil in these things, and
 therefore we now make no conscience of sowing wheat and rye together, 
 ploughing with horses and oxen together, and of wearing linsey-woolsey 
 garments; but hereby is forbidden either,

 1. A conformity to some idolatrous customs of the heathen. Or, 

 2. That which is contrary to the plainness and purity of an Israelite.
 They must not gratify their own vanity and curiosity by putting those 
 things together which the Creator in infinite wisdom had made asunder: 
 they must not be unequally yoked with unbelievers, nor mingle 
 themselves with the unclean, as an ox with an ass. Nor must their 
 profession and appearance in the world be motley, or party-coloured, 
 but all of a piece, all of a kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The law concerning fringes upon their garments, and memorandums of 
 the commandments, which we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:38,39">Num. xv. 38, 39</A>),

 is here repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 By these they were distinguished from other people, so that it might be
 said, upon the first sight, There goes an Israelite, which taught them 
 not to be ashamed of their country, nor the peculiarities of their 
 religion, how much soever their neighbours looked upon them and it with 
 contempt: and they were also put in mind of the precepts upon the 
 particular occasions to which they had reference; and perhaps this law 
 is repeated here because the precepts immediately foregoing seemed so 
 minute that they were in danger of being overlooked and forgotten. The 
 fringes will remind you not to make your garments of linen and woollen,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
 &nbsp; 14 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an
 evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came
 to her, I found her not a maid:
 &nbsp; 15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take
 and bring forth <I>the tokens of</I> the damsel's virginity unto the
 elders of the city in the gate:
 &nbsp; 16 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
 daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
 &nbsp; 17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech <I>against her,</I>
 saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these <I>are the
 tokens of</I> my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
 cloth before the elders of the city.
 &nbsp; 18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
 him;
 &nbsp; 19 And they shall amerce him in a hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver,
 and give <I>them</I> unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
 brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be
 his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
 &nbsp; 20 But if this thing be true, <I>and the tokens of</I> virginity be
 not found for the damsel:
 &nbsp; 21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
 father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
 stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to
 play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away
 from among you.
 &nbsp; 22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband,
 then they shall both of them die, <I>both</I> the man that lay with
 the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 23 If a damsel <I>that is</I> a virgin be betrothed unto a husband,
 and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
 &nbsp; 24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that
 city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the
 damsel, because she cried not, <I>being</I> in the city; and the man,
 because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put
 away evil from among you.
 &nbsp; 25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the
 man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
 her shall die:
 &nbsp; 26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; <I>there is</I> in the
 damsel no sin <I>worthy</I> of death: for as when a man riseth against
 his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so <I>is</I> this matter:
 &nbsp; 27 For he found her in the field, <I>and</I> the betrothed damsel
 cried, and <I>there was</I> none to save her.
 &nbsp; 28 If a man find a damsel <I>that is</I> a virgin, which is not
 betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
 found;
 &nbsp; 29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
 father fifty <I>shekels</I> of silver, and she shall be his wife;
 because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
 days.
 &nbsp; 30 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
 father's skirt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These laws relate to the seventh commandment, laying a restraint by 
 laying a penalty upon those fleshly lusts which war against the 
 soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. If a man, lusting after another woman, to get rid of his wife 
 slander her and falsely accuse her, as not having the virginity she 
 pretended to when he married her, upon the disproof of his slander he 
 must be punished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:13-19"><I>v.</I> 13-19</A>.

 What the meaning of that evidence is by which the husband's accusation
 was to be proved false the learned are not agreed, nor is it at all 
 necessary to enquire--those for whom this law was intended, no doubt, 
 understood it: it is sufficient for us to know that this wicked 
 husband, who had thus endeavoured to ruin the reputation of his own 
 wife, was to be scourged, and fined, and bound out from ever divorcing 
 the wife he had thus abused,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Upon his dislike of her he might have divorced her if he had pleased,
 by the permission of the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 1</A>),

 but then he must have given her her dowry: if therefore to save that,
 and to do her the greater mischief, he would thus destroy her good 
 name, it was fit that he should be severely punished for it, and for 
 ever after forfeit the permission to divorce her. Observe, 

 1. The nearer any are in relation to us the greater sin it is to belie
 them and blemish their reputation. It is spoken of as a crime of the 
 highest nature to <I>slander thy own mother's son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:20">Ps. l. 20</A>),

 who is next to thyself, much more to slander thy own wife, or thy own
 husband, that is thyself: it is an ill bird indeed that defiles its own 
 nest. 

 2. Chastity is honour as well as virtue, and that which gives occasion
 for the suspicion of it is as great a reproach and disgrace as any 
 whatsoever: in this matter therefore, above any thing, we should be 
 highly tender both of our own good name and that of others. 

 3. Parents must look upon themselves as concerned to vindicate the
 reputation of their children, for it is a branch of their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. If the woman that was married as a virgin was not found to be one 
 she was to be stoned to death at her father's door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 If the uncleanness had been committed before she was betrothed it would
 not have been punished as a capital crime; but she must die for the 
 abuse she put upon him whom she married, being conscious to herself of 
 being defiled, while she made him believe her to be a chaste and modest 
 woman. But some think that her uncleanness was punished with death only 
 in case it was committed after she was betrothed, supposing there were 
 few come to maturity but what were betrothed, though not yet married.  
 Now,

 1. This gave a powerful caution to young women to flee fornication,
 since, however concealed before, so as not to mar their marriage, it 
 would very likely be discovered afterwards, to their perpetual infamy 
 and utter ruin. 

 2. It is intimated to parents that they must by all means possible
 preserve their children's chastity, by giving them good advice and 
 admonition, setting them good examples, keeping them from bad company, 
 praying for them, and laying them under needful restraints, because, if 
 the children committed lewdness, the parents must have the grief and 
 shame of the execution at their own door. That phrase of <I>folly 
 wrought in Israel</I> was used concerning this very crime in the case 
 of Dinah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:7">Gen. xxxiv. 7</A>.

 All sin is folly, uncleanness especially; but, above all, uncleanness
 in Israel, by profession a holy people.</P>

 III. If any man, single or married, lay with a married woman, they were 
 both to be put to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This law we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:10">Lev. xx. 10</A>.

 For a married man to lie with a single woman was not a crime of so high
 a nature, nor was it punished with death, because not introducing a 
 spurious brood into families under the character of legitimate 
 children.</P>

 IV. If a damsel were betrothed and not married, she was from under the 
 eye of her intended husband, and therefore she and her chastity were 
 taken under the special protection of the law. 

 1. If her chastity were violated by her own consent, she was to be put
 to death, and her adulterer with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 And it shall be presumed that she consented if it were done in the
 city, or in any place where, had she cried out, help might speedily 
 have come in to prevent the injury offered her. <I>Qui tacet, 
 consentire videtur--Silence implies consent.</I> Note, It may be 
 presumed that those willingly yield to a temptation (whatever they 
 pretend) who will not use the means and helps they might be furnished 
 with to avoid and overcome it. Nay, her being found in the city, a 
 place of company and diversion, when she should have kept under the 
 protection of her father's house, was an evidence against her that she 
 had not that dread of the sin and the danger of it which became a 
 modest woman. Note, Those that needlessly expose themselves to 
 temptation justly suffer for the same, if, ere they are aware, they be 
 surprised and caught by it.  Dinah lost her honour to gratify her 
 curiosity with a sight of the <I>daughters of the land.</I> By this law 
 the Virgin Mary was in danger of being made a public example, that is, 
 of being stoned to death, but that God, by an angel, cleared the matter 
 to Joseph.

 2. If she were forced, and never consented, he that committed the rape
 was to be put to death, but the damsel was to be acquitted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:24-27"><I>v.</I> 24-27</A>.
 
 Now if it were done in the field, out of the hearing of neighbours, it
 shall be presumed that she cried out, but there was none to save her; 
 and, besides, her going into the field, a place of solitude, did not so 
 much expose her. Now by this law it is intimated to us,

 (1.) That we shall suffer only for the wickedness we do, not for that
 which is done to us. That is no sin which has not more or less of the 
 will in it.

 (2.) That we must presume the best concerning all persons, unless the
 contrary do appear; not only charity, but equity teaches us to do so. 
 Though none heard her cry, yet, because none could hear it if she did, 
 it shall be taken for granted that she did. This rule we should go by 
 in judging of persons and actions: <I>believe all things, and hope all 
 things.</I>

 (3.) That our chastity should be as dear to us as our life when that is
 assaulted, it is not at all improper to cry <I>murder, murder,</I> for, 
 <I>as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth him, even so 
 is this matter.</I>

 (4.) By way of allusion to this, see what we are to do when Satan sets
 upon us with his temptations: wherever we are, let us cry aloud to 
 heaven for help (<I>Succurre, Domine, vim patior--Help me, O Lord, for 
 I suffer violence</I>), and there we may be sure to be heard, and
 answered, as Paul was, <I>My grace is sufficient for thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. If a damsel not betrothed were thus abused by violence, he that 
 abused her should be fined, the father should have the fine, and, if he 
 and the damsel did consent, he should be bound to marry her, and never
 to divorce her, how much soever she was below him, and how unpleasing 
 soever she might afterwards be to him, as Tamar was to Amnon after he 
 had forced her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 This was to deter men from such vicious practices, which it is a shame
 that we are necessitated to read and write of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The law against a man's marrying his father's widow, or having any 
 undue familiarity with his father's wife, is here repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:8">Lev. xviii. 8</A>.

 And, probably, it is intended (as bishop Patrick notes) for a short
 memorandum to them carefully to observe all the laws there made against 
 incestuous marriages, that being specified which is the most detestable 
 of all; it is that of which the apostle says, <I>It is not so much as 
 named among the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>.</P>
