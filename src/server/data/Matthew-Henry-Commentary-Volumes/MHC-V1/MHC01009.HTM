 Both the world and the church were now again reduced to a family, 
 the family of Noah, of the affairs of which this chapter gives us 
 an account, of which we are the more concerned to take cognizance 
 because from this family we are all descendants. Here
 is,

 I. The covenant of providence settled with Noah and his sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.
 In this covenant, 

 1. God promises them to take care
 of their lives, so that,

 (1.) They should replenish the earth,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1,7">ver. 1, 7</A>.

 (2.) They should be safe from the insults of the brute-creatures, 
 which should stand in awe of them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:2">ver. 2</A>.
 
 (3.) They 
 should be allowed to eat flesh for the support of their lives; only 
 they must not eat blood,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.
 
 (4.) The world should never 
 be drowned again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.
 
 2. God requires of them to take 
 care of one another's lives, and of their own,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.
 
 II. The 
 seal of that covenant, namely, the rainbow,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.
 
 III. A particular passage of story concerning Noah and his sons, 
 which occasioned some prophecies that related to after-times,
 
 1. Noah's sin and shame,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.
 
 2. Ham's impudence and 
 impiety,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:22">ver. 22</A>.

 3. The pious modesty of Shem and Japheth,

 <A NAME="Page69"> </A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:23">ver. 23</A>.

 4. The curse of Canaan, and the blessing of Shem and 
 Japheth,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:21-27">ver. 21-27</A>.

 IV. The age and death of Noah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:28,29">ver. 28, 29</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And God blessed Noah and his 
 sons, and said unto them, Be
 fruitful, and multiply, and replenish 
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 2 And the fear of you 
 and the dread of you shall be upon 
 every beast of the earth, and upon 
 every fowl of the air, upon all that
 moveth <I>upon</I> the earth, and upon all 
 the fishes of the sea; into your hand 
 are they delivered.
 &nbsp; 3 Every moving 
 thing that liveth shall be meat for 
 you; even as the green herb have I 
 given you all things.
 &nbsp; 4 But flesh 
 with the life thereof, <I>which is</I> the 
 blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
 &nbsp; 5 And surely your blood of your lives 
 will I require; at the hand of every 
 beast will I require it, and at the hand 
 of man; at the hand of every man's 
 brother will I require the life of man.
 &nbsp; 6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by 
 man shall his blood be shed: for in 
 the image of God made he man.
 &nbsp; 7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; 
 bring forth abundantly in the earth, 
 and multiply therein.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read, in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, the very kind things which God said 
 in his heart, concerning the remnant of mankind 
 which was now left to be the seed of a 
 new world. Now here we have these kind 
 things <I>spoken to them.</I> In general, <I>God 
 blessed Noah and his sons</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 that is, he 
 assured them of his good-will to them and 
 his gracious intentions concerning them. 
 This follows from what he said in his heart. 
 Note, All God's promises of good flow from 
 his purposes of love and the counsels of his 
 own will. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11,3:11">Eph. i. 11; iii. 11</A>.
 and compare
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.
 <I>I know the thoughts that 
 I think towards you.</I> We read 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:20"><I>ch.</I> viii. 20</A>)
 how <I>Noah blessed God,</I> by his altar and sacrifice. 
 Now here we find God blessing Noah. 
 Note, God will graciously bless (that is, do
 well for) those who sincerely bless (that is, 
 speak well of) him. Those that are truly 
 thankful for the mercies they have received 
 take the readiest way to have them confirmed 
 and continued to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we have the <I>Magna Charta--the 
 great charter</I> of this new kingdom of 
 nature which was now to be erected, and incorporated, 
 the former charter having been 
 forfeited and seized.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The grants of this charter are kind and 
 gracious to men. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A grant of lands of vast extent, and a 
 promise of a great increase of men to occupy 
 and enjoy them. The first blessing is here 
 renewed: <I>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish 
 the earth</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 and repeated 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 for the race of mankind was, as it were, to 
 begin again. Now, 

 (1.) God sets the whole 
 earth before them, tells them it is all their 
 own, <I>while it remains,</I> to them and their 
 heirs. Note, The earth God has given to the 
 children of men, for a possession and habitation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>.
 Though it is not a paradise, 
 but a wilderness rather; yet it is better 
 than we deserve. Blessed be God, it is not
 hell.

 (2.) He gives them a blessing, by the 
 force and virtue of which mankind should be 
 both multiplied and perpetuated upon earth, 
 so that in a little time all the habitable parts 
 of the earth should be more or less inhabited; 
 and, though one generation should pass 
 away, yet another generation should come, 
 while the world stands, so that the stream of 
 the human race should be supplied with a 
 constant succession, and run parallel with 
 the current of time, till both should be delivered 
 up together into the ocean of eternity. 
 Though death should still reign, and the 
 Lord would still be known by his judgments, 
 yet the earth should never again be dispeopled 
 as now it was, but still replenished, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24-26">Acts xvii. 24-26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A grant of power over the inferior creatures, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 He grants,

 (1.) A title to them: 
 <I>Into your hands they are delivered,</I> for your 
 use and benefit. 
 
 (2.) A dominion over them, 
 without which the title would avail little: 
 <I>The fear of you and the dread of you shall be 
 upon every beast.</I> This revives a former 
 grant 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>),
 only with this difference, 
 that man in innocence ruled by love, fallen 
 man rules by fear. Now this grant remains 
 in force, and thus far we have still the benefit 
 of it,

 [1.] That those creatures which are 
 any way useful to us are reclaimed, and we
 use them either for service or food, or both,
 as they are capable. The horse and ox patiently
 submit to the bridle and yoke, and 
 the sheep is dumb both before the shearer
 and before the butcher; for the fear and 
 dread of man are upon them. 
 
 [2.] Those 
 creatures that are any way hurtful to us are 
 restrained, so that, though now and then man 
 may be hurt by some of them, they do not 
 combine together to rise up in rebellion 
 against man, else God could by these destroy
 the world as effectually as he did by a deluge; 
 it is one of God's sore judgments, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:21">Ezek. xiv. 21</A>.
 What is it that keeps wolves out of our 
 towns, and lions out of our streets, and confines 
 them to the wilderness, but this fear and 
 dread? Nay, some have been tamed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+9:7">Jas. iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A grant of maintenance and subsistence: 
 <I>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat 
 for you,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Hitherto, most think, man had 
 been confined to feed only upon the products 
 of the earth, fruits, herbs, and roots, 
 and all sorts of corn and milk; so was the 
 first grant, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:29"><I>ch.</I> i. 29</A>.
 But the flood having 
 perhaps washed away much of the virtue of 
 the earth, and so rendered its fruits less 

 <A NAME="Page70"> </A>

 pleasing and less nourishing, God now enlarged 
 the grant, and allowed man to eat flesh, which 
 perhaps man himself never thought of, till 
 now that God directed him to it, nor had any 
 more desire to than a sheep has to suck blood 
 like a wolf. But now man is allowed to feed
 upon flesh, as freely and safely as upon the
 green herb. Now here see,

 (1.) That God is 
 a good master, and provides, not only that 
 we may live, but that we may live comfortably,
 in his service; not for necessity only,
 but for delight.

 (2.) That every <I>creature of 
 God is good,</I> and nothing to be refused, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1 Tim. iv. 4</A>.
 Afterwards some meats that were 
 proper enough for food were prohibited by
 the ceremonial law; but from the beginning, 
 it seems, it was not so, and therefore is not 
 so under the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The precepts and provisos of this character
 are no less kind and gracious, and instances
 of God's good-will to man. The
 Jewish doctors speak so often of the seven
 precepts of Noah, or of the sons of Noah, 
 which they say were to be observed by all 
 nations, that it may not be amiss to set them 
 down. The first against the worship of idols. 
 The second against blasphemy, and requiring 
 to bless the name of God. The third against 
 murder. The fourth against incest and all 
 uncleanness. The fifth against theft and 
 rapine. The sixth requiring the administration 
 of justice. The seventh against eating 
 of flesh with the life. These the Jews required 
 the observance of from the <I>proselytes 
 of the gate.</I> But the precepts here given all 
 concern the life of man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Man must not prejudice his own life by
 eating that food which is unwholesome and 
 prejudicial to his health 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 "<I>Flesh with 
 the life thereof, which is the blood thereof</I> 
 (that is, raw flesh), shall you not eat, as the 
 beasts of prey do." It was necessary to add 
 this limitation to the grant of liberty to eat flesh, 
 lest, instead of nourishing their bodies by it, 
 they should destroy them. God would hereby 
 show, 
 
 (1.) That though they were lords of 
 the creatures, yet they were subjects to the
 Creator, and under the restraints of his law.

 (2.) That they must not be greedy and hasty 
 in taking their food, but stay the preparing 
 of it; not like Saul's soldiers 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:32">1 Sam. xiv. 32</A>),
 nor <I>riotous eaters of flesh,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:20">Prov. xxiii. 20</A>.

 (3.) That they must not be barbarous and 
 cruel to the inferior creatures. They must 
 be lords, but not tyrants; they might kill 
 them for their profit, but not torment them 
 for their pleasure, nor tear away the member 
 of a creature while it was yet alive, and eat 
 that. 

 (4.) That during the continuance of 
 the law of sacrifices, in which the blood made 
 <I>atonement for the soul</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11">Lev. xvii. 11</A>),
 signifying that the life of the sacrifice was accepted 
 for the life of the sinner, blood must not be 
 looked upon as a common thing, but must 
 be <I>poured out before the Lord</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:16">2 Sam. xxiii. 16</A>),
 either upon his altar or upon his earth. 
 But, now that the great and true sacrifice has 
 been offered, the obligation of the law ceases 
 with the reason of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Man must not take away his own life: 
 <I>Your blood of your lives will I require,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 Our lives are not so our own as that we may 
 quit them at our own pleasure, but they are 
 God's and we must resign them at his pleasure; 
 if we in any way hasten our own 
 deaths, we are accountable to God for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The beasts must not be suffered to hurt
 the life of man: <I>At the hand of every beast 
 will I require it.</I> To show how tender God 
 was of the life of man, though he had lately
 made such destruction of lives, he will 
 have the beast put to death that kills a man. This 
 was confirmed by the law of Moses 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:28">Exod. xxi. 28</A>),
 and I think it would not be unsafe 
 to observe it still. Thus God showed his 
 hatred of the sin of murder, that men might 
 hate it the more, and not only punish, but 
 prevent it. And see
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:23">Job v. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Wilful murderers must be put to death.
 This is the sin which is here designed to be
 restrained by the terror of punishment

 (1.) God will punish murderers: <I>At the hand of
 every man's brother will I require the life of 
 man,</I> that is, "I will avenge the blood of the 
 murdered upon the murderer." 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:22">2 Chron. xxiv. 22</A>.
 When God requires the life of a 
 man at the hand of him that took it away
 unjustly, the murderer cannot render that,
 and therefore must render his own in lieu of 
 it, which is the only way left of making restitution. 
 Note, The righteous God will certainly 
 make inquisition for blood, though 
 men cannot or do not. One time or other, 
 in this world or in the next, he will both discover 
 concealed murders, which are hidden 
 from man's eye, and punish avowed and justified 
 murders, which are too great for man's
 hand.

 (2.) The magistrate must punish
 murderers
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 <I>Whoso sheddeth man's blood,</I> 
 whether upon a sudden provocation or having 
 premeditated it (for rash anger is heart-murder 
 as well as malice prepense, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21,22">Matt. v. 21, 22</A>),
 <I>by man shall his blood be shed,</I> that is, by 
 the magistrate, or whoever is appointed or 
 allowed to be the avenger of blood. There 
 are those who are ministers of God for this 
 purpose, to be a protection to the innocent,
 by being a terror to the malicious and evildoers, 
 and they must not <I>bear the sword in 
 vain,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom. xiii. 4</A>.
 Before the flood, as it 
 should seem by the story of Cain, God took 
 the punishment of murder into his own 
 hands; but now he committed this judgment 
 to men, to masters of families at first, and 
 afterwards to the heads of countries, who 
 ought to be faithful to the trust reposed in 
 them. Note, Wilful murder ought always to 
 be punished with death. It is a sin <I>which 
 the Lord would not pardon</I> in a prince 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:3,4">2 Kings xxiv. 3, 4</A>),
 and which therefore a 
 prince should not pardon in a subject. To 
 this law there is a reason annexed: <I>For in the 
 image of God made he man</I> at first. Man is 
 a creature dear to his Creator, and therefore 

 <A NAME="Page71"> </A>

 ought to be so to us. God put honour upon 
 him, let not us then put contempt upon him. 
 Such remains of God's image are still even 
 upon fallen man as that he who unjustly kills 
 a man defaces the image of God and does 
 dishonour to him. When God allowed men 
 to kill their beasts, yet he forbade them to 
 kill their slaves; for these are of a much 
 more noble and excellent nature, not only 
 God's creatures, but his image, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:9">Jam. iii. 9</A>.
 All men have something of the image of God 
 upon them; but magistrates have, besides, 
 the image of his power, and the saints the 
 image of his holiness, and therefore those who 
 shed the blood of princes or saints incur a 
 double guilt.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And God spake unto Noah, and 
 to his sons with him, saying,
 &nbsp; 9 And 
 I, behold, I establish my covenant
 with you, and with your seed after 
 you;
 &nbsp; 10 And with every living 
 creature that <I>is</I> with you, of the fowl,

 earth with you; from all that go out of the 
 ark, to every beast of the earth.
 &nbsp; 11 And I will establish my covenant 
 with you; neither shall all flesh be 
 cut off any more by the waters of a 
 flood; neither shall there any more 
 be a flood to destroy the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. The general establishment of 
 God's covenant with this new world, and the 
 extent of that covenant, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 Here observe,

 1. That God is graciously pleased 
 to deal with man in the way of a covenant, 
 wherein God greatly magnifies his condescending 
 favour, and greatly encourages 
 man's duty and obedience, as a reasonable 
 and gainful service. 
 
 2. That all God's covenants 
 with man are of his own making: <I>I, 
 behold, I.</I> It is thus expressed both to raise 
 our admiration--"Behold, and wonder, that 
 though God be high yet he has this respect 
 to man," and to confirm our assurances of 
 the validity of the covenant--"Behold and 
 see, I make it; I that am faithful and able 
 to make it good." 
 
 3. That God's covenants
 are established more firmly than the pillars
 of heaven or the foundations of the earth,
 and cannot be disannulled.

 4. That God's 
 covenants are made with the covenanters and 
 with their seed; the promise is to them and
 their children.

 5. That those may be taken 
 into covenant with God, and receive the 
 benefits of it, who yet are not capable of restipulating, 
 or giving their own consent. 
 For this covenant is made with <I>every living 
 creature, every beast of the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular intention of this covenant. 
 It was designed to secure the world 
 from another deluge: <I>There shall not any 
 more be a flood.</I> God had drowned the world 
 once, and still it was as filthy and provoking 
 as ever, and God foresaw the wickedness of 
 it, and yet promised he would never drown 
 it any more; for he deals not with us according 
 to our sins. It is owing to God's goodness 
 and faithfulness, not to any reformation 
 of the world, that it has not often been 
 deluged and that it is not deluged now. As 
 the old world was ruined to be a monument 
 of justice, so this world remains to this day, 
 a monument of mercy, according to the oath 
 of God, that the waters of Noah should no 
 more return to cover the earth, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:9">Isa. liv. 9</A>.
 This promise of God keeps the sea and clouds 
 in their decreed place, and <I>sets them gates and 
 bars; hitherto they shall come,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:10,11">Job xxxviii. 10, 11</A>.
 If the sea should flow but for a few 
 days, as it does twice every day for a few 
 hours, what desolation would it make! And 
 how destructive would the clouds be, if such 
 showers as we have sometimes seen were continued 
 long! But God, by flowing seas and 
 sweeping rains, shows what he could do in 
 wrath; and yet, by preserving the earth from 
 being deluged between both, shows what he 
 can do in mercy and will do in truth. Let 
 us give him the glory of his mercy in promising 
 and of his truth in performing. This 
 promise does not hinder, 

 1. But that God
 may bring other wasting judgments upon
 mankind; for, though he has here bound
 himself not to use this arrow any more, yet
 he has other arrows in his quiver.

 2. Nor
 but that he may destroy particular places and
 countries by the inundations of the sea or
 rivers.

 3. Nor will the destruction of the 
 world at the last day by fire be any breach of 
 his promise. Sin which drowned the old 
 world will burn this.</P>

 pass, when I bring a cloud over the
 earth, that the bow shall be seen in 
 the cloud:
 &nbsp; 15 And I will remember 
 my covenant, which <I>is</I> between me 
 and you and every living creature of 
 all flesh; and the waters shall no 
 more become a flood to destroy all 
 flesh.
 &nbsp; 16 And the bow shall be in 
 the cloud; and I will look upon it,
 that I may remember the everlasting 
 covenant between God and every 
 living creature of all flesh that <I>is</I> upon 
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 17 And God said unto 
 Noah, This <I>is</I> the token of the covenant,
 which I have established 

 <A NAME="Page72"> </A>

 between me and all flesh that <I>is</I> upon
 the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Articles of agreement among men are 
 usually sealed, that the covenants may be 
 the more solemn, and the performances of 
 the covenants the more sure, to mutual satisfaction. 
 God therefore, being <I>willing more 
 abundantly to show to the heirs of promise
 the immutability of his councils,</I> has confirmed
 his covenant by a seal
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17">Heb. vi. 17</A>),
 which makes the foundations we build on
 stand sure,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>.
 The seal of this
 covenant of nature was natural enough; it
 was the <I>rainbow,</I> which, it is likely, was seen 
 in the clouds before, when second causes 
 concurred, but was never a seal of the covenant 
 till now that it was made so by a divine 
 institution. Now, concerning this seal of 
 the covenant, observe,

 1. This seal is affixed
 with repeated assurances of the truth of that
 promise of which it was designed to be the 
 ratification: <I>I do set my bow in the cloud</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 it <I>shall be seen in the cloud</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 that the eye may affect the heart and confirm 
 the faith; and it shall be <I>the token of 
 the covenant</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),
 <I>and I will remember 
 my covenant, that the waters shall no more 
 become a flood,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 Nay, as if the Eternal 
 Mind needed a memorandum, <I>I will look 
 upon it, that I may remember the everlasting 
 covenant,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 Thus here is line upon 
 line, that we might have sure and strong 
 consolation who have laid hold of this hope.

 2. The rainbow appears when the clouds 
 are most disposed to wet, and returns after 
 the rain; when we have most reason to fear 
 the rain prevailing, then God shows this 
 seal of the promise that it shall not prevail. 
 Thus God obviates our fears with such 
 encouragements as are both suitable and 
 seasonable.

 3. The thicker the cloud the 
 brighter the bow in the cloud. Thus, as 
 threatening afflictions abound, encouraging 
 consolations much more abound, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>.

 4. The rainbow appears when one part of 
 the sky is clear, which intimates mercy remembered 
 in the midst of wrath; and the 
 clouds are hemmed as it were with the rainbow, 
 that they may not overspread the heavens, 
 for the bow is coloured rain or the 
 edges of a cloud gilded. 

 5. The rainbow is 
 the reflection of the beams of the sun, which
 intimates that all the glory and significancy
 of the seals of the covenant are derived from
 Christ the Sun of righteousness, who is also
 described with a <I>rainbow about his throne</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:3">Rev. iv. 3</A>),
 and a <I>rainbow upon his head</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:1">Rev. x. 1</A>),
 which intimates, not only his
 majesty, but his mediatorship.

 6. The rainbow 
 has fiery colours in it, to signify that
 though God will not again drown the world,
 yet, when the mystery of God shall be
 finished, the world shall be consumed by
 fire.

 7. A bow bespeaks terror, but this 
 bow has neither string nor arrow, as the bow 
 ordained against the persecutors has 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12,13">Ps. vii. 12, 13</A>),
 and a bow alone will do little 
 execution. It is a bow, but it is directed 
 upwards, not towards the earth; for the seals 
 of the covenant were intended to comfort, 
 not to terrify. 
 
 8. As God looks upon the 
 bow, that he may remember the covenant, 
 so should we, that we also may be ever 
 mindful of the covenant, with faith and 
 thankfulness.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And the sons of Noah, that 
 went forth of the ark, were Shem,
 and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham <I>is</I> 
 the father of Canaan.
 &nbsp; 19 These <I>are</I> 
 the three sons of Noah: and of them 
 was the whole earth overspread.
 &nbsp; 20 And Noah began <I>to be</I> a husbandman, 
 and he planted a vineyard:
 &nbsp; 21 And he drank of the wine, and was 
 drunken; and he was uncovered 
 within his tent.
 &nbsp; 22 And Ham, the 
 father of Canaan, saw the nakedness 
 of his father, and told his two brethren 
 without.
 &nbsp; 23 And Shem and
 Japheth took a garment, and laid <I>it</I> 
 upon both their shoulders, and went 
 backward, and covered the nakedness 
 of their father; and their faces <I>were</I> 
 backward, and they saw not their 
 father's nakedness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Noah's family and employment. 
 The names of his sons are again 
 mentioned 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>)
 as those from whom 
 the whole earth was overspread, by which it 
 appears that Noah, after the flood, had no 
 more children: all the world came from 
 these three. Note, God, when he pleases, 
 can make <I>a little one to become a thousand,</I> 
 and greatly increase the latter end of those 
 whose beginning was small. Such are the 
 power and efficacy of a divine blessing. The 
 business Noah applied himself to was that 
 of <I>a husbandman,</I> Heb. <I>a man of the earth,</I> 
 that is, a man dealing in the earth, that kept 
 ground in his hand, and occupied it. We 
 are all naturally men of the earth, made of 
 it, living on it, and hastening to it: many 
 are sinfully so, addicted to earthly things. 
 Noah was by his calling led to trade in the 
 fruits of the earth. He <I>began to be a husbandman,</I> 
 that is, some time after his departure 
 out of the ark, he returned to his 
 old employment, from which he had been 
 diverted by the building of the ark first, and 
 probably afterwards by the building of a 
 house on dry land for himself and family. 
 For this good while he had been a carpenter, 
 but now he began again to be a husbandman. 
 Observe, Though Noah was a great 
 man and a good man, an old man and a rich 
 man, a man greatly favoured by heaven and 
 honoured on earth, yet he would not live an 
 idle life, nor think the husbandman's calling 
 <A NAME="Page73"> </A>
 below him. Note, Though God by his providence 
 may take us off from our callings 
 for a time, yet when the occasion is over we 
 ought with humility and industry to apply 
 ourselves to them again, and, in the calling 
 wherein we are called, faithfully to <I>abide with 
 God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:24">1 Cor. vii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Noah's sin and shame: <I>He planted a 
 vineyard;</I> and, when he had gathered his 
 vintage, probably he appointed a day of 
 mirth and feasting in his family, and had 
 his sons and their children with him, to 
 rejoice with him in the increase of his house 
 as well as in the increase of his vineyard; 
 and we may suppose he prefaced his feast 
 with a sacrifice to the honour of God. If 
 this was omitted, it was just with God to 
 leave him to himself, that he who did not 
 begin with God might end with the beasts;
 but we charitably hope that it was not: and 
 perhaps he appointed this feast with a design, 
 at the close of it, to bless his sons, as 
 <I>Isaac,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:3,4"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 3, 4</A>,
 <I>That I may eat, and 
 that my soul may bless thee.</I> At this feast he 
 <I>drank of the wine;</I> for who planteth a vineyard 
 and <I>eateth not of the fruit of it?</I> But 
 he drank too liberally, more than his head at 
 this age would bear, for he was <I>drunk.</I> We 
 have reason to think he was never drunk 
 before nor after; observe how he came now
 to be overtaken in this fault. It was his sin, 
 and a great sin, so much the worse for its 
 being so soon after a great deliverance; but 
 God left him to himself, as he did Hezekiah 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>),
 and has left this miscarriage 
 of his upon record, to teach us, 
 
 1. That 
 the fairest copy that ever mere man wrote 
 since the fall had its blots and false strokes. 
 It was said of Noah that he was <I>perfect in 
 his generations</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:9"><I>ch.</I> vi. 9</A>),
 but this shows that 
 it is meant of sincerity, not a sinless perfection. 
 
 2. That sometimes those who, with 
 watchfulness and resolution, have, by the 
 grace of God, kept their integrity in the 
 midst of temptation, have, through security, 
 and carelessness, and neglect of the grace of 
 God, been surprised into sin, when the hour 
 of temptation has been over. Noah, who 
 had kept sober in drunken company, is now 
 drunk in sober company. <I>Let him that thinks 
 he stands take heed.</I> 
 
 3. That we have need 
 to be very careful, when we use God's good 
 creatures plentifully, lest we use them to 
 excess. Christ's disciples must take heed 
 lest at any time <I>their hearts be overcharged,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:34">Luke xxi. 34</A>.
 Now the consequence of 
 Noah's sin was shame. He was <I>uncovered 
 within his tent,</I> made naked to his shame, as 
 Adam when he had eaten forbidden fruit. 
 Yet Adam sought concealment; Noah is so 
 destitute of thought and reason that he seeks 
 no covering. This was a fruit of the vine 
 that Noah did not think of. Observe here 
 the great evil of the sin of drunkenness. 
 
 (1.) It discovers men. What infirmities they 
 have, they betray when they are drunk, and 
 what secrets they are entrusted with are then 
 easily got out of them. Drunken porters 
 keep open gates. 
 
 (2.) It disgraces men, 
 and exposes them to contempt. As it shows 
 them, so it shames them. Men say and do
 that when drunk which when they are sober 
 they would blush at the thoughts of, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15,16">Hab. ii. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Ham's impudence and impiety: He 
 <I>saw the nakedness of his father, and told his 
 two brethren,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 To see it accidentally 
 and involuntarily would not have been a 
 crime; but, 
 
 1. He pleased himself with the 
 sight, <I>as the Edomites looked up on the day of 
 their brother</I> 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12">Obad. 12</A>),
 pleased, and insulting. 
 Perhaps Ham had sometimes been 
 himself drunk, and reproved for it by his 
 good father, whom he was therefore pleased 
 to see thus overcome. Note, It is common 
 for those who walk in false ways themselves 
 to rejoice at the false steps which they sometimes 
 see others make. But charity rejoices 
 not in iniquity, nor can true penitents that 
 are sorry for their own sins rejoice in the 
 sins of others. 
 
 2. <I>He told his two brethren 
 without</I> (<I>in the street,</I> as the word is), in a 
 scornful deriding manner, that his father 
 might seem vile unto them. It is very 
 wrong, 
 
 (1.) To make a jest of sin 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:9">Prov. xiv. 9</A>),
 and to be puffed up with that for which 
 we should rather mourn, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:2">1 Cor. v. 2</A>.
 And, 
 
 (2.) To publish the faults of any, especially 
 of parents, whom it is our duty to 
 honour. Noah was not only a good man, 
 but had been a good father to him; and this 
 was a most base disingenuous requital to 
 him for his tenderness. Ham is here called 
 the <I>father of Canaan,</I> which intimates that 
 he who was himself a father should have been 
 more respectful to him that was his father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The pious care of Shem and Japheth 
 to cover their poor father's shame, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 They not only would not see it themselves, 
 but provided that no one else might see it, 
 herein setting us an example of charity with 
 reference to other men's sin and shame; we 
 must not only not say, <I>A confederacy,</I> with 
 those that proclaim it, but we must be careful 
 to conceal it, or at least to make the best 
 of it, so doing as we would be done by. 
 
 1. There is a mantle of love to be thrown over 
 the faults of all, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:8">1 Pet. iv. 8</A>.

 2. Besides 
 this, there is a robe of reverence to be thrown 
 over the faults of parents and other superiors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. Noah comes to himself: He 
 <I>awoke from his wine.</I> Sleep cured him, and, 
 we may suppose, so cured him that he never 
 relapsed into that sin afterwards. Those 
 that sleep as Noah did should awake as he 
 did, and not as that drunkard 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:35">Prov. xxiii. 35</A>)
 who says when he awakes, <I>I will seek it 
 yet again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The spirit of prophecy comes upon 
 him, and, like dying Jacob, he tells his sons 
 what shall befal them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:1"><I>ch.</I> xlix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pronounces a curse on Canaan the 
 son of Ham 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 in whom Ham is himself 
 cursed, either because this son of his 
 was now more guilty than the rest, or because 
 the posterity of this son was afterwards 
 to be rooted out of their land, to make room
 for Israel. And Moses here records it for 
 the animating of Israel in the wars of Canaan; 
 though the Canaanites were a formidable 
 people, yet they were of old an accursed 
 people, and doomed to ruin. The particular 
 curse is, <I>A servant of servants</I> (that is, the 
 meanest and most despicable servant) <I>shall 
 he be,</I> even <I>to his brethren.</I> Those who by 
 birth were his equals shall by conquest be 
 his lords. This certainly points at the victories 
 obtained by Israel over the Canaanites, 
 by which they were all either put to the 
 sword or put under tribute 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:23,Jdg+1:28,30,33,35">Josh. ix. 23; Judg. i. 28, 30, 33, 35</A>),
 which happened not 
 till about 800 years after this. Note, 
 
 (1.) God often visits the iniquity of the fathers 
 upon the children, especially when the children 
 inherit the fathers' wicked dispositions, 
 and imitate the fathers' wicked practices, 
 and do nothing to cut off the entail of the 
 curse. 
 
 (2.) Disgrace is justly put upon those 
 that put disgrace upon others, especially that 
 dishonour and grieve their own parents. An 
 undutiful child that mocks at his parents is 
 <I>no more worthy to be called a son,</I> but deserves 
 to be <I>made as a hired servant,</I> nay, as 
 <I>a servant of servants,</I> among his brethren. 
 
 (3.) Though divine curses operate slowly, 
 yet, first or last, they will take effect. The 
 Canaanites were under a curse of slavery, 
 and yet, for a great while, had the dominion; 
 for a family, a people, a person, may lie 
 under the curse of God, and yet may long 
 prosper in the world, till the measure of 
 their iniquity, like that of the Canaanites, be 
 full. Many are marked for ruin that are not 
 yet ripe for ruin. Therefore, <I>Let not thy 
 heart envy sinners.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He entails a blessing upon Shem and 
 Japheth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He blesses Shem, or rather blesses 
 God for him, yet so that it entitles him to 
 the greatest honour and happiness imaginable, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 Observe, 
 
 [1.] He calls the Lord 
 <I>the god of Shem;</I> and happy, thrice happy, 
 <I>is that people whose God is the</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:15">Ps. cxliv. 15</A>.
 All blessings are included in this. 
 This was the blessing conferred on Abraham 
 and his seed; the God of heaven was 
 <I>not ashamed to be called their God,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>.
 Shem is sufficiently recompensed for 
 his respect to his father by this, that the 
 Lord himself puts this honour upon him, <I>to 
 be his God,</I> which is a sufficient recompence 
 for all our services and all our sufferings for 
 his name. 
 
 [2.] He gives to God the glory 
 of that good work which Shem had done, 
 and, instead of blessing and praising him 
 that was the instrument, he blesses and 
 praises God that was the author. Note, The 
 glory of all that is at any time well done, by 
 ourselves or others, must be humbly and 
 thankfully transmitted to God, who works 
 all our good works in us and for us. When 
 we see men's good works we should glorify, 
 not them, but <I>our Father,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>.
 Thus David, in effect, blessed Abigail, when he 
 <I>blessed God</I> that sent her 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32,33">1 Sam. xxv. 32, 33</A>),
 for it is an honour and a favour to be 
 employed for God and used by him in doing 
 good. 
 
 [3.] He foresees and foretels that 
 God's gracious dealings with Shem and his 
 family would be such as would evidence to all 
 the world that he was the God of Shem, on 
 which behalf thanksgivings would by many 
 be rendered to him: <I>Blessed be the Lord 
 God of Shem.</I> 
 
 [4.] It is intimated that the 
 church should be built up and continued in 
 the posterity of Shem; for of him came the 
 Jews, who were, for a great while, the only 
 professing people God had in the world.
 
 [5.] Some think reference is here had to 
 Christ, who was the Lord God that, in his 
 human nature, should descend from the 
 loins of Shem; for of him, as concerning 
 the flesh, Christ came. 
 
 [6.] Canaan is particularly 
 enslaved to him: <I>He shall be his 
 servant.</I> Note, Those that have the Lord for 
 their God shall have as much of the honour 
 and power of this world as he sees good for 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He blesses Japheth, and, in him, <I>the 
 isles of the Gentiles,</I> which were peopled by 
 his seed: <I>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he 
 shall dwell in the tents of Shem,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 Now, 
 
 [1.] Some make this to belong wholly to 
 Japheth, and to denote either, <I>First,</I> His 
 outward prosperity, that his seed should be 
 so numerous and so victorious that they 
 should be masters of the tents of Shem,
 which was fulfilled when the people of the 
 Jews, the most eminent of Shem's race, were 
 tributaries to the Grecians first and afterwards 
 to the Romans, both of Japheth's 
 seed. Note, Outward prosperity is no infallible 
 mark of the true church: the tents 
 of Shem are not always the tents of the 
 conqueror. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> It denotes the 
 conversion of the Gentiles, and the bringing 
 of them into the church; and then we should 
 read it, <I>God shall persuade Japheth</I> (for so 
 the word signifies), and then, being so persuaded, 
 <I>he shall dwell in the tents of Shem,</I> 
 that is, Jews and Gentiles shall be united together 
 in the gospel fold. After many of the 
 Gentiles shall have been proselyted to the Jewish 
 religion, both shall be one in Christ 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14,15">Eph. ii. 14, 15</A>),

 <A NAME="Page75"> </A>

 and the Christian church, mostly 
 made up of the Gentiles, shall succeed the 
 Jews in the privileges of church-membership; 
 the latter having first cast themselves 
 out by their unbelief, the Gentiles shall 
 dwell in their tents, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11-24">Rom. xi. 11</A>,
 &c. Note, 
 It is God only that can bring those again 
 into the church who have separated themselves 
 from it. It is the power of God that 
 makes the gospel of Christ effectual to salvation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16">Rom. i. 16</A>.
 And again, Souls are 
 brought into the church, not by force, but 
 by persuasion, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.
 They are drawn 
 by the cords of a man, and persuaded by 
 reason to be religious. 
 
 [2.] Others divide 
 this between Japheth and Shem, Shem having 
 not been directly blessed, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 <I>First,</I> 
 Japheth has the blessing of the earth beneath: 
 <I>God shall enlarge Japheth,</I> enlarge 
 his seed, enlarge his border. Japheth's 
 prosperity peopled all Europe, a great part of 
 Asia, and perhaps America. Note, God is 
 to be acknowledged in all our enlargements. 
 It is he that enlarges the coast and enlarges 
 the heart. And again, many dwell in large 
 tents that do not dwell in God's tents, as 
 Japheth did. <I>Secondly,</I> Shem has the blessing 
 of heaven above: <I>He shall</I> (that is, 
 God shall) <I>dwell in the tents of Shem,</I> that is 
 "From his loins <I>Christ shall come,</I> and in 
 his seed the <I>church shall be continued.</I>" The 
 birth-right was now to be divided between 
 Shem and Japheth, Ham being utterly discarded. In 
 the principality which they 
 equally share Canaan shall be servant to 
 both. The double portion is given to Japheth, 
 whom God shall enlarge; but the 
 priesthood is given to Shem, for <I>God shall 
 dwell in the tents of Shem:</I> and certainly we 
 are more happy if we have God dwelling in 
 our tents than if we had there all the silver 
 and gold in the world. It is better to dwell 
 in tents with God than in palaces without 
 him. In Salem, where is God's tabernacle, 
 there is more satisfaction than in all the isles 
 of the Gentiles. <I>Thirdly,</I> They both have dominion 
 over Canaan: <I>Canaan shall be servant 
 to them;</I> so some read it. When Japheth 
 joins with Shem, Canaan falls before them 
 both. When strangers become friends, 
 enemies become servants.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28 And Noah lived after the flood

 hundred and fifty years: and he died.

 Here see, 
 
 1. How God prolonged the life of 
 Noah; he lived 950 years, twenty more than 
 Adam and but nineteen less than Methuselah: 
 this long life was a further reward of 
 his signal piety, and a great blessing to the 
 world, to which no doubt he continued a 
 <I>preacher of righteousness,</I> with this advantage, 
 that now all he preached to were his 
 own children. 
 
 2. How God put a period to 
 his life at last. Though he lived long, yet 
 he died, having probably first seen many 
 that descended from him dead before him. 
 Noah lived to see two worlds, but, being an heir 
 of the righteousness which is by faith, when 
 he died he went to see a better than either.</P>
