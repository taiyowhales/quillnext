 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have instances, 
 
 I. Of Joseph's kindness and 
 affection to his relations, presenting his brethren first and then 
 his father to Pharaoh
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>),
 settling them in Goshen, and 
 providing for them there
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>),
 and paying his respects to 
 his father when he sent for him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:27-31">ver. 27-31</A>.
 
 II. Of Joseph's 
 justice between prince and people in a very critical affair, selling 
 Pharaoh's corn to his subjects with reasonable profits to Pharaoh, 
 and yet without any wrong to them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:13-26">ver. 13</A>,
 &c. Thus he 
 approved himself wise and good, both in his private and in his 
 public capacity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, 
 and said, My father and 
 my brethren, and their flocks, and 
 their herds, and all that they have, 

 <A NAME="Page251"> </A>
 
 are come out of the land of Canaan; 
 and, behold, they <I>are</I> in the land of 
 Goshen.
 &nbsp; 2 And he took some of his 
 brethren, <I>even</I> five men, and presented 
 them unto Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 3 And Pharaoh 
 said unto his brethren, What <I>is</I> your
 occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, 
 Thy servants <I>are</I> shepherds, 
 both we, <I>and</I> also our fathers.
 &nbsp; 4 They 
 said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to 
 sojourn in the land are we come; for 
 thy servants have no pasture for their 
 flocks; for the famine <I>is</I> sore in the 
 land of Canaan: now therefore, we
 pray thee, let thy servants dwell in 
 the land of Goshen.
 &nbsp; 5 And Pharaoh 
 spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father 
 and thy brethren are come unto 
 thee:
 &nbsp; 6 The land of Egypt <I>is</I> before 
 thee; in the best of the land make 
 thy father and brethren to dwell; 
 in the land of Goshen let them dwell: 
 and if thou knowest <I>any</I> men of activity 
 among them, then make them 
 rulers over my cattle.
 &nbsp; 7 And Joseph 
 brought in Jacob his father, and set him 
 before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed 
 Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 8 And Pharaoh said unto 
 Jacob, How old <I>art</I> thou?
 &nbsp; 9 And 
 Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of 
 the years of my pilgrimage <I>are</I> a 
 hundred and thirty years: few and 
 evil have the days of the years of my 
 life been, and have not attained unto
 the days of the years of the life of my 
 fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
 &nbsp; 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and 
 went out from before Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 11 And Joseph placed his father and his 
 brethren, and gave them a possession 
 in the land of Egypt, in the best of 
 the land, in the land of Rameses, as 
 Pharaoh had commanded.
 &nbsp; 12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his 
 brethren, and all his father's household, 
 with bread, according to <I>their</I> families.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The respect which Joseph, as 
 a subject, showed to his prince. Though he 
 was his favourite, and prime-minister of 
 state, and had had particular orders from 
 him to send for his father down to Egypt, 
 yet he would not suffer him to settle till he 
 had given notice of it to Pharaoh,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Christ, our Joseph, disposes of his followers 
 in his kingdom as it is prepared of his Father, 
 saying, <I>It is not mine to give,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23">Matt. xx. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The respect which Joseph, as a brother, 
 showed to his brethren, notwithstanding all 
 the unkindness he had formerly received 
 from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Though he was a great man, and they 
 were comparatively mean and despicable, 
 especially in Egypt, yet he owned them. 
 Let those that are rich and great in the world 
 learn hence not to overlook nor despise their 
 poor relations. Every branch of the tree is 
 not a top branch; but, because it is a lower 
 branch, is it therefore not of the tree? Our 
 Lord Jesus, like Joseph here, is not <I>ashamed 
 to call us brethren.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They being strangers and no courtiers, 
 he introduced some of them to Pharaoh, <I>to 
 kiss his hand,</I> as we say, intending thereby 
 to put an honour upon them among the 
 Egyptians. Thus Christ presents his brethren 
 in the court of heaven, and improves 
 his interest for them, though in themselves 
 unworthy and <I>an abomination to the Egyptians.</I> 
 Being presented to Pharaoh, according 
 to the instructions which Joseph had given 
 them, they tell him, 
 
 (1.) What was their 
 business--that they were shepherds, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 Pharaoh asked them (and Joseph knew it 
 would be one of his first questions,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:33"><I>ch.</I> xlvi. 33</A>),
 <I>What is your occupation?</I> He takes it 
 for granted they had something to do, else 
 Egypt should be no place for them, no harbour 
 for idle vagrants. If they would not 
 work, they should not eat of his bread in this 
 time of scarcity. Note, All that have a 
 place in the world should have an employment 
 in it according to their capacity, some 
 occupation or other, mental or manual. 
 Those that need not work for their bread 
 must yet have something to do, to keep them 
 from idleness. Again, Magistrates should 
 enquire into the occupation of their subjects, 
 as those that have the care of the public 
 welfare; for idle people are as drones in the 
 hive, unprofitable burdens of the commonwealth. 
 
 (2.) What was their business in 
 Egypt--to sojourn in the land
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 not to 
 settle there for ever, only to sojourn there 
 for a time, while the famine so prevailed in 
 Canaan, which lay high, that it was not 
 habitable for shepherds, the grass being 
 burnt up much more than in Egypt, which 
 lay low, and where the corn chiefly failed, 
 while there was tolerably good pasture.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He obtained for them a grant of a settlement 
 in the land of Goshen,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 This 
 was an instance of Pharaoh's gratitude to 
 Joseph; because he had been such a blessing 
 to him and his kingdom, he would be kind 
 to his relations, purely for his sake. He offered 
 them preferment as shepherds over his 
 cattle, provided they were men of activity; 
 for it is the man who is diligent in his business 
 that shall stand before kings. And, 
 whatever our profession or employment is, 
 we should aim to be excellent in it, and 
 to prove ourselves ingenious and industrious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The respect Joseph, as a son, showed 
 to his father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He presented him to Pharaoh,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Pharaoh asks Jacob a common question: 
 <I>How old art thou?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 A question 
 usually put to old men, for it is natural to us 
 to admire old age and to reverence it
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:32">Lev. xix. 32</A>),
 as it is very unnatural and unbecoming 
 to despise it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:5">Isa. iii. 5</A>.
 Jacob's 
 countenance, no doubt, showed him to be 
 very old, for he had been a man of labour 
 and sorrow; in Egypt people were not so 
 long-lived as in Canaan, and therefore Pharaoh 
 looks upon Jacob with wonder; he was 
 as a show in his court. When we are reflecting 
 upon ourselves, this should come 
 into the account, "How old are we?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Jacob gives Pharaoh an uncommon 
 answer,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 He speaks as becomes a patriarch, 
 with an air of seriousness, for the instruction 
 of Pharaoh. Though our speech 
 be not always of grace, yet it must thus be 
 always with grace. Observe here, 
 
 [1.] He 
 calls his life <I>a pilgrimage,</I> looking upon himself 
 as a stranger in this world, and a traveller 
 towards another world: this earth his inn, 
 not his home. To this the apostle refers
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13">Heb. xi. 13</A>),
 <I>They confessed that they were 
 strangers and pilgrims.</I> He not only reckoned 
 himself a pilgrim now that he was in Egypt, 
 a strange country in which he never was before; 
 but his life, even in the land of his nativity, 
 was a pilgrimage, and those who so 
 reckon it can the better bear the inconvenience 
 of banishment from their native soil; 
 they are but pilgrims still, and so they were 
 always. 
 
 [2.] He reckons his life by <I>days;</I> 
 for, even so, it is soon reckoned, and we are 
 not sure of the continuance of it for a day to 
 an end, but may be turned out of this tabernacle 
 at less than an hour's warning. Let 
 us therefore number our days
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:12">Ps. xc. 12</A>),
 and measure them, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:4">Ps. xxxix. 4</A>.
 
 [3.] The 
 character he gives of them is, <I>First,</I> That 
 they were few. Though he had now lived 
 130 years, they seemed to him but a few days, 
 in comparison with the days of eternity, the 
 eternal God, and the eternal state, in which a 
 thousand years (longer than ever any man 
 lived) are but as one day. <I>Secondly,</I> That 
 they were evil. This is true concerning man 
 in general, <I>he is of few days, and full of 
 trouble</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:1">Job xiv. 1</A>);
 and, since his days are 
 evil, it is well they are few. Jacob's life, particularly, 
 had been made up of evil days; 
 and the pleasantest days of his life were yet 
 before him. <I>Thirdly,</I> That they were short
 of the days of his fathers, not so many, not 
 so pleasant, as their days. Old age came 
 sooner upon him than it had done upon 
 some of his ancestors. As the young man 
 should not be proud of his strength or beauty, 
 so the old man should not be proud of his 
 age, and the crown of his hoary hairs, though 
 others justly reverence it; for those who are 
 accounted very old attain not to the years of 
 the patriarchs. The hoary head is a crown 
 of glory only when it is found in the way of 
 righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Jacob both addresses himself to Pharaoh 
 and takes leave of him with a blessing
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 <I>Jacob blessed Pharaoh,</I> and again,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,
 which was not only an act of civility (he paid 
 him respect and returned him thanks for his 
 kindness), but an act of piety--he prayed for 
 him, as one having the authority of a prophet 
 and a patriarch. Though in worldly wealth 
 Pharaoh was the greater, yet, in interest with 
 God, Jacob was the greater; he was God's 
 anointed,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:15">Ps. cv. 15</A>.
 And a patriarch's blessing 
 was not a thing to be despised, no, not 
 by a potent prince. Darius valued the prayers 
 of the church for himself and for his sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:10">Ezra vi. 10</A>.
 Pharaoh kindly received Jacob, 
 and, whether in the name of a prophet or no, 
 thus he had a prophet's reward, which sufficiently 
 recompensed him, not only for his 
 courteous converse with him, but for all the 
 other kindnesses he showed to him and his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He provided well for him and his, <I>placed 
 him in Goshen</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 <I>nourished him</I> and all 
 his with food convenient for them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 This bespeaks, not only Joseph a good man, 
 who took this tender care of his poor relations, 
 but God a good God, who raised him 
 up for this purpose, and put him into a capacity 
 of doing it, as Esther came to the 
 kingdom for such a time as this. What God 
 here did for Jacob he has, in effect, promised 
 to do for all his, that serve him and trust in 
 him.
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:19">Ps. xxxvii. 19</A>,
 <I>In the days of famine 
 they shall be satisfied.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And <I>there was</I> no bread in all 
 the land; for the famine <I>was</I> very sore, 
 so that the land of Egypt and <I>all</I> the 
 land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
 &nbsp; 14 And Joseph gathered 
 up all the money that was found in 
 the land of Egypt, and in the land of 
 Canaan, for the corn which they 
 bought: and Joseph brought the 
 money into Pharaoh's house.
 &nbsp; 15 And 
 when money failed in the land of 
 Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all 
 the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and 
 said, Give us bread: for why should 
 we die in thy presence? for the money
 faileth.
 &nbsp; 16 And Joseph said, Give 
 your cattle; and I will give you for
 your cattle, if money fail.
 &nbsp; 17 And they 
 brought their cattle unto Joseph: and 
 Joseph gave them bread <I>in exchange</I> 
 for horses, and for the flocks, and for
 the cattle of the herds, and for the 
 asses: and he fed them with bread 
 for all their cattle for that year.
 &nbsp; 18 When that year was ended, they came 

 <A NAME="Page253"> </A>

 unto him the second year, and said 
 unto him, We will not hide <I>it</I> from 
 my lord, how that our money is spent; 
 my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
 there is not ought left in the sight 
 of my lord, but our bodies, and our 
 lands:
 &nbsp; 19 Wherefore shall we die 
 before thine eyes, both we and our
 land? buy us and our land for bread, 
 and we and our land will be servants 
 unto Pharaoh: and give <I>us</I> seed, that 
 we may live, and not die, that the land 
 be not desolate.
 &nbsp; 20 And Joseph 
 bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; 
 for the Egyptians sold every 
 man his field, because the famine prevailed
 over them: so the land became 
 Pharaoh's.
 &nbsp; 21 And as for the people, 
 he removed them to cities from <I>one</I>
 end of the borders of Egypt even to 
 the <I>other</I> end thereof.
 &nbsp; 22 Only the 
 land of the priests bought he not; for 
 the priests had a portion <I>assigned 
 them</I> of Pharaoh, and did eat their
 portion which Pharaoh gave them: 
 wherefore they sold not their lands.
 &nbsp; 23 Then Joseph said unto the people, 
 Behold, I have bought you this day 
 and your land for Pharaoh: lo, <I>here 
 is</I> seed for you, and ye shall sow the 
 land.
 &nbsp; 24 And it shall come to pass 
 in the increase, that ye shall give the 
 fifth <I>part</I> unto Pharaoh, and four parts 
 shall be your own, for seed of the field, 
 and for your food, and for them of
 your households, and for food for your 
 little ones.
 &nbsp; 25 And they said, Thou 
 hast saved our lives: let us find grace
 in the sight of my lord, and we will 
 be Pharaoh's servants.
 &nbsp; 26 And Joseph 
 made it a law over the land of 
 Egypt unto this day, <I>that</I> Pharaoh 
 should have the fifth <I>part;</I> except the 
 land of the priests only, <I>which</I> became 
 not Pharaoh's.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Care being taken of Jacob and his family, 
 the preservation of which was especially designed 
 by Providence in Joseph's advancement, 
 an account is now given of the saving 
 of the kingdom of Egypt too from ruin; for 
 God is King of nations as well as King of 
 saints, and provideth food for all flesh. Joseph 
 now returns to the management of that 
 great trust which Pharaoh had lodged in his 
 hand. It would have been pleasing enough 
 to him to have gone and lived with his father 
 and brethren in Goshen; but his employment 
 would not permit it. When he had 
 seen his father, and seen him well settled, he 
 applied himself as closely as ever to the execution 
 of his office. Note, Even natural 
 affection must give way to necessary business. 
 Parents and children must be content to be 
 absent one from another, when it is necessary, 
 on either side, for the service of God or their 
 generation. In Joseph's transactions with 
 the Egyptians observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great extremity that Egypt, and the 
 parts adjacent, were reduced to by the famine. 
 There was no bread, and they <I>fainted</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 they were ready to die,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:15,19"><I>v.</I> 15, 19</A>.
 
 1. See 
 here what a dependence we have upon God's 
 providence. If its usual favours are suspended 
 but for a while, we die, we perish, we 
 all perish. All our wealth would not keep 
 us from starving if the rain of heaven were 
 but withheld for two or three years. See 
 how much we lie at God's mercy, and let us 
 keep ourselves always in his love. 
 
 2. See 
 how much we smart by our own improvidence. 
 If all the Egyptians had done for 
 themselves in the seven years of plenty as 
 Joseph did for Pharaoh, they had not been 
 now in these straits; but they regarded not 
 the warning they had of the years of famine, 
 concluding that to-morrow shall be as this 
 day, next year as this, and much more abundant. 
 Note, Because man knows not his 
 time (his time of gathering when he has it) 
 therefore his misery is great upon him when 
 the spending time comes,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:6,7">Eccl. viii. 6, 7</A>.

 3. See how early God put a difference between 
 the Egyptians and the Israelites, as 
 afterwards in the plagues,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:22,9:4,10:23">Exod. viii. 22; ix. 4, 26; x. 23</A>.
 Jacob and his family, 
 though strangers, were plentifully fed on free 
 cost, while the Egyptians were dying for
 want. See 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:13">Isa. lxv. 13</A>,
 <I>My servants shall 
 eat, but you shall be hungry. Happy art thou, 
 O Israel.</I> Whoever wants, God's children 
 shall not,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The price they had come up to, for 
 their supply, in this exigency. 
 
 1. They parted 
 with all their money which they had hoarded 
 up,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 Silver and gold would not feed 
 them, they must have corn. All the money 
 of the kingdom was by this means brought 
 into the exchequer. 
 
 2. When the money 
 failed, they parted with all their cattle, those 
 for labour, as the horses and asses, and those 
 for food, as the flocks and the herds,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 By this it should seem that we may better 
 live upon bread without flesh than upon flesh 
 without bread. We may suppose they parted 
 the more easily with their cattle because they 
 had little or no grass for them; and now 
 Pharaoh saw in reality what he had before 
 seen in vision, nothing but lean kine. 
 
 3. When they had sold their stocks off their land, 
 it was easy to persuade themselves (rather than 
 starve) to sell their land too; for what good 
 would that do them, when they had neither 
 corn to sow it nor cattle to eat of it? They 

 <A NAME="Page253"> </A>

 therefore sold that next, for a further supply 
 of corn. 
 
 4. When their land was sold, so 
 that they had nothing to live on, they must 
 of course sell themselves, that they might 
 live purely upon their labour, and hold their 
 lands by the base tenure of villanage, at the 
 courtesy of the crown. Note, <I>Skin for skin, 
 and all that a man hath,</I> even liberty and property 
 (those darling twins), <I>will he give for his 
 life;</I> for life is sweet. There are few (though 
 perhaps there are some) who would even dare 
 to die rather than live in slavery, and dependence
 on an arbitrary power. And perhaps 
 there are those who, in that case, could 
 die by the sword, in a heat, who yet could 
 not deliberately die by famine, which is much 
 worse,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9">Lam. iv. 9</A>.
 Now it was a great mercy 
 to the Egyptians that, in this distress, they 
 could have corn at any rate; if they had all 
 died for hunger, their lands perhaps would 
 have escheated to the crown of course, for 
 want of heirs; they therefore resolved to make 
 the best of bad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The method which Joseph took to 
 accommodate the matter between prince and 
 people, so that the prince might have his just 
 advantage, and yet the people not be quite 
 ruined. 
 
 1. For their lands, he needed not come 
 to any bargain with them while the years of 
 famine lasted; but when these were over (for 
 God will not contend for ever, nor will he be 
 always wroth) he came to an agreement, 
 which it seems both sides were pleased with, 
 that the people should occupy and enjoy the 
 lands, as he thought fit to assign them, and 
 should have seed to sow them with out of the 
 king's stores, for their own proper use and 
 behoof, yielding and paying only a fifth part 
 of the yearly profits as a chief rent to the 
 crown. This became a standing law,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 And it was a very good bargain to have food 
 for their lands, when otherwise they and 
 theirs must have starved, and then to have 
 their lands again upon such easy terms. 
 Note, Those ministers of state are worthy of 
 double honour, both for wisdom and integrity, 
 that keep the balance even between prince 
 and people, so that liberty and property may 
 not intrench upon prerogative, nor the prerogative 
 bear hard upon liberty and property: 
 in the multitude of such counsellors there is 
 safety. If afterwards the Egyptians thought 
 it hard to pay so great a duty to the king out 
 of their lands, they must remember, not only 
 how just, but how kind, the first imposing of 
 it was. They might thankfully pay a fifth 
 where all was due. It is observable how 
 faithful Joseph was to him that appointed 
 him. He did not put the money into his 
 own pocket, nor entail the lands upon his 
 own family; but converted both entirely to 
 Pharaoh's use; and therefore we do not find 
 that his posterity went out of Egypt any 
 richer than the rest of their poor brethren. 
 Those in public trusts, if they raise great 
 estates, must take heed that it be not at the 
 expense of a good conscience, which is much 
 more valuable. 
 
 2. For their persons, he removed 
 them to cities,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 He transplanted 
 them, to show Pharaoh's sovereign power 
 over them, and that they might, in time, forget 
 their titles to their lands, and be the more 
 easily reconciled to their new condition of 
 servitude. The Jewish writers say, "He removed 
 them thus from their former habitations 
 because they reproached his brethren 
 as strangers, to silence which reproach they 
 were all made, in effect, strangers." See 
 what changes a little time may make with a 
 people, and how soon God can empty those 
 from vessel to vessel who had settled upon 
 their lees. How hard soever this seems to 
 have been upon them, they themselves were 
 at this time sensible of it as a very great 
 kindness, and were thankful they were not 
 worse used: <I>Thou hast saved our lives,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 Note, There is good reason that the Saviour 
 of our lives should be the Master of our lives. 
 "Thou hast saved us; do what thou wilt 
 with us."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The reservation he made in favour of 
 the priests. They were maintained on free 
 cost, so that they needed not to sell their 
 lands,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 <I>All people will thus walk in the 
 name of their God;</I> they will be kind to those 
 that attend the public service of their God, 
 and that minister to them in holy things; and 
 we should, in like manner, honour our God, 
 by esteeming his ministers highly in love for 
 their work's sake.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27 And Israel dwelt in the land of 
 Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and 
 they had possessions therein, and 
 grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
 &nbsp; 28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 
 seventeen years: so the whole age of 
 Jacob was a hundred forty and seven 
 years.
 &nbsp; 29 And the time drew nigh 
 that Israel must die: and he called
 his son Joseph, and said unto him, If 
 now I have found grace in thy sight, 
 put, I pray thee, thy hand under my 
 thigh, and deal kindly and truly with 
 me; bury me not, I pray thee, in 
 Egypt:
 &nbsp; 30 But I will lie with my 
 fathers, and thou shalt carry me out
 of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. 
 And he said, I will do as 
 thou hast said.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, Swear 
 unto me. And he sware unto him. And
 Israel bowed himself upon the bed's 
 head.

 Observe, 
 
 1. The comfort Jacob lived in
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>);
 while the Egyptians were impoverished 
 in their own land, Jacob was replenished 
 in a strange land. He lived 
 seventeen years after he came into Egypt, 
 far beyond his own expectation. Seventeen 

 <A NAME="Page255"> </A>

 years he had nourished Joseph (for so old he 
 was when he was sold from him,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 2</A>),
 and now, by way of requital, seventeen 
 years Joseph nourished him. Observe how 
 kindly Providence ordered Jacob's affairs, 
 that when he was old, and least able to bear 
 care or fatigue, he had least occasion for it, 
 being well provided for by his son without 
 his own forecast. Thus God considers the 
 frame of his people. 
 
 2. The care Jacob died 
 in. At last <I>the time drew nigh that Israel 
 must die,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 Israel, a prince with God,
 that had power over the angel and prevailed, 
 yet must yield to death. There is no remedy, 
 he <I>must die:</I> it is appointed for all men, 
 therefore for him; and there is no discharge 
 in that war. Joseph supplied him with 
 bread, that he might not die by famine; but 
 this did not secure him from dying by age or 
 sickness. He died by degrees; his candle 
 was not blown out, but gradually burnt down 
 to the socket, so that he saw, at some distance, 
 the time drawing nigh. Note, It is 
 an improvable advantage to see the approach 
 of death before we feel its arrests, that we 
 may be quickened to do what our hand finds 
 to do with all our might: however, it is not 
 far from any of us. Now Jacob's care, as he 
 saw the day approaching, was about his 
 burial, not the pomp of it (he was no way 
 solicitous about that), but the place of it. 
 
 (1.) He would be buried in Canaan. This 
 he resolved on, not from mere humour, because 
 Canaan was the land of his nativity, 
 but in faith, because it was the land of promise 
 (which he desired thus, as it were, to 
 keep possession of, till the time should come 
 when his posterity should be masters of it), 
 and because it was a type of heaven, that 
 better country which he that said these 
 things declared plainly that he was in expectation 
 of,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14">Heb. xi. 14</A>.
 He aimed at a good 
 land, which would be his rest and bliss on 
 the other side death. 
 
 (2.) He would have 
 Joseph sworn to bring him thither to be 
 buried
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:29,31"><I>v.</I> 29, 31</A>),
 that Joseph, being under 
 such a solemn obligation to do it, might 
 have that to answer to the objections which 
 otherwise might have been made against it, 
 and for the greater satisfaction of Jacob now 
 in his dying minutes. Nothing will better 
 help to make a death-bed easy than the certain 
 prospect of a rest in Canaan after death. 
 
 (3.) When this was done <I>Israel bowed himself 
 upon the bed's head,</I> yielding himself, as 
 it were, to the stroke of death ("Now let it 
 come, and it shall be welcome"), or worshipping 
 God, as it is explained,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21">Heb. xi. 21</A>,
 giving God thanks for all his favours, and 
 particularly for this, that Joseph was ready, 
 not only to put his hand upon his eyes to 
 close them, but under his thigh to give him 
 the satisfaction he desired concerning his 
 burial. Thus those that go down to the 
 dust should, with humble thankfulness, bow 
 before God, the God of their mercies,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:29">Ps. xxii. 29</A>.</P>
