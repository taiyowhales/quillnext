 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Care had been taken by some preceding laws for the vigorous and 
 effectual persecution of a wilful murderer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:11-13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 11</A>,

 &c.), the putting
 of whom to death was the putting away of the guilt of blood from the
 land; but if this could not be done, the murderer not being discovered, 
 they must not think that the land was in no danger of contracting any 
 pollution because it was not through any neglect of theirs that the 
 murderer was unpunished; no, a great solemnity is here provided for the 
 putting away of the guilt, as an expression of their dread and 
 detestation of that sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case supposed is that <I>one is found slain, and it is not known 
 who slew him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The providence of God has sometimes wonderfully brought to light these
 hidden works of darkness, and by strange occurrences the sin of the 
 guilty has found them out, insomuch that it has become a proverb, 
 <I>Murder will out.</I> But it is not always so; now and then the 
 devil's promises of secresy and impunity in this world are made good; 
 yet it is but for a while: there is a time coming when secret murders 
 will be discovered; the <I>earth shall disclose her blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21">Isa. xxvi. 21</A>),

 upon the inquisition which justice makes for it; and there is an
 eternity coming when those that escaped punishment from men will lie 
 under the righteous judgment of God. And the impunity with which so 
 many murders and other wickednesses are committed in this world makes 
 it necessary that there should be a day of judgment, to <I>require that 
 which is past,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:15">Eccl. iii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Directions are given concerning what is to be done in this case.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is taken for granted that a diligent search had been made for the 
 murderer, witnesses examined, and circumstances strictly enquired into, 
 that if possible they might find out the guilty person; but if, after 
 all, they could not trace it out, not fasten the charge upon any, then, 
 
 (1.) The <I>elders of the next city</I> (that had a court of three and
 twenty in it) were to concern themselves about this matter. If it were 
 doubtful which city was next, the great sanhedrim were to send 
 commissioners to determine that matter by an exact measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 Note, Public persons must be solicitous about the public good; and
 those that are in power and reputation in cities must lay out 
 themselves to redress grievances, and reform what is amiss in the 
 country and neighbourhood that lie about them. Those that are next to 
 them should have the largest share of their good influence, as 
 ministers of God for good. 

 (2.) The priests and Levites must assist and preside in this solemnity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that they might direct the management of it in all points according to
 the law, and particularly might be the people's mouth to God in the 
 prayer that was to be put up on this sad occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 God being Israel's King, his ministers must be their magistrates, and
 by their word, as the mouth of the court and learned in the laws, every 
 controversy must be tried. It was Israel's privilege that they had such 
 guides, overseers, and rulers, and their duty to make use of them upon 
 all occasions, especially in sacred things, as this was.

 (3.) They were to bring a heifer down into a rough and unoccupied
 valley, and to kill it there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 This was not a sacrifice (for it was not brought to the altar), but a
 solemn protestation that thus they would put the murderer to death if 
 they had him in their hands. The heifer must be one that had not drawn 
 in the yoke, to signify (say some) that the murderer was a son of 
 Belial; it must be brought into a rough valley, to signify the horror 
 of the fact, and that the defilement which blood brings upon a land 
 turns it into barrenness. And the Jews say that unless, after this, the 
 murderer was found out, this valley where the heifer was killed was 
 never to be tilled nor sown.

 (4.) The elders were to <I>wash their hands in water</I> over the
 heifer that was killed, and to profess, not only that they had not shed 
 this innocent blood themselves, but that they knew not who had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 nor had knowingly concealed the murderer, helped him to make his
 escape, or been any way aiding or abetting. To this custom David 
 alludes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6">Ps. xxvi. 6</A>,

 <I>I will wash my hands in innocency;</I> but if Pilate had any eye to
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:24">Matt. xxvii. 24</A>)

 he wretchedly misapplied it when he condemned Christ, knowing him to be
 innocent, and yet acquitted himself from the guilt of innocent blood.
 <I>Protestatio non valet contra factum--Protestations are of no avail 
 when contradicted by fact.</I> 

 (5.) The priests were to pray to God for the country and nation, that
 God would be merciful to them, and not bring upon them the judgments 
 which the connivance at the sin of murder would deserve. It might be 
 presumed that the murderer was either one of their city or was now 
 harboured in their city; and therefore they must pray that they might 
 not fare the worse for his being among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:22">Num. xvi. 22</A>.

 <I>Be merciful, O Lord, to thy people Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, When we hear of the wickedness of the wicked we have need to cry
 earnestly to God for mercy for our land, which groans and trembles 
 under it. We must empty the measure by our prayers which others are 
 filling by their sins.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This solemnity was appointed, 

 (1.) That it might give occasion to common and public discourse
 concerning the murder, which perhaps might some way or other occasion 
 the discovery of it.

 (2.) That it might possess people with a dread of the guilt of blood,
 which defiles not only the conscience of him that sheds it (this should 
 engage us all to pray with David, <I>Deliver me from 
 blood--guiltiness</I>), but the land in which it is shed; it cries to 
 the magistrate for justice on the criminal, and, if that cry be not 
 heard, it cries to heaven for judgment on the land. If there must be so 
 much care employed to save the land from guilt when the murderer was 
 not known, it was certainly impossible to secure it from guilt if the 
 murderer was known and yet protected. All would be taught, by this 
 solemnity, to use their utmost care and diligence to prevent, discover, 
 and punish murder. Even the heathen mariners dreaded the guilt of 
 blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:14">Jon. i. 14</A>.

 (3.) That we might all learn to take heed of partaking in other men's
 sins, and making ourselves accessory to them <I>ex post facto--after 
 the fact,</I> by countenancing the sin or sinner, and not witnessing 
 against it in our places. We have <I>fellowship with the unfruitful 
 works of darkness</I> if we do not reprove them rather, and bear our 
 testimony against them. The repentance of the church of Corinth for the 
 sin of one of their members produced such a carefulness, such a 
 clearing of themselves, such a holy indignation, fear, and revenge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>),

 as were signified by the solemnity here appointed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast
 taken them captive,
 &nbsp; 11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
 desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;
 &nbsp; 12 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall
 shave her head, and pare her nails;
 &nbsp; 13 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
 and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
 mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
 and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
 &nbsp; 14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
 shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at
 all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because
 thou hast humbled her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By this law a soldier is allowed to marry his captive if he pleased. 
 For the hardness of their hearts Moses gave them this permission, lest, 
 if they had not had liberty given them to marry such, they should have 
 taken liberty to defile themselves with them, and by such wickedness 
 the camp would have been troubled. The man is supposed to have a wife 
 already, and to take this wife for a secondary wife, as the Jews called 
 them. This indulgence of men's inordinate desires, in which their 
 hearts walked after their eyes, is by no means agreeable to the law of 
 Christ, which therefore in this respect, among others, far exceeds in 
 glory the law of Moses. The gospel permits not him that has one wife to 
 take another, for <I>from the beginning it was not so.</I> The gospel 
 forbids looking upon a woman, though a beautiful one, to lust after 
 her, and commands the mortifying and denying of all irregular desires, 
 though it be as uneasy as the cutting off of a right hand; so much does 
 our holy religion, more than that of the Jews, advance the honour and 
 support the dominion of the soul over the body, the spirit over the 
 flesh, consonant to the glorious discovery it makes of life and 
 immortality, and the better hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, though military men were allowed this liberty, yet care is here 
 taken that they should not abuse it, that is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they should not abuse themselves by doing it too hastily, 
 though the captive was ever so desirable: "<I>If thou wouldest have her 
 to thy wife</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>),

 it is true thou needest not ask her parents' consent, for she is thy
 captive, and is at thy disposal. But, 

 1. Thou shalt have no familiar intercourse till thou hast married her."
 This allowance was designed to gratify, not a filthy brutish lust, in 
 the heat and fury of its rebellion against reason and virtue, but an 
 honourable and generous affection to a comely and amiable person, 
 though in distress; therefore he may make her his wife if he will, but 
 he must not <I>deal with her as with a harlot.</I> 

 2. "Thou shalt not marry her of a sudden, but keep her a full month in
 thy house," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 This he must do either,

 (1.) That he may try to take his affection off from her; for he must
 know that, though in marrying her he does not do ill (so the law then 
 stood), yet in letting her alone he does much better. Let her therefore 
 shave her head, that he might not be enamoured with her locks, and 
 <I>let her nails grow</I> (so the margin reads it), to spoil the beauty 
 of her hand. <I>Quisquid amas cupias non placuisse nimis--We should 
 moderate our affection for those things which we are tempted to love 
 inordinately.</I> Or rather,

 (2.) This was done in token of her renouncing idolatry, and becoming a
 proselyte to the Jewish religion. The shaving of her head, the paring 
 of her nails, and the changing of her apparel, signified her putting 
 off her former conversation, which was corrupt in her ignorance, that 
 she might become a new creature. She must remain in his house to be 
 taught the good knowledge of the Lord and the worship of him: and the 
 Jews say that if she refused, and continued obstinate in idolatry, he 
 must not marry her. Note, The professors of religion must not be 
 unequally yoked with unbelievers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14">2 Cor. vi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they should not abuse the poor captive. 

 1. She must have time to <I>bewail her father and mother,</I> from whom
 she was separated, and without whose consent and blessing she is now 
 likely to be married, and perhaps to a common soldier of Israel, though 
 in her country ever so nobly born and bred. To force a marriage till 
 these sorrows were digested, and in some measure got over, and she was 
 better reconciled to the land of her captivity by being better 
 acquainted with it, would be very unkind. She must not bewail her 
 idols, but be glad to part with them; to her near and dear relations 
 only her affection must be thus indulged. 

 2. If, upon second thoughts, he that had brought her to his house with
 a purpose to marry her changed his mind and would not marry her, he 
 might not make merchandise of her, as of his other prisoners, but must 
 give her liberty to return, if she pleased, to her own country, because 
 he had humbled her and afflicted her, by raising expectations and then 
 disappointing them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 having made a fool of her, he might not make a prey of her. This
 intimates how binding the laws of justice and honour are, particularly 
 in the pretensions of love, the courting of affections, and the 
 promises of marriage, which are to be looked upon as solemn things, 
 that have something sacred in them, and therefore are not to be jested 
 with.</P>

 for he <I>is</I> the beginning of his strength; the right of the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This law restrains men from disinheriting their eldest sons out of mere 
 caprice, and without just provocation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case here put 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 is very instructive. 

 1. It shows the great mischief of having more wives than one, which the
 law of Moses did not restrain, probably in hopes that men's own 
 experience of the great inconvenience of it in families would at last 
 put an end to it and make them a law to themselves. Observe the 
 supposition here: If a man have two wives, it is a thousand to one but 
 one of them is beloved and the other hated (that is, manifestly loved 
 less) as Leah was by Jacob, and the effect of this cannot but be 
 strifes and jealousies, envy, confusion, and every evil work, which 
 could not but create a constant uneasiness and vexation to the husband, 
 and involve him both in sin and trouble. Those do much better consult 
 their own ease and satisfaction who adhere to God's law than those who 
 indulge their own lusts. 

 2. It shows how Providence commonly sides with the weakest, and
 <I>gives more abundant honour to that part which lacked;</I> for the 
 first-born son is here supposed to be <I>hers that was hated;</I> it 
 was so in Jacob's family: because <I>the Lord saw that Leah was 
 hated,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:31">Gen. xxix. 31</A>.

 The great householder wisely gives to each his dividend of comfort; if
 one had the honour to be the beloved wife, it often proved that the 
 other had the honour to be the mother of the first-born.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The law in this case is still binding on parents; they must give 
 their children their right without partiality. In the case supposed, 
 the eldest son, though the son of the less-beloved wife, must have his 
 birthright privilege, which was a double portion of the father's 
 estate, because he was the beginning of his strength that is, in him 
 his family began to be strengthened and his quiver began to be filled 
 with the <I>arrows of a mighty man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:4">Ps. cxxvii. 4</A>),

 and therefore the right of the first-born is his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Jacob had indeed deprived Reuben of his birthright, and given it to
 Joseph, but it was because Reuben had forfeited the birthright by his 
 incest, not because he was the <I>son of the hated;</I> now, lest that 
 which Jacob did justly should be drawn into a precedent for others to 
 do the same thing unjustly, it is here provided that when the father 
 makes his will, or otherwise settled his estate, the child shall not 
 fare the worse for the mother's unhappiness in having less of her 
 husband's love, for that was not the child's fault. Note,

 (1.) Parents ought to make no other difference in dispensing their
 affections among their children than what they see plainly God makes in 
 dispensing his grace among them.

 (2.) Since it is the providence of God that makes heirs, the disposal
 of providence in that matter must be acquiesced in and not opposed. No 
 son should be abandoned by his father till he manifestly appear to be 
 abandoned of God, which is hard to say of any while there is life.</P>

 there is no partiality in the divine law. Observe,</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 No child was to fare the worse for the weakness of his capacity, the
 slowness or dulness of his understanding, but for his wilfulness and 
 obstinacy. If he carry himself proudly and insolently towards his 
 parents, contemn their authority, slight their reproofs and 
 admonitions, disobey the express commands they give him for his own 
 good, hate to be reformed by the correction they give him, shame their 
 family, grieve their hearts, waste their substance, and threaten to 
 ruin their estate by riotous living--this is a <I>stubborn and 
 rebellious son.</I> He is particularly supposed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 to be a <I>glutton or a drunkard.</I> This intimates either,

 (1.) That these were sins which his parents did in a particular manner
 warn him against, and therefore that in these instances there was a 
 plain evidence that he did not obey their voice. Lemuel had this charge 
 from his mother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:4">Prov. xxxi. 4</A>.

 Note, In the education of children, great care should be taken to
 suppress all inclinations to drunkenness, and to keep them out of the 
 way of temptations to it; in order hereunto they should be possessed 
 betimes with a dread and detestation of that beastly sin, and taught 
 betimes to deny themselves. Or,

 (2.) That his being a <I>glutton and a drunkard</I> was the cause of
 his insolence and obstinacy towards his parents. Note, There is nothing 
 that draws men into all manner of wickedness, and hardens them in it, 
 more certainly and fatally than drunkenness does. When men take to 
 drink they forget the law, they forget all law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>),

 even that fundamental law of honouring parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How this criminal is to be proceeded against. His own father and 
 mother are to be his prosecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 They might not put him to death themselves, but they must complain of
 him to the elders of the city, and the complaint must needs be made 
 with a sad heart: <I>This our son is stubborn and rebellious.</I> Note, 
 Those that give up themselves to vice and wickedness, and will not be 
 reclaimed, forfeit their interest in the natural affections of the 
 nearest relations; the instruments of their being justly become the 
 instruments of their destruction. The children that forget their duty 
 must thank themselves and not blame their parents if they are regarded 
 with less and less affection. And, how difficult soever tender parents 
 now find it to reconcile themselves to the just punishment of their 
 rebellious children, in the day of the revelation of the righteous 
 judgment of God all natural affection will be so entirely swallowed up 
 in divine love that they will acquiesce even in the condemnation of 
 those children, because God will be therein for ever glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What judgment is to be executed upon him: he must publicly <I>stoned 
 to death by the men of his city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 And thus,

 (1.) The paternal authority was supported, and God, our common Father,
 showed himself jealous for it, it being one of the first and most 
 ancient streams derived from him that is the fountain of all power.

 (2.) This law, if duly executed, would <I>early destroy the wicked of
 the land.</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:8">Ps. ci. 8</A>),

 and prevent the spreading of the gangrene, by cutting off the corrupt
 part betimes; for those that were bad members of families would never 
 make good members of the commonwealth.

 (3.) It would strike an awe upon children, and frighten them into
 obedience to their parents, if they would not otherwise be brought to 
 their duty and kept in it: <I>All Israel shall hear.</I> The Jews say, 
 "The elders that condemned him were to send notice of it in writing all 
 the nation over, <I>In such a court, such a day, we stoned such a one, 
 because he was a stubborn and rebellious son.</I>" And I have sometimes 
 wished that as in all our courts there is an exact record kept of the 
 condemnation of criminals, <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--that the 
 memorial may never be lost,</I> so there might be public and authentic 
 notice given in print to the kingdom of such condemnations, and the 
 executions upon them, by the elders themselves, <I>in terrorem--that 
 all may hear and fear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A law for the burying of the bodies of malefactors that were 
 hanged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The hanging of them by the neck till the body was dead was not used at
 all among the Jews, as with us; but of such as were stoned to death, if 
 it were for blasphemy, or some other very execrable crime, it was 
 usual, by order of the judges, to hang up the dead bodies upon a post 
 for some time, as a spectacle to the world, to express the ignominy of 
 the crime, and to strike the greater terror upon others, that they 
 might not only hear and fear, but see and fear. Now it is here provided 
 that, whatever time of the day they were thus hanged up, at sun-set 
 they should be taken down and buried, and not left to hang out all 
 night; sufficient (says the law) <I>to such a man is this 
 punishment;</I> hitherto let it go, but no further. Let the malefactor 
 and his crime be hidden in the grave. Now,

 1. God would thus preserve the honour of human bodies and tenderness
 towards the worst of criminals. The time of exposing dead bodies thus 
 is limited for the same reason that the number of stripes was limited 
 by another law: <I>Lest thy brother seem vile unto thee.</I> Punishing 
 beyond death God reserves to himself; as for man, there is no more that 
 he can do.  Whether therefore the hanging of malefactors in chains, and 
 setting up their heads and quarters, be decent among Christians that 
 look for the resurrection of the body, may perhaps be worth 
 considering. 

 2. Yet it is plain there was something ceremonial in it; by the law of
 Moses the touch of a dead body was defiling, and therefore dead bodies 
 must not be left hanging up in the country, because, by the same rule, 
 this would defile the land. But, 

 3. There is one reason here given which has reference to Christ. <I>He
 that is hanged is accursed of God,</I> that is, it is the highest 
 degree of disgrace and reproach that can be done to a man, and 
 proclaims him under the curse of God as much as any external punishment 
 can. Those that see him thus hang between heaven and earth will 
 conclude him abandoned of both and unworthy of either; and therefore 
 let him not hang all night, for that would carry it too far. Now the 
 apostle, showing how Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law 
 by being himself made a curse for us, illustrates it by comparing the 
 brand here put on him that was hanged on a tree with the death of 
 Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Gal. iii. 13</A>.

 Moses, by the Spirit, uses this phrase of being <I>accursed of God,</I>
 when he means no more than being treated most ignominiously, that it 
 might afterwards be applied to the death of Christ, and might show that 
 in it he underwent the curse of the law for us, which is a great 
 enhancement of his love and a great encouragement to our faith in him. 
 And (as the excellent bishop Patrick well observes) this passage is 
 applied to the death of Christ, not only because he bore our sins and 
 was exposed to shame, as these malefactors were that were accursed of 
 God, but because he was in the evening taken down from the cursed tree 
 and buried (and that by the particular care of the Jews, with an eye to 
 this law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:31">John xix. 31</A>),

 in token that now, the guilt being removed, the law was satisfied, as
 it was when the malefactor had hanged till sun-set; it demanded no 
 more. Then he ceased to be a curse, and those that were his. And, as 
 the land of Israel was pure and clean when the dead body was buried, so 
 the church is washed and cleansed by the complete satisfaction which 
 thus Christ made.</P>
