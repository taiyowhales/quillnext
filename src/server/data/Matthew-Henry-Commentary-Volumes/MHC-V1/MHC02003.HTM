 As prophecy had ceased for many ages before the coming of Christ, that
 the revival and perfection of it in that great prophet might be the
 more remarkable, so vision had ceased (for aught that appears) among
 the patriarchs for some ages before the coming of Moses, that God's
 appearances to him for Israel's salvation might be the more welcome;
 and in this chapter we have God's first appearance to him in the bush
 and the conference between God and Moses in that vision. Here is,

 I. The discovery God was pleased to make of his glory to Moses at the
 bush, to which Moses was forbidden to approach too near,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. A general declaration of God's grace and good-will to his people,
 who were beloved for their fathers' sakes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:6">ver. 6</A>.

 III. A particular notification of God's purpose concerning the
 deliverance of Israel out of Egypt.

 1. He assures Moses it should now be done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 2. He gives him a commission to act in it as his ambassador both to
 Pharaoh,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:10">ver. 10</A>)

 and to Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:16">ver. 16</A>.

 3. He answers the objection Moses made of his own unworthiness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 4. He gives him full instructions what to say both to Pharaoh and to
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>.

 5. He tells him beforehand what the issue would be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:19-22">ver. 19</A>,

 1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
 priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
 desert, and came to the mountain of God, <I>even</I> to Horeb.
 2 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto him in a flame of
 fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
 bush burned with fire, and the bush <I>was</I> not consumed.
 3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
 sight, why the bush is not burnt.
 4 And when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saw that he turned aside to see, God called
 unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
 And he said, Here <I>am</I> I.
 5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
 thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest <I>is</I> holy ground.
 6 Moreover he said, I <I>am</I> the God of thy father, the God of
 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
 his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The years of the life of Moses are remarkably divided into three
 forties: the first forty he spent as a prince in Pharaoh's court, the
 second a shepherd in Midian, the third a king in Jeshurun; so
 changeable is the life of men, especially the life of good men. He had
 now finished his second forty, when he received his commission to
 bring Israel out of Egypt. Note, Sometimes it is long before God calls
 his servants out of that work which of old he designed them for, and
 has been graciously preparing them for. Moses was born to be Israel's
 deliverer, and yet not a word is said of it to him till he is eighty
 years of age. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this appearance of God to him found him employed. He was
 keeping the flock (tending sheep) near mount Horeb,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This was a poor employment for a man of his parts and education, yet
 he rests satisfied with it, and thus learns meekness and contentment
 to a high degree, for which he is more celebrated in sacred writ than
 for all his other learning. Note,

 1. In the calling to which we are called we should abide, and not be 
 given to change. 

 2. Even those that are qualified for great employments and services 
 must not think it strange if they be confined to obscurity; it was the 
 lot of Moses before them, who foresaw nothing to the contrary but that 
 he should die, as he had lived a great while, a poor despicable 
 shepherd. Let those that think themselves buried alive be content to 
 shine like lamps in their sepulchres, and wait till God's time come for 
 setting them on a candlestick. Thus employed Moses was, when he was 
 honoured with this vision. Note, (1.) God will encourage industry. The 
 shepherds were keeping their flocks when they received the tidings of 
 our Saviour's birth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:8">Luke ii. 8</A>.

 Satan loves to find us idle; God is well pleased when he finds us
 employed. 

 (2.) Retirement is a good friend to our communion with God.  When we
 are alone, the Father is with us.  Moses saw more of God in a desert 
 than ever he had seen in Pharaoh's court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the appearance was. To his great surprise he saw a bush
 burning, when he perceived no fire either from earth or heaven to
 kindle it, and, which was more strange, it did not consume,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was an angel of the Lord that appeared to him; some think, a
 created angel, who speaks in the language of him that sent him;
 others, the second person, the angel of the covenant, who is himself
 Jehovah. It was an extraordinary manifestation of the divine presence
 and glory; what was visible was produced by the ministry of an angel,
 but he heard God in it speaking to him. 

 1. He saw a flame of fire; <I>for our God is a consuming fire.</I> When
 Israel's deliverance out of Egypt was promised to Abraham, he saw a 
 burning lamp, which signified the light of joy which that deliverance 
 should cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:17">Gen. xv. 17</A>);

 but now it shines brighter, as a flame of fire, for God in
 that deliverance brought terror and destruction to his enemies, light
 and heat to his people, and displayed his glory before all. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:17">Isa. x. 17</A>.

 2. This fire was not in a tall and stately cedar, but in a bush, <I>a
 thorny bush,</I> so the word signifies; for God chooses the weak and 
 despised things of the world (such as Moses, now a poor shepherd), with 
 them to confound the wise; he delights to beautify and crown the 
 humble. 

 3. <I>The bush burned,</I> and yet <I>was not consumed,</I> an emblem 
 of the church now in bondage in Egypt, burning in the brick-kilns, yet 
 not consumed; perplexed, but not in despair; cast down, but not 
 destroyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The curiosity Moses had to enquire into this extraordinary sight:
 <I>I will turn aside and see,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He speaks as one inquisitive and bold in his enquiry; whatever it was,
 he would, if possible, know the meaning of it. Note, Things revealed
 belong to us, and we ought diligently to enquire into them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The invitation he had to draw near, yet with a caution not to come
 too near, nor rashly. </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God gave him a gracious call, to which he returned a ready answer,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When God saw that he took notice of the burning bush, and turned aside
 to see it, and left his business to attend it, then God called to him.
 If he had carelessly neglected it as an <I>ignis fatuus--a deceiving
 meteor,</I> a thing not worth taking notice of, it is probable that
 God would have departed, and said nothing to him; but, when he turned
 aside, God called to him. Note, Those that would have communion with
 God must attend upon him, and approach to him, in those ordinances
 wherein he is pleased to manifest himself, and his power and glory,
 though it be in a bush; they must come to the treasure, though in an
 earthen vessel. Those that seek God diligently shall find him, and
 find him their bountiful rewarder. <I>Draw nigh to God, and he will
 draw nigh to you.</I> God called him by name, <I>Moses, Moses.</I>
 This which he heard could not but surprise him much more than what he
 saw. The word of the Lord always went along with the glory of the
 Lord, for every divine vision was designed for divine revelation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:16-21,32:14-15">Job iv. 16, &c.; xxxii. 14-15</A>.

 Divine calls are then effectual,

 (1.) When the Spirit of God makes them particular, and calls us by
 name. The word calls, <I>Ho, every one!</I> The Spirit, by the 
 application of that, calls, <I>Ho, such a one! I know thee by name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:12">Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>.

 (2.) When we return an obedient answer to them, as Moses here, "<I>Here
 am I, what saith my Lord unto his servant? Here am I,</I> not only to 
 hear what is said, but to do what I am bidden."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God gave him a needful caution against rashness and irreverence in
 his approach, 

 (1.) He must keep his distance; draw near, but not too near; so near as
 to hear, but not so near as to pry. His conscience must be satisfied, 
 but not his curiosity; and care must be taken that familiarity do not 
 breed contempt. Note, In all our approaches to God, we ought to be 
 deeply affected with the infinite distance there is between us and God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:2">Eccl. v. 2</A>.

 Or this may be taken as proper to the Old-Testament dispensation, which
 was a dispensation of darkness, bondage, and terror, from which the 
 gospel happily frees us, giving us boldness to enter into the holiest, 
 and inviting us to draw near. 

 (2.) He must express his reverence, and his readiness to obey: <I>Put
 off thy shoes from off thy feet,</I> as a servant. Putting off the shoe 
 was then what putting off the hat is now, a token of respect and 
 submission. "The ground, for the present, is <I>holy ground,</I> made 
 so by this special manifestation of the divine presence, during the 
 continuance of which it must retain this character; therefore tread not 
 on that ground with soiled shoes." <I>Keep thy foot,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.

 Note, We ought to approach to God with a solemn pause and preparation;
 and, though bodily exercise alone profits little, yet we ought to 
 glorify God with our bodies, and to express our inward reverence by a 
 grave and reverent behaviour in the worship of God, carefully avoiding 
 everything that looks light, and rude, and unbecoming the awfulness of 
 the service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The solemn declaration God made of his name, by which he would be
 known to Moses: <I>I am the God of thy father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. He lets him know that it is God who speaks to him, to engage his
 reverence and attention, his faith and obedience; for this is enough
 to command all these: <I>I am the Lord.</I> Let us always hear the
 word <I>as the word of God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13">1 Thess. ii. 13</A>.

 2. He will be known as the God of his father, his pious father Amram,
 and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his ancestors, and the 
 ancestors of all Israel, for whom God was now about to appear. By this 
 God designed, 

 (1.) To instruct Moses in the knowledge of another world, and to
 strengthen his belief of a future state. Thus it is interpreted by our 
 Lord Jesus, the best expositor of scripture, who from this proves that 
 the dead are raised, against the Sadducees. <I>Moses,</I> says he, 
 <I>showed it at the bush</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:37">Luke xx. 37</A>),

 that is, God there showed it to him, and in him to us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:31">Matt. xxii. 31</A>, &c.

 Abraham was dead, and yet
 God is the God of Abraham; therefore Abraham's soul lives, to which
 God stands in relation; and, to make his soul completely happy, his
 body must live again in due time. This promise made unto the fathers,
 that God would be their God, must include a future happiness; for he
 never did anything for them in this world sufficient to answer to the
 vast extent and compass of that great word, but, having prepared for
 them a city, he is not ashamed to be called their God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>;

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:6,7,24:15">Acts xxvi. 6, 7; xxiv. 15</A>.

 (2.) To assure Moses of the fulfillment of all those particular
 promises made to the fathers. He may confidently expect this, for by
 these words it appears that God remembered his covenant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:24"><I>ch.</I> ii. 24</A>.

 Note, 

 [1.] God's covenant-relation to us as our God is the best support in
 the worst of times, and a great encouragement to our faith in 
 particular promises. 

 [2.] When we are conscious to ourselves of our own great unworthiness
 we may take comfort from God's relation to our fathers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:6">2 Chron. xx. 6</A>. </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The solemn impression this made upon Moses: He <I>hid his
 face,</I> as one both ashamed and afraid to look upon God. Now that he
 knew it was a divine light his eyes were dazzled with it; he was not
 afraid of a burning bush till he perceived that God was in it. Yea,
 though God called himself <I>the God of his father,</I> and a God in
 covenant with him, yet he was afraid. Note, 

 1. The more we see of God the more cause we shall see to worship him 
 with reverence and godly fear. 

 2. Even the manifestations of God's grace and covenant-love should 
 increase our humble reverence of him.</P>

 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
 people which <I>are</I> in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
 of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
 8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
 Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land
 and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the
 place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
 the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
 9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
 come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the
 Egyptians oppress them.
 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
 thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of
 Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that Moses had put off his shoes (for, no doubt, he observed the
 orders given him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and covered his face, God enters upon the particular business that was
 now to be concerted, which was the bringing of Israel out of Egypt.
 Now, after forty years of Israel's bondage and Moses's banishment,
 when we may suppose both he and they began to despair, they of being
 delivered and he of delivering them, at length, the time has come,
 even the year of the redeemed. Note, God often comes for the salvation
 of his people when they have done looking for him. <I>Shall he find
 faith?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Luke xviii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The notice God takes of the afflictions of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>):

 <I>Seeing I have seen,</I> not only, <I>I have surely seen,</I> but I
 have strictly observed and considered the matter. Three things God
 took cognizance of:--
 
 1. <I>Their sorrows,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is likely they were not permitted to make a remonstrance of their
 grievances to Pharaoh, nor to seek relief against their task-masters
 in any of his courts, nor scarcely durst complain to one another; but
 God observed their tears. Note, Even the secret sorrows of God's
 people are known to him. 

 2. Their cry: <I>I have heard their cry</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>it has come unto me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, God is not deaf to the cries of his afflicted people. 

 3. The tyranny of their persecutors: <I>I have seen the oppression,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, As the poorest of the oppressed are not below God's cognizance,
 so the highest and greatest of their oppressors are not above his
 check, but he will surely visit for these things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The promise God makes of their speedy deliverance and enlargement:
 <I>I have come down to deliver them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. It denotes his resolution to deliver them, and that his heart was
 upon it, so that it should be done speedily and effectually, and by
 methods out of the common road of providence: when God does something
 very extraordinary he is said to <I>come down</I> to do it, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1">Isa. lxiv. 1</A>.

 2. This deliverance was typical of our redemption by Christ, in which
 the eternal Word did indeed come down from heaven to deliver us: it was 
 his errand into the world. He promises also their happy settlement in 
 the land of Canaan, that they should exchange bondage for liberty, 
 poverty for plenty, labour for rest, and the precarious condition of 
 tenants at will for the ease and honour of lords proprietors. Note, 
 Whom God by his grace delivers out of a spiritual Egypt he will bring 
 to a heavenly Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The commission he gives to Moses in order hereunto,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He is not only sent as a prophet to Israel, to assure them that they
 should speedily be delivered (even that would have been a great
 favour), but he is sent as an ambassador to Pharaoh, to treat with
 him, or rather as a herald at arms, to demand their discharge, and to
 denounce war in case of refusal; and he is sent as a prince to Israel,
 to conduct and command them. Thus is he taken from <I>following the
 ewes great with young,</I> to a pastoral office much more noble, as
 David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:71">Ps. lxxviii. 71</A>.

 Note, God is the fountain of power, and the powers that be are ordained
 of him as he pleases. The same hand that now fetched a shepherd out of 
 a desert, to be the planter of a Jewish church, afterwards fetched 
 fishermen from their ships, to be the planters of the Christian church, 
 <I>That the excellency of the power might be of God.</I></P>

 11 And Moses said unto God, Who <I>am</I> I, that I should go unto
 Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out
 of Egypt?
 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this <I>shall
 be</I> a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
 brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
 this mountain.
 13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, <I>when</I> I come unto the
 children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your
 fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What
 <I>is</I> his name? what shall I say unto them?
 14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
 shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
 unto you.
 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto
 the children of Israel, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your fathers, the God of
 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
 unto you: this <I>is</I> my name for ever, and this <I>is</I> my memorial
 unto all generations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having spoken to Moses, allows him also a liberty of speech,
 which he here improves; and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He objects his own insufficiency for the service he was called to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Who am I?</I> He thinks himself unworthy of the honour, and not
 <I>par negotio--equal to the task.</I> He thinks he wants courage, and
 therefore cannot go to Pharaoh, to make a demand which might cost the
 demandant his head: he thinks he wants skill, and therefore cannot
 bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt; they are unarmed,
 undisciplined, quite dispirited, utterly unable to help themselves; it
 is morally impossible to bring them out. 

 1. Moses was incomparably the fittest of any man living for this work, 
 eminent for learning, wisdom, experience, valour, faith, holiness; and 
 yet he says, <I>Who am I?</I> Note, The more fit any person is for 
 service commonly the less opinion he has of himself: see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:8">Judg. ix. 8</A>, &c.

 2. The difficulties of the work were indeed very great, enough to
 startle the courage and stagger the faith of Moses himself. Note, Even 
 wise and faithful instruments may be much discouraged at the 
 difficulties that lie in the way of the church's salvation. 

 3. Moses had formerly been very courageous when he slew the Egyptian, 
 but now his heart failed him; for good men are not always alike bold 
 and zealous. 

 4. Yet Moses is the man that does it at last; for God gives grace to 
 the lowly. Modest beginnings are very good presages.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God answers this objection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. He promises him his presence: <I>Certainly I will be with thee,</I>
 and that is enough. Note, Those that are weak in themselves may yet
 do wonders, being strong in the Lord and in the power of his might;
 and those that are most diffident of themselves may be most confident
 in God. God's presence puts an honour upon the worthless, wisdom and
 strength into the weak and foolish, makes the greatest difficulties
 dwindle to nothing, and is enough to answer all objections. 

 2. He assures him of success, and that the Israelites should serve God 
 upon this mountain. Note,

 (1.) Those deliverances are most valuable which open to us a door of
 liberty to serve God. 

 (2.) If God gives us opportunity and a heart to serve him, it is a
 happy and encouraging earnest of further favours designed us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He begs instructions for the executing of his commission, and has
 them, thoroughly to furnish him. He desires to know by what name God
 would at this time make himself known,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He supposes the children of Israel would ask him, <I>What is his
 name?</I> This they would ask either, 

 (1.) To perplex Moses: he foresaw difficulty, not only in dealing with
 Pharaoh, to make him willing to part with them, but in dealing with 
 them, to make them willing to remove. They would be scrupulous and apt 
 to cavil, would bid him produce his commission, and probably this would 
 be the trial: "Does he know the name of God? Has he the watch-word?" 
 Once he was asked, <I>Who made thee a judge?</I> Then he had not his 
 answer ready, and he would not be nonplussed so again, but would be 
 able to tell in whose name he came. Or, 

 (2.) For their own information.  It is to be feared that they had grown
 very ignorant in Egypt, by reason of their hard bondage, want of 
 teachers, and loss of the sabbath, so that they needed to be told the 
 first principles of the oracles of God. Or this question, <I>What is 
 his name?</I> amounted to an enquiry into the nature of the 
 dispensation they were now to expect: "How will God in it be known to 
 us, and what may we depend upon from him?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He desires instructions what answer to give them: "<I>What shall I
 say to them?</I> What name shall I vouch to them for the proof of my
 authority? I must have something great and extraordinary to say to
 them; what must it be? If I must go, let me have full instructions,
 that I may not run in vain." Note, 

 (1.) It highly concerns those who speak to people in the name of God to
 be well prepared beforehand.  

 (2.) Those who would know what to say must go to God, to the word of
 his grace and to the throne of his grace, for instructions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:7,3:4,10,17">Ezek. ii. 7; iii. 4, 10, 17</A>.

 (3.) Whenever we have any thing to do with God, it is
 desirable to know, and our duty to consider, what is his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God readily gives him full instructions in this matter. Two names
 God would now be known by:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A name that denotes what he is in himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I am that I am.</I> This explains his name <I>Jehovah,</I> and
 signifies, 

 (1.) That he is self-existent; he has his being of himself, and has no
 dependence upon any other: the greatest and best man in the world must 
 say, By the grace of God <I>I am what I am;</I> but God says 
 absolutely--and it is more than any creature, man or angel, can 
 say--<I>I am that I am.</I> Being self-existent, he cannot but be 
 self-sufficient, and therefore all-sufficient, and the inexhaustible 
 fountain of being and bliss. 

 (2.) That he is eternal and unchangeable, and always the same,
 yesterday, to-day, and for ever; he will be what he will be and what he 
 is; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8">Rev. i. 8</A>.

 (3.) That we cannot by searching find him out. This is such a name as
 checks all bold and curious enquiries concerning God, and in effect 
 says, <I>Ask not after my name, seeing it is secret,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18,Pr+30:4">Judg. xiii. 18; Prov. xxx. 4</A>.

 Do we ask what is God? Let it suffice us to know that he is what he is,
 what he ever was, and ever will be. <I>How little a portion is heard of 
 him!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:14">Job xxvi. 14</A>.

 (4.) That he is faithful and true to all his promises, unchangeable in
 his word as well as in his nature, and not a man that he should lie. 
 Let Israel know this, <I>I AM hath sent me unto you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A name that denotes what he is to his people. Lest that name <I>I
 AM</I> should amuse and puzzle them, he is further directed to make
 use of another name of God more familiar and intelligible: <I>The Lord
 God of your fathers hath sent me unto you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 Thus God had made himself known to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and thus he must make him known to them, 

 (1.) That he might revive among them the religion of their fathers,
 which, it is to be feared, was much decayed and almost lost. This was 
 necessary to prepare them for deliverance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19">Ps. lxxx. 19</A>.

 (2.) That he might raise their expectations of the speedy performance
 of the promises made unto their fathers. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are 
 particularly named, because with Abraham the covenant was first made, 
 and with Isaac and Jacob often expressly renewed; and these three were 
 distinguished from their brethren, and chosen to be the trustees of the 
 covenant, when their brethren were rejected. God will have this to be 
 his name for ever, and it has been, is, and will be, his name, by which 
 his worshippers know him, and distinguish him from all false gods; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:36">1 Kings xviii. 36</A>.

 Note, God's covenant-relation to his people is what he will be ever
 mindful of, what he glories in, and what he will have us never forget, 
 but give him the glory of: if he will have this to be his memorial unto 
 all generations, we have all the reason in the world to make it so with 
 us, for it is a precious memorial.</P>

 16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
 them, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
 and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited
 you, and <I>seen</I> that which is done to you in Egypt:
 17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction
 of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
 the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come,
 thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye
 shall say unto him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
 and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the
 wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go,
 no, not by a mighty hand.
 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
 wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he
 will let you go.
 21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
 Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall
 not go empty:
 22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her
 that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of
 gold, and raiment: and ye shall put <I>them</I> upon your sons, and
 upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses is here more particularly instructed in his work, and informed
 beforehand of his success.

 1. He must deal with the elders of Israel, and raise their expectation 
 of a speedy removal to Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 He must repeat to them what God had said to him, as a faithful
 ambassador. Note, That which ministers have received of the Lord they
 must deliver to his people, and keep back nothing that is profitable.
 Lay an emphasis on that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>:

 "<I>I have said, I will bring you up;</I> that is enough to satisfy
 them, <I>I have said it:</I>" hath he spoken, and will he not make it
 good? With us saying and doing are two things, but they are not so
 with God, for he is in one mind and who can turn him? "I have said it,
 and all the world cannot gainsay it. My counsel shall stand." His
 success with the elders of Israel would be good; so he is told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They shall hearken to thy voice,</I> and not thrust thee away as
 they did forty years ago. He who, by his grace, inclines the heart,
 and opens the ear, could say beforehand, <I>They shall hearken to thy
 voice,</I> having determined to make them willing in this day of
 power. 
 
 2. He must deal with the king of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 he and the elders of Israel, and in this they must not begin with a
 demand, but with a humble petition; that gentle and submissive method
 must be first tried, even with one who, it was certain, would not be
 wrought upon by it: <I>We beseech thee, let us go.</I> Moreover, they
 must only beg leave of Pharaoh to go as far as Mount Sinai to worship
 God, and say nothing to him of going quite away to Canaan; the latter
 would have been immediately rejected, but the former was a very modest
 and reasonable request, and his denying it was utterly inexcusable and
 justified them in the total deserting of his kingdom. If he would not
 give them leave to go and sacrifice at Sinai, justly did they go
 without leave to settle in Canaan. Note, The calls and commands which
 God sends to sinners are so highly reasonable in themselves, and
 delivered to them in such a gentle winning way, that the mouth of the
 disobedient must needs be for ever stopped. As to his success with
 Pharaoh, Moses is here told, 

 (1.) That petitions, and persuasions, and humble remonstrances, would
 not prevail with him, no, nor a mighty hand stretched out in signs and 
 wonders: <I>I am sure he will not let you go,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, God sends his messengers to those whose hardness and obstinacy
 he certainly knows and foresees, that it may appear he would have them
 turn and live. 

 (2.) That plagues should compel him to it: <I>I will smite Egypt,</I>
 and then he will <I>let you go,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Note, Those will certainly be broken by the power of God's hand that
 will not bow to the power of his word; we may be sure that <I>when God
 judges he will overcome.</I> 

 (3.) That his people should be more kind to them, and furnish them at
 their departure with abundance of plate and jewels, to their great 
 enriching: <I>I will give this people favour in the sight of the 
 Egyptians,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Note, 

 [1.] God sometimes makes the enemies of his people, not only to be at
 peace with them, but to be kind to them. 

 [2.] God has many ways of balancing accounts between the injured and
 the injurious, of righting the oppressed, and compelling those that 
 have done wrong to make restitution; for he sits in the throne judging 
 right.</P>
