 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter gives us an account of God's providences concerning 
 Jacob, pursuant to the promises made to him in the foregoing 
 chapter. 
 
 I. How he was brought in safety to his journey's end, 
 and directed to his relations there, who bade him welcome,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.
 
 II. How he was comfortably disposed of in marriage,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:15-30">ver. 15-30</A>.
 
 III. How his family was built up in the birth of 
 four sons,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>.
 The affairs of princes and mighty nations
 that were then in being are not recorded in the book of God, but
 are left to be buried in oblivion; while these small domestic concerns
 of holy Jacob are particularly recorded with their minute
 circumstances, that they may be in everlasting remembrance.
 For "the memory of the just is blessed."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Jacob went on his journey, 
 and came into the land of the people of the 
 east.
 &nbsp; 2 And he looked, 
 and behold a well in the field, and, lo, 
 there <I>were</I> three flocks of sheep lying 
 by it; for out of that well they watered 
 the flocks: and a great stone 
 <I>was</I> upon the well's mouth.
 &nbsp; 3 And 
 thither were all the flocks gathered: 
 and they rolled the stone from the 
 well's mouth, and watered the sheep, 
 and put the stone again upon the well's 
 mouth in his place.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jacob 
 said unto them, My brethren, whence 
 <I>be</I> ye? And they said, Of Haran <I>are</I> 
 we.
 &nbsp; 5 And he said unto them, Know 
 ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
 they said, We know <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 6 And he 
 said unto them, <I>Is</I> he well? And they 
 said, <I>He is</I> well: and, behold, Rachel 
 his daughter cometh with the sheep.
 &nbsp; 7 And he said, Lo, <I>it is</I> yet high day, 
 neither <I>is it</I> time that the cattle should 
 be gathered together: water ye 
 the sheep, and go <I>and</I> feed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 And they said, We cannot, until all the 
 flocks be gathered together, and <I>till</I> 
 they roll the stone from the well's 
 mouth; then we water the sheep.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All the stages Israel's march to Canaan 
 are distinctly noticed, but no particular 
 journal is kept of Jacob's expedition further 
 than Beth-el; no, he had no more such happy 
 nights as he had at Beth-el, no more such 
 visions of the Almighty. That was intended 
 for a feast; he must not expect it to be his 
 daily bread. But, 
 
 1. We are here told how 
 cheerfully he proceeded in his journey after 
 the sweet communion he had with God at Beth-el: 
 <I>Then Jacob lifted up his feet;</I> so 
 the margin reads it,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 Then he went on 
 with cheerfulness and alacrity, not burdened 
 with his cares, nor cramped with his fears, 
 being assured of God's gracious presence 
 with him. Note, After the visions we have 
 had of God, and the vows we have made to 
 him in solemn ordinances, we should run 
 the way of his commandments with enlarged 
 hearts, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb. xii. 1</A>.

 2. How happily he arrived 
 at his journey's end. Providence 
 brought him to the very field where his 
 uncle's flocks were to be watered, and there 
 he met with Rachel, who was to be his wife. 
 Observe, 
 
 (1.) The divine Providence is to be 
 acknowledged in all the little circumstances 
 which concur to make a journey, or other 
 undertaking, comfortable and successful. If, 
 when we are at a loss, we meet seasonably 
 with those that can direct us--if we meet 
 with a disaster, and those are at hand that 
 will help us--we must not say that it was by 
 chance, nor that fortune therein favoured us, 
 but that it was by Providence, and that God 
 therein favoured us. Our ways are ways of 

 <A NAME="Page175"> </A>

 pleasantness, if we continually acknowledge 
 God in them. 
 
 (2.) Those that have flocks 
 must look well to them, and be diligent to 
 know their state, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:23">Prov. xxvii. 23</A>.
 What is 
 here said of the constant care of the shepherds 
 concerning their sheep
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:2,3,7,8"><I>v.</I> 2, 3, 7, 8</A>)
 may 
 serve to illustrate the tender concern which 
 our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the 
 sheep, has for his flock, the church; for he 
 is the good Shepherd, that knows his sheep, 
 and is known of them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:14">John x. 14</A>.
 The stone at the well's mouth, which is so often 
 mentioned here, was either to secure their 
 property in it (for water was scarce, it was 
 not there <I>usus communis aquarum--for every 
 one's use</I>), or it was to save the well from 
 receiving damage from the heat of the sun, 
 or from any spiteful hand, or to prevent the 
 lambs of the flock from being drowned in it. 
 
 (3.) Separate interests should not take us 
 from joint and mutual help; when all the 
 shepherds came together with their flocks, 
 then, like loving neighbours, at watering-time, 
 they watered their flocks together. 
 
 (4.) It becomes us to speak civilly and respectfully 
 to strangers. Though Jacob was no courtier, 
 but a plain man, dwelling in tents, and a 
 stranger to compliment, yet he addresses 
 himself very obligingly to the people he met 
 with, and calls them his <I>brethren,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 The law of kindness in the tongue has a commanding 
 power, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:26">Prov. xxxi. 26</A>.
 Some think 
 he calls them brethren because they were of 
 the same trade, shepherds like him. Though 
 he was now upon his preferment, he was not 
 ashamed of his occupation. 
 
 (5.) Those that 
 show respect have usually respect shown to 
 them. As Jacob was civil to these strangers, 
 so he found them civil to him. When he 
 undertook to teach them how to despatch 
 their business
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 they did not bid him 
 meddle with his own concerns and let them 
 alone; but, though he was a stranger, they 
 gave him the reason of their delay,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 Those that are neighbourly and friendly shall 
 have neighbourly and friendly usage.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And while he yet spake with them, 
 Rachel came with her father's sheep: 
 for she kept them.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came 
 to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the 
 daughter of Laban his mother's brother, 
 and the sheep of Laban his mother's
 brother, that Jacob went near, 
 and rolled the stone from the well's 
 mouth, and watered the flock of Laban 
 his mother's brother.
 &nbsp; 11 And 
 Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his 
 voice, and wept.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jacob told 
 Rachel that he <I>was</I> her father's brother,
 and that he <I>was</I> Rebekah's son: 
 and she ran and told her father.
 &nbsp; 13 And it came to pass, when Laban 
 heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's 
 son, that he ran to meet him, and 
 embraced him, and kissed him, and 
 brought him to his house. And he 
 told Laban all these things.
 &nbsp; 14 And 
 Laban said to him, Surely thou <I>art</I> 
 my bone and my flesh. And he abode 
 with him the space of a month.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see, 
 
 1. Rachel's humility and industry: 
 <I>She kept her father's sheep</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 that is, she took the care of them, having 
 servants under her that were employed about 
 them. Rachel's name signifies <I>a sheep.</I> Note, 
 Honest useful labour is that which nobody 
 needs be ashamed of, nor ought it to be a 
 hindrance to any one's preferment. 
 
 2. Jacob's 
 tenderness and affection. When he understood 
 that this was his kinswoman (probably 
 he had heard of her name before), knowing 
 what his errand was into that country, we 
 may suppose it struck his mind immediately 
 that this must be his wife. Being already
 smitten with her ingenuous comely face 
 (though it was probably sun-burnt, and she 
 was in the homely dress of a shepherdess), he 
 is wonderfully officious, and anxious to serve 
 her
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 and addresses himself to her with 
 tears of joy and kisses of love,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 She runs 
 with all haste to tell her father; for she will 
 by no means entertain her kinsman's address 
 without her father's knowledge and approbation, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 These mutual respects, at 
 their first interview, were good presages of 
 their being a happy couple. 
 
 3. Providence 
 made that which seemed contingent and fortuitous
 to give speedy satisfaction to Jacob's 
 mind, as soon as ever he came to the place
 which he was bound for. Abraham's servant, 
 when he came upon a similar errand, met 
 with similar encouragement. Thus God guides 
 his people with his eye, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps. xxxii. 8</A>.
 It is a 
 groundless conceit which some of the Jewish 
 writers have, that Jacob, when he kissed 
 Rachel, wept because he had been set upon 
 in his journey by Eliphaz the eldest son of 
 Esau, at the command of his father, and 
 robbed of all his money and jewels, which 
 his mother had given him when she sent him 
 away. It was plain that it was his passion
 for Rachel, and the surprise of this happy 
 meeting, that drew these tears from his eyes. 
 
 4. Laban, though none of the best-humoured 
 men, bade him welcome, was satisfied in the 
 account he gave of himself, and of the reason 
 of his coming in such poor circumstances. 
 While we avoid the extreme, on the one 
 hand, of being foolishly credulous, we must 
 take heed of falling into the other extreme, 
 of being uncharitably jealous and suspicious. 
 Laban owned him for his kinsman: <I>Thou art 
 my bone and my flesh,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:14">v. 14</A>.
 Note, Those 
 are hard-hearted indeed that are unkind 
 to their relations, and that <I>hide themselves 
 from their own flesh,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Laban said unto Jacob, 
 
 <A NAME="Page176"> </A>

 Because thou <I>art</I> my brother, shouldest 
 thou therefore serve me for nought? 
 tell me, what <I>shall</I> thy wages <I>be?</I>
 &nbsp; 16 And Laban had two daughters: the 
 name of the elder <I>was</I> Leah, and the 
 name of the younger <I>was</I> Rachel.
 &nbsp; 17 Leah <I>was</I> tender eyed; but Rachel 
 was beautiful and well favoured.
 &nbsp; 18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I 
 will serve thee seven years for Rachel 
 thy younger daughter.
 &nbsp; 19 And 
 Laban said, <I>It is</I> better that I give her 
 to thee, than that I should give her 
 to another man: abide with me.
 &nbsp; 20 And Jacob served seven years for 
 Rachel; and they seemed unto him 
 <I>but</I> a few days, for the love he had to 
 her.
 &nbsp; 21 And Jacob said unto Laban, 
 Give <I>me</I> my wife, for my days are 
 fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
 &nbsp; 22 And Laban gathered together all 
 the men of the place, and made a 
 feast.
 &nbsp; 23 And it came to pass in the 
 evening, that he took Leah his daughter, 
 and brought her to him; and he 
 went in unto her.
 &nbsp; 24 And Laban 
 gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah 
 his maid <I>for</I> a handmaid.
 &nbsp; 25 And 
 it came to pass, that in the morning, 
 behold, it <I>was</I> Leah: and he said to 
 Laban, What <I>is</I> this thou hast done 
 unto me? did not I serve with thee 
 for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou 
 beguiled me?
 &nbsp; 26 And Laban said, 
 It must not be so done in our country, 
 to give the younger before the 
 firstborn.
 &nbsp; 27 Fulfil her week, and we 
 will give thee this also for the service 
 which thou shalt serve with me yet 
 seven other years.
 &nbsp; 28 And Jacob did 
 so, and fulfilled her week: and he 
 gave him Rachel his daughter to wife 
 also.
 &nbsp; 29 And Laban gave to Rachel 
 his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
 be her maid.
 &nbsp; 30 And he went in 
 also unto Rachel, and he loved also 
 Rachel more than Leah, and served 
 with him yet seven other years.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The fair contract made between 
 Laban and Jacob, during the month that 
 Jacob spent there as a guest,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 It seems 
 he was not idle, nor did he spend his time in 
 sport and pastime; but like a man of business, 
 though he had no stock of his own, he 
 applied himself to serve his uncle, as he 
 had begun
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)
 when he <I>watered his flock.</I>
 Note, Wherever we are, it is good to be
 employing ourselves in some useful business, 
 which will turn to a good account to ourselves 
 or others. Laban, it seems, was so 
 taken with Jacob's ingenuity and industry 
 about his flocks that he was desirous he 
 should continue with him, and very fairly 
 reasons thus: "<I>Because thou art my brother, 
 shouldst thou therefore serve me for nought?</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 No, what reason for that?" If Jacob 
 be so respectful to his uncle as to give him 
 his service without demanding any consideration 
 for it, yet Laban will not be so unjust 
 to his nephew as to take advantage either of 
 his necessity or of his good-nature. Note, 
 Inferior relations must not be imposed upon; 
 if it be their duty to serve us, it is our duty 
 to reward them. Now Jacob had a fair 
 opportunity to make known to Laban the 
 affection he had for his daughter Rachel; 
 and, having no worldly goods in his hand 
 with which to endow her, he promises him 
 seven years' service, upon condition that, at 
 the end of the seven years, he would bestow 
 her upon him for his wife. It appears by 
 computation that Jacob was now seventy-seven 
 years old when he bound himself 
 apprentice for a wife, <I>and for a wife he kept 
 sheep,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:12">Hos. xii. 12</A>.
 His posterity are there 
 reminded of it long afterwards, as an instance 
 of the meanness of their origin: probably 
 Rachel was young, and scarcely marriageable, 
 when Jacob first came, which made him 
 the more willing to stay for her till his seven 
 years' service had expired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jacob's honest performance of his part 
 of the bargain,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 He served seven years 
 for Rachel. If Rachel still continued to keep 
 her father's sheep (as she did,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 his innocent 
 and religious conversation with her, 
 while they kept the flocks, could not but 
 increase their mutual acquaintance and affection 
 (Solomon's song of love is a pastoral); if 
 she now left it off, his easing her of that care 
 was very obliging. Jacob honestly served 
 out his seven years, and did not forfeit his 
 indentures, though he was old; nay, he 
 served them cheerfully: <I>They seemed to him 
 but a few days, for the love he had to her,</I> as 
 if it were more his desire to earn her than to 
 have her. Note, Love makes long and hard 
 services short and easy; hence we read of 
 <I>the labour of love,</I> 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.
 If we know 
 how to value the happiness of heaven, the 
 sufferings of this present time will be as 
 nothing to us in comparison of it. An age 
 of work will be but as a few days to those 
 that love God and long for Christ's appearing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The base cheat which Laban put upon 
 him when he was out of his time: he put 
 Leah into his arms instead of Rachel,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 This was Laban's sin; he wronged both 
 Jacob and Rachel, whose affections, doubtless, 
 were engaged to each other, and, if (as some 
 say) Leah was herein no better than an adulteress, 
 it was no small wrong to her too. 
 But it was Jacob's affliction, a damp to the 
 
 <A NAME="Page177"> </A>

 mirth of the marriage-feast, when in the 
 morning behold it was Leah,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 It is 
 easy to observe here how Jacob was paid in 
 his own coin. He had cheated his own 
 father when he pretended to be Esau, and 
 now his father-in-law cheated him. Herein, 
 how unrighteous soever Laban was, the Lord 
 was righteous; as 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:7">Judges i. 7</A>.
 Even the 
 righteous, if they take a false step, are sometimes 
 thus recompensed on the earth. Many 
 that are not, like Jacob, disappointed in the 
 person, soon find themselves, as much to 
 their grief, disappointed in the character. 
 The choice of that relation therefore, on both 
 sides, ought to be made with good advice and 
 consideration, that, if there should be a disappointment, 
 it may not be aggravated by a 
 consciousness of mismanagement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The excuse and atonement Laban made 
 for the cheat. 
 
 1. The excuse was frivolous: 
 <I>It must not be so done in our country,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 We have reason to think there was no such 
 custom of his country as he pretends; only 
 he banters Jacob with it, and laughs at 
 his mistake. Note, Those that can do wickedly 
 and then think to turn it off with a jest, 
 though they may deceive themselves and 
 others, will find at last that God is not 
 mocked. But if there had been such a custom, 
 and he had resolved to observe it, he 
 should have told Jacob so when he undertook 
 to serve him for his younger daughter. Note, 
 As saith the proverb of the ancients, <I>Wickedness 
 proceeds from the wicked,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>.
 Those that deal with treacherous men must 
 expect to be dealt treacherously with. 
 
 2. His 
 compounding the matter did but make bad 
 worse: <I>We will give thee this also,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 Hereby he drew Jacob into the sin, and 
 snare, and disquiet, of multiplying wives, 
 which remains a blot in his escutcheon, and 
 will be so to the end of the world. Honest 
 Jacob did not design it, but to have kept as 
 true to Rachel as his father had done to Rebekah. 
 He that had lived without a wife to the 
 eighty-fourth year of his age could then have 
 been very well content with one; but Laban, to
 dispose of his two daughters without portions, 
 and to get seven years' service more out of 
 Jacob, thus imposes upon him, and draws 
 him into such a strait by his fraud, that 
 (the matter not being yet settled, as it was 
 afterwards by the divine law, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:18">Lev. xviii. 18</A>,
 and more fully since by our Saviour,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:5">Matt. xix. 5</A>)
 he had some colourable reasons for 
 marrying them both. He could not refuse 
 Rachel, for he had espoused her; still less 
 could he refuse Leah, for he had married her; 
 and therefore Jacob must <I>be content, and take 
 two talents,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:23">2 Kings v. 23</A>.
 Note, One sin 
 is commonly the inlet of another. Those that 
 go in by one door of wickedness seldom find 
 their way out but by another. The polygamy 
 of the patriarchs was, in some measure, excusable 
 in them, because, though there was a 
 reason against it as ancient as Adam's marriage 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>),
 yet there was no express 
 command against it; it was in them a sin of 
 ignorance. It was not the product of any 
 sinful lust, but for the building up of the 
 church, which was the good that Providence 
 brought out of it; but it will by no means 
 justify the like practice now, when God's will 
 is plainly made known, that one man and 
 one woman only must be joined together,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:2">1 Cor. vii. 2</A>.
 The having of many wives 
 suits well enough with the carnal sensual 
 spirit of the Mahomedan imposture, which 
 allows it; but we have not so learned Christ. 
 Dr. Lightfoot makes Leah and Rachel to be 
 figures of the two churches, the Jews under 
 the law and the Gentiles under the gospel: 
 the younger the more beautiful, and more in the 
 thoughts of Christ when he came in the 
 form of a servant; but he other, like Leah, 
 first embraced: yet in this the allegory does 
 not hold, that the Gentiles, the younger, were 
 more fruitful,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the birth of four of Jacob's 
 sons, all by Leah. Observe, 
 
 1. That Leah, 
 who was less beloved, was blessed with children, 
 when Rachel was denied that blessing,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 See how Providence, in dispensing 
 its gifts, observes a proportion, to keep the 
 balance even, setting crosses and comforts 
 one over-against another, that none may be 
 either too much elevated or too much depressed. 
 Rachel wants children, but she is 
 blessed with her husband's love; Leah wants 
 that, but she is fruitful. Thus it was between 
 Elkana's two wives
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:5">1 Sam. i. 5</A>);
 for the 
 Lord is wise and righteous. <I>When the Lord 
 saw that Leah was hated,</I> that is, loved less 
 than Rachel, in which sense it is required 
 that we hate father and mother, in comparison 
 with Christ
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>),
 then the 
 Lord granted her a child, which was a rebuke 
 
 <A NAME="Page178"> </A>

 to Jacob, for making so great a difference 
 between those that he was equally related to,--a 
 check to Rachel, who perhaps insulted over 
 her sister upon that account,--and a comfort 
 to Leah, that she might not be overwhelmed 
 with the contempt put upon her: thus <I>God 
 giveth abundant honour to that which lacked,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:24">1 Cor. xii. 24</A>.

 2. The names she gave her 
 children were expressive of her respectful 
 regards both to God and to her husband. 
 
 (1.) She appears very ambitious of her husband's 
 love: she reckoned the want of it her affliction
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);
 not upbraiding him with it as his 
 fault, nor reproaching him for it, and so 
 making herself uneasy to him, but laying it 
 to heart as her grief, which yet she had reason 
 to bear with the more patience because she 
 herself was consenting to the fraud by which 
 she became his wife; and we may well bear that 
 trouble with patience which we bring upon 
 ourselves by our own sin and folly. She 
 promised herself that the children she bore 
 him would gain her the interest she desired 
 in his affections. She called her first-born 
 <I>Reuben</I> (<I>see a son</I>), with this pleasant thought, 
 <I>Now will my husband love me;</I> and her third 
 son <I>Levi</I> (<I>joined</I>), with this expectation, <I>Now 
 will my husband be joined unto me,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 Mutual affection is both the duty and comfort 
 of that relation; and yoke-fellows should 
 study to recommend themselves to each other,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:33,34">1 Cor. vii. 33, 34</A>.

 (2.) She thankfully 
 acknowledges the kind providence of God in 
 it: <I>The Lord hath looked upon my affliction,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 "<I>The Lord hath heard,</I> that is, taken 
 notice of it, <I>that I was hated</I> (for our afflictions, 
 as they are before God's eyes, so they 
 have a cry in his ears), <I>he has therefore given 
 me this son.</I>" Note, Whatever we have that 
 contributes either to our support and comfort 
 under our afflictions or to our deliverance from 
 them, God must be owned in it, especially his 
 pity and tender mercy. Her fourth she called 
 <I>Judah</I> (<I>praise</I>), saying, <I>Now will I praise the 
 Lord,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 And this was he of whom, as 
 concerning the flesh, Christ came. Note, 
 
 [1.] Whatever is the matter of our rejoicing 
 ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. 
 Fresh favours should quicken us to praise
 God for former favours. <I>Now will I praise 
 the Lord</I> more and better than I have done. 
 
 [2.] All our praises must centre in Christ, 
 both as the matter of them and as the Mediator 
 of them. He descended from him whose 
 name was praise, for he is our praise. Is 
 Christ formed in my heart? <I>Now will I praise 
 the Lord.</I></P>
