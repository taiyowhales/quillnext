 Moses here receives instructions, 

 I. Concerning the inner curtains of the tent or tabernacle, and the
 coupling of those curtains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.
 
 II. Concerning the outer curtains which were of goats' hair, to
 strengthen the former, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 III.  Concerning the case or cover which was to secure it from the
 weather, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:14">ver. 14</A>.

 IV. Concerning the boards which were to be reared up to support the
 curtains, with their bars and sockets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:15-30">ver. 15-30</A>.

 V.  The partition between the holy place and the most holy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>.
 
 VI. The veil for the door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:36,37">ver. 36, 37</A>.

 These particulars, thus largely recorded, seem of little use to us now;
 yet, having been of great use to Moses and Israel, and God having 
 thought fit to preserve down to us the remembrance of them, we ought 
 not to overlook them. Even the antiquity renders this account 
 venerable.</P>

 1 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle <I>with</I> ten curtains
 <I>of</I> fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: <I>with</I>
 cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.
 2 The length of one curtain <I>shall be</I> eight and twenty cubits,
 and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the
 curtains shall have one measure.
 3 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
 and <I>other</I> five curtains <I>shall be</I> coupled one to another.
 4 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
 curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
 thou make in the uttermost edge of <I>another</I> curtain, in the
 coupling of the second.
 5 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
 loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that <I>is</I> in the
 coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of
 another.
 6 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
 curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
 tabernacle.

 I. The house must be a <I>tabernacle</I> or <I>tent,</I> such as 
 soldiers now use in the camp, which was both a mean dwelling and a 
 movable one; and yet the ark of God had not better, till Solomon built 
 the temple 480 years after this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:1">1 Kings vi. 1</A>.

 God manifested his presence among them thus in a tabernacle, 

 1. In compliance with their present condition in the wilderness, that 
 they might have him with them wherever they went. Note, God suits the 
 tokens of his favour, and the gifts of his grace, to his people's wants 
 and necessities, according as they are, accommodating his mercy to 
 their state, prosperous or adverse, settled or unsettled. <I>When thou 
 passest through the waters, I will be with thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2">Isa. xliii. 2</A>.

 2. That it might represent the state of God's church in this world, it
 is a <I>tabernacle-state,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:1">Ps. xv. 1</A>.

 <I>We have here no continuing city;</I> being strangers in this world,
 and travellers towards a better, we shall never be fixed till we come 
 to heaven.  Church-privileges are movable goods, from one place to 
 another; the gospel is not tied to any place; the candlestick is in a 
 tent, and may easily be taken away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:5">Rev. ii. 5</A>.

 If we make much of the tabernacle, and improve the privilege of it,
 wherever we go it will accompany us; but, if we neglect and disgrace 
 it, wherever we stay it will forsake us.  <I>What hath my beloved to do 
 in my house?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:15">Jer. xi. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The curtains of the tabernacle must correspond to a divine pattern. 
 
 1. They were to be very rich, the best of the kind, <I>fine twined 
 linen;</I> and colours very pleasing, <I>blue,</I> and <I>purple,</I> 
 and <I>scarlet.</I> 
 
 2. They were to be embroidered with cherubim
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 to intimate that the angels of God pitch their tents round about
 the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7">Ps. xxxiv. 7</A>.

 As there were cherubim over the mercy-seat, so there were round the
 tabernacle; for we find the angels compassing, not only the throne, but 
 the elders; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:11">Rev. v. 11</A>.

 3. There were to be two hangings, five breadths in each, sewed
 together, and the two hangings coupled together with golden clasps, or 
 tacks, so that it might be all one tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:6">v. 6</A>.

 Thus the churches of Christ and the saints, though they are many, are
 yet one, being <I>fitly joined together</I> in holy love, and by the 
 <I>unity of the Spirit,</I> so growing into one <I>holy temple</I> in 
 <I>the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21,22,4:16">Eph. ii. 21, 22; iv. 16</A>.

 This tabernacle was very strait and narrow; but, at the preaching of
 the gospel, the church is bidden to <I>enlarge the place of her 
 tent,</I> and to <I>stretch forth her curtains,</I>

 7 And thou shalt make curtains <I>of</I> goats' <I>hair</I> to be a
 covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.
 8 The length of one curtain <I>shall be</I> thirty cubits, and the
 breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
 <I>shall be all</I> of one measure.
 9 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
 curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the
 forefront of the tabernacle.
 10 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one
 curtain <I>that is</I> outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the
 edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
 11 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the
 taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may
 be one.
 12 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
 the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of
 the tabernacle.
 13 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side
 of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
 tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side
 and on that side, to cover it.
 14 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent <I>of</I> rams' skins
 dyed red, and a covering above <I>of</I> badgers' skins.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses is here ordered to make a double covering for the tabernacle, 
 that it might not rain in, and that the beauty of those fine curtains 
 might not be damaged. 

 1. There was to be a covering of hair camlet curtains, which were 
 somewhat larger every way than the inner curtains, because they were to 
 enclose them, and probably were stretched out at some little distance 
 from them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:7">v. 7</A>,

 &c. These were coupled together with brass clasps. The stuff being less
 valuable, the tacks were so; but the brass tacks would answer the 
 intention as effectually as the golden ones. The bonds of unity may be 
 as strong between curtains of goats' hair as between those of purple 
 and scarlet. 

 2. Over this there was to be another covering, and that a double one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 one of <I>rams' skins dyed red,</I> probably dressed with the wool on; 
 another of <I>badgers' skins,</I> so we translate it, but it should 
 rather seem to have been some strong sort of leather (but very fine), 
 for we read of the best sort of shoes being made of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:10">Ezek. xvi. 10</A>.

 Now observe here, 

 (1.) That the outside of the tabernacle was coarse and rough, the
 beauty of it was in the inner curtains. Those in whom God dwells must 
 labour to be better than they seem to be. Hypocrites put the best side 
 outwards, like <I>whited sepulchres;</I> but <I>the king's daughter is 
 all glorious within</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:13">Ps. xlv. 13</A>);

 in the eye of the world black as the tents of Kedar, but, in the eye of
 God, comely as the curtains of Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5">Cant. i. 5</A>.

 Let our adorning be that of the hidden man of the heart, which God
 values,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 (2.) That where God places his glory he will create a defence upon it;
 even upon the habitations of the righteous there shall be a covert,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5,6">Isa. vi. 5, 6</A>.

 The protection of Providence shall always be upon the beauty of
 holiness. God's tent will be a pavilion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>.</P>

 15 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle <I>of</I> shittim
 wood standing up.
 16 Ten cubits <I>shall be</I> the length of a board, and a cubit and
 a half <I>shall be</I> the breadth of one board.
 17 Two tenons <I>shall there be</I> in one board, set in order one
 against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the
 tabernacle.
 18 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
 boards on the south side southward.
 19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
 boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
 sockets under another board for his two tenons.
 20 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
 <I>there shall be</I> twenty boards:
 21 And their forty sockets <I>of</I> silver; two sockets under one
 board, and two sockets under another board.
 22 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
 six boards.
 23 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
 tabernacle in the two sides.
 24 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall
 be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
 shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.
 25 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets <I>of</I>
 silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two
 sockets under another board.
 26 And thou shalt make bars <I>of</I> shittim wood; five for the
 boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
 27 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
 tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
 tabernacle, for the two sides westward.
 28 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach
 from end to end.
 29 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
 rings <I>of</I> gold <I>for</I> places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
 the bars with gold.
 30 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the
 fashion thereof which was showed thee in the mount.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Very particular directions are here given about the boards of the 
 tabernacle, which were to bear up the curtains, as the stakes of a tent 
 which had need to be strong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:2">Isa. liv. 2</A>.

 These boards had tenons which fell into the mortises that were made for
 them in silver bases. God took care to have every thing strong, as well 
 as fine, in his tabernacle. Curtains without boards would have been 
 shaken by every wind; but <I>it is a good thing</I> to have the 
 <I>heart established with grace,</I> which is as the boards to support 
 the curtains of profession, which otherwise will not hold out long. The 
 boards were coupled together with gold rings at top and bottom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and kept firm with bars that ran through golden staples in every board 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and the boards and bars were all richly gilded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:29">v. 29</A>.

 Thus every thing in the tabernacle was very splendid, agreeable to that
 infant state of the church, when such things were proper enough to 
 please children, to possess the minds of the worshippers with a 
 reverence of the divine glory, and to affect them with the greatness of 
 that prince who said, <I>Here will I dwell;</I> in allusion to this the 
 new Jerusalem is said to be of <I>pure gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:18">Rev. xxi. 18</A>.

 But the builders of the gospel church said, <I>Silver and gold have we
 none;</I> and yet the glory of their building far exceeded that of the 
 tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:10,11">2 Cor. iii. 10, 11</A>.

 <I>How much better is wisdom than gold!</I> No orders are given here
 about the floor of the tabernacle; probably that also was boarded; for 
 we cannot think that within all these fine curtains they trod upon the 
 cold or wet ground; if it was so left, it may remind us of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24"><I>ch.</I> xx. 24</A>,

 31 And thou shalt make a vail <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and
 scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims
 shall it be made:
 32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim <I>wood</I>
 overlaid with gold: their hooks <I>shall be of</I> gold, upon the four
 sockets of silver.
 33 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
 mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony:
 and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy <I>place</I> and
 the most holy.
 34 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
 testimony in the most holy <I>place.</I>
 35 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
 candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle
 toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side.
 36 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent,
 <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
 wrought with needlework.
 37 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars <I>of</I>
 shittim <I>wood,</I> and overlay them with gold, <I>and</I> their hooks
 <I>shall be of</I> gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for
 them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two veils are here ordered to be made, 

 1. One for a partition between the holy place and the most holy, which 
 not only forbade any to enter, but forbade them so much as to look into 
 the holiest of all,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:31,33">v. 31, 33</A>.
 
 Under that dispensation, divine grace was veiled, but now we behold it
 with open face, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 The apostle tells us
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:8,9">Heb. ix. 8, 9</A>)

 what was the meaning of this veil; it intimated that the ceremonial law
 <I>could not make the comers thereunto perfect,</I> nor would the 
 observance of it bring men to heaven; the <I>way into the holiest of 
 all was not made manifest while the first tabernacle was standing; life 
 and immortality</I> lay concealed till they were <I>brought to light by 
 the gospel,</I> which was therefore signified by the rending of this 
 veil at the death of Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:51">Matt. xxvii. 51</A>.

 We have not <I>boldness to enter into the holiest,</I> in all acts of
 devotion, <I>by the blood of Jesus,</I> yet such as obliges us to a 
 holy reverence and a humble sense of our distance. 

 2. Another veil was for the outer door of the tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:36,37">v. 36, 37</A>. 

 Through this first veil the priests went in every day to minister in
 the holy place, but not the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:6">Heb. ix. 6</A>.

 This veil, which was all the defence the tabernacle had against thieves
 and robbers, might easily be broken through, for it could be neither 
 locked nor barred, and the abundance of wealth in the tabernacle, one 
 would think, might be a temptation; but by leaving it thus exposed, 
 
 (1.) The priests and Levites would be so much the more obliged to keep
 a strict watch upon it, and, 

 (2.) God would show his care of his church on earth, though it is weak
 and defenceless, and continually exposed. A curtain shall be (if God 
 please to make it so) as strong a defence to his house as gates of 
 brass and bars of iron.</P>
