 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The song which Moses, by the appointment of God, delivered to the
 children of Israel, for a standing admonition to them, to take heed of 
 forsaking God. This takes up most of the chapter, in which we have,

 1. The preface, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. A high character of God, and, in opposition to that, a bad character
 of the people of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 3. A rehearsal of the great things God had done for them, and in
 opposition to that an account of their ill carriage towards him, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:7-18">ver. 7-18</A>.

 4. A prediction of the wasting destroying judgments which God would
 bring upon them for their sins, in which God is here justified by the 
 many aggravations of their impieties, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:19-33">ver. 19-33</A>.

 5. A promise of the destruction of their enemies and oppressors at
 last, and the glorious deliverance of a remnant of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36-43">ver. 36-43</A>.
 
 II. The exhortation with which Moses delivered this song to them, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:41-47">ver. 41-47</A>.

 III. The orders God gives to Moses to go up to Mount Nebo and die, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:48-52">ver. 48</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
 the words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
 the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
 showers upon the grass:
 &nbsp; 3 Because I will publish the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: ascribe ye
 greatness unto our God.
 &nbsp; 4 <I>He is</I> the Rock, his work <I>is</I> perfect: for all his ways
 <I>are</I> judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and
 right <I>is</I> he.
 &nbsp; 5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot <I>is</I> not <I>the
 spot</I> of his children: <I>they are</I> a perverse and crooked
 generation.
 &nbsp; 6 Do ye thus requite the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O foolish people and unwise?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. A commanding preface or introduction to this song of Moses,
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 He begins,

 1. With a solemn appeal to heaven and earth concerning the truth and
 importance of what he was about to say, and the justice of the divine 
 proceedings against a rebellious and backsliding people, for he had 
 said

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:28"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 28</A>)

 that he would in this song call heaven and earth to record against
 them. Heaven and earth would sooner hear than this perverse and 
 unthinking people; for they revolt not from the obedience to their 
 Creator, but <I>continue to this day, according to his ordinances, as 
 his servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:89-91">Ps. cxix. 89-91</A>),

 and therefore will rise up in judgment against rebellious Israel.
 Heaven and earth will be witnesses against sinners, witnesses of the 
 warning given them and of their refusal to take the warning (see

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:27">Job xx. 27</A>);

 the <I>heaven shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up
 against him.</I> Or heaven and earth are here put for the inhabitants 
 of both, angels and men; both shall agree to justify God in his 
 proceedings against Israel, and to <I>declare his righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:6">Ps. l. 6</A>;
 
 see

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1,2">Rev. xix. 1, 2</A>.

 2. He begins with a solemn application of what he was about to say to
 the people

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>My doctrine shall drop as the rain.</I> "It shall be a beating
 sweeping rain to the rebellious;" so one of the Chaldee paraphrasts 
 expounds the first clause. Rain is sometimes sent for judgment, witness 
 that with which the world was deluged; and so the word of God, while to 
 some it is reviving and refreshing--a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> 
 is to others terrifying and killing--a <I>savour of death unto 
 death.</I> It shall be as a sweet and comfortable dew to those who are 
 rightly prepared to receive it. Observe,

 (1.) The subject of this song is doctrine; he had given them a song of
 praise and thanksgiving

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-21">Exod. xv.</A>),

 but this is a song of instruction, for in psalms, and hymns, and
 spiritual songs, we are not only to give glory to God, but to <I>teach
 and admonish one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:16">Col. iii. 16</A>.

 Hence many of David's psalms are entitled <I>Maschil--to give
 instruction.</I>

 (2.) This doctrine is fitly compared to rain and showers which come
 from above, to make the earth fruitful, and <I>accomplish that for 
 which they are sent.</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10,11">Isa. lv. 10, 11</A>),

 and depend not upon the wisdom or will of man, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Mic.  v. 7</A>.

 It is a mercy to have this rain come often upon us, and our duty to
 <I>drink it in,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7">Heb. vi. 7</A>.

 (3.) He promises that his doctrine shall drop and distil as the dew,
 and the small rain, which descend silently and without noise.  The word 
 preached is likely to profit when it comes gently, and sweetly 
 insinuates itself into the hearts and affections of the hearers.

 (4.) He bespeaks their acceptance and entertainment of it, and that it
 might be as sweet, and pleasant, and welcome to them as rain to the 
 <I>thirsty earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps. lxxii. 6</A>.

 And the word of God is likely to do us good when it is thus acceptable.

 (5.) The learned bishop Patrick understands it as a prayer that his
 words which were sent from heaven to them might sink into their hearts 
 and soften them, as the rain softens the earth, and so make them 
 fruitful in obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An awful declaration of the greatness and righteousness of God, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He begins with this, and lays it down as his first principle, 

 (1.) To preserve the honour of God, that no reproach might be cast upon
 him for the sake of the wickedness of his people Israel; how wicked and 
 corrupt soever those are who are called by his name, he is just, and 
 right, and all that is good, and is not to be thought the worse of for 
 their badness.

 (2.) To aggravate the wickedness of Israel, who knew and worshipped
 such a holy god, and yet were themselves so unholy. And,

 (3.) To justify God in his dealings with them; we must abide by it,
 that God is righteous, even when his <I>judgments are a great deep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1,Ps+36:6">Jer. xii. 1; Ps.  xxxvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Moses here sets himself to <I>publish the name of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that Israel, knowing what a God he is whom they had avouched for
 theirs, might never be such fools as to exchange him for a false god, a 
 dunghill god. He calls upon them therefore to ascribe greatness to him.  
 It will be of great use to us for the preventing of sin, and the 
 preserving of us in the way of our duty, always to keep up high and 
 honourable thoughts of God, and to take all occasions to express them: 
 <I>Ascribe greatness to our God.</I> We cannot add to his greatness, 
 for it is infinite; but we must acknowledge it, and give him the glory 
 of it. Now, when Moses would set forth the greatness of God, he does 
 it, not by explaining his eternity and immensity, or describing the 
 brightness of his glory in the upper world, but by showing the 
 faithfulness of his word, the perfection of his works, and the wisdom 
 and equity of all the administrations of his government; for in these 
 his glory shines most clearly to us, and these are the things revealed 
 concerning him, which <I>belong to us and our children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) <I>He is the rock.</I> So he is called six times in this chapter,
 and the LXX. all along translates it <B><I>Theos,</I></B> <I>God.</I> The
 learned Mr. Hugh Broughton reckons that God is called the <I>rock</I>
 eighteen times (besides in this chapter) in the Old Testament (though
 in some places we translate it <I>strength</I>), and charges it
 therefore upon the papists that they make St. Peter a god when they 
 make him the rock on which the church is built. God is the rock, for he 
 is in himself immutable immovable, and he is to all that seek him and 
 fly to him an impenetrable shelter, and to all that trust in him an 
 everlasting foundation.

 (2.) <I>His work is perfect.</I> His work of creation was so, <I>all
 very good;</I> his works of providence are so, or will be so in due 
 time, and when the mystery of God shall be finished the perfection of 
 his works will appear to all the world.  Nothing that God does can be 
 mended, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 God was now perfecting what he had promised and begun for his people
 Israel, and from the perfection of this work they must take occasion to 
 give him the glory of the perfection of all his works. The best of 
 men's works are imperfect, they have their flaws and defects, and are 
 left unfinished; but, <I>as for God, his work is perfect;</I> if he 
 begin, he will make an end.

 (3.) <I>All his ways are judgment.</I> The ends of his ways are all
 righteous, and he is wise in the choice of the means in order to those 
 ends. <I>Judgment</I> signifies both <I>prudence</I> and <I>justice. 
 The ways of the Lord are right,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9">Hos. xiv. 9</A>.

 (4.) He is <I>a God of truth,</I> whose word we may take and rely upon,
 for he cannot lie who is faithful to all his promises, nor shall his 
 threatenings fall to the ground.

 (5.) He is <I>without iniquity,</I> one who never cheated any that
 trusted in him, never wronged any that appealed to his justice, nor 
 ever was hard upon any that cast themselves upon his mercy.

 (6.) <I>Just and right is he.</I> As he will not wrong any by punishing
 them more than they deserve, so he will not fail to recompense all 
 those that serve him or suffer for him. He is indeed just and right; 
 for he will effectually take care that none shall lose by him. Now what
 a bright and amiable idea does this 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:4">one verse</A>

 give us of the God whom we worship; and what reason have we then to
 love him and fear him, to live a life of delight in him, dependence on 
 him, and devotedness to him! This is <I>our rock, and there is no 
 unrighteousness in him;</I> nor can there be,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:15">Ps. xcii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A high charge exhibited against the Israel of God, whose character 
 was in all respects the reverse of that of the <I>God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. <I>They have corrupted themselves.</I> Or, <I>It has corrupted
 itself;</I> the body of the people has: <I>the whole head sick, and the 
 whole heart faint.</I> God did not corrupt them, for <I>just and right 
 is he;</I> but they are themselves the sole authors of their own sin 
 and ruin; and both are included in this word. <I>They have debauched 
 themselves;</I> for every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his 
 own lust. And <I>they have destroyed themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:9">Hos. xiii. 9</A>.

 If thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear the guilt and grief,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:12">Prov. ix. 12</A>.

 2.  <I>Their spot is not the spot of his children.</I> Even God's
 children have their spots, while they are in this imperfect state; for 
 if we say we have no sin, no spot, we deceive ourselves. But the sin of 
 Israel was none of those; it was not an infirmity which they strove 
 against, watched and prayed against, but an evil which their hearts 
 were fully set in them to do. For, 

 3. They were a <I>perverse and crooked generation,</I> that were
 actuated by a spirit of contradiction, and therefore would do what was 
 forbidden because it was forbidden, would set up their own humour and 
 fancy in opposition to the will of God, were impatient of reproof, 
 hated to be reformed, and <I>went on frowardly in the way of their 
 heart.</I> The Chaldee paraphrase reads 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:5">this verse</A>

 thus: <I>They have scattered</I> or changed <I>themselves, and not him,
 even the children that served idols, a generation that has depraved its
 own works, and alienated itself.</I> Idolaters cannot hurt God, nor do
 any damage to his works, nor make him a stranger to this world. See

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:6">Job xxxv. 6</A>.

 No, all the hurt they do is to themselves and their own works. The
 learned bishop Patrick gives another reading of it: <I>Did he do him 
 any hurt?</I> That is, "Is God the rock to be blamed for the evils that 
 should befal Israel? No, <I>His children are their blot,</I>" that is, 
 "All the evil that comes upon them is the fruit of their children's 
 wickedness; for the whole generation of them is crooked and perverse." 
 All that are ruined ruin themselves; they die because they will 
 die.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A pathetic expostulation with this provoking people for their 
 ingratitude 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Do you thus requite the Lord?</I> Surely you will not hereafter be
 so base and disingenuous in your carriage towards him as you have 
 been." 

 1. He reminds them of the obligations God had laid upon them to serve
 him, and to cleave to him. He had been a Father to them, had begotten 
 them, fed them, carried them, nursed them, and borne their manners; and 
 would they spurn at the bowels of a Father? He had bought them, had 
 been at a vast expense of miracles to bring them out of Egypt, had 
 given <I>men for them,</I> and <I>people for their life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.
 
 "<I>Is not he thy Father, thy owner</I> (so some), that has an
 incontestable propriety in thee?" and <I>the ox knoweth his owner.</I> 
 "he has made thee, and brought thee into being, established thee and 
 kept thee in being; has he not done so? Can you deny the engagements 
 you lie under to him, in consideration of the great things he has done 
 and designed for you?" And are not our obligations, as baptized 
 Christians, equally great and strong to our Creator that made us, our 
 Redeemer that bought us, and our Sanctifier that has established us. 

 2.  Hence he infers the evil of deserting him and rebelling against
 him.  For,

 (1.) It was base ingratitude: "<I>Do you thus require the Lord?</I> Are
 these the returns you make him for all his favours to you? The powers 
 you have from him will you employ them against him?" See

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:3,Joh+10:32">Mic. vi. 3, 4; John x. 32</A>.

 This is such monstrous villany as all the world will cry shame of: call
 a man ungrateful, and you can call him no worse. 

 (2.) It was prodigious madness: <I>O foolish people and unwise!</I>
 Fools, and double fools!  <I>who has bewitched you?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:1">Gal. iii. 1</A>.
 
 "Fools indeed, to disoblige one on whom you have such a necessary
 dependence! To forsake your own mercies for lying vanities!" Note, All 
 wilful sinners, especially sinners in Israel, are the most unwise and 
 the most ungrateful people in the world.</P>

 people according to the number of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 9 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s portion <I>is</I> his people; Jacob <I>is</I> the lot of
 his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
 wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as
 the apple of his eye.
 &nbsp; 11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
 spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
 wings:
 &nbsp; 12 <I>So</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> alone did lead him, and <I>there was</I> no strange
 god with him.
 &nbsp; 13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
 might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
 honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
 &nbsp; 14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and
 rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys
 of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses, having in general represented God to them as their great 
 benefactor, whom they were bound in gratitude to observe and obey, in 
 these verses gives particular instances of God's kindness to them and 
 concern for them. 

 1. Some instances were ancient, and for proof of them he appeals to the
 records

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Remember the days of old;</I> that is, "Keep in remembrance the
 history of those days, and of the wonderful providences of God 
 concerning the old world, and concerning your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, 
 and Jacob; you will find a constant series of mercies attending them, 
 and how long since things were working towards that which has now come 
 to pass." Note, The authentic histories of ancient times are of 
 singular use, and especially the history of the church in its infancy, 
 both the Old-Testament and the New-Testament church. 

 2. Others were more modern, and for proof of them he appeals to their
 fathers and elders that were now alive and with them. Parents must 
 diligently teach their children, not only the word of God, his laws

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>),

 and the meaning of his ordinances 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:26,27">Exod.  xii. 26, 27</A>),

 but his works also, and the methods of his providence. See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:3,4,6,7">Ps. lxxviii. 3, 4, 6, 7</A>.

 And children should desire the knowledge of those things which will be
 of use to engage them to their duty and to direct them in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things are here enlarged upon as instances of God's kindness to 
 his people Israel, and strong obligations upon them never to forsake 
 him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The early designation of the land of Canaan for their inheritance; 
 for herein it was a type and figure of our heavenly inheritance, that 
 it was of old ordained and prepared in the divine counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When the earth was divided among the sons of men, in the days of 
 Peleg, after the flood, and each family had its lot, in which it must 
 settle, and by degrees grow up into a nation, then God had Israel in 
 his thoughts and in his eye; for, designing this good land into which 
 they were now going to be in due time an inheritance for them, he 
 ordered that the posterity of Canaan, rather than any other of the 
 families then in being, should be planted there in the mean time, to 
 keep possession, as it were, till Israel was ready for it, because 
 those families were under the curse of Noah, by which they were 
 condemned to servitude and ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25">Gen. ix. 25</A>),

 and therefore would be the more justly, honourably, easily, and
 effectually, rooted out, when the fulness of time should come that 
 Israel should take possession. Thus he set the bounds of that people 
 with an eye to the designed number of the children of Israel, that they 
 might have just as much as would serve their turn. And some observe 
 that Canaan himself, and his eleven sons

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:15-18">Gen. x. 15</A>,

 &c.), make up just the number of the twelve tribes of
 Israel. Note, 

 (1.) The wisdom of God has appointed the bounds of men's habitation,
 and determined both the place and time of our living in the world, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>.
 
 When he <I>gave the earth to the children of men</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>),

 it was not that every man might catch as he could; no, he divides to
 nations their inheritance, and will have every one to know his own, and 
 not to invade another's property.

 (2.) Infinite wisdom has a vast reach, and designs beforehand what is
 brought to pass long after. <I>Known unto God are all his works</I> 
 from the beginning to the end

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18">Acts xv. 18</A>),
 
 but they are not so to us, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11">Eccl. iii. 11</A>.

 (3.) The great God, in governing the world, and ordering the affairs of
 states and kingdoms, has a special regard to his church and people, and 
 consults their good in all. See

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9,Isa+45:4">2 Chron. xvi. 9, and Isa. xlv. 4</A>.

 The Canaanites thought they had as good and sure a title to their land
 as any of their neighbours had to theirs; but God intended that they 
 should only be tenants, till the Israelites, their landlords, came.  
 Thus God serves his own purposes of kindness to his people, by those 
 that neither know him nor love him, <I>who mean not so, neither doth 
 their heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7,Mic+4:12">Isa. x. 7; Mic. iv. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason given for the particular care God took for this people, 
 so long before they were either born or thought of (as I may say), in 
 our world, does yet more magnify the kindness, and make it obliging 
 beyond expression 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>For the Lord's portion is his people.</I> All the world is his. He
 is owner and possessor of heaven and earth, but his church is his in a 
 peculiar manner. It is his demesne, his vineyard, his garden enclosed. 
 He has a particular delight in it: it is the beloved of his soul, in it 
 he walks, he dwells, it is his rest for ever. He has a particular
 concern for it, keeps it as the apple of his eye. He has particular 
 expectations from it, as a man has from his portion, has a much greater 
 rent of honour, glory, and worship, from that distinguished remnant, 
 than from all the world besides. That God should be his people's 
 portion is easy to be accounted for, for he is their joy and felicity; 
 but how they should be his portion, who neither needs them nor can be 
 benefited by them, must be resolved into the wondrous condescensions of 
 free grace. <I>Even so, Father, because it seemed good in thy eyes</I> 
 so to call and to account them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The forming of them into a people, that they might be fit to enter 
 upon this inheritance, like an heir of age, at the time appointed of 
 the Father. And herein also Canaan was a figure of the heavenly 
 inheritance; for, as it was from eternity proposed and designed for all 
 God's spiritual Israel, so they are, in time (and it is a work of 
 time), fitted and made meet for it, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12">Col. i. 12</A>.

 The deliverance of Israel out of slavery, by the destruction of their
 oppressors, was attended with so many wonders obvious to sense, and had 
 been so often spoken of, that it needed not to be mentioned in this 
 song; but the gracious works God wrought upon them would be less taken 
 notice of than the glorious works he had wrought for them, and 
 therefore he chooses rather to advert to them. A great deal was done to 
 model this people, to cast them into some shape, and to fit them for 
 the great things designed for them in the land of promise; and it is 
 here most elegantly described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He found him in a desert land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This refers, no doubt, to the wilderness through which God brought them
 to Canaan, and in which he took so much pains with them; it is called 
 <I>the church in the wilderness,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:38">Acts vii. 38</A>.

 There it was born, and nursed, and educated, that all might appear to
 be divine and from heaven, since they had there no communication with 
 any part of this earth either for food or learning. But, because he is 
 said to <I>find</I> them there, it seems designed also to represent 
 both the bad state and the bad character of that people when God began 
 first to appear for them.

 (1.) Their condition was forlorn. Egypt was to them a desert land, and
 a waste howling wilderness, for they were bond-slaves in it, and cried 
 by reason of their oppression, and were perfectly bewildered and at a 
 loss for relief; there God found them, and thence he fetched them. And,

 (2.) Their disposition was very unpromising. So ignorant were the
 generality of them in divine things, so stupid and unapt to receive the 
 impressions of them, so peevish and humoursome, so froward and 
 quarrelsome, and withal so strangely addicted to the idolatries of 
 Egypt, that they might well be said to be found in a desert land; for 
 one might as reasonably expect a crop of corn from a barren wilderness 
 as any good fruit of service to God from a people of such a character.  
 Those that are renewed and sanctified by grace should often remember 
 what they were by nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>He led him about and instructed him.</I> When God had them in the 
 wilderness he did not bring them directly to Canaan, but made them go a 
 great way about, and so he instructed them; that is, 

 (1.) By this means he took time to instruct them, and gave them
 commandments as they were able to receive them. Those whose business it 
 is to instruct others must not expect it will be done of a sudden; 
 learners must have time to learn.

 (2.) By this means he tried their faith, and patience, and dependence
 upon God, and inured them to the hardships of the wilderness, and so 
 instructed them. Every stage had something in it that was instructive; 
 even when he chastened them, he thereby <I>taught them out of his 
 law.</I> It is said

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:7">Ps. cvii. 7</A>)

 that he <I>led them forth by the right way;.</I> and yet here that he
 <I>led them about;</I> for God always leads his people the right way, 
 however to us it may seem circuitous: so that the furthest way about 
 proves, if not the nearest way, yet the best way home to Canaan.  How 
 God instructed them is explained long after

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:13">Neh. ix. 13</A>),

 <I>Thou gavest them right judgments and true laws, good statutes, and
 commandments;</I> and especially

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>Thou gavest them also thy good Spirit to instruct them;</I> and he
 instructs effectually. We may well imagine how unfit that people would 
 have been for Canaan had they not first gone through the discipline of 
 the wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>He kept him as the apple of his eye,</I> with all the care and 
 tenderness that could be, from the malignant influences of an open sky 
 and air, and all the perils of an inhospitable desert. The pillar of 
 cloud and fire was both a guide and a guard to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He did that for them which the eagle does for her nest of young 
 ones, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 The similitude was touched,
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4">Exod. xix. 4</A>,

 <I>I bore you on eagles' wings;</I> here it is enlarged upon. The eagle
 is observed to have a strong affection for her young, and to show it, 
 not only as other creatures by protecting them and making provision for 
 them, but by educating them and teaching them to fly. For this purpose 
 she stirs them out of the nest where they lie dozing, flutters over 
 them, to show them how they must use their wings, and then accustoms 
 them to fly upon her wings till they have learnt to fly upon their own. 
 This, by the way, is an example to parents to train up their children 
 to business, and not to indulge them in idleness and the love of ease. 
 God did thus by Israel; when they were in love with their slavery, and 
 loth to leave it, God, by Moses, stirred them up to aspire after 
 liberty, and many a time kept them from returning to the house of 
 bondage. He carried them out of Egypt, led them into the wilderness, 
 and now at length had led them through it. <I>The Lord alone did lead 
 him,</I> he needed not any assistance, nor did he take any to be 
 partner with him in the achievement, which was a good reason why they 
 should serve the Lord only and no other, so much as in partnership, 
 much less in rivalship with him. There was no strange god with him to 
 contribute to Israel's salvation, and therefore there should be none to 
 share in Israel's homage and adoration, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:9">Ps.  lxxxi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The settling of them in a good land. This was done in part 
 already, in the happy planting of the two tribes and a half, an earnest 
 of what would speedily and certainly be done for the rest of the 
 tribes. 

 1. They were blessed with glorious victories over their enemies

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>He made him ride on the high places of the earth,</I> that is, he
 brought him on with conquest, and brought him home with triumph.  He
 rode over the high places or strong holds that were kept against him, 
 sat in ease and honour upon the fruitful hills of Canaan. In Egypt they 
 looked mean, and were so, in poverty and disgrace; but in Canaan they 
 looked great, and were so, advanced and enriched; they rode in state, 
 as a people whom the King of kings delighted to honour. 

 2.  With great plenty of all good things. Not only the ordinary
 increase of the field, but, which was uncommon, <I>Honey out of the 
 rock, and oil out of the flinty rock,</I> which may refer either,

 (1.) To their miraculous supply of fresh water out of the rock that
 followed them in the wilderness, which is called <I>honey and oil,</I> 
 because the necessity they were reduced to made it as sweet and 
 acceptable as honey and oil at another time. Or,

 (2.) To the great abundance of honey and oil they should find in
 Canaan, even in those parts that were least fertile. The rocks in 
 Canaan should yield a better increase than the fields and meadows of 
 other countries. Other productions of Canaan are mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Such abundance and such variety of wholesome food (and every thing the
 best in its kind) that every meal might be a feast if they pleased: 
 excellent bread made of the best corn, here called the <I>kidneys of 
 the wheat</I> (for a grain of wheat is not unlike a kidney), butter and 
 milk in abundance, the flesh of cattle well fed, and for their drink, 
 no worse than the <I>pure blood of the grape;</I> so indulgent a Father 
 was God to them, and so kind a benefactor.  Ainsworth makes the plenty 
 of good things in Canaan to be a figure of the fruitfulness of Christ's 
 kingdom, and the heavenly comforts of his word and Spirit: for the 
 children of his kingdom he has butter and milk, the sincere milk of the 
 word; and strong meat for strong men, with the wine that makes glad the 
 heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a description of the apostasy of Israel from God, which 
 would shortly come to pass, and to which already they had a 
 disposition. One would have thought that a people under so many 
 obligations to their God, in duty, gratitude, and interest, would never 
 have turned from him; but, alas! they <I>turned aside quickly.</I> Here 
 are two great instances of their wickedness, and each of them amounted 
 to an apostasy from God:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Security and sensuality, pride and insolence, and the other common 
 abuses of plenty and prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 These people were called <I>Jeshurun--an upright people</I> (so some),
 <I>a seeing people,</I> so others: but they soon lost the reputation 
 both of their knowledge and of their righteousness; for, being 
 well-fed,

 1. They <I>waxed fat,</I> and <I>grew thick,</I> that is, they indulged
 themselves in all manner of luxury and gratifications of their 
 appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to <I>make provision for 
 the flesh, to fulfil the lusts of it.</I> They <I>grew fat,</I> that 
 is, they grew big and unwieldy, unmindful of business, and unfit for 
 it; dull and stupid, careless and senseless; and this was the effect of 
 their plenty. Thus <I>the prosperity of fools destroys them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32">Prov. i. 32</A>.

 Yet this was not the worst of it. 

 2. They <I>kicked;</I> they grew proud and insolent, and <I>lifted up
 the heel</I> even against God himself. If God rebuked them, either by 
 his prophets or by his providence, they <I>kicked against the goad,</I> 
 as an <I>untamed heifer,</I> or a <I>bullock unaccustomed to the 
 yoke,</I> and in their rage persecuted the prophets, and flew in the 
 face of providence itself. And thus he <I>forsook God that made him</I> 
 (not paying due respect to his creator, nor answering the ends of his 
 creation), and put an intolerable contempt upon <I>the rock of his 
 salvation,</I> as if he were not indebted to him for any past favours, 
 nor had any dependence upon him for the future.  Those that make a god 
 of themselves and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and 
 cannot bear to be told of it, certainly thereby forsake God and show 
 how lightly they esteem him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Idolatry was the great instance of their apostasy, and which the 
 former led them to, as it made them sick of their religion, 
 self-willed, and fond of changes.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What sort of gods they chose and offered sacrifice to, when they 
 forsook the God that made them, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 This aggravated their sin that those very services which they should
 have done to the true God they did,

 (1.) To <I>strange gods,</I> that could not pretend to have done them
 any kindness, or laid them under any obligation to them, gods that they 
 had no knowledge of, nor could expect any benefit by, for they were 
 strangers. Or they are called <I>strange gods,</I> because they were 
 other than the one only true God, to whom they were betrothed and ought 
 to have been faithful.

 (2.) To <I>new gods, that came newly up;</I> for even in religion, the
 antiquity of which is one of its honours, vain minds have strangely 
 affected novelty, and, in contempt of the Ancient of days, have been 
 fond of new gods. A new god! can there be a more monstrous absurdity? 
 Would we find the right way to rest, we must ask for the <I>good old 
 way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.

 It was true their fathers had worshipped <I>other gods</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2">Josh. xxiv. 2</A>),

 and perhaps it had been some little excuse if the children had returned
 to them; but to serve <I>new gods whom their fathers feared not,</I> 
 and to like them the better for being new, was to open a door to 
 endless idolatries. 

 (3.) They were such as were no gods at all, but mere counterfeits and
 pretenders; their names the invention of men's fancies, and their 
 images the work of men's hands. Nay,

 (4.) They were devils. So far from being <I>gods, fathers</I> and
 <I>benefactors</I> to mankind, they really were <I>destroyers</I> (so 
 the word signifies), such as aimed to do mischief. If there were any 
 spirits or invisible powers that possessed their idol-temples and 
 images, they were evil spirits and malignant powers, whom yet they did 
 not need to worship for fear they should hurt them, as they say the 
 Indians do; for those that faithfully worship God are out of the 
 devil's reach: nay, the devil can destroy those only that sacrifice to 
 him. How mad are idolaters, who forsake the <I>rock of salvation</I> to 
 run themselves upon the <I>rock of perdition!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What a great affront this was to Jehovah their God. 

 (1.) It was justly interpreted a forgetting of him

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful.</I> Mindfulness of
 God would prevent sin, but, when the world is served and the flesh 
 indulged, God is forgotten; and can any thing be more base and unworthy 
 than to forget the God that is the author of our being, by whom we 
 subsist, and in whom we live and move? And see what comes of it, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:10,11">Isa. xvii. 10, 11</A>,

 <I>Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not
 been mindful of the Rock of thy strength,</I> though the strange slips 
 be pleasant plants at first, yet the harvest at last <I>will be a heap 
 in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</I> There is nothing got 
 by forgetting God.

 (2.) It was justly resented as an inexcusable offence: <I>They provoked
 him to jealousy and to anger</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 for their idols were abominations to him. See here God's displeasure
 against idols, whether they be set up in the heart or in the sanctuary.  
 
 [1.] He is jealous of them, as rivals with him for the throne in the
 heart. 

 [2.] He hates them, as enemies to his crown and government. 

 [3.] He is, and will be, very angry with those that have any respect or
 affection for them. Those consider not what they do that provoke God; 
 for <I>who knows the power of his anger?</I></P>

 The method of this song follows the method of the predictions in the 
 foregoing chapter, and therefore, after the revolt of Israel from God, 
 described in the 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:15,16">foregoing verses</A>,

 here follow immediately the resolves of divine Justice concerning them;
 we deceive ourselves if we think that God will be thus mocked by a 
 foolish faithless people, that play fast and loose with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He had delighted in them, but now he would reject them with 
 detestation and disdain, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When the Lord saw their treachery, and folly, and base ingratitude, he
 abhorred them, he despised them, so some read it. Sin makes us odious 
 in the sight of the holy God; and no sinners are so loathsome to him as 
 those that he has called, and that have called themselves, his sons and 
 his daughters, and yet have been provoking to him. Note, The nearer any 
 are to God in profession the more noisome are they to him if they are 
 defiled in a sinful way, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:39,40">Ps.  cvi. 39, 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He had given them the tokens of his presence with them and his 
 favour to them; but now he would withdraw and <I>hide his face from 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 His <I>hiding his face</I> signifies his great displeasure; they had
 <I>turned their back</I> upon God, and now God would turn his back upon 
 them (compare

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:17,Jer+2:27">Jer. xviii. 17 with Jer. ii. 27</A>);

 but here it denotes also the slowness of God's proceedings against them
 in a way of judgment. They began in their apostasy with omissions of 
 good, and so proceeded to commissions of evil. In like manner God will 
 first suspend his favours, and let them see what the issue of that will 
 be, what a friend they lose when they provoke God to depart, and will 
 try whether this will bring them to repentance. Thus we find God hiding 
 himself, as it were, in expectation of the event, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17">Isa. lvii. 17</A>.

 To justify himself in leaving them he shows that they were such as
 there was no dealing with; for,

 1. They were froward and a people that could not be pleased, or
 obstinate in sin, and that could not be convinced and reclaimed. 

 2.  They were faithless, and a people that could not be trusted. When
 he saved them, and took them into covenant, he said, <I>Surely they are 
 children that will not lie</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:8">Isa. lxiii. 8</A>);

 but when they proved otherwise, <I>children in whom is no faith,</I>
 they deserved to be abandoned, and that the God of truth should have no 
 more to do with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He had done every thing to make them easy and to please them, but 
 now he would do that against them which should be most vexatious to 
 them. The punishment here answers the sin, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 1. They had provoked God with despicable deities which were not gods at
 all, but vanities, creatures of their own imagination, that could not 
 pretend either to merit or to repay the respects of their worshippers; 
 the more vain and vile the gods were after which they went a whoring 
 the greater was the offence to that great and good God whom they set 
 them up in competition with and contradiction to. This put two great 
 evils into their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:13">Jer. ii. 13</A>.

 2. God would therefore plague them with despicable enemies, that were
 worthless, weak, and inconsiderable, and not deserving the name of a 
 people, which was a great mortification to them, and aggravated the 
 oppressions they groaned under. The more base the people were that
 tyrannised over them the more barbarous they would be (none so insolent 
 as a beggar on horseback), besides that it would be infamous to Israel, 
 who had so often triumphed over great and mighty nations, to be 
 themselves trampled upon by the weak and foolish, and to come under the 
 curse of Canaan, who was to be a servant of servants.  But God can make 
 the weakest instrument a scourge to the strongest sinner; and those 
 that by sin insult their mighty Creator are justly insulted by the
 meanest of their fellow-creatures. This was remarkably fulfilled in the 
 days of the judges, when they were sometimes oppressed by the very 
 Canaanites themselves, whom they had subdued,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:2">Judg. iv. 2</A>.

 But the apostle applies it to the conversion of the Gentiles, who had
 been a people not in covenant with God, and foolish in divine things, 
 yet were brought into the church, sorely to the grief of the Jews, who 
 upon all occasions showed a great indignation at it, which was both 
 their sin and their punishment, as envy always is, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:19">Rom.  x. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He had planted them in a good land, and replenished them with all 
 good things; but now he would strip them of all their comforts, and 
 bring them to ruin. The judgments threatened are very terrible, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:22-25"><I>v.</I> 22-25</A>.

 1. The fire of God's anger shall consume them, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Are they proud of their plenty? It shall burn up the increase of the
 earth. Are they confident of their strength? It shall destroy the very 
 foundations of their mountains: there is no fence against the judgments 
 of God when they come with commission to lay all waste. It shall burn 
 to the lowest hell, that is, it shall bring them to the very depth of 
 misery in this world, which yet would be but a faint resemblance of the 
 complete and endless misery of sinners in the other world. The 
 damnation of hell (as our Saviour calls it) is the fire of God's anger, 
 fastening upon the guilty conscience of a sinner, to its inexpressible 
 and everlasting torment, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 2. The arrows of God's judgments shall be spent upon them, till his
 quiver is quite exhausted, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The judgments of God, like arrows, fly swiftly

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:7">Ps. lxiv. 7</A>),

 reaching those at a distance who flatter themselves with hopes of
 escaping them, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8,12">Ps. xxi. 8, 12</A>.

 They come from an unseen hand, but wound mortally, for God never misses
 his mark,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:34">1 Kings xxii. 34</A>.

 The particular judgments here threatened are, 

 (1.) Famine: <I>they shall be burnt,</I> or <I>parched, with
 hunger.</I>

 (2.) Pestilence and other diseases, here called <I>burning heat and
 bitter destruction.</I>

 (3.) The insults of the inferior creatures: <I>the teeth of beasts and
 the poison of serpents,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 (4.) War and the fatal consequences of it, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 [1.] Perpetual frights. When the <I>sword is without,</I> there cannot
 but be <I>terror within.</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2 Cor. vii. 5</A>,

 <I>Without were fightings, within were fears.</I> Those who cast off
 the fear of God are justly exposed to the fear of enemies.  

 [2.] Universal deaths. The sword of the Lord, when it is sent to lay
 all waste, will destroy without distinction; neither the strength of 
 the young man nor the beauty of the virgin, neither the innocency of 
 the suckling nor the gravity or infirmity of the man of gray hairs, 
 will be their security from the sword when it devours one as well as 
 another.  Such devastation does war make, especially when it is pushed 
 on by men as ravenous as wild beasts and as venomous as serpents, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
 remembrance of them to cease from among men:
 &nbsp; 27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
 adversaries should behave themselves strangely, <I>and</I> lest they
 should say, Our hand <I>is</I> high, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath not done all
 this.
 &nbsp; 28 For they <I>are</I> a nation void of counsel, neither <I>is there
 any</I> understanding in them.
 &nbsp; 29 O that they were wise, <I>that</I> they understood this, <I>that</I>
 they would consider their latter end!
 &nbsp; 30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
 flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had shut
 them up?
 &nbsp; 31 For their rock <I>is</I> not as our Rock, even our enemies
 themselves <I>being</I> judges.
 &nbsp; 32 For their vine <I>is</I> of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields
 of Gomorrah: their grapes <I>are</I> grapes of gall, their clusters
 <I>are</I> bitter:
 &nbsp; 33 Their wine <I>is</I> the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom
 of asps.
 &nbsp; 34 <I>Is</I> not this laid up in store with me, <I>and</I> sealed up
 among my treasures?

 &nbsp; 36 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall judge his people, and repent himself for
 his servants, when he seeth that <I>their</I> power is gone, and
 <I>there is</I> none shut up, or left.
 &nbsp; 37 And he shall say, Where <I>are</I> their gods, <I>their</I> rock in
 whom they trusted,
 &nbsp; 38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, <I>and</I> drank the
 wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you,
 <I>and</I> be your protection.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After many terrible threatenings of deserved wrath and vengeance, we 
 have here surprising intimations of mercy, undeserved mercy, which 
 rejoices against judgment, and by which it appears that God has <I>no 
 pleasure in the death of sinners,</I> but would rather they should 
 <I>turn and live.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In jealousy for his own honour, he will not <I>make a full end</I> 
 of them, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 1. It cannot be denied but that they deserved to be utterly ruined, and
 that their <I>remembrance should be made to cease from among men,</I> 
 so that the name of an Israelite should never be known but in history; 
 <I>for they were a nation void of counsel</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 the most sottish inconsiderate people that ever were, that would not
 believe the gory of God, though they saw it, nor understand his loving 
 kindness, though they tasted it and lived upon it. Of those who could 
 cast off such a God, such a law, such a covenant, for vain and 
 dunghill-deities, it might truly be said, There is <I>no understanding 
 in them.</I> 

 2. It would have been an easy thing with God to ruin them and blot out
 the remembrance of them; when the greatest part of them were cut off by 
 the sword, it was but scattering the remnant into some remote obscure 
 corners of the earth, where they should never have been heard of any 
 more, and the thing had been done. See

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+5:12">Ezek. v. 12</A>.

 God can destroy those that are most strongly fortified, disperse those
 that are most closely united, and bury those names in perpetual 
 oblivion that have been most celebrated. 

 3. Justice demanded it: <I>I said I would scatter them.</I> It is fit
 those should be cut off from the earth that have cut themselves off 
 from their God; why should they not be dealt with according to their 
 deserts? 

 4. Wisdom considered the pride and insolence of the enemy, which would
 take occasion from the ruin of a people that had been so dear to God, 
 and for whom he had done such great things, to reflect upon God and to 
 imagine that because they had got the better of Israel they had carried 
 the day against the God of Israel: The <I>adversaries will say, Our 
 hand is high,</I> high indeed, when it has been too high for those whom 
 God himself fought for; nor will they consider that <I>the Lord has 
 done all this,</I> but will dream that they have done it in despite of 
 him, as if the God of Israel were as weak and impotent, and as easily 
 run down, as the pretended deities of other nations. 

 5. In consideration of this, Mercy prevails for the sparing of a
 remnant and the saving of that unworthy people from utter ruin: <I>I 
 feared the wrath of the enemy.</I> It is an expression after the manner 
 of men; it is certain that God fears no man's wrath, but he acted in 
 this matter as if he had feared it. Those few good people in Israel 
 that had a concern for the honour of God's name <I>feared the wrath of 
 the enemy</I> in this instance more than in any other, as Joshua

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:9">Josh. vii. 9</A>),

 and David often; and, because they feared it, God himself is said to
 fear it. He needed not Moses to plead it with him, but reminded himself 
 of it: <I>What will the Egyptians say?</I> Let all those whose hearts 
 tremble for the ark of God and his Israel comfort themselves with this, 
 that God will <I>work for his own name,</I> and will not suffer it to 
 be profaned and polluted: how much soever we deserve to be disgraced, 
 God will never <I>disgrace the throne of his glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In concern for their welfare, he earnestly desires their 
 conversion; and, in order to that, their serious consideration of their 
 latter end, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. Though God had pronounced them a foolish people and of no
 understanding, yet he wishes they were wise, as

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:29">Deut. v. 29</A>,

 <I>O that there were such a heart in them!</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:8">Ps. xciv. 8</A>,

 <I>You fools, when will you be wise?</I> God delights not to see
 sinners ruin themselves, but desires they will help themselves; and, if 
 they will, he is ready to help them.

 2. It is a great piece of wisdom, and will contribute much to the
 return of sinners to God, seriously to consider the latter end, or the 
 future state. It is here meant particularly of that which God by Moses 
 had foretold concerning this people in the latter days: but it may be 
 applied more generally. We ought to understand and consider,

 (1.) The latter end of life, and the future state of the soul. To think
 of death as our removal from a world of sense to a world of spirits, 
 the final period of our state of trial and probation, and our entrance 
 upon an unchangeable state of recompence and retribution.

 (2.) The latter end of sin, and the future state of those that live and
 die in it. O that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and 
 the misery they will certainly plunge themselves into, if they <I>go on 
 still in their trespasses, what will be in the end thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:31">Jer. v. 31</A>.

 Jerusalem forgot this, and therefore <I>came down wonderfully,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:9">Lam. i. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He calls to mind the great things he had done for them formerly, 
 as a reason why he should not quite cast them off. This seems to be the 
 meaning of that 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>),

 "How should one Israelite have been too hard for a thousand Canaanites,
 as they have been many a time, but that God, who is greater than all 
 gods, fought for them!" And so it corresponds with that, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63"10,11">Isa. lxiii. 10, 11</A>.

 When he was <I>turned to be their enemy,</I> as here, <I>and fought
 against them</I> for their sins, <I>then he remembered the days of 
 old,</I> saying, <I>Where is he that brought them out of the sea?</I> 
 So here, his arm begins to awake as in the days of old <I>against the 
 wrath of the enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:7">Ps. cxxxviii. 7</A>.

 There was a time when the enemies of Israel were sold by their own
 rock, that is, their own idol-gods, who could not help them, but 
 betrayed them, because Jehovah, the God of Israel, had shut them up as 
 sheep for the slaughter. For the enemies themselves must own that their 
 gods were a very unequal match for the God of Israel. <I>For their vine 
 is of the vine of Sodom,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 This must be meant of the enemies of Israel, who fell so easily before
 the sword of Israel because they were ripe for ruin, and the measure of 
 their iniquity was full. Yet these verses may be understood of the 
 strange prevalency of the enemies of Israel against them, when God made 
 use of them as the <I>rod of his anger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5,6">Isa. x. 5, 6</A>.

 "How should one Canaanite chase a thousand Israelites" (as it is
 threatened against those that trust to Egypt for help, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:17">Isa. xxx. 17</A>,

 <I>One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one</I>) "unless Israel's 
 rock had deserted them and given them up." For otherwise, however they 
 may impute their power <I>to their gods</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:11">Hab. i. 11</A>),

 as the Philistines imputed their victory to Dagon, it is certain the
 enemies' rock could not have prevailed against the rock of Israel; God 
 would soon have subdued their enemies

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:14">Ps. lxxxi. 14</A>),

 but that the wickedness of Israel delivered them into their hands. For
 their vine, that is, Israel's, is of the <I>vine of Sodom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 They were planted a choice vine, wholly a right seed, but by sin had
 become the <I>degenerate plant of a strange vine</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21">Jer. ii. 21</A>),

 and not only transcribed the iniquity of Sodom, but outdid it,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:48">Ezek. xvi. 48</A>.
 
 God called them his <I>vineyard,</I> his <I>pleasant plant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:7">Isa. v. 7</A>.
 
 But their fruits were,

 1. Very offensive, and displeasing to God, bitter as gall. 2 Very
 malignant, and pernicious one to another, <I>like the cruel venom of 
 asps.</I> Some understand this of their punishment; their sin would be 
 <I>bitterness in the latter end</I>

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:26">2 Sam. ii. 26</A>),
 
 it would <I>bite like a serpent and sting like an adder,</I>
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:14,Pr+23:32">Job xx. 14; Prov. xxiii. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He resolves upon the destruction of those at last that had been 
 their persecutors and oppressors. When the cup of trembling goes round, 
 the king of Babel shall pledge it at last, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:26">Jer. xxv. 26</A>,
 
 and see 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22,23">Isa. li. 22, 23</A>.

 The day is coming when the judgment that began at the house of God
 shall end with the sinner and ungodly,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,18">1 Pet. iv. 17, 18</A>.

 God will in due time bring down the church's enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In displeasure against their wickedness, which he takes notice of, 
 and keeps an account of, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 "Is not this implacable fury of theirs against Israel <I>laid up in
 store with me,</I> to be reckoned for hereafter, when it shall be made 
 to appear that <I>to me belongs vengeance?</I>" Some understand it of 
 the sin of Israel, especially their persecuting the prophets, which was 
 laid up in store against them from the <I>blood of righteous Abel,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>.

 However it teaches us that the wickedness of the wicked is all laid up
 in store with God.  

 (1.) He observes it, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:8">Ps. xc. 8</A>.

 He knows both what the vine is and what the grapes are, what is the
 temper of the mind and what are the actions of life.

 (2.) He keeps a record of it both in his own omniscience and in the
 sinner's conscience; and this is <I>sealed up among his treasures,</I> 
 which denotes both safety and secresy: these books cannot be lost, nor 
 will they be opened till the great day.  See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:12">Hos. xiii. 12</A>.

 (3.) He often delays the punishment of sin for a great while; it is
 laid up in store, till the measure be full, and the day of divine 
 patience has expired. See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:28-30">Job xxi. 28-30</A>.

 (4.) There is a day of reckoning coming, when all the treasures of
 guilt and wrath will be broken up, and the sin of sinners shall surely 
 find them out. 

 [1.] The thing itself will certainly be done, for the Lord is a <I>God
 to whom vengeance belongs,</I> and therefore he will repay, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:18">Isa. lix. 18</A>.
 
 This is quoted by the apostle to show the severity of God's wrath
 against those that revolt from the faith of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:30">Heb. x. 30</A>.

 [2.] It will be done in due time, in the best time; nay, it will be
 done in a short time.  <I>The day of their calamity is at hand;</I> 
 and, though it may seem to tarry, it lingers not, it slumbers not, but 
 makes haste.  <I>In one hour,</I> shall the judgment of Babylon 
 come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will do it in compassion to his own people, who, though they had 
 greatly provoked him, yet stood in relation to him, and their misery 
 appealed to his mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall judge his people,.</I> that is, judge for them
 against their enemies, plead their cause, and break the yoke of 
 oppression under which they had long groaned, <I>repenting himself for 
 his servants;</I> not changing his mind, but changing his way, and 
 fighting for them, as he had fought against them, <I>when he sees that 
 their power is gone.</I> This plainly points at the deliverances God 
 wrought for Israel by the judges out of the hands of those to whom he 
 had sold them for their sins (see

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:11-18">Judg. ii. 11-18</A>),
 
 and how <I>his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel</I>
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judg. x. 16</A>),

 and this when they were reduced to the last extremity. God helped them
 when they could not help themselves; for there was <I>none shut up or 
 left;</I> that is, none that dwelt either in cities or walled towns, in 
 which they were shut up, nor any that dwelt in scattered houses in the 
 country, in which they were left at a distance from neighbours. Note, 
 God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people is when things 
 are at the worst with them. God tries his people's faith, and stirs up 
 prayer, by letting things go to the worst, and then magnifies his own 
 power, and fills the faces of his enemies with shame and the hearts of 
 his people with so much the greater joy, by rescuing them out of 
 extremity as <I>brands out of the burning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He will do it in contempt and to the reproach of idol-gods, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.
 
 <I>Where are their gods?</I> Two ways it may be understood:

 (1.) That God would do that for his people which the idols they had
 served could not do for them. They had forsaken God, and been very 
 liberal in their sacrifices to idols, had brought to their altars the 
 <I>fat of their sacrifices</I> and the <I>wine of their 
 drink-offerings,</I> which they supposed their deities to feed upon and 
 on which they feasted with them.  "Now," says God, "will these gods you 
 have made your court to, at so great an expense, help you in your 
 distress, and so repay you for all your charges in their service? <I>Go 
 get you to the gods you have served, and let them deliver you,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.
 
 This is intended to convince them of their folly in forsaking a God
 that could help them for gods that could not, and so to bring them to 
 repentance and qualify them for deliverance. When the adulteress shall 
 <I>follow after her lovers</I> and <I>not overtake them,</I> pray to 
 her idols and receive no kindness from them, <I>then she shall say, I 
 will go and return to my first husband,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:12,Jer+2:27,28">Isa. xvi. 12; Jer. ii. 27, 28</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) That God would do that against his enemies which the idols they
 had served could not save them from, Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar 
 boldly challenged the God of Israel to deliver his worshippers

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:10,Da+3:15">Isa. xxxvii. 10; Dan. iii. 15</A>),

 and he did deliver them, to the confusion of their enemies. But the God
 of Israel challenged Bel and Nebo to deliver their worshippers, to rise 
 up and help them, and to be their protection

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12,13">Isa. xlvii. 12, 13</A>);

 but they were so far from helping them that they themselves, that is,
 their images, which was all that was of them, <I>went into 
 captivity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1,2">Isa. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.

 This conclusion of the song speaks three things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Glory to God, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 "See now upon the whole matter, <I>that I, even I, am he.</I> Learn
 this from the destruction of idolaters, and the inability of their 
 idols to help them." The great God here demands the glory,

 1. Of a self-existence: <I>I, even I, am he.</I> Thus Moses concludes
 with that name of God by which he was first made to know him

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>),

 "<I>I am that I am.</I> I am he that I have been, that I will be, that
 I have promised to be, that I have threatened to be; all shall find me 
 true to my word." The Targum of Uzzielides paraphrases it thus: <I>When 
 the Word of the Lord shall reveal himself to redeem his people, he 
 shall say to all people, See that I now am what I am, and have been, 
 and I am what I will be,</I> which we know very well how to apply to 
 him who said to John, <I>I am he who is, and was, and is to come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8">Rev. i. 8</A>.

 These words, <I>I even I, am he,</I> we meet with often in those
 chapters of Isaiah where God is encouraging his people to hope for 
 their deliverance out of Babylon,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:4,43:11,13,15,25,46:4">Isa. xli. 4;
 xliii. 11, 13, 25; xlvi. 4</A>.
 
 2. Of a sole supremacy. "There <I>is no god with me.</I> None to help
 with me, none to cope with me." See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:10,11">Isa.  xliii. 10, 11</A>.

 3. Of an absolute sovereignty, a universal agency: <I>I kill, and I
 make alive;</I> that is, all evil and all good come from his hand to 
 providence; he forms both the light of life and the darkness of death,
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7,La+3:37,38">Isa. xlv. 7; Lam. iii. 37, 38</A>.

 Or, He kills and wounds his enemies, but heals and makes alive his own
 people, kills and wounds with his judgments those that revolt from him 
 and rebel against him; but, when they return and repent, he heals them, 
 and makes them alive with his mercy and grace. Or it denotes his 
 incontestable authority to dispose of all his creatures, and the beings 
 he has given them, so as to serve his own purposes by them: <I>Whom he 
 will he slays, and whom he will he keeps alive,</I> when his judgments 
 are abroad. Or thus, Though he kill, yet he makes alive again: 
 <I>though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion,</I>

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:32">Lam.  iii. 32</A>.

 Though he have <I>torn,</I> he will <I>heal us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1,2">Hos. vi. 1, 2</A>.

 The Jerusalem Targum reads it, <I>I kill those that are alive in this
 world, and make those alive in the other world that are dead.</I> And 
 some of the Jewish doctors themselves have observed that death, and a 
 life after it, that is, eternal life, is intimated in these words. 

 4.  Of an irresistible power, which cannot be controlled: <I>Neither is
 there any that can deliver out of my hand</I> those that I have marked 
 for destruction.  As no exception can be made against the sentence of 
 God's justice, so no escape can be made from the executions of his 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Terror to his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:40-42"><I>v.</I> 40-42</A>.

 Terror indeed to those that hate him, as all those do that serve other
 gods, that persist in wilful disobedience to the divine law, and that 
 malign and persecute his faithful servants. These are those to whom God 
 will render vengeance, those his enemies that will not have him to 
 reign over them. In order to alarm such in time to repent and return to 
 their allegiance, the wrath of God is here revealed from heaven against 
 them.

 1. The divine sentence is ratified with an oath

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 He <I>lifts up his hand to heaven,</I> the habitation of his holiness;
 this was an ancient and very significant sign used in swearing, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:22">Gen. xiv. 22</A>.

 And, since he could swear by no greater, he swears by himself and his
 own life. Those are miserable without remedy that have the word and 
 oath of God against them. The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, 
 that the sin of sinners shall be their ruin if they go on in it. 

 2.  Preparation is made for the execution: The <I>glittering sword is
 whet.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12">Ps. vii. 12</A>.

 It is a sword <I>bathed in heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa.  xxxiv. 5</A>.

 While the sword is in whetting, space is given to the sinner to repent
 and make his peace, which, if he neglects, will render the wound the 
 deeper. And, as the sword is whet, so the hand that is to wield it 
 takes hold on judgment with a resolution to go through with it.

 3. The execution itself will be very terrible: The <I>sword shall
 devour flesh</I> in abundance, and the <I>arrows</I> be made <I>drunk 
 with blood,</I> such vast quantities of it shall be shed, the blood of 
 the slain in battle, and of the captives, to whom no quarter shall be 
 given, but who shall be put under military execution. When he begins 
 revenge he will make an end; for in this also his work is perfect. The 
 critics are much perplexed with the last clause, <I>From the beginning 
 of revenges upon the enemy.</I> The learned bishop Patrick (that great 
 master) thinks it may admit this reading, <I>From the king to the slave 
 of the enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:35-37">Jer. l. 35-37</A>.

 When the sword of God's wrath is drawn it will make bloody work, blood
 to the horse-bridles, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:20">Rev.  xiv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Comfort to his own people 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Rejoice, O you nations, with his people.</I> He concludes the song
 with words of joy; for in God's Israel there is a remnant whose end 
 will be peace. God's people will rejoice at last, will rejoice 
 everlastingly. Three things are here mentioned as the matter of joy:--

 1.  The enlarging of the church's bounds. The apostle applies the first
 words of this verse to the conversion of the Gentiles.
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:10">Rom. xv. 10</A>,

 <I>Rejoice you Gentiles with his people.</I> See what the grace of God 
 does in the conversion of souls, it brings them to rejoice with the 
 people of God; for true religion brings us acquainted with true joy, so 
 great a mistake are those under that think it tends to make men 
 melancholy. 

 2. The avenging of the church's controversies upon her adversaries. He
 will make inquisition for <I>the blood of his servants,</I> and it 
 shall appear how precious it is to him; for those that spilt it shall 
 have blood given them to drink. 

 3. The mercy God has in store for his church, and for all that belong
 to it: He will be <I>merciful to his land, and to his people,</I> that 
 is, to all every where that fear and serve him.  Whatever judgments are 
 brought upon sinners, it shall go well with the people of God; in this 
 let Jews and Gentiles rejoice together.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
 ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
 &nbsp; 45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
 Israel:
 &nbsp; 46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
 which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your
 children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
 &nbsp; 47 For it <I>is</I> not a vain thing for you; because it <I>is</I> your
 life: and through this thing ye shall prolong <I>your</I> days in the
 land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
 &nbsp; 48 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
 &nbsp; 49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, <I>unto</I> mount Nebo,
 which <I>is</I> in the land of Moab, that <I>is</I> over against Jericho;
 and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
 Israel for a possession:
 &nbsp; 50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
 unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was
 gathered unto his people:
 &nbsp; 51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of
 Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
 because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 52 Yet thou shalt see the land before <I>thee;</I> but thou shalt
 not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The solemn delivery of this song to the children of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>.

 Moses spoke it to as many as could hear him, while Joshua, in another
 assembly, at the same time, delivered it to as many as his voice would 
 reach. Thus coming to them from the mouth of both their governors, 
 Moses who was laying down the government, and Joshua who was taking it 
 up, they would see they were both in the same mind, and that, though 
 they changed their commander, there was no change in the divine 
 command; Joshua, as well as Moses, would be a witness against them if 
 ever they forsook God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An earnest charge to them to mind these and all the rest of the
 good words that Moses had said to them. How earnestly does he long 
 after them all, how very desirous that the word of God might make deep 
 and lasting impressions upon them, how jealous over them with a godly 
 jealousy, lest they should at any time let slip these great things!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duties he charges upon them are, 

 (1.) Carefully to attend to these themselves: "Set your hearts both to
 the laws, and to the promises and threatenings, the blessings and 
 curses, and now at last to this song. Let the mind be closely applied 
 to the consideration of these things; be affected with them; be intent 
 upon your duty, and cleave to it with full purpose of heart."

 (2.) Faithfully to transmit these things to those that should come
 after them: "What interest you have in your children, or influence upon 
 them, use it for this purpose; and <I>command them</I> (as your father 
 Abraham did,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>)

 <I>to observe to do all the words of this law.</I>" Those that are good
 themselves cannot but desire that their children may be so likewise, 
 and that posterity may keep up religion in their day and the entail of 
 it may not be cut off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The arguments he uses to persuade them to make religion their 
 business and to persevere in it are, 

 (1.) The vast importance of the things themselves which he had charged
 upon them

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 "<I>It is not a vain thing, because it is your life.</I> It is not an
 indifferent thing, but of absolute necessity; it is not a trifle, but a 
 matter of consequence, a matter of life and death; mind it, and you are 
 made for ever; neglect it, and you are for ever undone." O that men 
 were but fully persuaded of this, that religion is their life, even the 
 life of their souls!

 (2.) The vast advantage it would be of to them: <I>Through this thing
 you shall prolong your days</I> in Canaan, which is a typical promise 
 of that eternal life which Christ has assured us those shall enter into 
 that keep the commandments of God,

 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:17">Matt. xix. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Orders given to Moses concerning his death. Now that this renowned 
 witness for God had finished his testimony, he must go up to Mount Nebo 
 and die; in the prophecy of Christ's two witnesses there is a plain 
 allusion to Moses and Elias 
 
 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Rev. xi. 6</A>),

 and perhaps their removal, being by martyrdom, is no less glorious than
 the removal either of Moses or Elias. Orders were given to Moses that 
 self-same day, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 Now that he had done his work, why should he desire to live a day
 longer? He had indeed formerly prayed that he might go over Jordan, but 
 now he is entirely satisfied, and, as God had bidden him, <I>saith no 
 more of that matter.</I>

 1. God here reminds him of the sin he had been guilty of, for which he 
 was excluded Canaan

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 that he might the more patiently bear the rebuke because he had sinned,
 and that now he might renew his sorrow for that unadvised word, for it 
 is good for the best of men to die repenting of the infirmities they 
 are conscious to themselves of. It was an omission that was thus 
 displeasing to God; he did <I>not sanctify God,</I> as he ought to have 
 done, <I>before the children of Israel,</I> he did not carry himself 
 with a due decorum in executing the orders he had then received. 

 2. He reminds him of the death of his brother Aaron

 (<A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),

 to make his own the more familiar and the less formidable. Note, It is
 a great encouragement to us, when we die, to think of our friends that 
 have gone before us through that darksome valley, especially of Christ, 
 our elder brother and great high priest. 

 3. He sends him up to a high hill, thence to take a view of the land of
 Canaan and then die, 
 
 <A HREF="https://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>.

 The remembrance of his sin might make death terrible, but the sight God
 gave him of Canaan took off the terror of it, as it was a token of 
 God's being reconciled to him, and a plain indication to him that 
 though his sin shut him out of the earthly Canaan, yet it should not 
 deprive him of that better country which in this world can only be 
 seen, and that with an eye of faith.  Note, Those may die with comfort 
 and ease whenever God calls for them (notwithstanding the sins they 
 remember against themselves) who have a believing prospect and a 
 well-grounded hope of eternal life beyond death.</P>
