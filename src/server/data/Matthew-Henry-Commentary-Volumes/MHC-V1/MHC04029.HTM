 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And in the seventh month, on the first <I>day</I> of the month, ye
 shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it
 is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.
 &nbsp; 2 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; one young bullock, one ram, <I>and</I> seven lambs of the
 first year without blemish:

 atonement for you:
 &nbsp; 6 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat
 offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering,
 and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a

 &nbsp; 7 And ye shall have on the tenth <I>day</I> of this seventh month an
 holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not
 do any work <I>therein:</I>
 &nbsp; 8 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> a
 sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, <I>and</I> seven lambs of

 &nbsp; 10 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven
 lambs:

 offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the
 meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There were more sacred solemnities in the seventh month than in any 
 other month of the year, not only because it had been the first month 
 till the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt (which, falling in the 
 month Abib, occasioned that to be thenceforth made the <I>beginning of 
 the months</I> in all ecclesiastical computations), but because still 
 it continued the first month in the civil reckonings of the jubilees 
 and years of release, and also because it was the time of vacation 
 between harvest and seedtime, when they had most leisure to attend the 
 sanctuary, which intimates that, though God will dispense with 
 sacrifices in consideration of works of necessity and mercy, yet the 
 more leisure we have from the pressing occasions of this life the more 
 time we should spend in the immediate service of God. 

 1. We have here the appointment of the sacrifices that were to be
 offered on the first day of the month, the day of <I>blowing the 
 trumpets,</I> which was a preparative for the two great solemnities of 
 holy mourning on the day of atonement and of holy joy in the feast of 
 tabernacles. The intention of divine institutions is well answered when 
 one religious service helps to fit us for another and all for heaven. 
 The <I>blowing of the trumpets</I> was appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:24">Lev. xxiii. 24</A>.

 Here the people are directed what sacrifices to offer on that day, of
 which there was not then any mention made. Note, Those who would know 
 the mind of God in the scripture must compare one part of the scripture 
 with another, and put those parts together that have reference to the 
 same thing, for the latter discoveries of divine light explain what was 
 dark and supply what was defective in the former, <I>that the man of 
 God may be perfect.</I> The sacrifices then to be offered are 
 particularly ordered here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:2-6"><I>v.</I> 2-6</A>),

 and care taken that these should not supersede the daily oblation and 
 that of the new moon. It is hereby intimated that we must not seek 
 occasions to abate our zeal in God's service, nor be glad of an excuse 
 to omit a good duty, but rather rejoice in an opportunity of 
 accumulating and doing more than ordinary in religion. If we perform 
 family-worship, we must not think that this will excuse us from our 
 secret devotions; nor that on the days we go to church we need not 
 worship God alone and with our families; but we should <I>always abound 
 in the work of the Lord.</I>

 2. On the <I>day of atonement.</I> Besides all the services of that 
 day, which we had the institution of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:1-34">Lev. xvi.</A>,

 and which, one would think, required trouble and charge enough, here
 are burnt-offerings ordered to be offered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 For in our faith and repentance, those two great gospel graces which
 were signified by that day's performances, we must have an eye to the 
 glory and honour of God, which was purely intended in the 
 burnt-offerings; there was likewise to be a <I>kid of the goats for a 
 sin-offering, besides the great sin-offering of atonement</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>),

 which intimates that there are so many defects and faults, even in the 
 exercises and expressions of our repentance, that we have need of an 
 interest in a sacrifice to expiate the guilt even of that part of our 
 holy things. Though we must not repent that we have repented, yet we 
 must repent that we have not repented better. It likewise intimated the 
 imperfection of the legal sacrifices, and their insufficiency to take 
 away sin, that on the very day the <I>sin-offering of atonement</I> was 
 offered, yet there must be another sin-offering. But <I>what the law 
 could not do, in that it was weak,</I> that Christ has done.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have
 an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
 keep a feast unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> seven days:
 &nbsp; 13 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by
 fire, of a sweet savour unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; thirteen young bullocks,
 two rams, <I>and</I> fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
 without blemish:
 &nbsp; 14 And their meat offering <I>shall be of</I> flour mingled with
 oil, three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen
 bullocks, two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,
 &nbsp; 15 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:
 &nbsp; 16 And one kid of the goats <I>for</I> a sin offering; beside the
 continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
 offering.
 &nbsp; 17 And on the second day <I>ye shall offer</I> twelve young
 bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without
 spot:
 &nbsp; 18 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

 &nbsp; 20 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen

 &nbsp; 23 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, <I>and</I> fourteen
 lambs of the first year without blemish:
 &nbsp; 24 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

 &nbsp; 26 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, <I>and</I> fourteen
 lambs of the first year without spot:
 &nbsp; 27 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

 &nbsp; 29 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, <I>and</I>

 &nbsp; 35 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall

 &nbsp; 36 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by

 Soon after the day of atonement, that day in which men were to afflict 
 their souls, followed the feast of tabernacles, in which they were to 
 rejoice before the Lord; for those that <I>sow in tears</I> shall soon 
 <I>reap in joy.</I> To the former laws about this feast, which we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34-44">Lev. xxiii. 34</A>,

 &c., here are added directions about the <I>offerings by
 fire,</I> which they were to offer unto the Lord during the <I>seven 
 days of that feast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+33:36">Lev. xxiii. 36</A>.

 Observe here,

 1. Their days of rejoicing were to be days of sacrifices. A disposition
 to be cheerful does us no harm, nor is any bad symptom, when it is so 
 far from unfitting us for the duties of God's immediate service that it 
 encourages and enlarges our hearts in them. 

 2. All the days of their dwelling in booths they must offer sacrifices. 
 While we are here in a tabernacle-state, it is our interest as well as 
 duty constantly to keep up communion with God; nor will the 
 unsettledness of our outward condition excuse us in our neglect of the 
 duties of God's worship. 

 3.  The sacrifices for each of the seven days, though differing in 
 nothing but the number of the bullocks, are severally and particularly 
 appointed, which yet is no vain repetition; for God would thus teach 
 them to be very exact in those observances, and to keep an eye of faith 
 fixed upon the institution in every day's work. It likewise intimates 
 that the repetition of the same services, if performed with an upright 
 heart, and with a continued fire of pious and devout affection, is no 
 weariness to God, and therefore we ought not to snuff at it, or to say, 
 <I>Behold, what a weariness it is to us!</I> 

 4. The number of bullocks (which were the most costly part of the
 sacrifice) decreased every day.  On the first day of the feast they 
 were to offer thirteen, on the second day but twelve, on the third day 
 eleven, &c. So that on the seventh they offered seven; and the last 
 day, though it was the great day of the feast, and celebrated with a 
 holy convocation, yet they were to offer but one bullock; and, whereas 
 on all the other days they offered two rams and fourteen lambs, on this 
 they offered but one ram and seven lambs. Such was the will of the 
 Law-maker, and that is reason enough for the law. Some suggest that God 
 herein considered the infirmity of the flesh, which is apt to grudge 
 the charge and expense of religion; it is therefore ordered to grow 
 less and less, that they might not complain as if God had <I>made them 
 to serve with an offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23">Isa. xliii. 23</A>.

 Or it is hereby intimated to them that the legal dispensation should
 wax old, and vanish away at last; and the multitude of their sacrifices 
 should end in one great sacrifice, infinitely more worthy than all of 
 them. It was on the last day of the feast, after all these sacrifices 
 had been ordered, that our Lord Jesus stood and cried to those who 
 still thirsted after righteousness (being sensible of the insufficiency 
 of these sacrifices to justify them) <I>to come unto him and drink,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">John vii. 37</A>.

 5. The meat-offerings and drink-offerings attended all the sacrifices,
 <I>according to their number, after the manner.</I> Be there ever so 
 much flesh, it is no feast without bread and drink, therefore these 
 must never be omitted at God's altar, which was his table. We must not 
 think that doing much in religion will be accepted if we do not do it 
 well, and after the manner that God has appointed. 

 6. Every day there must be a sin-offering presented, as we observed in
 the other feasts.  Our burnt-offerings of praise cannot be accepted of 
 God unless we have an interest in the great sacrifice of propitiation 
 which Christ offered when for us he made himself a sin-offering. 

 7.  Even when all these sacrifices were offered, yet the continual
 burnt-offering must not be omitted either morning or evening, but each 
 day this must be offered first in the morning and last in the evening.  
 No extraordinary services should jostle out our stated devotions. 

 8.  Though all these sacrifices were required to be presented by the
 body of the congregation, at the common charge, yet, besides these, 
 particular persons were to glorify God with their vows and their 
 free-will offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 When God commanded that this <I>they must do,</I> he left room for the
 generosity of their devotion, a great deal more they <I>might do,</I> 
 not inventing other worships, but abounding in these, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:23,24">2 Chron. xxx. 23, 24</A>.

 Large directions had been given in Leviticus concerning the offerings
 of all sorts that should be brought by particular persons according to 
 the providences of God concerning them and the graces of God in them. 
 Though every Israelite had an interest in these common sacrifices, yet 
 he must not think that these will serve instead of his vows and his 
 free-will offerings. Thus our ministers' praying with us and for us 
 will not excuse us from praying for ourselves.</P>
