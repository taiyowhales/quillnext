 This chapter gives us an account of the solemn consecration of Aaron 
 and his sons to the priest's office. 

 I. It was done publicly, and the congregation was called together to be
 witnesses of it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Moses, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
 anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams,
 and a basket of unleavened bread;
 &nbsp; 3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door
 of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 4 And Moses did as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded him; and the assembly was
 gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This <I>is</I> the thing
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded to be done.
 &nbsp; 6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
 water.
 &nbsp; 7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
 and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he
 girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound <I>it</I>
 unto him therewith.
 &nbsp; 8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
 breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
 &nbsp; 9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre,
 <I>even</I> upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
 crown; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the
 tabernacle and all that <I>was</I> therein, and sanctified them.
 &nbsp; 11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
 anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
 foot, to sanctify them.
 &nbsp; 12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
 anointed him, to sanctify him.
 &nbsp; 13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
 girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had given Moses orders to consecrate Aaron and his sons to the 
 priests' office, when he was with him the first time upon mount Sinai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:1-29:46">Exod. xxviii. and xxix.</A>,

 where we have also the particular instructions he had how to do it. Now
 here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders repeated. What was there commanded to be done is here 
 commanded to be done <I>now,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 The tabernacle was newly set up, which, without the priests, would be 
 as a candlestick without a candle; the law concerning sacrifices was 
 newly given, but could not be observed without priests; for, though 
 Aaron and his sons had been nominated to the office, they could not 
 officiate, till they were consecrated, which yet must not be done till 
 the place of their ministration was prepared, and the ordinances were 
 instituted, that they might apply themselves to work as soon as ever 
 they were consecrated, and might know that they were ordained, not only 
 to the honour and profit, but to the business of the priesthood. Aaron 
 and his sons were near relations to Moses, and therefore he would not 
 consecrate them till he had further orders, lest he should seem too 
 forward to bring honour into his family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The congregation called together, <I>at the door,</I> that is, in 
 the court <I>of the tabernacle,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The elders and principal men of the congregation, who represented the 
 body of the people, were summoned to attend; for the court would hold 
 but a few of the many thousands of Israel. It was done thus publicly,

 1. Because it was a solemn transaction between God and Israel; the
 priests were to be <I>ordained for men in things pertaining to God,</I> 
 for the maintaining of a settled correspondence, and the negotiating of 
 all affairs between the people and God; and therefore it was fit that 
 both sides should appear, to own the appointment, at the door of the 
 tabernacle of meeting. 

 2. The spectators of the solemnity could not but be possessed, by the 
 sight of it, with a great veneration for the priests and their office, 
 which was necessary among a people so wretchedly prone as these were to 
 envy and discontent. It was strange that any of those who were 
 witnesses of what was here done should afterwards say, as some of them 
 did, <I>You take too much upon you, you sons of Levi;</I> but what 
 would they have said if it had been done clandestinely? Note, It is 
 very fit, and of good use, that ministers should be ordained publicly, 
 <I>plebe praesente--in the presence of the common people,</I> according 
 to the usage of the primitive church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The commission read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Moses, who was God's representative in this solemnity, produced his 
 orders before the congregation: <I>This is the thing which the Lord 
 commanded to be done.</I> Though God had crowned him king in Jeshurun, 
 when he made his face to shine in the sight of all Israel, yet he did 
 not institute or appoint any thing in God's worship but what God 
 himself had commanded. The priesthood he delivered to them was that 
 which he had received from the Lord. Note, All that minister about holy 
 things must have an eye to God's command as their rule and warrant; for 
 it is only in the observance of this that they can expect to be owned 
 and accepted of God. Thus we must be able to say, in all acts of 
 religious worship, <I>This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be 
 done.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The ceremony performed according to the divine ritual. 

 1. Aaron and his sons were <I>washed with water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to signify that they ought now to purify themselves from all sinful 
 dispositions and inclinations, and ever after to keep themselves pure.  
 Christ washes those from their sins in his own blood whom he makes to 
 our God kings and priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6">Rev. i. 5, 6</A>);

 and those that draw near to God must be washed in pure water,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22">Heb. x. 22</A>.

 Though they were ever so clean before and no filth was to be seen upon
 them, yet they must be washed, to signify their purification from sin, 
 with which their souls were polluted, how clean soever their bodies 
 were.

 2. They were clothed with the holy garments, Aaron with his 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>),

 which typified the dignity of Christ our great high priest, and his 
 sons with theirs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which typified the decency of Christians, who are spiritual priests. 
 Christ wears the breast-plate of judgment and the holy crown; for the 
 church's high priest is her prophet and king. All believers are clothed 
 with the robe of righteousness, and girt with the girdle of truth, 
 resolution, and close application; and their heads are <I>bound,</I> as 
 the word here is, with the bonnet or diadem of beauty, the beauty of 
 holiness.

 3. The high priest was anointed, and, it should seem, the holy things
 were anointed at the same time; some think that they were anointed 
 before, but that the anointing of them is mentioned here because Aaron 
 was anointed with the same oil with which they were anointed; but the 
 manner of relating it here makes it more than probable that it was done 
 at the same time, and that the seven days employed in consecrating the 
 altar were coincident with the seven days of the priests' consecration.
 The tabernacle, and all its utensils, had some of the anointing oil put 
 upon them with Moses's finger 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 so had the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 these were to sanctify the gold and the gift 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:17-19">Matt. xxiii. 17-19</A>),

 and therefore must themselves be thus sanctified; but he poured it out
 more plentifully upon the head of Aaron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 so that it ran down to the <I>skirts of his garments,</I> because his 
 unction was to typify the anointing of Christ with the Spirit, which 
 was not given by measure to him. Yet all believers also have received 
 the anointing, which puts an indelible character upon them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron
 and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for
 the sin offering.
 &nbsp; 15 And he slew <I>it;</I> and Moses took the blood, and put <I>it</I>
 upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and
 purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the
 altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
 &nbsp; 16 And he took all the fat that <I>was</I> upon the inwards, and the
 caul <I>above</I> the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
 Moses burned <I>it</I> upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
 burnt with fire without the camp; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
 his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
 &nbsp; 19 And he killed <I>it;</I> and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the
 altar round about.
 &nbsp; 20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head,
 and the pieces, and the fat.
 &nbsp; 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
 burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it <I>was</I> a burnt sacrifice
 for a sweet savour, <I>and</I> an offering made by fire unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
 Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
 &nbsp; 23 And he slew <I>it;</I> and Moses took of the blood of it, and put
 <I>it</I> upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
 right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
 &nbsp; 24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
 the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
 hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
 sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
 &nbsp; 25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that
 <I>was</I> upon the inwards, and the caul <I>above</I> the liver, and the
 two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
 &nbsp; 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that <I>was</I> before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
 and one wafer, and put <I>them</I> on the fat, and upon the right
 shoulder:
 &nbsp; 27 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
 and waved them <I>for</I> a wave offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt <I>them</I>
 on the altar upon the burnt offering: they <I>were</I> consecrations
 for a sweet savour: it <I>is</I> an offering made by fire unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it <I>for</I> a wave
 offering before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: <I>for</I> of the ram of consecration it was
 Moses' part; as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
 <I>was</I> upon the altar, and sprinkled <I>it</I> upon Aaron, <I>and</I> upon
 his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
 him; and sanctified Aaron, <I>and</I> his garments, and his sons, and
 his sons' garments with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The covenant of priesthood must be made by sacrifice, as well as other 
 covenants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5">Ps. l. 5</A>.

 And thus Christ was consecrated by the sacrifice of himself, once for
 all. Sacrifices of each kind must be offered for the priests, that they 
 might with the more tenderness and concern offer the gifts and 
 sacrifices of the people, with compassion on the ignorant, and on 
 <I>those that were out of the way,</I> not insulting over those for 
 whom sacrifices were offered, remembering that they themselves had had 
 sacrifices offered for them, being <I>compassed with infirmity.</I>

 1. A bullock, the largest sacrifice, was offered for a sin-offering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that hereby atonement might be made, and they might not bring any of 
 the guilt of the sins of their former state into the new character they 
 were now to put on. When Isaiah was sent to be a prophet, he was told 
 to his comfort, <I>Thy iniquity is taken away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:7">Isa. vi. 7</A>.

 Ministers, that are to declare the remission of sins to others, should
 give diligence to get it made sure to themselves in the first place 
 that their own sins are pardoned. Those to whom is <I>committed the 
 ministry of reconciliation</I> must first be reconciled to God 
 themselves, that they may deal for the souls of others as for their 
 own.

 2. A ram was offered for a burnt-offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:18-21"><I>v.</I> 18-21</A>.

 By this they gave to God the glory of this great honour which was now 
 put upon them, and returned him praise for it, as Paul thanked Christ 
 Jesus for <I>putting him into the ministry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>.

 They also signified the devoting of themselves and all their services
 to the honour of God.

 3. Another ram, called the <I>ram of consecration,</I> was offered for
 a peace-offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>,

 &c. The blood of it was part put on the priests, on their ears, thumbs, 
 and toes, and part sprinkled upon the altar; and thus he did (as it 
 were) marry them to the altar, upon which they must all their days give 
 attendance. All the ceremonies about this offering, as those before, 
 were appointed by the express command of God; and, if we compare this 
 chapter with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:1-46">Exod. xxix</A>,

 we shall find that the performance of the solemnity exactly agrees with
 the precept there, and in nothing varies. Here, therefore, as in the
 account we had of the tabernacle and its vessels, it is again and again 
 repeated, <I>As the Lord commanded Moses.</I> And thus Christ, when he 
 sanctified himself with his own blood, had an eye to his Father's will 
 in it. <I>As the Father gave me commandment so I do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:31,Joh+10:18,Joh+6:38">John xiv. 31; 
 x. 18; vi. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh
 <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there
 eat it with the bread that <I>is</I> in the basket of consecrations,
 as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
 &nbsp; 32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
 ye burn with fire.
 &nbsp; 33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation <I>in</I> seven days, until the days of your consecration
 be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
 &nbsp; 34 As he hath done this day, <I>so</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded to
 do, to make an atonement for you.
 &nbsp; 35 Therefore shall ye abide <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle of
 the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
 &nbsp; 36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded by the hand of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses, having done his part of the ceremony, now leaves Aaron and his 
 sons to do theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must boil the flesh of their peace-offering, and eat it in the 
 court of the tabernacle, and what remained they must burn with fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 This signified their thankful consent to the consecration: when God 
 gave Ezekiel his commission, he told him to eat the roll, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:1,2">Ezek. iii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They must not stir out of the court of the tabernacle for seven 
 days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The priesthood being a good warfare, they must thus learn to endure 
 hardness, and to disentangle themselves from the affairs of this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:3,4">2 Tim. ii. 3, 4</A>.

 Being consecrated to their service, they must <I>give themselves wholly
 to it,</I> and <I>attend continually to this very thing.</I> Thus 
 Christ's apostles were appointed to <I>wait for the promise of the 
 Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:4">Acts i. 4</A>.

 During this time appointed for their consecration, they were daily to
 repeat the same sacrifices which were offered the first day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 This shows the imperfection of the legal sacrifices, which, because
 they could not take away sin, were often repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1,2">Heb. x. 1, 2</A>),

 but were here repeated seven times (a number of perfection), because 
 they typified that <I>one offering, which perfected for ever those that 
 were sanctified.</I> The work lasted seven days; for it was a kind of 
 creation: and this time was appointed in honour of the sabbath, which, 
 probably, was the last day of the seven, for which they were to prepare 
 during the six days. Thus the time of our life, like the six days, must 
 be our preparation for the perfection of our consecration to God in the 
 everlasting sabbath: they attended <I>day and night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 and so constant should we be in our meditation on God's law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:2">Ps. i. 2</A>.

 They attended to <I>keep the charge of the Lord:</I> we have every one
 of us a charge to keep, an eternal God to glorify, an immortal soul to 
 provide for, needful duty to be done, our generation to serve; and it 
 must be our daily care to keep this charge, for it is the charge of the 
 Lord our Master, who will shortly call us to an account about it, and 
 it is at our utmost peril if we neglect it. Keep it <I>that you die 
 not;</I> it is death, eternal death, to betray the trust we are charged 
 with; by the consideration of this we must be kept in awe. 
 <I>Lastly,</I> We are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 that <I>Aaron and his sons did all that was commanded.</I> Thus their 
 consecration was completed; and thus they set an example before the 
 people of an exact obedience to the laws of sacrifices now newly given, 
 and then they could with the better grace teach them. Thus the 
 <I>covenant of peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:12">Num. xxv. 12</A>),

 <I>of life and peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:5">Mal. ii. 5</A>),

 was made with Aaron and his sons; but after all the ceremonies that
 were used in their consecration there was one point of ratification 
 which was reserved to be the honour and establishment of Christ's 
 priesthood, which was this, that they were <I>made priests without an 
 oath, but Christ with an oath</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+7:21">Hab. vii. 21</A>),

 for neither such priests nor their priesthood could continue, but
 Christ's is a perpetual and unchangeable priesthood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Gospel ministers are compared to those who served at the altar, for 
 they <I>minister about holy things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13">1 Cor. ix. 13</A>),

 they are God's mouth to the people and the people's to God, the pastors
 and teachers Christ has appointed to continue in the church to the end 
 of the world: they seem to be meant in that promise which points at 
 gospel times

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:21">Isa. lvi. 21</A>),

 <I>I will take of them for priests and for Levites.</I> No man may take
 this honour to himself, but he who upon trial is found to be clothed 
 and anointed by the Spirit of God with gifts and graces to qualify him 
 for it, and who with purpose of heart devotes himself entirely to the 
 service, and is then by the <I>word and prayer</I> (for so every thing 
 is sanctified), and the imposition of the hands of those that <I>give 
 themselves to the word and prayer,</I> set apart to the office, and 
 recommended to Christ as a servant and to the church as a steward and 
 guide. And those that are thus solemnly dedicated to God ought not to 
 depart from his service, but faithfully to abide in it all their days; 
 and those that do so, and continue <I>labouring in the word and 
 doctrine,</I> are to be accounted <I>worthy of double honour,</I> 
 double to that of the Old-Testament priests.</P>
