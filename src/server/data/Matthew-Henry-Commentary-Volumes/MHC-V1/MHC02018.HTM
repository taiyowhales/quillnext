 This chapter is concerning Moses himself, and the affairs of his own
 family. 

 I. Jethro his father-in-law brings to him his wife and children,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. Moses entertains his father-in-law with great respect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:7">ver. 7</A>),

 with good discourse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>),

 with a sacrifice and a feast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12">ver. 12</A>.

 III. Jethro advises him about the management of his business as a judge
 in Israel, to take inferior judges in to his assistance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:13-23">ver. 13-23</A>),

 and Moses, after some time, takes his counsel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:24-26">ver. 24-26</A>),

 and so they part,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:27">ver. 27</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law,
 heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his
 people, <I>and</I> that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had brought Israel out of Egypt;
 &nbsp; 2 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses'
 wife, after he had sent her back,
 &nbsp; 3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one <I>was</I> Gershom;
 for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:
 &nbsp; 4 And the name of the other <I>was</I> Eliezer; for the God of my
 father, <I>said he, was</I> mine help, and delivered me from the sword
 of Pharaoh:
 &nbsp; 5 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
 wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
 mount of God:
 &nbsp; 6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
 unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This incident may very well be allowed to have happened as it is placed 
 here, before the giving of the law, and not, as some place it, in 
 connection with what is recorded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:11,29">Num. x. 11, 29</A>,

 &c. Sacrifices were offered before; in these mentioned here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 it is observable that <I>Jethro</I> is said to take them, not
 <I>Aaron.</I> And as to Jethro's advising Moses to constitute judges
 under him, though it is intimate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that the occasion of his giving that advice was <I>on the morrow,</I> 
 yet it does not follow but that Moses's settlement of that affair might 
 be some time after, when the law was given, as it is placed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:9">Deut. i. 9</A>.

 It is plain that Jethro himself would not have him make this alteration 
 in the government till he had received instructions from God about it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 which he did not till some time after. Jethro comes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To congratulate the happiness of Israel, and particularly the honour 
 of Moses his son-in-law; and now Jethro thinks himself well paid for 
 all the kindness he had shown to Moses in his distress, and his 
 daughter better matched than he could have expected. Jethro could not 
 but hear what all the country rang of, the glorious appearances of God 
 for his people Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 and he comes to enquire, and inform himself more fully thereof (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2">Ps. cxi. 2</A>),

 and to rejoice with them as one that had a true respect both for them
 and for their God. Though he, as a Midianite, was not to share with 
 them in the promised land, yet he shared with them in the joy of their 
 deliverance. We may thus make the comforts of others our own, by taking 
 pleasure, as God does, in the <I>prosperity of the righteous.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To bring Moses's wife and children to him. It seems, he had sent 
 them back, probably from the inn where his wife's aversion to the 
 circumcision of her son had like to have cost him his life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:25"><I>ch.</I> iv. 25</A>);

 fearing lest they should prove a further hindrance, he sent them home 
 to his father-in-law. He foresaw what discouragements he was likely to 
 meet with in the court of Pharaoh, and therefore would not take any 
 with him in his own family. He was of that tribe that said to his 
 father, <I>I have not known him,</I> when service was to be done for 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Thus Christ's disciples, when they were to go upon an expedition not
 much unlike that of Moses, were to forsake <I>wife and children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:29">Matt. xix. 29</A>.

 But though there might be reason for the separation that was between
 Moses and his wife for a time, yet they must come together again, as 
 soon as ever they could with any convenience. It is the law of the 
 relation. <I>You husbands, dwell with your wives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1 Pet. iii. 7</A>.

 Jethro, we may suppose, was glad of his daughter's company, and fond of 
 her children, yet he would not keep her from her husband, nor them from 
 their father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Moses must have his family with him, that while he ruled the church of 
 God he might set a good example of prudence in family-government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:5">1 Tim. iii. 5</A>.

 Moses had now a great deal both of honour and care put upon him, and it
 was fit that his wife should be with him to share with him in both. 
 Notice is taken of the significant names of his two sons. 

 1. The eldest was called <I>Gershom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>a stranger,</I> Moses designing thereby, not only a memorial of his 
 own condition, but a memorandum to his son of his condition also: for 
 we are all strangers upon earth, as all our fathers were. Moses had a 
 great uncle almost of the same name, <I>Gershon, a stranger;</I> for 
 though he was born in Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:11">Gen. xlvi. 11</A>),

 yet even there the patriarchs confessed themselves strangers.

 2. The other he called <I>Eliezer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>My God a help,</I> as we translate it; it looks back to his 
 deliverance from Pharaoh, when he made his escape, after the slaying of 
 the Egyptian; but, if this was (as some think) the son that was 
 circumcised at the inn as he was going, I would rather translate it so 
 as to look forward, which the original will bear, <I>The Lord is my 
 help, and will deliver me</I> from the sword of Pharaoh, which he had 
 reason to expect would be drawn against him when he was going to fetch 
 Israel out of bondage. Note, When we are undertaking any difficult 
 service for God and our generation, it is good for us to encourage 
 ourselves in God as our help: he that has delivered does and will 
 deliver.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
 obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of <I>their</I>
 welfare; and they came into the tent.
 &nbsp; 8 And Moses told his father in law all that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had done
 unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, <I>and</I> all
 the travail that had come upon them by the way, and <I>how</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered them.
 &nbsp; 9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
 Egyptians.
 &nbsp; 10 And Jethro said, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who hath delivered
 you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
 Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the
 Egyptians.
 &nbsp; 11 Now I know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> greater than all gods: for in
 the thing wherein they dealt proudly <I>he was</I> above them.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
 sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel,
 to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. The kind greeting that took place between Moses and his 
 father-in-law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Though Moses was a prophet of the Lord, a great prophet, and king in 
 Jeshurun, yet he showed a very humble respect to his father-in-law. 
 However God in his providence is pleased to advance us, we must make 
 conscience of giving honour to whom honour is due, and never look with 
 disdain upon our poor relations. Those that stand high in the favour of 
 God are not thereby discharged from the duty they owe to men, nor will 
 that justify them in a stately haughty carriage. Moses went out to meet 
 Jethro, did <I>homage to him, and kissed him.</I> Religion does not 
 destroy good manners. <I>They asked each other of their welfare.</I> 
 Even the kind How-do-you-do's that pass between them are taken notice 
 of, as the expressions and improvements of mutual love and 
 friendship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The narrative that Moses gave his father-in-law of the great things 
 God had done for Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This was one thing Jethro came for, to know more fully and particularly 
 what he had heard the general report of. Note, Conversation concerning 
 <I>God's wondrous works</I> is profitable conversation; it is <I>good, 
 and to the use of edifying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:2">Ps. cv. 2</A>.

 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:11,12">Ps. cxlv. 11, 12</A>.

 Asking and telling news, and discoursing of it, are not only an 
 allowable entertainment of conversation, but are capable of being tuned 
 to a very good account, by taking notice of God's providence, and the 
 operations and tendencies of that providence, in all occurrences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The impressions this narrative made upon Jethro. 

 1. He congratulated God's Israel: <I>Jethro rejoiced,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He not only rejoiced in the honour done to his son-in-law, but in 
 <I>all the goodness done to Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, Public blessings are the joy of public spirits. While the 
 Israelites were themselves murmuring, notwithstanding all God's 
 goodness to them, here was a Midianite rejoicing. This was not the only 
 time that the faith of the Gentiles shamed the unbelief of the Jews; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10">Matt. viii. 10</A>.

 Standers-by were more affected with the favours God had shown to Israel
 than those were that received them.

 2. He gave the glory to Israel's God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Blessed be Jehovah</I>" (for by that name he is now known), "<I>who 
 hath delivered you,</I> Moses and Aaron, <I>out of the hand of 
 Pharaoh,</I> so that though he designed your death he could not effect 
 it, and by your ministry has <I>delivered the people.</I>" Note, 
 Whatever we have the joy of God must have the praise of. 

 3. His faith was hereby confirmed, and he took this occasion to make a 
 solemn profession of it: <I>Now know I that Jehovah is greater than all 
 gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Observe, 

 (1.) The matter of his faith: that the God of Israel is greater than
 all pretenders, all false and counterfeit-deities, that usurp divine 
 honours; he silences them, subdues them, and is too hard for them all, 
 and therefore is himself the only <I>living and true God.</I> He is 
 also higher than all princes and potentates (who are called gods), and 
 has both an incontestable authority over them and an irresistible power 
 to control and over-rule them; he manages them all as he pleases, and 
 gets honour upon them, how great soever they are.

 (2.) The confirmation and improvement of his faith: <I>Now know I;</I>
 he knew it before, but now he knew it better; his faith great up to a 
 full assurance, upon this fresh evidence. Those obstinately shut their 
 eyes against the clearest light who do not know that <I>the Lord is 
 greater than all gods.</I> 

 (3.) The ground and reason upon which he built it: <I>For wherein they
 dealt proudly,</I> the magicians, and the idols which the Egyptians 
 worshipped, or Pharaoh and his grandees (they both opposed God and set 
 up in competition with him), <I>he was above them.</I> The magicians 
 were baffled, the idols shaken, Pharaoh humbled, his powers broken, 
 and, in spite of all their confederacies, God's Israel was rescued out 
 of their hands. Note, Sooner or later, God will show himself above 
 those that by their proud dealings contest with him. He that <I>exalts 
 himself</I> against God <I>shall be abased.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The expressions of their joy and thankfulness. They had communion 
 with each other both in a feast and in a sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Jethro, being hearty in Israel's interests, was cheerfully admitted 
 though a Midianite, into fellowship with Moses and the elders of 
 Israel, <I>forasmuch as he also was a son of Abraham,</I> though of a 
 younger house. 

 1. They joined in a sacrifice of thanksgiving: <I>Jethro took burnt 
 offerings for God,</I> and probably offered them himself, for he was a 
 priest in Midian, and a worshipper of the true God, and the priesthood 
 was not yet settled in Israel. Note, Mutual friendship is sanctified by 
 joint-worship. It is a very good thing for relations and friends, when 
 they come together, to join in the spiritual sacrifice of prayer and 
 praise, as those that meet in Christ the centre of unity. 

 2. They joined in a feast of rejoicing, a feast upon the sacrifice.
 Moses, upon this occasion, invited his relations and friends to an 
 entertainment in his own tent, a laudable usage among friends, and 
 which Christ himself, not only warranted, but recommended, by his 
 acceptance of such invitations. This was a temperate feast: <I>They did 
 eat bread;</I> this bread, we may suppose, was manna. Jethro must see 
 and taste that bread from heaven, and, though a Gentile, is as welcome 
 to it as any Israelite; the Gentiles still are so to Christ the bread 
 of life. It was a feast kept after a godly sort: <I>They did eat bread 
 before God,</I> soberly, thankfully, in the fear of God; and their 
 table-talk was such as became saints. Thus we must eat and drink to the 
 glory of God, behaving ourselves at our tables as those who believe 
 that God's eye is upon us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge
 the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
 the evening.
 &nbsp; 14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
 people, he said, What <I>is</I> this thing that thou doest to the
 people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand
 by thee from morning unto even?
 &nbsp; 15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people
 come unto me to enquire of God:
 &nbsp; 16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
 between one and another, and I do make <I>them</I> know the statutes
 of God, and his laws.
 &nbsp; 17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
 doest <I>is</I> not good.
 &nbsp; 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that
 <I>is</I> with thee: for this thing <I>is</I> too heavy for thee; thou art
 not able to perform it thyself alone.
 &nbsp; 19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
 shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou
 mayest bring the causes unto God:
 &nbsp; 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt
 show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
 must do.
 &nbsp; 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
 such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
 <I>such</I> over them, <I>to be</I> rulers of thousands, <I>and</I> rulers of
 hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
 &nbsp; 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall
 be, <I>that</I> every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but
 every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
 thyself, and they shall bear <I>the burden</I> with thee.
 &nbsp; 23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee <I>so,</I> then
 thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go
 to their place in peace.
 &nbsp; 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and
 did all that he had said.
 &nbsp; 25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
 heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,
 rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
 &nbsp; 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
 they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
 themselves.
 &nbsp; 27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
 into his own land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The great zeal and industry of Moses as a magistrate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Having been employed to redeem Israel out of the house of bondage, 
 herein he is a further type of Christ, that he is employed as a 
 lawgiver and a judge among them. 

 (1.) He was to answer enquiries, to acquaint them with the will of God
 in doubtful cases, and to explain the laws of God that were already 
 given them, concerning the sabbath, the man, &c., beside the laws of 
 nature, relating both to piety and equity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>They came to enquire of God;</I> and happy it was for them that they 
 had such an oracle to consult: we are ready to wish, many a time, that 
 we had some such certain way of knowing God's mind when we are at a 
 loss what to do. Moses was faithful both to him that appointed him and 
 to those that consulted him, and made them <I>know the statutes of God 
 and his laws,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 His business was, not to make laws, but to make known God's laws; his 
 place was but that of a servant. 

 (2.) He was to decide controversies, and determine matters in variance,
 judging between a man and his fellow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And, if the people were as quarrelsome one with another as they were 
 with God, no doubt he had a great many causes brought before him, and 
 the more because their trials put them to no expense, nor was the law 
 costly to them. When a quarrel happened in Egypt, and Moses would have 
 reconciled the contenders, they asked, <I>Who made thee a prince and a 
 judge?</I> But now it was past dispute that God had made him one; and 
 they humbly attend him whom they had then proudly rejected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Such was the business Moses was called to, and it appears that he 
 did it, 

 (1.) With great consideration, which, some think, is intimated in his
 posture: he <I>sat</I> to judge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 composed and sedate.

 (2.) With great condescension to the people, who stood <I>by him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He was very easy of access; the meanest Israelite was welcome himself 
 to bring his cause before him. 

 (3.) With great constancy and closeness of application.

 [1.] Though Jethro, his father-in-law, was with him, which might have
 given him a good pretence for a vacation (he might have adjourned the 
 court for that day, or at least have shortened it), yet he sat, even 
 the next day after his coming, <I>from morning till evening.</I> Note, 
 Necessary business must always take place of ceremonious attentions. It 
 is too great a compliment to our friends to prefer the enjoyment of 
 their company before our duty to God, which ought to be done, while yet 
 the other is not left undone. 

 [2.] Though Moses was advanced to great honour, yet he did not
 therefore take his case and throw upon others the burden of care and 
 business; no, he thought his preferment, instead of discharging him 
 from service, made it more obligatory upon him. Those think of
 themselves above what is meet who think it below them to do good. It is 
 the honour even of angels themselves to be serviceable.

 [3.] Though the people had been provoking to him, and were ready to
 stone him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:4"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 4</A>),

 yet still he made himself the servant of all. Note, Though others fail
 in their duty to us, yet we must not therefore neglect ours to them. 
 
 [4.] Though he was an old man, yet he kept to his business from morning
 to night, and made it his meat and drink to do it. God had given him 
 great strength both of body and mind, which enabled him to go through a 
 great deal of work with ease and pleasure; and, for the encouragement 
 of others to spend and be spent in the service of God, it proved that 
 after all his labours his natural force was not diminished. Those that 
 wait on the Lord and his service shall renew their strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great prudence and consideration of Jethro as a friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He disliked the method that Moses took, and was so free with him as 
 to tell him so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:14,17,18"><I>v.</I> 14, 17, 18</A>.

 He thought it was too much business for Moses to undertake alone, that 
 it would be a prejudice to his health and too great a fatigue to him, 
 and also that it would make the administration of justice tiresome to 
 the people; and therefore he tells him plainly, <I>It is not good.</I> 
 Note, There may be over-doing even in well-doing, and therefore our 
 zeal must always be governed by discretion, that our good may not be 
 evil spoken of. Wisdom is profitable to direct, that we may neither 
 content ourselves with less than our duty nor over-task ourselves with 
 that which is beyond our strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He advised him to such a model of government as would better answer 
 the intention, which was, 

 (1.) That he should reserve to himself all applications to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Be thou for them to God-ward;</I> that was an honour in which it was 
 not fit any other should share with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6-8">Num. xii. 6-8</A>.

 Also whatever concerned the whole congregation in general must pass
 through his hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 But, 

 (2.) That he should appoint judges in the several tribes and families,
 who should try causes between man and man, and determine them, which 
 would be done with less noise, and more despatch, than in the general 
 assembly wherein Moses himself presided. Thus they must be governed as 
 a nation by a king as supreme, and inferior magistrates sent and 
 commissioned by him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 Thus many hands would make light work, causes would be sooner heard,
 and the people eased by having justice thus brought to their 
 tent-doors. Yet, 

 (3.) An appeal might lie, if there were just cause for it, from these
 inferior courts to Moses himself; at least if the judges were 
 themselves at a loss: <I>Every great matter they shall bring unto 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Thus that great man would be the more serviceable by being employed 
 only in great matters. Note, Those whose gifts and stations are most 
 eminent may yet be greatly furthered in their work by the assistance of 
 those that are every way their inferiors, whom therefore they should 
 not despise. The head has need of the hands and feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.

 Great men should not only study to be useful themselves, but contrive 
 how to make others useful, according as their capacity is. Such is 
 Jethro's advice, by which it appears that though Moses excelled him in 
 prophecy he excelled Moses in politics; yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He adds two qualifications to his counsel:--

 (1.) That great care should be taken in the choice of the persons who
 should be admitted into this trust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 they must <I>be able men,</I> &c. It was requisite that they should be 
 men of the very best character, 

 [1.] For judgment and resolution--<I>able men,</I> men of good sense,
 that understood business, and bold men, that would not be daunted by 
 frowns or clamours. Clear heads and stout hearts make good judges. 

 [2.] For piety and religion--<I>such as fear God,</I> as believe there
 is a God above them, whose eye is upon them, to whom they are 
 accountable, and of whose judgment they stand in awe. Conscientious 
 men, that dare not do a base thing, though they could do it ever so 
 secretly and securely. The fear of God is that principle which will
 best fortify a man against all temptations to injustice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15,Ge+42:18">Neh. v. 15; Gen. xlii. 18</A>.

 [3.] For integrity and honesty--<I>men of truth,</I> whose word one may
 take, and whose fidelity one may rely upon, who would not for a world 
 tell a lie, betray a trust, or act an insidious part. 

 [4.] For noble and generous contempt of worldly wealth--<I>hating
 covetousness,</I> not only not seeking bribes nor aiming to enrich 
 themselves, but abhorring the thought of it; he is fit to be a 
 magistrate, and he alone, who <I>despiseth the gain of oppressions, and 
 shaketh his hands from the holding of bribes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 (2.) That he should attend God's direction in the case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so.</I> Jethro 
 knew that Moses had a better counsellor than he was, and to his counsel 
 he refers him. Note, Advice must be given with a humble submission to 
 the word and providence of God, which must always overrule.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Moses did not despise this advice because it came from one not 
 acquainted, as he was, with the words of God and the visions of the 
 Almighty; but he <I>hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 When he came to consider the thing, he saw the reasonableness of what 
 his father-in-law proposed and resolved to put it in practice, which he 
 did soon afterwards, when he had received directions from God in the 
 matter. Note, Those are not so wise as they would be thought to be who 
 think themselves too wise to be counselled; for <I>a wise man</I> (one 
 who is truly so) <I>will hear, and will increase learning,</I> and not 
 slight good counsel, though given by an inferior. Moses did not leave
 the election of the magistrates to the people, who had already done 
 enough to prove themselves unfit for such a trust; but he chose them, 
 and appointed them, some for greater, others for less division, the 
 less probably subordinate to the greater. We have reason to value 
 government as a very great mercy, and to thank God for laws and 
 magistrates, so that we are not like <I>the fishes of the sea, where 
 the greater devour the less.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jethro's return to his own land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 No doubt he took home with him the improvements he had made in the 
 knowledge of God, and communicated them to his neighbours for their 
 instruction. It is supposed that the Kenites (mentioned in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:6">1 Sam. xv. 6</A>)

 were the posterity of Jethro (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16">Judg. i. 16</A>),

 and they are there taken under special protection, for the kindness
 their ancestor here showed to Israel. The good-will shown to God's 
 people, even in the smallest instances, shall in no wise lose its 
 reward, but shall be recompensed, at furthest, in the resurrection.</P>
