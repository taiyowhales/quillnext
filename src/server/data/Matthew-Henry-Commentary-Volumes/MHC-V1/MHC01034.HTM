 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At this chapter begins the story of Jacob's afflictions in his children, 
 which were very great, and are recorded to show, 
 
 1. The 
 vanity of this world. That which is dearest to us may prove 
 our greatest vexation, and we may meet with the greatest crosses 
 in those things of which we said, "This same shall comfort us." 
 
 2. The common griefs of good people. Jacob's children were 
 circumcised, were well taught, and prayed for, and had very 
 good examples set them; yet some of them proved very untoward. 
 "The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the 
 strong." Grace does not run in the blood, and yet the interrupting 
 of the entail of grace does not cut off the entail of profession 
 and visible church-privileges: nay, Jacob's sons, though 
 they were his grief in some things, yet were all taken into covenant 
 with God. In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. Dinah debauched,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. A treaty of marriage between her and Shechem who 
 had defiled her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:6-19">ver. 6-19</A>.

 III. The circumcision of the Shechemites, 
 pursuant to that treaty,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>.
 
 IV. The perfidious 
 and bloody revenge which Simeon and Levi took upon 
 them,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:25-31">ver. 25-31.</A></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, 
 which she bare unto Jacob, went 
 out to see the daughters of the land.
 &nbsp; 2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor 
 the Hivite, prince of the country, 
 saw her, he took her, and lay with her, 
 and defiled her.
 &nbsp; 3 And his soul clave 
 unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, 
 and he loved the damsel, and spake 
 kindly unto the damsel.
 &nbsp; 4 And Shechem 
 spake unto his father Hamor, 
 saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
 &nbsp; 5 And Jacob heard that he had 
 defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons 
 were with his cattle in the field: and 
 Jacob held his peace until they were 
 come.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Dinah was, for aught that appears, Jacob's 
 only daughter, and we may suppose her 

 <A NAME="Page201"> </A>

 therefore the mother's fondling and the darling 
 of the family, and yet she proves neither 
 a joy nor a credit to them; for those children 
 seldom prove either the best or the happiest 
 that are most indulged. She is reckoned 
 now but fifteen or sixteen years of age when 
 she here occasioned so much mischief. Observe, 
 
 1. Her vain curiosity, which exposed 
 her. She went out, perhaps unknown to her 
 father, but by the connivance of her mother, 
 <I>to see the daughters of the land</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 probably it was at a ball, or on some public day. 
 Being an only daughter, she thought herself 
 solitary at home, having none of her own 
 age and sex to converse with; and therefore 
 she must needs go abroad to divert herself, 
 to keep off melancholy, and to accomplish 
 herself by conversation better than she could 
 in her father's tents. Note, It is a very 
 good thing for children to love home; it is 
 parents' wisdom to make it easy to them, 
 and children's duty then to be easy in it. 
 Her pretence was <I>to see the daughters of the 
 land,</I> to see how they dressed, and how they 
 danced, and what was fashionable among 
 them. She went to <I>see,</I> yet that was not all, 
 she went to be <I>seen</I> too; she went to see the 
 daughters of the land, but, it may be, with 
 some thoughts of the sons of the land too. I 
 doubt she went to get an acquaintance with 
 those Canaanites, and to learn their way. 
 Note, The pride and vanity of young people 
 betray them into many snares. 
 
 2. The loss 
 of her honour by this means
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 <I>Shechem, 
 the prince of the country,</I> but a slave to his 
 own lusts, took her, and lay with her, it 
 should seem, not so much by force as by 
 surprise. Note, Great men think they may 
 do any thing; and what more mischievous 
 than untaught and ungoverned youth? See 
 what came of Dinah's gadding: young 
 women must learn to be <I>chaste, keepers at 
 home;</I> these properties are put together, 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:5">Tit. ii. 5</A>,
 for those that are not keepers at home 
 expose their chastity. Dinah went abroad 
 to look about her; but, if she had looked 
 about her as she ought, she would not have 
 fallen into this snare. Note, The beginning 
 of sin is as the letting forth of water. How 
 great a matter does a little fire kindle! We 
 should therefore carefully avoid all occasions 
 of sin and approaches to it. 
 
 3. The court 
 Shechem made to her, after he had defiled 
 her. This was fair and commendable, and 
 made the best of what was bad; he loved her 
 (not as Amnon,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:15">2 Sam. xiii. 15</A>),
 and he engaged 
 his father to make a match for him 
 with her,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 4. The tidings brought to 
 poor Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 As soon as his children 
 grew up they began to be a grief to him. 
 Let not godly parents, that are lamenting the 
 miscarriages of their children, think their 
 case singular or unprecedented. The good 
 man <I>held his peace,</I> as one astonished, that 
 knows not what to say: or he said nothing, 
 for fear of saying amiss, as David 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1,2">Ps. xxxix. 1, 2</A>);
 he smothered his resentments, lest, if 
 he had suffered them to break out, they 
 should have transported him into any indecencies.
 Or, it should seem, he had left the 
 management of his affairs very much (too 
 much I doubt) to his sons, and he would do 
 nothing without them: or, at least, he knew 
 they would make him uneasy if he did, they 
 having shown themselves, of late, upon all 
 occasions, bold, forward, and assuming. 
 Note, Things never go well when the authority 
 of a parent runs low in a family. Let 
 every man <I>bear rule in his own house, and 
 have his children in subjection with all gravity.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And Hamor the father of Shechem 
 went out unto Jacob to commune with 
 him.
 &nbsp; 7 And the sons of Jacob came 
 out of the field when they heard <I>it:</I> 
 and the men were grieved, and they 
 were very wroth, because he had 
 wrought folly in Israel in lying with 
 Jacob's daughter; which thing ought 
 not to be done.
 &nbsp; 8 And Hamor communed 
 with them, saying, The soul of 
 my son Shechem longeth for your 
 daughter: I pray you give her him 
 to wife.
 &nbsp; 9 And make ye marriages 
 with us, <I>and</I> give your daughters unto
 us, and take our daughters unto you.
 &nbsp; 10 And ye shall dwell with us: and 
 the land shall be before you; dwell 
 and trade ye therein, and get you possessions 
 therein.
 &nbsp; 11 And Shechem said 
 unto her father and unto her brethren, 
 Let me find grace in your eyes, and 
 what ye shall say unto me I will give.
 &nbsp; 12 Ask me never so much dowry and 
 gift, and I will give according as ye 
 shall say unto me: but give me the 
 damsel to wife.
 &nbsp; 13 And the sons of Jacob 
 answered Shechem and Hamor his 
 father deceitfully, and said, because he 
 had defiled Dinah their sister:
 &nbsp; 14 And they said unto them, We cannot 
 do this thing, to give our sister to one 
 that is uncircumcised; for that <I>were</I> 
 a reproach unto us:
 &nbsp; 15 But in this 
 will we consent unto you: If ye will 
 be as we <I>be,</I> that every male of you 
 be circumcised;
 &nbsp; 16 Then will we give 
 our daughters unto you, and we will 
 take your daughters to us, and we will 
 dwell with you, and we will become 
 one people.
 &nbsp; 17 But if ye will not 
 hearken unto us, to be circumcised; 
 then will we take our daughter, and we 
 will be gone.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jacob's sons, when they heard of the 

 <A NAME="Page202"> </A>

 injury done to Dinah, showed a very great 
 resentment of it, influenced perhaps rather 
 by jealousy for the honour of their family 
 than by a sense of virtue. Many are concerned 
 at the shamefulness of sin that never 
 lay to heart the sinfulness of it. It is here 
 called <I>folly in Israel</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 according to the 
 language of after-times; for Israel was not
 yet a people, but a family only. Note, 
 
 1. Uncleanness is folly; for it sacrifices 
 the favour of God, peace of conscience, and all 
 the soul can pretend to that is sacred and 
 honourable, to a base and brutish lust. 
 
 2. This folly is most shameful in <I>Israel,</I> in a 
 family of Israel, where God is known and 
 worshipped, as he was in Jacob's tents, by 
 the name of <I>the God of Israel.</I> Folly in 
 Israel is scandalous indeed. 
 
 3. It is a good 
 thing to have sin stamped with a bad name: 
 uncleanness is here proverbially called <I>folly 
 in Israel,</I>
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:12">2 Sam. xiii. 12</A>.
 Dinah is here 
 called <I>Jacob's daughter,</I> for warning to all 
 the daughters of Israel, that they betray not 
 themselves to this folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hamor came to treat with Jacob himself, 
 but he turns him over to his sons; and here 
 we have a particular account of the treaty, in 
 which, it is a shame to say, the Canaanites 
 were more honest than the Israelites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Hamor and Shechem fairly propose this 
 match, in order to a coalition in trade. Shechem 
 is deeply in love with Dinah; he will 
 have her upon any terms,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 His 
 father not only consents, but solicits for him, 
 and gravely insists upon the advantages that 
 would follow from the union of the families,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 He shows no jealousy of Jacob, 
 though he was a stranger, but rather an 
 earnest desire to settle a correspondence with 
 him and his family, making him that generous 
 offer, <I>The land shall be before you, trade you 
 therein.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jacob's sons basely pretend to insist 
 upon a coalition in religion, when really they 
 designed nothing less. If Jacob had taken 
 the management of this affair into his own 
 hands, it is probable that he and Hamor 
 would soon have concluded it; but Jacob's 
 sons meditate only revenge, and a strange 
 project they have for the compassing of it--the 
 Shechemites must be circumcised; not to 
 make them holy (they never intended that), 
 but to make them sore, that they might become 
 an easier prey to their sword. 
 
 1. The 
 pretence was specious. "It is the honour of 
 Jacob's family that they carry about with 
 them the token of God's covenant with 
 them; and it will be a reproach to those 
 that are thus dignified and distinguished to 
 enter into such a strict alliance with those 
 that are <I>uncircumcised</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);
 and therefore, 
 <I>if you will be circumcised, then we will become 
 one people with you,</I>"
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 Had they 
 been sincere herein their proposal of these 
 terms would have had in it something commendable; 
 for Israelites should not intermarry 
 with Canaanites, professors with profane; 
 it is a great sin, or at least the cause 
 and inlet of a great deal, and has often been 
 of pernicious consequence. The interest we 
 have in any persons, and the hold we have 
 of them, should be wisely improved by us, 
 to bring them to the love and practice of religion 
 (<I>He that winneth souls is wise</I>); but 
 then we must not, like Jacob's sons, think it 
 enough to persuade them to submit to the 
 external rites of religion, but must endeavour 
 to convince them of its reasonableness, 
 and to bring them acquainted with the power 
 of it. 
 
 2. The intention was malicious, as 
 appears by the sequel of the story; all they 
 aimed at was to prepare them for the day of 
 slaughter. Note, Bloody designs have often 
 been covered, and carried on, with a pretence 
 of religion; thus they have been accomplished 
 most plausibly and most securely: 
 but this dissembled piety is, doubtless, 
 double iniquity. Religion is never more 
 injured, nor are God's sacraments more profaned, 
 than when they are thus used for a 
 cloak of maliciousness. Nay, if Jacob's sons 
 had not had this bloody design, I do not see 
 how they could justify their offering the 
 sacred sign of circumcision, the seal of God's 
 covenant, to these devoted Canaanites, who 
 had no part nor lot in the matter. Those 
 had no right to the seal that had no right to 
 the promise. <I>It is not meet to take the children's 
 bread, and cast it to dogs:</I> but Jacob's 
 sons valued not this, while they could make 
 it serve their turn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And their words pleased Hamor, 
 and Shechem Hamor's son.
 &nbsp; 19 And 
 the young man deferred not to do the 
 thing, because he had delight in Jacob's 
 daughter: and he <I>was</I> more honourable
 than all the house of his father.
 &nbsp; 20 And Hamor and Shechem 
 his son came unto the gate of 
 their city, and communed with the men of 
 their city, saying,
 &nbsp; 21 These men <I>are</I> 
 peaceable with us; therefore let them 
 dwell in the land, and trade therein; 
 for the land, behold, <I>it is</I> large enough 
 for them; let us take their daughters 
 to us for wives, and let us give them 
 our daughters.
 &nbsp; 22 Only herein will 
 the men consent unto us for to dwell 
 with us, to be one people, if every male 
 among us be circumcised, as they <I>are</I> 
 circumcised.
 &nbsp; 23 <I>Shall</I> not their cattle 
 and their substance and every beast
 of theirs <I>be</I> ours? only let us consent 
 unto them, and they will dwell 
 with us.
 &nbsp; 24 And unto Hamor and 
 unto Shechem his son hearkened all 
 that went out of the gate of his city; 

 <A NAME="Page203"> </A>

 and every male was circumcised, all 
 that went out of the gate of his city.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 1. Hamor and Shechem gave consent 
 themselves to be circumcised,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.
 To this perhaps they were moved, not only 
 by the strong desire they had to bring about 
 this match, but by what they might have 
 heard of the sacred and honourable intentions 
 of this sign, in the family of Abraham, 
 which, it is probable, they had some confused 
 notions of, and of the promises confirmed by 
 it, which made them the more desirous to 
 incorporate with the family of Jacob,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.
 Note, Many who know little of 
 religion, yet know so much of it as makes 
 them willing to join themselves with those 
 that are religious. Again, If a man would 
 take upon him a form of religion to gain a 
 good wife, much more should we embrace the 
 power of it to gain the favour of a good God, 
 even circumcise our hearts to love him, and, 
 as Shechem here, <I>not defer to do the thing.</I> 
 
 2. They gained the consent of the men of 
 their city, Jacob's sons requiring that they 
 also should be circumcised. 
 
 (1.) They themselves 
 had great influences upon them by their 
 command and example. Note, Religion 
 would greatly prevail if those in authority, 
 who, like Shechem, are more honourable than 
 their neighbours, would appear forward and 
 zealous for it. 
 
 (2.) They urged an argument 
 which was very cogent
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 <I>Shall 
 not their cattle and their substance be ours?</I> 
 They observed that Jacob's sons were industrious 
 thriving people, and promised themselves 
 and their neighbours advantage by an 
 alliance with them; it would improve ground 
 and trade, and bring money into their 
 country. Now, 
 
 [1.] It was bad enough to 
 marry upon this principle: yet we see covetousness 
 the greatest matchmaker in the 
 world, and nothing designed so much, with 
 many, as the laying of house to house, and 
 field to field, without regard had to any other 
 consideration. 
 
 [2.] It was worse to be circumcised 
 upon this principle. The Shechemites 
 will embrace the religion of Jacob's 
 family only in hopes of interesting themselves 
 thereby in the riches of that family. Thus 
 there are many with whom gain is godliness, 
 and who are more governed and influenced 
 by their secular interest than by any principle 
 of their religion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And it came to pass on the third 
 day, when they were sore, that two of 
 the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, 
 Dinah's brethren, took each man his 
 sword, and came upon the city boldly, 
 and slew all the males.
 &nbsp; 26 And they 
 slew Hamor and Shechem his son 
 with the edge of the sword, and took 
 Dinah out of Shechem's house, and 
 went out.
 &nbsp; 27 The sons of Jacob came 
 upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
 because they had defiled their sister.
 &nbsp; 28 They took their sheep, and their 
 oxen, and their asses, and that which 
 <I>was</I> in the city, and that which <I>was</I> in 
 the field,
 &nbsp; 29 And all their wealth, 
 and all their little ones, and their
 wives took they captive, and spoiled 
 even all that <I>was</I> in the house.
 &nbsp; 30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 
 Ye have troubled me to make me to 
 stink among the inhabitants of the 
 land, among the Canaanites and the 
 Perizzites: and I <I>being</I> few in number, 
 they shall gather themselves together 
 against me, and slay me; and 
 I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
 &nbsp; 31 And they said, Should he deal 
 with our sister as with an harlot?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, we have Simeon and Levi, two of 
 Jacob's sons, young men not much above 
 twenty years old, cutting the throats of the 
 Shechemites, and thereby breaking the heart 
 of their good father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the barbarous murder of the 
 Shechemites. Jacob himself was used to the 
 sheep-hook, but his sons had got swords by 
 their sides, as if they had been the seed of 
 Esau, who was to live by his sword; we have 
 them here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Slaying the inhabitants of Shechem--<I>all 
 the males,</I> Hamor and Shechem particularly, 
 with whom they had been treating in 
 a friendly manner but the other day, yet with 
 a design upon their lives. Some think that 
 all Jacob's sons, when they wheedled the Shechemites 
 to be circumcised, designed to take 
 advantage of their soreness, and to rescue Dinah 
 from among them; but that Simeon and Levi, 
 not content with that, would themselves avenge 
 the injury--and they did it with a witness. 
 Now, 
 
 (1.) It cannot be denied but that God 
 was righteous in it. Had the Shechemites 
 been circumcised in obedience to any command 
 of God, their circumcision would have 
 been their protection; but when they submitted 
 to that sacred rite only to serve a 
 turn, to please their prince and to enrich 
 themselves, it was just with God to bring 
 this upon them. Note, As nothing secures 
 us better than true religion, so nothing exposes 
 us more than religion only pretended 
 to. 
 
 (2.) But Simeon and Levi were most unrighteous. 
 
 [1.] It was true that Shechem 
 had <I>wrought folly against Israel,</I> in defiling 
 Dinah; but it ought to have been considered 
 how far Dinah herself had been accessory to 
 it. Had Shechem abused her in her own 
 mother's tent, it would have been another 
 matter; but she went upon his ground, and 
 perhaps by her indecent carriage had struck 
 the spark which began the fire: when we are 
 severe upon the sinner we ought to consider 
 
 <A NAME="Page204"> </A>

 who was the tempter. 
 
 [2.] It was true that 
 Shechem had done ill; but he was endeavouring 
 to atone for it, and was as honest and 
 honourable, <I>ex post facto--after the deed,</I> as 
 the case would admit: it was not the case of 
 the Levite's concubine that was abused to 
 death; nor does he justify what he has done, 
 but courts a reconciliation upon any terms.
 
 [3.] It was true that Shechem had done ill; 
 but what was that to all the Shechemites? 
 Does one man sin, and will they be wroth 
 with all the town? Must the innocent fall 
 with the guilty? This was barbarous indeed. 
 
 [4.] But that which above all aggravated the 
 cruelty was the most perfidious treachery that 
 was in it. The Shechemites had submitted 
 to their conditions, and had done that upon 
 which they had promised to become one 
 people with them
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 yet they act as sworn 
 enemies to those to whom they had lately 
 become sworn friends, making as light of 
 their covenant as they did of the laws of 
 humanity. And are these the sons of Israel? 
 <I>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce.</I> 
 
 [5.] This also added to the crime, that they made 
 a holy ordinance of God subservient to their 
 wicked design, so making that odious; as if 
 it were not enough for them to shame themselves 
 and their family, they bring a reproach 
 upon that honourable badge of their religion; 
 justly would it be called a bloody ordinance.</P>

 2. Seizing the prey of Shechem, and plundering 
 the town. They rescued Dinah
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 and, if that was all they came for, they 
 might have done that without blood, as appears 
 by their own showing
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);
 but they aimed at the spoil; and, though Simeon and 
 Levi only were the murderers, yet it is intimated 
 that others of the sons of Jacob <I>came 
 upon the slain and spoiled the city</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 and 
 so became accessory to the murder. In them 
 it was manifest injustice; yet here we may 
 observe the righteousness of God. The Shechemites 
 were willing to gratify the sons of 
 Jacob by submitting to the penance of circumcision, 
 upon this principle, <I>Shall not their 
 cattle and their substance be ours?</I>
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 and 
 see what was the issue; instead of making 
 themselves masters of the wealth of Jacob's 
 family, Jacob's family become masters of 
 their wealth. Note, Those who unjustly 
 grasp at that which is another's justly lose 
 that which is their own.</P>

 II. Here is Jacob's resentment of this 
 bloody deed of Simeon and Levi,
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 Two 
 things he bitterly complains of:--
 
 1. The reproach 
 they had brought upon him thereby: 
 <I>You have troubled me,</I> put me into a disorder, 
 for you have made me <I>to stink among the inhabitants 
 of the land,</I> that is, "You have 
 rendered me and my family odious among 
 them. What will they say of us and our 
 religion? We shall be looked upon as the 
 most perfidious barbarous people in the 
 world." Note, The gross misconduct of
 wicked children is the grief and shame of 
 their godly parents. Children should be the 
 joy of their parents; but wicked children are 
 their trouble, sadden their hearts, break their 
 spirits, and make them go mourning from 
 day to day. Children should be an ornament 
 to their parents; but wicked children are 
 their reproach, and are as dead flies in the 
 pot of ointment: but let such children know 
 that, if they repent not, the grief they have 
 caused to their parents, and the damage religion 
 has sustained in its reputation through 
 them, will come into the account and be 
 reckoned for. 
 
 2. The ruin they had exposed 
 him to. What could be expected, but that 
 the Canaanites, who were numerous and 
 formidable, would confederate against him, 
 and he and his little family would become 
 an easy prey to them? <I>I shall be destroyed, 
 I and my house.</I> If all the Shechemites must 
 be destroyed for the offence of one, why not 
 all the Israelites for the offence of two? 
 Jacob knew indeed that God had promised 
 to preserve and perpetuate his house; but 
 he might justly fear that these vile practices 
 of his children would amount to a forfeiture, 
 and cut off the entail. Note, When sin is in 
 the house, there is reason to fear ruin at the 
 door. The tender parents foresee those bad 
 consequences of sin which the wicked children 
 have no dread of. One would think 
 this should have made them to relent, and 
 they should have humbled themselves to their 
 good father, and begged his pardon; but, 
 instead of this, they justify themselves, and 
 give him this insolent reply, <I>Should he deal 
 with our sister as with a harlot?</I> No, he 
 should not; but, if he do, must they be their 
 own avengers? Will nothing less than so 
 many lives, and the ruin of a whole city, 
 serve to atone for an abuse done to one
 foolish girl? By their question they tacitly 
 reflect upon their father, as if he would have 
 been content to let them deal with his daughter 
 as with a harlot. Note, It is common for 
 those who run into one extreme to reproach 
 and censure those who keep the mean as if 
 they ran into the other. Those who condemn 
 the rigour of revenge shall be misrepresented, 
 as if they countenanced and 
 justified the offence.</P>
