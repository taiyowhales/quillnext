 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter consists of two parts. 

 I. Of the account which Paul gives the Ephesians concerning himself, as
 he was appointed by God to be the apostle of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. Of his devout and affectionate prayer to God for the Ephesians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.

 We may observe it to have been very much the practice of this apostle 
 to intermix, with his instructions and counsels, intercessions and 
 prayers to God for those to whom he wrote, as knowing that all his 
 instructions and teachings would be useless and vain, except God did 
 co-operate with them, and render them effectual. This is an example 
 that all the ministers of Christ should copy after, praying earnestly 
 that the efficacious operations of the divine Spirit may attend their 
 ministrations, and crown them with success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
 Gentiles,
 &nbsp; 2  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God
 which is given me to you-ward:
 &nbsp; 3  How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as
 I wrote afore in few words,
 &nbsp; 4  Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the
 mystery of Christ)
 &nbsp; 5  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
 as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the
 Spirit;
 &nbsp; 6  That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same
 body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
 &nbsp; 7  Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the
 grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
 &nbsp; 8  Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this
 grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the
 unsearchable riches of Christ;
 &nbsp; 9  And to make all <I>men</I> see what <I>is</I> the fellowship of the
 mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in
 God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
 &nbsp; 10  To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
 heavenly <I>places</I> might be known by the church the manifold
 wisdom of God,
 &nbsp; 11  According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ
 Jesus our Lord:
 &nbsp; 12  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the
 faith of him.
 &nbsp; 13  Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for
 you, which is your glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the account which Paul gives the Ephesians concerning 
 himself, as he was appointed by God the apostle of the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We may observe that he acquaints them with the tribulations and 
 sufferings which he endured in the discharge of that office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The first clause refers to the preceding chapter, and may be understood
 either of these two ways:--

 1. "<I>For this cause,</I>--for having preached the doctrine contained 
 in the foregoing chapter, and for asserting that the great privileges 
 of the gospel belong not only to the Jews, but to believing Gentiles 
 also, though they are not circumcised,--for this I am now a prisoner, 
 but a <I>prisoner of Jesus Christ,</I> as I suffer in his cause and for 
 his sake, and continue his faithful servant and the object of his 
 special protection and care, while I am thus suffering for him." 
 Observe, Christ's servants, if they come to be prisoners, are his 
 prisoners; and he despises not his prisoners. He thinks never the worse 
 of them for the bad character which the world gives them or the evil 
 treatment that they met with in it. Paul adhered to Christ, and Christ 
 owned him, when he was in prison.--<I>For you, Gentiles;</I> the Jews 
 persecuted and imprisoned him because he was the apostle of the 
 Gentiles, and preached the gospel to them. We may learn hence that the 
 faithful ministers of Christ are to dispense his sacred truths, however 
 disagreeable they may be to some, and whatever they themselves may 
 suffer for doing so. Or, 

 2. The words may be thus understood:--"<I>For this cause,</I>--since
 <I>you are no more strangers and foreigners</I> (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19"><I>ch.</I> ii. 19</A>),

 but are united to Christ, and admitted into communion with his
 church,--<I>I Paul,</I> who am <I>the prisoner of Jesus Christ,</I> 
 pray that you may be enabled to act as becomes persons thus favoured by 
 God, and made partakers of such privileges." To this purport you find 
 him expressing himself in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 where, after the digression contained in the several verses 
 intervening, he proceeds with what he began in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1">first verse</A>.

 Observe, Those who have received grace and signal favours from God 
 stand in need of prayer, that they may improve and advance, and 
 continue to act as becomes them. And, seeing Paul while he was a 
 prisoner employed himself in such prayers to God in behalf of the 
 Ephesians, we should learn that no particular sufferings of our own 
 should make us so solicitous about ourselves as to neglect the cases of
 others in our supplications and addresses to God. He speaks again of 
 his sufferings: <I>Wherefore I desire that you faint not at my 
 tribulation for you, which is your glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 While he was in prison, he suffered much there; and, though it was upon 
 their account that he suffered, yet he would not have them discouraged 
 nor dismayed at this, seeing God had done such great things for them by 
 his ministry. What a tender concern was here for these Ephesians! The 
 apostle seems to have been more solicitous lest they should be 
 discouraged and faint upon his tribulations than about what he himself 
 endured; and, to prevent this, he tells them that his sufferings were 
 their glory, and would be so far from being a real discouragement, if 
 they duly considered the matter, that they ministered cause to them for 
 glorying and for rejoicing, as this discovered the great esteem and 
 regard which God bore to them, in that he not only sent his apostles to 
 preach the gospel to them, but even to suffer for them, and to confirm 
 the truths they delivered by the persecutions they underwent. Observe, 
 Not only the faithful ministers of Christ themselves, but their people 
 too, have some special cause for joy and glorying, when they suffer for 
 the sake of dispensing the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle informs them of God's appointing him to the office, and 
 eminently fitting and qualifying him for it, by a special revelation 
 that he made unto him. 

 1. God appointed him to the office: <I>If you have heard of the
 dispensation of the grace of God, which is given me to you-ward,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They could not have heard of this, and therefore he does not design to 
 speak doubtfully of this matter. <B><I>Eige</I></B> is sometimes an
 affirmative particle, and we may read it, <I>Since you have heard,</I> 
 &c. He styles the gospel <I>the grace of God</I> here (as in other 
 places) because it is the gift of divine grace to sinful men; and all 
 the gracious overtures that it makes, and the joyful tidings that it 
 contains, proceed from the rich grace of God; and it is also the great 
 instrument in the hands of the Spirit by which God works grace in the 
 souls of men. He speaks of the dispensation of this grace given to him; 
 he means as he was authorized and commissioned by God to dispense the 
 doctrine of the gospel, which commission and authority were given to 
 him chiefly for he service of the Gentiles: <I>to you-ward.</I> And 
 again, speaking of the gospel, he says, <I>Whereof I was made a 
 minister,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Here he again asserts his authority. He <I>was</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>MADE</FONT> <I>a minister</I>--he did not make himself
 such; he took not to himself that honour--and he was made such 
 <I>according to the gift of the grace of God unto</I> him. God supplied 
 and furnished him for his work; and in the performance of it suitably 
 assisted him with all needful gifts and graces, both ordinary and 
 extraordinary, and that <I>by the effectual working of his power,</I> 
 in himself more especially, and also in great numbers of those to whom 
 he preached, by which means his labours among them were successful. 
 Observe, What God calls men to he fits them for, and does it with an 
 almighty power. An effectual working of divine power attends the gifts 
 of divine grace. 

 2. As God appointed him to the office, so he eminently qualified him
 for it, by a special revelation that he made unto him. He makes mention 
 both of the mystery that was revealed and of the revelation of it.

 (1.) The mystery revealed is <I>that the Gentiles should be 
 fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in 
 Christ, by the gospel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 that is, that they should be joint-heirs with the believing Jews of the 
 heavenly inheritance; and that they should be members of the same 
 mystical body, be received into the church of Christ, and be interested 
 in the gospel-promises, as well as the Jews, and particularly in that 
 great promise of the Spirit. And this <I>in Christ,</I> being united to 
 Christ, <I>in whom all the promises are yea and amen; and by the 
 gospel,</I> that is, in the times of the gospel, as some understand it; 
 or, <I>by the gospel</I> preached to them, which is the great 
 instrument and means by which God works faith in Christ, as others. 
 This was the great truth revealed to the apostles, namely, that God 
 would call the Gentiles to salvation by faith in Christ, and that 
 without the works of the law. 

 (2.) Of the revelation of this truth he speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 Here we may observe that the coalition of Jews and Gentiles in the 
 gospel church was a mystery, a great mystery, what was designed in the 
 counsel of God before all worlds, but what could not be fully 
 understood for many ages, till the accomplishment expounded the 
 prophecies of it. It is called a mystery because the several 
 circumstances and peculiarities of it (such as the time and manner and 
 means by which it should be effected) were concealed and kept secret in 
 God's own breast, till be an immediate <I>revelation he made them 
 known</I> to his servant. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:16-18">Acts xxvi. 16-18</A>.
 
 And it is called the mystery of Christ because it was revealed by him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:12">Gal. i. 12</A>),

 and because it relates so very much to him. Of this the apostle has 
 given some hints <I>afore,</I> or a little before; that is, in the 
 preceding chapters. <I>Whereby, when you read;</I> or, as those words 
 may be read, <I>unto which attending</I> (and it is not enough for us 
 barely to read the scriptures, unless we attend to them, and seriously 
 consider and lay to heart what we read), <I>you may understand my 
 knowledge in the mystery of Christ;</I> so as to perceive how God had 
 fitted and qualified him to be an apostle to the Gentiles, which might 
 be to them an evident token of his divine authority. <I>This
 mystery,</I> he says, <I>in other ages was not made known unto the sons 
 of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by 
 the Spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 that is, "It was not so fully and clearly discovered in the ages before 
 Christ as it is now revealed unto the prophets of this age, the 
 prophets of the New Testament, who are immediately inspired and taught 
 by the Spirit." Let us observe, that the conversion of the Gentile 
 world to the faith of Christ was an adorable mystery, and we ought to 
 bless God for it. Who would have imagined that those who had been so 
 long in the dark, and at so great a distance, would be enlightened with 
 the marvellous light, and be made nigh? Let us learn hence not to 
 despair of the worst, of the worst of persons, and the worst of 
 nations. Nothing is too hard for divine grace to do: none so unworthy 
 but God may please to confer great grace upon them. And how much are we 
 ourselves interested in this affair; not only as we live in a time in 
 which the mystery is revealed, but particularly as we are a part of the 
 nations which in times past were foreigners and strangers, and lived in 
 gross idolatry; but are now enlightened with the everlasting gospel, 
 and partake of its promises!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle informs them how he was employed in this office, and 
 that with respect to the Gentiles, and to all men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With respect to the Gentiles, he <I>preached</I> to them <I>the 
 unsearchable riches of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Observe, in this verse, how humbly he speaks of himself, and how highly 
 he speaks of Jesus Christ.

 (1.) How humbly he speaks of himself: <I>I am less than the least of 
 all saints.</I> St. Paul, who was the chief of the apostles, calls 
 himself <I>less than the least of all saints:</I> he means on account 
 of his having been formerly a persecutor of the followers of Christ. He 
 was, in his own esteem, as little as could be. What can be less than 
 the least? To speak himself as little as could be, he speaks himself 
 less than could be. Observe, Those whom God advances to honourable 
 employments he humbles and makes low in their own eyes; and, where God 
 gives grace to be humble, there he gives all other grace. You may also 
 observe in what a different manner the apostle speaks of himself and of 
 his office. While he magnifies his office, he debases himself. Observe, 
 A faithful minister of Christ may be very humble, and think very meanly 
 of himself, even when he thinks and speaks very highly and honourably 
 of his sacred function. 

 (2.) How highly he speaks of Jesus Christ: <I>The unsearchable riches 
 of Christ.</I> There is a mighty treasury of mercy, grace, and love, 
 laid up in Christ Jesus, and that both for Jews and Gentiles. Or, the 
 riches of the gospel are here spoken of as the riches of Christ: the 
 riches which Christ purchased for, and bestows upon, all believers. And 
 they are unsearchable riches, which we cannot find the bottom of, which 
 human sagacity could never have discovered, and men could no otherwise 
 attain to the knowledge of them but by revelation. Now it was the 
 apostle's business and employment to <I>preach</I> these 
 <I>unsearchable riches of Christ among the Gentiles:</I> and it was a 
 favour he greatly valued, and looked upon it as an unspeakable honour 
 to him: "<I>Unto me is this grace given;</I> this special favour God 
 has granted to such an unworthy creature as I am." And it is an 
 unspeakable favour to the Gentile world that to them <I>the 
 unsearchable riches of Christ</I> are preached. Though many remain 
 poor, and are not enriched with these riches, yet it is a favour to 
 have them preached among us, to have an offer of them made to us; and, 
 if we are not enriched with them, it is our own fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With respect to all men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 His business and employment were <I>to make all men see</I> (to publish 
 and make known to the whole world) <I>what is the fellowship of the 
 mystery</I> (that the Gentiles who have hitherto been strangers to the 
 church, shall be admitted into communion with it) <I>which from the 
 beginning of the world hath been hid in God</I> (kept secret in his 
 purpose), <I>who created all things by Jesus Christ:</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3">John i. 3</A>,

 <I>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made
 that was made;</I> and therefore no wonder that he saves the Gentiles 
 as well as the Jews; for he is the common Creator of them both: and we 
 may conclude that he is able to perform the work of their redemption, 
 seeing he was able to accomplish the great work of creation. It is true 
 that both the first creation, when God made all things out of nothing, 
 and the new creation, whereby sinners are made new creatures by 
 converting grace, are of God by Jesus Christ. The apostle adds, <I>To 
 the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly 
 places might be known, by the church, the manifold wisdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This was one things, among others, which God had in his eye in 
 revealing this mystery, that the good angels, who have a pre-eminence 
 in governing the kingdoms and principalities of the world, and who are 
 endued with great power to execute the will of God on this earth 
 (though their ordinary residence is in heaven) may be informed, from 
 what passes in the church and is done in and by it, <I>of the manifold 
 wisdom of God;</I> that is, of the great variety with which God wisely 
 dispenses things, or of his wisdom manifested in the many ways and 
 methods he takes in ordering his church in the several ages of it, and 
 especially in receiving the Gentiles into it. The holy angels, who look 
 into the mystery of our redemption by Christ, could not but take notice 
 of this branch of that mystery, that among the Gentiles is preached the 
 unsearchable riches of Christ. And this is <I>according to the eternal 
 purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Some translate the words <B><I>kata prothesin ton aionon</I></B> thus 
 <I>According to the fore-disposing of the ages which he made,</I> &c.
 So Dr. Whitby, &c. "In the first of the ages," says this author, "his
 wisdom seeing fit to give the promise of a Saviour to a fallen Adam: in 
 the second age to typify and represent him to the Jews in sacred 
 persons, rites, and sacrifices: and in the age of the Messiah, or the 
 last age, to reveal him to the Jews, and preach him to the Gentiles." 
 Others understand it, according to our translation, of the eternal 
 purpose which God purposed to execute in and through Jesus Christ, the 
 whole of what he has done in the great affair of man's redemption being 
 in pursuance of his eternal decree about that matter. The apostle, 
 having mentioned our Lord Jesus Christ, subjoins concerning him, <I>In 
 whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 that is, "By (or through) whom we have liberty to open our minds freely
 to God, as to a Father, and a well-grounded persuasion of audience and 
 of acceptance with him; and this by means of the faith we have in him, 
 as our great Mediator and Advocate." We may come with humble boldness 
 to hear from God, knowing that the terror of the curse is done away; 
 and we may expect to hear from him good words and comfortable. We may 
 have access with confidence to speak to God, knowing that we have such 
 a Mediator between God and us, and such an Advocate with the 
 Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord
 Jesus Christ,
 &nbsp; 15  Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
 &nbsp; 16  That he would grant you, according to the riches of his
 glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
 man;
 &nbsp; 17  That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye,
 being rooted and grounded in love,
 &nbsp; 18  May be able to comprehend with all saints what <I>is</I> the
 breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
 &nbsp; 19  And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,
 that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
 &nbsp; 20  Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above
 all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in
 us,
 &nbsp; 21  Unto him <I>be</I> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
 all ages, world without end. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We now come to the second part of this chapter, which contains Paul's 
 devout and affectionate prayer to God for his beloved Ephesians.--<I>For
 this cause.</I> This may be referred either to the immediately 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:13">foregoing verse</A>,

 <I>That you faint not,</I> &c., or, rather, the apostle is here
 resuming what he began at the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1">first verse</A>,

 from which he digressed in those which are interposed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To whom he prays--to God, as <I>the Father of our Lord Jesus
 Christ,</I> of which see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3"><I>ch.</I> i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His outward posture in prayer, which was humble and reverent: <I>I 
 bow my knees.</I> Note, When we draw nigh to God, we should reverence 
 him in our hearts, and express our reverence in the most suitable and 
 becoming behaviour and gesture. Here, having mentioned Christ, he 
 cannot pass without an honourable encomium of his love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The universal church has a dependence upon the Lord Jesus Christ: <I>Of 
 whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</I> The Jews were 
 wont to boast of Abraham as their father, but now Jews and Gentiles are 
 both denominated from Christ (so some); while others understand it of 
 the saints in heaven, who wear the crown of glory, and of saints on 
 earth who are going on in the work of grace here. Both the one and the 
 other make but one family, one household; and from him they are 
 <I>named</I> C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRISTIANS</FONT>, as they really are such, 
 acknowledging their dependence upon, and their relation to, Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the apostle asks of God for these his friends--spiritual
 blessings, which are the best blessings, and the most earnestly to be 
 sought and prayed for by every one of us, both for ourselves and for 
 our friends. 

 1. Spiritual strength for the work and duty to which they were called,
 and in which they were employed: <I>That he would grant you, according 
 to the riches of his grace, to be strengthened,</I> &c. <I>The inner
 man</I> is the heart or soul. To be <I>strengthened with might</I> is 
 to be mightily strengthened, much more than they were at present; to be 
 endued with a high degree of grace, and spiritual abilities for 
 discharging duty, resisting temptations, enduring persecutions, &c. And 
 the apostle prays that this may be <I>according to the riches of his 
 glory,</I> or according to his glorious riches--answerable to that 
 great abundance of grace, mercy, and power, which resides in God, and 
 is his glory: and this by his Spirit, who is the immediate worker of 
 grace in the souls of God's people. Observe from these things, That 
 strength from the Spirit of God in the inner man is the best and most 
 desirable strength, strength in the soul, the strength of faith and 
 other graces, strength to serve God and to do our duty, and to 
 persevere in our Christian course with vigour and with cheerfulness. 
 And let us further observe that <I>as the work of grace is first begun 
 so it is continued and carried on, by the blessed Spirit of God.</I>

 2. The indwelling of Christ in their hearts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Christ is said to dwell in his people, as he is always present with
 them by his gracious influences and operations. Observe, It is a 
 desirable thing to have Christ dwell in our hearts; and if the law of 
 Christ be written there, and the love of Christ be shed abroad there, 
 then Christ dwells there. Christ is an inhabitant in the soul of every 
 good Christian. Where his spirit dwells, there he swells; and he dwells 
 in the heart by faith, by means of the continual exercise of faith upon 
 him. Faith opens the door of the soul, to receive Christ; faith admits 
 him, and submits to him. By faith we are united to Christ, and have an 
 interest in him. 

 3. The fixing of pious and devout affections in the soul: <I>That you
 being rooted and grounded in love,</I> stedfastly fixed in your love to 
 God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to all the saints, the 
 beloved of our Lord Jesus Christ. Many have some love to God and to his 
 servants, but it is a flash, like the crackling of thorns under a pot, 
 it makes a great noise, but is gone presently. We should earnestly
 desire that good affections may be fixed in us, that we may be 
 <I>rooted and grounded in love.</I> Some understand it of their being 
 settled and established in the sense of God's love to them, which would 
 inspire them with greater ardours of holy love to him, and to one 
 another. And how very desirable is it to have a settled fixed sense of 
 the love of God and Christ to our souls, so as to be able to say with 
 the apostle at all times, <I>He has loved me!</I> Now the best way to 
 attain this is to be careful that we maintain a constant love to God in 
 our souls; this will be the evidence of the love of God to us. <I>We 
 love him, because he first loved us.</I> In order to this he prays, 

 4. For their experimental acquaintance with the love of Jesus Christ.
 The more intimate acquaintance we have with Christ's love to us, the 
 more our love will be drawn out to him, and to those who are his, for 
 his sake: <I>That you may be able to comprehend with all saints,</I> 
 &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>);

 that is, more clearly to understand, and firmly to believe, the 
 wonderful love of Christ to his, which the saints do understand and 
 believe in some measure, and shall understand more hereafter. 
 Christians should not aim to comprehend above all saints; but be 
 content that God deals with them as he uses to do with those who love 
 and fear his name: we should desire to comprehend <I>with all 
 saints,</I> to have so much knowledge as the saints are allowed to have 
 in this world. We should be ambitious of coming up with <I>the first 
 three;</I> but not of going beyond what is the measure of the stature 
 of other saints. It is observable how magnificently the apostle speaks 
 of the love of Christ. The dimensions of redeeming love are admirable: 
 <I>The breadth, and length, and depth, and height.</I> By enumerating 
 these dimensions, the apostle designs to signify the exceeding 
 greatness of the love of Christ, the unsearchable riches of his love, 
 which is <I>higher than heaven, deeper than hell, longer than the 
 earth, and broader than the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:8,9">Job xi. 8, 9</A>.

 Some describe the particulars thus: By the breadth of it we may
 understand the extent of it to all ages, nations, and ranks of men; by 
 the length of it, its continuance from everlasting to everlasting; by 
 the depth of it, its stooping to the lowest condition, with a design to 
 relieve and save those who have sunk into the depths of sin and misery; 
 by its height, its entitling and raising us up to the heavenly 
 happiness and glory. We should desire to comprehend this love: it is 
 the character of all the saints that they do so; for they all have a 
 complacency and a confidence in the love of Christ: <I>And to know the 
 love of Christ which passeth knowledge,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 If it passeth knowledge, how can we know it? We must pray and endeavour 
 to know something, and should still covet and strive to know more and 
 more of it, though, after the best endeavours, none can fully 
 comprehend it: in its full extent it surpasses knowledge. Though the 
 love of Christ may be better perceived and known by Christians than it 
 generally is, yet it cannot be fully understood on this side heaven. 

 5. He prays that they may <I>be filled with all the fulness of
 God.</I> It is a high expression: we should not dare to use it if we 
 did not find it in the scriptures. It is like those other expressions, 
 of being <I>partakers of a divine nature,</I> and of being <I>perfect 
 as our Father in heaven is perfect.</I> We are not to understand it of 
 his fulness as God in himself, but of his fulness as a God in covenant 
 with us, as a God to his people: such a fulness as God is ready to 
 bestow, who is willing to fill them all to the utmost of their 
 capacity, and that with all those gifts and graces which he sees they 
 need. Those who receive grace for grace from Christ's fulness may be 
 said to be <I>filled with the fulness of God,</I> according to their 
 capacity, all which is in order to their arriving at the highest degree 
 of the knowledge and enjoyment of God, and an entire conformity to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle closes the chapter with a doxology, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 It is proper to conclude our prayers with praises. Our blessed Saviour 
 has taught us to do so. Take notice how he describes God, and how he 
 ascribes glory to him. He describes him as a God that <I>is able to do 
 exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think.</I> There is an 
 inexhaustible fulness of grace and mercy in God, which the prayers of 
 all the saints can never draw dry. Whatever we may ask, or think to 
 ask, still God is still able to do more, abundantly more, exceedingly 
 abundantly more. Open thy mouth ever so wide, still he hath wherewithal 
 to fill it. Note, In our applications to God we should encourage our 
 faith by a consideration of his all-sufficiency and almighty power.
 <I>According to the power which worketh in us.</I> As if he had said, 
 We have already had a proof of this power of God, in what he hath 
 wrought in us and done for us, having quickened us by his grace, and 
 converted us to himself. The power that still worketh for the saints is 
 according to that power that hath wrought in them. Wherever God gives 
 of his fulness he gives to experience his power. Having thus described 
 God, he ascribes glory to him. When we come to ask for grace from God, 
 we ought to give glory to God. Unto him be glory in the church by 
 Christ Jesus. In ascribing glory to God, we ascribe all excellences and 
 perfections to him, glory being the effulgency and result of them all.
 Observe, The seat of God's praises is in the church. That little rent 
 of praise which God receives from this world is from the church, a 
 sacred society constituted for the glory of God, every particular 
 member of which, both Jew and Gentile, concurs in this work of praising 
 God. The Mediator of these praises is Jesus Christ. All God's gifts
 come from his to us through the hand of Christ; and all our praises 
 pass from us to him through the same hand. And God should and will be 
 praised thus <I>throughout all ages, world without end;</I> for he will 
 ever have a church to praise him, and he will ever have his tribute of 
 praise from his church. <I>Amen.</I> So be it; and so it will certainly 
 be.</P>
