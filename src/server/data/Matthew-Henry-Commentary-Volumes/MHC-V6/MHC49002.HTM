 Gentiles receive from Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14-22">ver. 14-22</A>.

 The apostle endeavours to affect them with a due sense of the wonderful
 change which divine grace had wrought in them; and this is very 
 applicable to that great change which the same grace works in all those 
 who are brought into a state of grace. So that we have here a lively 
 picture both of the misery of unregenerate men and of the happy 
 condition of converted souls, enough to awaken and alarm those who are 
 yet in their sins and to put them upon hastening out of that state, and 
 to comfort and delight those whom God hath quickened, with a 
 consideration of the mighty privileges with which they are 
 invested.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And you <I>hath he quickened,</I> who were dead in trespasses and
 sins;
 &nbsp; 2  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of
 this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the
 spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
 &nbsp; 3  Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
 the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
 of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
 others.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The miserable condition of the Ephesians by nature is here in part 
 described. Observed, 

 1. Unregenerate souls are dead in trespasses and sins. All those who
 are in their sins, are dead in sins; yea, in trespasses and sins, which 
 may signify all sorts of sins, habitual and actual, sins of heart and 
 of life. Sin is the death of the soul. Wherever that prevails there is
 a privation of all spiritual life. Sinners are dead in state, being
 destitute of the principles, and powers of spiritual life; and cut off 
 from God, the fountain of life: and they are dead in law, as a 
 condemned malefactor is said to be a dead man. 

 2. A state of sin is a state of conformity to this world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:1">first verse</A>

 he speaks of their internal state, in this of their outward
 conversation: <I>Wherein,</I> in which trespasses and sins, <I>in time 
 past you walked,</I> you lived and behaved yourselves in such a manner 
 as the men of the world are used to do. 

 3. We are by nature bond-slaves to sin and Satan. Those who walk in
 trespasses and sins, and according to the course of this world, walk
 <I>according to the prince of the power of the air.</I> The devil, or
 the prince of devils, is thus described. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:24,26">Matt. xii. 24, 26</A>.

 The legions of apostate angels are as one power united under one chief; 
 and therefore what is called <I>the powers of darkness</I> elsewhere is 
 here spoken of in the singular number. The air is represented as the 
 seat of his kingdom: and it was the opinion of both Jews and heathens 
 that the air is full of spirits, and that there they exercise and exert 
 themselves. The devil seems to have some power (by God's permission) in 
 the lower region of the air; there he is at hand to tempt men, and to 
 do as much mischief to the world as he can: but it is the comfort and 
 joy of God's people that he who is <I>head over all things to the 
 church</I> has conquered the devil and has him in his chain. But wicked 
 men are slaves to Satan, for they walk according to him; they conform 
 their lives and actions to the will and pleasure of this great usurper.
 The course and tenour of their lives are according to his suggestions, 
 and in compliance with his temptations; they are subject to him, and 
 are led captive by him at his will, whereupon he is called the god of 
 this world, and <I>the spirit that now worketh in the children of 
 disobedience. The children of disobedience</I> are such as choose to 
 disobey God, and to serve the devil; in these he works very powerfully 
 and effectually. As the good Spirit works that which is good in 
 obedient souls, so this evil spirit works that which is evil in wicked 
 men; and he now works, not only heretofore, but even since the world 
 has been blessed with the light of the glorious gospel. The apostle 
 adds, <I>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past,</I> 
 which words refer to the Jews, whom he signifies here to have been in 
 the like sad and miserable condition by nature, and to have been as 
 vile and wicked as the unregenerate Gentiles themselves, and whose 
 natural state he further describes in the next words. 

 4. We are by nature drudges to the flesh, and to our corrupt
 affections,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 By <I>fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,</I> men 
 contract that filthiness of flesh and spirit from which the apostle 
 exhorts Christians to cleanse themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1">2 Cor. vii. 1</A>.

 The fulfilling of the desires of the flesh and of the mind includes all
 the sin and wickedness that are acted in and by both the inferior and 
 the higher or nobler powers of the soul. We lived in the actual 
 commission of all those sins to which corrupt nature inclined us. The 
 carnal mind makes a man a perfect slave to his vicious 
 appetite.--<I>The fulfilling of the wills of the flesh,</I> so the 
 words may be rendered, denoting the efficacy of these lusts, and what 
 power they have over those who yield themselves up unto them. 

 5. We are <I>by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</I> The
 Jews were so, as well as the Gentiles; and one man is as much so as 
 another by nature, not only by custom and imitation, but from the time 
 when we began to exist, and by reason of our natural inclinations and 
 appetites. All men, being naturally children of disobedience, are also 
 by nature children of wrath: God is angry with the wicked every day.
 Our state and course are such as deserve wrath, and would end in 
 eternal wrath, if divine grace did not interpose. What reason have 
 sinners then to be looking out for that grace that will make them, of 
 children of wrath, children of God and heirs of glory! Thus far the 
 apostle has described the misery of a natural state in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:1-3">these verses</A>,

 which we shall find him pursuing again in some following ones.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith
 he loved us,
 &nbsp; 5  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
 with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
 &nbsp; 6  And hath raised <I>us</I> up together, and made <I>us</I> sit together
 in heavenly <I>places</I> in Christ Jesus:
 &nbsp; 7  That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches
 of his grace in <I>his</I> kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
 yourselves: <I>it is</I> the gift of God:
 &nbsp; 9  Not of works, lest any man should boast.
 &nbsp; 10  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
 good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
 them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle begins his account of the glorious change that was 
 wrought in them by converting grace, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By whom, and in what manner, it was brought about and effected. 

 1. Negatively: <I>Not of yourselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Our faith, our conversion, and our eternal salvation, are not the mere
 product of any natural abilities, nor of any merit of our own: <I>Not 
 of works, lest any man should boast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 These things are not brought to pass by any thing done by us, and 
 therefore all boasting is excluded; he who glories must not glory in 
 himself, but in the Lord. There is no room for any man's boasting of
 his own abilities and power; or as though he had done any thing that 
 might deserve such immense favours from God. 

 2. Positively: <I>But God, who is rich in mercy,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God himself is the author of this great and happy change, and his great 
 love is the spring and fontal cause of it; hence he resolved to show 
 mercy. Love is his inclination to do us good considered simply as 
 creatures; mercy respects us as apostate and as miserable creatures.
 Observe, God's eternal love or good-will towards his creatures is the 
 fountain whence all his mercies vouch-safed to us proceed; and that 
 love of God is great love, and that mercy of his is rich mercy, 
 inexpressibly great and inexhaustibly rich. And then <I>by grace you 
 are saved</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and <I>by grace are you saved through faith--it is the gift of</I> God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, Every converted sinner is a saved sinner. Such are delivered from 
 sin and wrath; they are brought into a state of salvation, and have a 
 right given them by grace to eternal happiness. The grace that saves
 them is the free undeserved goodness and favour of God; and he saves 
 them, not <I>by the works of the law,</I> but through faith in Christ 
 Jesus, by means of which they come to partake of the great blessings of 
 the gospel; and both that faith and that salvation on which it has so 
 great an influence are the gift of God. The great objects of faith are 
 made known by divine revelation, and made credible by the testimony and 
 evidence which God hath given us; and that we believe to salvation and 
 obtain salvation through faith is entirely owing to divine assistance 
 and grace; God has ordered all so that the whole shall appear to be of 
 grace. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Wherein this change consists, in several particulars, answering to 
 the misery of our natural state, some of which are enumerated in this 
 section, and others are mentioned below. 

 1. We who were dead are quickened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 we are saved from the death of sin and have a principle of spiritual 
 life implanted in us. Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul. As 
 death locks up the senses, seals up all the powers and faculties, so 
 does a state of sin, as to any thing that is good. Grace unlocks and
 opens all, and enlarges the soul. Observe, A regenerate sinner becomes 
 a living soul: he lives a life of sanctification, being born of God; 
 and he lives in the sense of the law, being delivered from the guilt of 
 sin by pardoning and justifying grace. <I>He hath quickened us together 
 with Christ.</I> Our spiritual life results from our union with Christ; 
 it is in him that we live: <I>Because I live, you shall live also.</I> 
 
 2. We who were buried are raised up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 What remains yet to be done is here spoken of as though it were already 
 past, though indeed we are raised up in virtue of our union with him 
 whom God hath raised from the dead. When he raised Christ from the 
 dead, he did in effect raise up all believers together with him, he 
 being their common head; and when he placed him at his right hand in 
 heavenly places, he advanced and glorified them in and with him, their 
 raised and exalted head and forerunner.--<I>And made us sit together in 
 heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</I> This may be understood in another 
 sense. Sinners roll themselves in the dust; sanctified souls sit in 
 heavenly places, are raised above the world; the world is as nothing to 
 them, compared with what it has been, and compared with what the other 
 world is. Saints are not only Christ's freemen, but they are assessors 
 with him; by the assistance of his grace they have ascended with him 
 above this world to converse with another, and they live in the 
 constant expectation of it. They are not only servants to the best of
 masters in the best work, but they are exalted to reign with him; they 
 sit upon the throne with Christ, <I>as he has sat down with his Father 
 on his throne.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe what is the great design and aim of God in producing and 
 effecting this change: And this, 

 1. With respect to others: <I>That in the ages to come he might
 show,</I> &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that he might give a specimen and proof of his great goodness and 
 mercy, for the encouragement of sinners in future time. Observe, The 
 goodness of God in converting and saving sinners heretofore is a proper 
 encouragement to others in after-time to hope in his grace and mercy, 
 and to apply themselves to these. God having this in his design, poor 
 sinners should take great encouragement from it. And what may we not 
 hope for from such grace and kindness, from riches of grace, to which 
 this change is owing? <I>Through Christ Jesus,</I> by and through whom 
 God conveys all his favour and blessings to us. 

 2. With respect to the regenerated sinners themselves: <I>For we are 
 his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It appears that all is of grace, because all our spiritual advantages 
 are from God. <I>We are his workmanship;</I> he means in respect of the 
 new creation; not only as men, but as saints. The new man is a new 
 creature; and God is its Creator. It is a new birth, and we are born or 
 begotten of his will. <I>In Christ Jesus,</I> that is, on the account
 of what he has done and suffered, and by the influence and operation of 
 his blessed Spirit. <I>Unto good works,</I> &c. The apostle having
 before ascribed this change to divine grace in exclusion of works, lest 
 he should seem thereby to discourage good works, he here observes that 
 though the change is to be ascribed to nothing of that nature (<I>for 
 we are the workmanship of God</I>), yet God, in his new creation, has 
 designed and prepared us for good works: <I>Created unto good 
 works,</I> with a design that we should be fruitful in them. Wherever 
 God by his grace implants good principles, they are intended to be for 
 good works. <I>Which God hath before ordained,</I> that is, decreed
 and appointed. Or, the words may be read, <I>To which God hath before
 prepared us,</I> that is, by blessing us with the knowledge of his 
 will, and with the assistance of his Holy Spirit; and by producing such 
 a change in us. <I>That we should walk in them,</I> or glorify God by
 an exemplary conversation and by our perseverance in holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Wherefore remember, that ye <I>being</I> in time past Gentiles in
 the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called
 the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
 &nbsp; 12  That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from
 the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of
 promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
 &nbsp; 13  But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are
 made nigh by the blood of Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle proceeds in his account of the miserable
 condition of these Ephesians by nature. <I>Wherefore remember,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 As if he had said, "You should remember what you have been, and compare 
 it with what you now are, in order to humble yourselves and to excite 
 your love and thankfulness to God." Note, Converted sinners ought 
 frequently to reflect upon the sinfulness and misery of the state they 
 were in by nature. <I>Gentiles in the flesh,</I> that is, living in the 
 corruption of their natures, and being destitute of circumcision, the 
 outward sign of an interest in the covenant of grace. <I>Who are
 called uncircumcision by that,</I> &c., that is, "You were reproached 
 and upbraided for it by the formal Jews, who made an external 
 profession, and who looked no further than the outward ordinance." 
 Note, Hypocritical professors are wont to value themselves chiefly on 
 their external privileges, and to reproach and despise others who are 
 destitute of them. The apostle describes the misery of their case in 
 several particulars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "<I>At that time,</I> while you were Gentiles, and in an unconverted 
 state, you were," 

 1. "In a Christless condition, without the knowledge of the Messiah, 
 and without any saving interest in him or relation to him." It is true 
 of all unconverted sinners, all those who are destitute of faith, that 
 they have no saving interest in Christ; and it must be a sad and 
 deplorable thing for a soul to be without a Christ. Being without
 Christ, they were, 

 2. <I>Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel;</I> they did not belong
 to Christ's church, and had no communion with it, that being confined 
 to the Israelitish nation. It is no small privilege to be placed in the 
 church of Christ, and to share with the members of it in the advantages 
 peculiar to it. 

 3. <I>They are strangers from the covenants of promise.</I> The
 covenant of grace has ever been the same for substance, though, having 
 undergone various additions and improvements in the several ages of the 
 church, it is called covenants; and the covenants of promise, because 
 it is made up of promises, and particularly contains the great promise 
 of the Messiah, and of eternal life through him. Now the Ephesians, in 
 their gentilism, were strangers to this covenant, having never had any 
 information nor overture of it; and all unregenerate sinners are 
 strangers to it, as they have no interest in it. Those who are without 
 Christ, and so have no interest in the Mediator of the covenant, have 
 none in the promises of the covenant. 

 4. They had no hope, that is, beyond this life--no well-grounded hope
 in God, no hope of spiritual and eternal blessings. Those who are with
 out Christ, and strangers from the covenant, can have no good hope; for 
 Christ and the covenant are the ground and foundation of all the 
 Christian's hopes. They were in a state of distance and estrangement 
 from God: <I>Without God in the world;</I> not without some general 
 knowledge of a deity, for they worshipped idols, but living without any 
 due regard to him, any acknowledged dependence on him, and any special 
 interest in him. The words are, <I>atheists in the world;</I> for, 
 though they worshipped many gods, yet they were without the true 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 further to illustrate the happy change that was made in their state: 
 <I>But now, in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off,</I> &c. 
 They were far off from Christ, from his church, from the promises, from 
 the Christian hope, and from God himself; and therefore from all good, 
 like the prodigal son in the far country: this had been represented in 
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:11-13">preceding verses</A>.

 Unconverted sinners remove themselves at a distance from God, and God
 puts them at a distance: <I>He be holds the proud afar off. "But now in 
 Christ Jesus,</I> &c., upon your conversion, by virtue of union with 
 Christ, and interest in him by faith, you are made nigh." They were 
 brought home to God, received into the church, taken into the covenant, 
 and possessed of all other privileges consequent upon these. Note, 
 <I>The saints are a people near to God. Salvation is far from the 
 wicked;</I> but God is a help at hand to his people; and this is <I>by 
 the blood of Christ,</I> by the merit of his sufferings and death. 
 Every believing sinner owes his nearness to God, and his interest in 
 his favour, to the death and sacrifice of Christ.</P>

 &nbsp; 22  In whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have now come to the last part of the chapter, which contains an 
 account of the great and mighty privileges that converted Jews and 
 Gentiles both receive from Christ. The apostle here shows that those 
 who were in a state of enmity are reconciled. Between the Jews and the
 Gentiles there had been a great enmity; so there is between God and 
 every unregenerate man. Now Jesus Christ is our peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He made peace by the sacrifice of himself; and came to reconcile, 

 1. Jews and Gentiles to each other. He <I>made both one,</I> by
 reconciling these two divisions of men, who were wont to malign, to 
 hate, and to reproach each other before. He <I>broke down the middle 
 wall of partition,</I> the ceremonial law, that made the great feud, 
 and was the badge of the Jews' peculiarity, called <I>the 
 partition-wall</I> by way of allusion to the partition in the temple, 
 which separated the court of the Gentiles from that into which the Jews 
 only had liberty to enter. Thus <I>he abolished in his flesh the 
 enmity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 By his sufferings in the flesh, to took away the binding power of the 
 ceremonial law (so removing that cause of enmity and distance between 
 them), which is here called <I>the law of commandments contained in 
 ordinances,</I> because it enjoined a multitude of external rites and 
 ceremonies, and consisted of many institutions and appointments about 
 the outward parts of divine worship. <I>The legal ceremonies were 
 abrogated by Christ, having their accomplishment in him.</I> By taking 
 these out of the way, he formed one church of believers, whether they 
 had been Jews or Gentiles. Thus he made <I>in himself of twain one new 
 man.</I> He framed both these parties into one new society, or body of 
 God's people, uniting them to himself as their common head, they being 
 renewed by the Holy Ghost, and now concurring in a new way of gospel 
 worship, <I>so making peace</I> between these two parties, who were so 
 much at variance before. 

 2. There is an enmity between God and sinners, whether Jews and
 Gentiles; and Christ came to slay that enmity, and to reconcile them 
 both to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Sin breeds a quarrel between God and men. Christ came to take up the 
 quarrel, and to bring it to an end, by reconciling both Jew and 
 Gentile, now collected and gathered into one body, to a provoked and an 
 offended God: and this <I>by the cross,</I> or by the sacrifice of 
 himself upon the cross, <I>having slain the enmity thereby.</I> He, 
 being slain or sacrificed, slew the enmity that there was between God 
 and poor sinners. The apostle proceeds to illustrate the great 
 advantages which both parties gain by the mediation of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Christ, who purchased peace on the cross, came, partly in his own 
 person, as to the Jews, who are here said to have been nigh, and partly 
 in his apostles, whom he commissioned to preach the gospel to the 
 Gentiles, who are said to have been afar off, in the sense that has 
 been given before. <I>And preached peace,</I> or published the terms of 
 reconciliation with God and of eternal life. Note here, When the
 messengers of Christ deliver his truths, it is in effect the same as if 
 he did it immediately himself. He is said to preach by them, insomuch 
 that he who receiveth them receiveth him, and he who despiseth them 
 (acting by virtue of his commission, and delivering his message) 
 despiseth and rejecteth Christ himself. Now the effect of this peace is 
 the free access which both Jews and Gentiles have unto God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>For through him,</I> in his name and by virtue of his mediation, 
 <I>we both have access</I> or admission into the presence of God, who 
 has become the common reconciled Father of both: the throne of grace is 
 erected for us to come to, and liberty of approach to that throne is 
 allowed us. Our access is by the Holy Spirit. Christ purchased for us
 leave to come to God, and the Spirit gives us a heart to come and 
 strength to come, even grace to serve God acceptably. Observe, We draw 
 nigh to God, through Jesus Christ, by the help of the Spirit. The 
 Ephesians, upon their conversion, having such an access to God, as well 
 as the Jews, and by the same Spirit, the apostle tells them, <I>Now 
 therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This he mentions by way of opposition to what he had observed of them 
 in their heathenism: they were now no longer <I>aliens from the 
 commonwealth of Israel,</I> and no longer what the Jews were wont to 
 account all the nations of the earth besides themselves (namely, 
 strangers to God), <I>but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the 
 household of God,</I> that is, members of the church of Christ, and 
 having a right to all the privileges of it. Observe here, The church is 
 compared to a city, and every converted sinner is free of it. It is 
 also compared to a house, and every converted sinner is one of the 
 domestics, one of the family, a servant and a child in God's house. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>

 the church is compared to a building. The apostles and prophets are 
 <I>the foundation</I> of that building. They may be so called in a 
 secondary sense, Christ himself being the primary foundation; but we 
 are rather to understand it of the doctrine delivered by the prophets 
 of the Old Testament and the apostles of the New. It follows, <I>Jesus 
 Christ himself being the chief corner-stone.</I> In him both Jews and 
 Gentiles meet, and constitute one church; and Christ supports the 
 building by his strength: <I>In whom all the building, fitly framed 
 together,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 All believers, of whom it consists, being united to Christ by faith, 
 and among themselves by Christian charity, <I>grow unto a holy 
 temple,</I> become a sacred society, in which there is much communion 
 between God and his people, as in the temple, they worshipping and 
 serving him, he manifesting himself unto them, they offering up 
 spiritual sacrifices to God and he dispensing his blessings and favours 
 to them. Thus the building, for the nature of it, is a temple, a holy 
 temple; for the church is the place which God hath chosen to put his 
 name there, and it becomes such a temple by grace and strength derived 
 from himself--<I>in the Lord.</I> The universal church being built upon 
 Christ as the foundation-stone, and united in Christ as the 
 corner-stone, comes at length to be glorified in him as the top-stone: 
 <I>In whom you also are built together,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Observe, Not only the universal church is called the temple of God, but
 particular churches; and even every true believer is a living temple, 
 is <I>a habitation of God through the Spirit.</I> God dwells in all 
 believers now, they having become the temple of God through the 
 operations of the blessed Spirit, and his dwelling with them now is an 
 earnest of their dwelling together with him to eternity.</P>
