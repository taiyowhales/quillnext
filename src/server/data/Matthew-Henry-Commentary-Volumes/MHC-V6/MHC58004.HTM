 The apostle, having in the foregoing chapter set forth the sin and 
 punishment of the ancient Jews, proceeds in this, 

 I. To declare that our privileges by Christ under the gospel exceed the
 privileges of the Jewish church under Moses, as a reason why we should
 make a right improvement of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He assigns the cause why the ancient Hebrews did not profit by
 their religious privileges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">ver. 2</A>.
 
 Then, 

 III. Confirms the privileges of those who believe, and the misery of
 those who continue in unbelief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:3-10">ver. 3-10</A>.

 IV. Concludes with proper and powerful arguments and motives to faith
 and obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <I>us</I> of
 entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of
 it.
 &nbsp; 2  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them:
 but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
 faith in them that heard <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 3  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
 I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
 although the works were finished from the foundation of the
 world.
 &nbsp; 4  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <I>day</I> on this
 wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
 &nbsp; 5  And in this <I>place</I> again, If they shall enter into my rest.
 &nbsp; 6  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
 and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of
 unbelief:
 &nbsp; 7  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
 after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his
 voice, harden not your hearts.
 &nbsp; 8  For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
 have spoken of another day.
 &nbsp; 9  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
 &nbsp; 10  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
 from his own works, as God <I>did</I> from his.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. The apostle declares that our privileges by Christ under the 
 gospel are not only as great, but greater than those enjoyed under the 
 Mosaic law. He specifies this, that we have a promise left us of 
 entering into his rest; that is, of entering into a covenant-relation 
 to Christ, and a state of communion with God through Christ, and of 
 growing up therein, till we are made perfect in glory. We have 
 discoveries of this rest, and proposals, and the best directions how we 
 may attain unto it. This promise of spiritual rest is a promise left us 
 by the Lord Jesus Christ in his last will and testament, as a precious 
 legacy. Our business is to see to it that we be the legatees, that we 
 lay our claim to that rest and freedom from the dominion of sin, Satan, 
 and the flesh, by which the souls of men are kept in servitude and 
 deprived of the true rest of the soul, and may be also set free from 
 the yoke of the law and all the toilsome ceremonies and services of it, 
 and may enjoy peace with God in his ordinances and providences, and in 
 our own consciences, and so have the prospect and earnest of perfect 
 and everlasting rest in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He demonstrates the truth of his assertion, that we have as great 
 advantages as they. For says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>To us was the gospel preached as well as unto them;</I> the same 
 gospel for substance was preached under both Testaments, though not so 
 clearly; not in so comfortable a manner under the Old as under the New. 
 The best privileges the ancient Jews had were their gospel privileges; 
 the sacrifices and ceremonies of the Old Testament were the gospel of 
 that dispensation; and, whatever was excellent in it, was the respect 
 it had to Christ. Now, if this was their highest privilege, we are not 
 inferior to them; for we have the gospel as well as they, and in 
 greater purity and perspicuity than they had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He again assigns the reason why so few of the ancient Jews 
 profited by that dispensation of the gospel which they enjoyed, and 
 that was their want of faith: <I>The word preached did not profit them 
 because it was not mixed with faith in those that heard him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The word is preached to us that we may profit by it, that we may 
 gain spiritual riches by it; it is a price put into our hands to get 
 wisdom, the rich endowment of the soul. 

 2. There have been in all ages a great many unprofitable hearers; many
 who seem to deal much in sermons, in hearing the word of God, but gain 
 nothing to their souls thereby; and those who are not gainers by 
 hearing are great losers. 

 3. That which is at the bottom of all our unprofitableness under the
 word is our unbelief. We do not mix faith with what we hear; it is 
 faith in the hearer that is the life of the word. Though the preacher 
 believes the gospel, and endeavours to mix faith with his preaching, 
 and to speak as one who has believed and so spoken, yet, if the hearers 
 have not faith in their souls to mix with the word, they will be never 
 the better for it. This faith must mingle with every word, and be in 
 act and exercise while we are hearing; and, when we have heard the 
 word, assenting to the truth of it, approving of it, accepting the 
 mercy offered, applying the word to ourselves with suitable affections, 
 then we shall find great profit and gain by the word preached.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. On these considerations the apostle grounds his repeated and
 earnest caution and counsel that those who enjoy the gospel should 
 maintain a holy fear and jealousy over themselves, lest latent unbelief 
 should rob them of the benefit of the word, and of that spiritual rest 
 which is discovered and tendered in the gospel: <I>Let us fear lest, a 
 promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem 
 to come short of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Grace and glory are attainable by all under the gospel: there is an 
 offer, and a promise to those who shall accept the offer. 

 2. Those who may attain them may also fall short.  Those who might have 
 attained salvation by faith may fall short by unbelief.

 3. It is a dreadful thing so much as to seem to fall short of the
 gospel salvation, to seem so to themselves, to lose their comfortable 
 hope; and to seem so to others, so losing the honour of their holy 
 profession. But, if it be so dreadful to seem to fall short of this 
 rest, it is much more dreadful really to fall short. Such a 
 disappointment must be fatal. 

 4. One good means to prevent either our real falling short or seeming
 to fall short is to maintain a holy and religious fear lest we should 
 fall short. This will make us vigilant and diligent, sincere and
 serious; this fear will put us upon examining our faith and exercising 
 it; whereas presumption is the high road to ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The apostle confirms the happiness of all those who truly believe 
 the gospel; and this he does,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By asserting so positively the truth of it, from the experience of 
 himself and others: "<I>We, who have believed, do enter into rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We enter into a blessed union with Christ, and into a communion with 
 God through Christ; in this state we actually enjoy many sweet 
 communications of pardon of sin, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy 
 Ghost, increase of grace and earnests of glory, resting from the 
 servitude of sin, and reposing ourselves in God till we are prepared to 
 rest with him in heaven."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He illustrates and confirms it that those who believe are thus 
 happy, and do enter into rest. 

 (1.) From God's finishing his work of creation, and so entering into 
 his rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 appointing our first parents to rest the seventh day, to rest in God. 
 Now as God finished his work, and then rested from it, and acquiesced 
 in it, so he will cause those who believe to finish their work, and 
 then to enjoy their rest. 

 (2.) From God's continuing the observance of the sabbath, after the 
 fall, and the revelation of a Redeemer. They were to keep the seventh 
 day a holy sabbath to the Lord, therein praising him who had raised 
 them up out of nothing by creating power, and praying to him that he 
 would create them anew by his Spirit of grace, and direct their faith 
 to the promised Redeemer and restorer of all things, by which faith 
 they find rest in their souls. 

 (3.) From God's proposing Canaan as a typical rest for the Jews who 
 believed: and as those who did believe, Caleb and Joshua, did actually 
 enter into Canaan; so those who now believe shall enter into rest. 

 (4.) From the certainty of another rest besides that seventh day of 
 rest instituted and observed both before and after the fall, and 
 besides that typical Canaan-rest which most of the Jews fell short of 
 by unbelief; for the Psalmist has spoken of another day and another 
 rest, whence it is evident that there is a more spiritual and excellent 
 sabbath remaining for the people of God than that into which Joshua led 
 the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>),

 and this rest remaining, 

 [1.] A rest of grace, and comfort, and holiness, in the gospel state.
 This is the rest wherewith the Lord Jesus, our Joshua, causes weary 
 souls and awakened consciences to rest, and this is the refreshing.

 [2.] A rest in glory, the everlasting sabbatism of heaven, which is the 
 repose and perfection of nature and grace too, where the people of God 
 shall enjoy the end of their faith and the object of all their desires.

 (5.) This is further proved from the glorious forerunners who have 
 actually taken possession of this rest--God and Christ. It is certain 
 that God, after the creating of the world in six days, entered into his 
 rest; and it is certain that Christ, when he had finished the work of 
 our redemption, entered into his rest; and these were not only 
 examples, but earnests, that believers shall enter into their rest: 
 <I>He that hath entered into rest hath also ceased from his own works 
 as God did from his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Every true believer hath ceased from his own works of righteousness, 
 and from the burdensome works of the law, as God and Christ have ceased 
 from their works of creation and redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostle confirms the misery of those who do not believe; they 
 shall never enter into this spiritual rest, either of grace here or 
 glory hereafter. This is as certain as the word and oath of God can 
 make it. As sure as God has entered into his rest, so sure it is that 
 obstinate unbelievers shall be excluded. As sure as the unbelieving 
 Jews fell in the wilderness, and never reached the promised land, so 
 sure it is that unbelievers shall fall into destruction, and never 
 reach heaven. As sure as Joshua, the great captain of the Jews, could 
 not give them possession of Canaan because of their unbelief, 
 notwithstanding his eminent valour and conduct, so sure it is that even 
 Jesus himself, and captain of our salvation, notwithstanding all that 
 fulness of grace and strength that dwells in him, will not, cannot, 
 give to final unbelievers either spiritual or eternal rest: it remains 
 only for the people of God; others by their sin abandon themselves to 
 eternal restlessness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any
 man fall after the same example of unbelief.
 &nbsp; 12  For the word of God <I>is</I> quick, and powerful, and sharper
 than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
 soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <I>is</I> a
 discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
 &nbsp; 13  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
 sight: but all things <I>are</I> naked and opened unto the eyes of him
 with whom we have to do.
 &nbsp; 14  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
 into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <I>our</I>
 profession.
 &nbsp; 15  For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with
 the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
 like as <I>we are, yet</I> without sin.
 &nbsp; 16  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
 we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this latter part of the chapter the apostle concludes, first, with a 
 serious repeated exhortation, and then with proper and powerful 
 motives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here we have a serious exhortation: <I>Let us labour therefore to 
 enter into that rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The end proposed--rest spiritual and eternal, the rest of grace here 
 and glory hereafter--in Christ on earth, with Christ in heaven. 

 2. The way to this end prescribed--labour, diligent labour; this is the
 only way to rest; those who will not work now shall not rest hereafter.
 After due and diligent labour, sweet and satisfying rest shall follow; 
 and labour now will make that rest more pleasant when it comes. <I>The 
 sleep of the labouring man is sweet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:12">Eccl. v. 12</A>.

 Let us therefore labour, let us all agree and be unanimous in this, and
 let us quicken one another, and call upon one another to this 
 diligence. It is the truest act of friendship, when we see our 
 fellow-christians loiter, to call upon them to mind their business and 
 labour at it in earnest. "Come, Sirs, let us all go to work; why do we
 sit still? Why do we loiter? Come, let us labour; now is our working 
 time, our rest remains." Thus should Christians call upon themselves 
 and one another to be diligent in duty; and so much the more as we see 
 the day approaching.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here we have proper and powerful motives to make the advice 
 effectual, which are drawn,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the dreadful example of those who have already perished by 
 unbelief: <I>Lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</I> 
 To have seen so many fall before us will be a great aggravation of our 
 sin, if we will not take warning by them: their ruin calls loudly upon 
 us; their lost and restless souls cry to us from their torments, that 
 we do not, by sinning as they did, make ourselves miserable as they 
 are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the great help and advantage we may have from the word of God 
 to strengthen our faith, and excite our diligence, that we may obtain 
 this rest: <I>The word of God is quick and powerful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 By the word of God we may understand either the essential or the 
 written word: the essential <I>Word,</I> that in <I>the beginning was 
 with God, and was God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>),

 the Lord Jesus Christ, and indeed what is said in this verse is true
 concerning him; but most understand it of the written word, the holy 
 scriptures, which are the word of God. Now of this word it is said, 
 
 (1.) That is <I>quick;</I> it is very lively and active, in all its 
 efforts, in seizing the conscience of the sinner, in cutting him to the 
 heart, and in comforting him and binding up the wounds of the soul. 
 Those know not the word of God who call it a dead letter; it is quick, 
 compared to the light, and nothing quicker than the light; it is not 
 only quick, but quickening; it is a vital light; it is a living word, 
 <B><I>zon.</I></B> Saints die, and sinners die; but the word of God 
 lives. <I>All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower 
 of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away, but 
 the word of the Lord endureth for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:24,25">1 Pet. i. 24, 25</A>.

 <I>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for
 ever? But my words, which I commanded the prophets, did they not take 
 hold of your fathers?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5,6">Zech. i. 5, 6</A>.

 (2.) It is <I>powerful.</I> When God sets it home by his Spirit, it
 convinces powerfully, converts powerfully, and comforts powerfully. It 
 is so powerful as to pull down strong holds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:4,5">2 Cor. x. 4, 5</A>),

 to raise the dead, to make the deaf to hear, the blind to see, the dumb 
 to speak, and the lame to walk. It is powerful to batter down Satan's 
 kingdom, and to set up the kingdom of Christ upon the ruins thereof. 
 
 (3.) It is <I>sharper than any two-edged sword;</I> it cuts both ways;
 it is <I>the sword of the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:17">Eph. vi. 17</A>.

 It is the two-edged sword that cometh out of the mouth of Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:16">Rev. i. 16</A>.

 It is sharper than any two-edged sword, for it will enter where no
 other sword can, and make a more critical dissection: it <I>pierces to 
 the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit,</I> the soul and its 
 habitual prevailing temper; it makes a soul that has been a long time 
 of a proud spirit to be humble, of a perverse spirit to be meek and 
 obedient. Those sinful habits that have become as it were natural to 
 the soul, and rooted deeply in it, and become in a manner one with it, 
 are separated and cut off by this sword. It cuts off ignorance from the 
 understanding, rebellion from the will, and enmity from the mind, 
 which, when carnal, is enmity itself against God. This sword divides 
 between <I>the joints and the marrow,</I> the most secret, close, and 
 intimate parts of the body; this sword can cut off the lusts of the 
 flesh as well as the lusts of the mind, and make men willing to undergo 
 the sharpest operation for the mortifying of sin.

 (4.) It is <I>a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,</I> 
 even the most secret and remote thoughts and designs. It will discover 
 to men the variety of their thoughts and purposes, the vileness of 
 them, the bad principles they are actuated by, the sinister and sinful 
 ends they act to. The word will turn the inside of a sinner out, and 
 let him see all that is in his heart. Now such a word as this must 
 needs be a great help to our faith and obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. From the perfections of the Lord Jesus Christ, both of his person 
 and office.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His person, particularly his omniscience: <I>Neither is there any 
 creature that is not manifest in his sight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This is agreeable to what Christ speaks of himself: <I>All the churches 
 shall know that I am he that searches the reins and hearts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>.
 
 None of the creatures can be concealed from Christ; none of the
 creatures of God, for Christ is the Creator of them all; and there are
 none of the motions and workings of our heads and hearts (which may be
 called creatures of our own) but what are open and manifest to him with 
 whom we have to do as the object of our worship, and the high priest of 
 our profession. He, by his omniscience, cuts up the sacrifice we bring 
 to him, that it may be presented to the Father. Now as the high priest 
 inspected the sacrificed beasts, cut them up to the back-bone to see 
 whether they were sound at heart, so all things are thus dissected, and 
 lie open to the piercing eye of our great high priest. An he who now 
 tries our sacrifices will at length, as Judge, try our state. We shall 
 have to do with him as one who will determine our everlasting state. 
 Some read the words, <I>to whom with us there is an account or 
 reckoning.</I> Christ has an exact account of us all. He has accounted 
 for all who believe on him; and he will account with all: our accounts 
 are before him. This omniscience of Christ, and the account we owe of 
 ourselves to him, should engage us to persevere in faith and obedience 
 till he has perfected all our affairs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have an account of the excellency and perfection of Christ, as 
 to his office, and this particular office of our high priest. The 
 apostle first instructs Christians in the knowledge of their high 
 priest, what kind of high priest he is, and then puts them in mind of 
 the duty they owe on this account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What kind of high priest Christ is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Seeing we have such a high priest;</I> that is, <I>First,</I> A 
 great high priest, much greater than Aaron, or any of the priests of 
 his order. The high priests under the law were accounted great and 
 venerable persons; but they were but faint types and shadows of Christ.
 The greatness of our high priest is set forth, 

 1. By his having passed into the heavens. The high priest under the
 law, once a year, went out of the people's sight within the veil, into 
 the holiest of all, where were the sacred signals of the presence of 
 God; but Christ once for all has passed into the heavens, to take the 
 government of all upon him, to send the Spirit to prepare a place for 
 his people, and to make intercession for them. Christ executed one
 part of his priesthood on earth, in dying for us; the other he executes 
 in heaven, by pleading the cause, and presenting the offerings, of his 
 people. 

 2. The greatness of Christ is set forth by his name, <I>Jesus</I>--a
 physician and a Saviour, and one of a divine nature, the Son of God by 
 eternal generation; and therefore having divine perfection, able to 
 save to the uttermost all who come to God by him. <I>Secondly,</I> He
 is not only a great, but a gracious high priest, merciful, 
 compassionate, and sympathizing with his people: <I>We have not a high 
 priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though he is so great, and so far above us, yet he is very kind, and 
 tenderly concerned for us. He is touched with the feeling of our 
 infirmities in such a manner as none else can be; for he was himself 
 tried with all the afflictions and troubles that are incident to our 
 nature in its fallen state: and this not only that he might be able to 
 satisfy for us, but to sympathize with us. But then, <I>Thirdly,</I> He 
 is a sinless high priest: <I>He was in all things tempted as we are, 
 yet without sin.</I> He was tempted by Satan, but he came off without 
 sin. We seldom meet with temptations but they give us some shock. We
 are apt to give back, though we do not yield; but our great high priest 
 came off clear in his encounter with the devil, who could neither find 
 any sin in him nor fix any stain upon him. He was tried severely by the 
 Father. It pleased the Lord to bruise him; and yet he sinned not, 
 either in thought, word, or deed. He had done no violence, neither was 
 there any deceit in his mouth. He was holy, harmless, and undefiled; 
 and such a high priest became us. Having thus told us what a one our 
 high priest is, the apostle proceeds to show us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How we should demean ourselves towards him. <I>First,</I> Let us 
 hold fast our profession of faith in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Let us never deny him, never be ashamed of him before men. Let us hold 
 fast the enlightening doctrines of Christianity in our heads, the 
 enlivening principles of it in our hearts, the open profession of it in 
 our lips, and our practical and universal subjection to it in our 
 lives. Observe here, 

 1. We ought to be possessed of the doctrines, principles, and practice,
 of the Christian life. 

 2. When we are so, we may be in danger of losing our hold, from the
 corruption of our hearts, the temptations of Satan, and the allurements 
 of this evil world. 

 3. The excellency of the high priest of our profession would make our
 apostasy from him most heinous and inexcusable; it would be the 
 greatest folly and the basest ingratitude.

 4. Christians must not only set out well, but they must hold out: those
 who endure to the end will be saved, and none but they.
 <I>Secondly,</I> We should encourage ourselves, by the excellency of 
 our high priest, to come boldly to the throne of grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. There is a throne of grace set up, a way of worship instituted, in 
 which God may with honour meet poor sinners, and treat with them, and
 they may with hope draw nigh to him, repenting and believing. God
 might have set up a tribunal of strict and inexorable justice, 
 dispensing death, the wages of sin, to all who were convened before it; 
 but he has chosen to set up a throne of grace. A throne speaks 
 authority, and bespeaks awe and reverence. A throne of grace speaks 
 great encouragement even to the chief of sinners. There grace reigns, 
 and acts with sovereign freedom, power, and bounty. 

 2. It is our duty and interest to be often found before this throne of
 grace, waiting on the Lord in all the duties of his worship, private 
 and public. It is good for us to be there. 

 3. Our business and errand at the throne of grace should be that we
 <I>may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</I> Mercy 
 and grace are the things we want, mercy to pardon all our sins and 
 grace to purify our souls. 

 4. Besides the daily dependence we have upon God for present supplies,
 there are some seasons in which we shall most sensibly need the mercy 
 and grace of God, and we should lay up prayers against such 
 seasons--times of temptation, either by adversity or prosperity, and 
 especially a dying time: we should every day put up a petition for 
 mercy in our last day. The Lord grant unto us that we may find mercy
 of the Lord at that day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:18">2 Tim. i. 18</A>.

 5. In all our approaches to this throne of grace for mercy, we should
 come with a humble freedom and boldness, with a liberty of spirit and a 
 liberty of speech; we should ask in faith, nothing doubting; we should 
 come with a Spirit of adoption, as children to a reconciled God and 
 Father. We are indeed to come with reverence and godly fear, but not 
 with terror and amazement; not as if we were dragged before the 
 tribunal of justice, but kindly invited to the mercy-seat, where grace 
 reigns, and loves to exert and exalt itself towards us. 

 6. The office of Christ, as being our high priest, and such a high
 priest, should be the ground of our confidence in all our approaches to 
 the throne of grace. Had we not a Mediator, we could have no boldness 
 in coming to God; for we are guilty and polluted creatures. All we do
 is polluted; we cannot go into the presence of God alone; we must 
 either go in the hand of a Mediator or our hearts and our hopes will 
 fail us. We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of 
 Jesus. He is our Advocate, and, while he pleads for his people, he 
 pleads with the price in his hand, by which he purchased all that our 
 souls want or can desire.</P>
