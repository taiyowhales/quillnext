 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
 and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
 begotten of him.
 &nbsp; 2  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we
 love God, and keep his commandments.
 &nbsp; 3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:
 and his commandments are not grievous.
 &nbsp; 4  For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
 is the victory that overcometh the world, <I>even</I> our faith.
 &nbsp; 5  Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
 that Jesus is the Son of God?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle having, in the conclusion of the last chapter, as was 
 there observed, urged Christian love upon those two accounts, as 
 suitable to Christian profession and as suitable to the divine command, 
 here adds a third: Such love is suitable, and indeed demanded, by their 
 eminent relation; our Christian brethren or fellow-believers are nearly 
 related to God; they are his children: <I>Whosoever believeth that 
 Jesus is the Christ is born of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Here the Christian brother is, 

 1. Described by his faith; he that <I>believeth that Jesus is the
 Christ</I>--that he is Messiah the prince, that he is the Son of God by 
 nature and office, that he is the chief of all the anointed world, 
 chief of all the priests, prophets, or kings, who were ever anointed by 
 God or for him, that he is perfectly prepared and furnished for the 
 whole work of the eternal salvation-accordingly yields himself up to 
 his care and direction; and then he is, 

 2. Dignified by his descent: <I>He is born of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This principle of faith, and the new nature that attends it or from 
 which it springs, are ingenerated by the Spirit of God; and so sonship 
 and adoption are not now appropriated <I>to the seed of Abraham 
 according to the flesh,</I> not to the ancient Israel of God; all 
 believers, though by nature sinners of the Gentiles, are spiritually 
 descended from God, and accordingly are to be beloved; as it is added: 
 <I>Every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is 
 begotten of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It seems but natural that he who loves the Father should love the 
 children also, and that in some proportion to their resemblance to 
 their Father and to the Father's love to them; and so we must first and 
 principally love <I>the Son of the Father,</I> as he is most 
 emphatically styled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:3">2 John 3</A>,

 <I>the only</I> (necessarily) <I>begotten,</I> and <I>the Son of his
 love,</I> and then those that are voluntarily begotten, and <I>renewed 
 by the Spirit of grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle shows, 

 1. How we may discern the truth, or the true evangelical nature of our
 love to the regenerate. The ground of it must be our love to God, whose 
 they are: <I>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we 
 love God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Our love to them appears to be sound and genuine when we love them not 
 merely upon any secular account, as because they are rich, or learned, 
 or kind to us, or of our denomination among religious parties; but 
 because they are God's children, his regenerating grace appears in 
 them, his image and superscription are upon them, and so in them God 
 himself is loved. Thus we see what that love to the brethren is that is 
 so pressed in this epistle; it is love to them as the children of God 
 and the adopted brethren of the Lord Jesus. 

 2. How we may learn the truth of our love to God--it appears in our
 holy obedience: <I>When we love God, and keep his commandments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Then we truly, and in gospel account, love God, when we keep his 
 commandments: <I>For this is the love of God, that we keep his 
 commandments;</I> and the keeping of his commandments requires a spirit 
 inclined thereto and delighting herein; <I>and so his commandments are 
 not grievous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Or, <I>This is the love of God, that,</I> as thereby we are determined 
 to obedience, and to keep the commandments of God, so his commandments 
 are thereby made easy and pleasant to us. The lover of God says, "<I>O 
 how I love thy law! I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou 
 shalt enlarge my heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32">Ps. cxix. 32</A>),

 when thou shalt enlarge it either with love or with thy Spirit, the 
 spring of love." 

 3. What is and ought to be the result and effect of regeneration--an
 intellectual spiritual conquest of this world: <I>For</I> whatsoever 
 <I>is born of God,</I> or, as in some copies, whosoever <I>is born of 
 God, overcometh the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He that is born of God is born <I>for</I> God, and consequently for 
 another world. He has a temper and disposition that tend to a higher
 and better world; and he is furnished with such arms, or such a weapon, 
 whereby he can repel and conquer this; as it is added, <I>And this is 
 the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Faith is the cause of victory, the means, the instrument, the spiritual 
 armour and artillery by which we overcome; for,

 (1.) In and by faith we cleave to Christ, in contempt of, and 
 opposition to, the world. 

 (2.) Faith works in and by love to God and Christ, and so withdraws us 
 from the love of the world.

 (3.) Faith sanctifies the heart, and purifies it from those sensual 
 lusts by which the world obtains such sway and dominion over souls.
 
 (4.) It receives and derives strength from the object of it, the Son of 
 God, for conquering the frowns and flatteries of the world. 

 (5.) It obtains by gospel promise a right to the indwelling Spirit of 
 grace, that is greater than he who dwells in the world. 

 (6.) It sees an invisible world at hand, with which this world is not 
 worthy to be compared, and into which it tells the soul in which it 
 resides it must be continually prepared to enter; and thereupon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle concludes that it is the real Christian that is the 
 true conqueror of the world: <I>Who is he</I> then <I>that overcometh 
 the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is the world that lies in our way to heaven, and is the great 
 impediment to our entrance there. But he who believes that Jesus is the 
 Son of God believes therein that Jesus came from God to be the Saviour
 of the world, and powerfully to conduct us from the world to heaven, 
 and to God, who is fully to be enjoyed there. And he who so believes 
 must needs by this faith overcome the world. For, 

 1. He must be well satisfied that this world is a vehement enemy to his
 soul, to his holiness, his salvation, and his blessedness. <I>For all 
 that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and 
 the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16"><I>ch.</I> ii. 16</A>.

 2. He sees it must be a great part of the Saviour's work, and of his
 own salvation, to be redeemed and rescued from this malignant world. 
 <I>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this 
 present evil world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:4">Gal. i. 4</A>.

 3. He sees in and by the life and conduct of the Lord Jesus on earth
 that this world is to be renounced and overcome. 

 4. He perceives that the Lord Jesus conquered the world, not for
 himself only, but for his followers; and they must study to be 
 partakers of his victory. <I>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the 
 world.</I> 

 5. He is taught and influenced by the Lord Jesus's death to be
 mortified and crucified to the world. <I>God forbid that I should 
 glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is 
 crucified to me, and I unto the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14">Gal. vi. 14</A>.

 6. He is begotten by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to
 the lively hope of a blessed world above,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3">1 Pet. i. 3</A>.

 7. He knows that the Saviour has gone to heaven, and is there preparing
 a place for his serious believers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2">John xiv. 2</A>.

 8. He knows that his Saviour will come again thence, and will put an
 end to this world, and judge the inhabitants of it, and receive his 
 believers to his presence and glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:3">John xiv. 3</A>.

 9. He is possessed with a spirit and disposition that cannot be
 satisfied with this world, that look beyond it, and are still tending,
 striving, and pressing, towards the world in heaven. <I>In this we
 groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is
 from heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:2">2 Cor. v. 2</A>.

 So that it is the Christian religion that affords its proselytes a
 universal empire. It is the Christian revelation that is the great 
 means of conquering the world, and gaining another that is most pure 
 and peaceful, blessed and eternal. It is there, in that revelation, 
 that we see what are the occasion and ground of the quarrel and contest 
 between the holy God and this rebellious world. It is there that we 
 meet with sacred doctrine (both speculative and practical), quite 
 contrary to the tenour, temper, and tendency of this world. It is by 
 that doctrine that a spirit is communicated and diffused which is 
 superior and adverse to the spirit of the world. It is there we see 
 that the Saviour himself was not of this world that his kingdom was not 
 and is not so, that it must be separated from the world and gathered 
 out of it for heaven and for God. There we see that the Saviour designs 
 not this world for the inheritance and portion of his saved company. As 
 he has gone to heaven himself, so he assures them he goes to prepare 
 for their residence there, as designing they should always dwell with 
 him, and allowing them to believe that if in this life, and this world 
 only, they had hope in him, they should at last be but miserable. It is 
 there that the eternal blessed world is most clearly revealed and 
 proposed to our affection and pursuit. It is there that we are 
 furnished with the best arms and artillery against the assaults and 
 attempts of the world. It is there that we are taught how the world may 
 be out-shot in its own bow, or its artillery turned against itself; and 
 its oppositions, encounters, and persecutions, be made serviceable to 
 our conquest of the world, and to our motion and ascent to the higher 
 heavenly world: and there we are encouraged by a whole army and cloud 
 of holy soldiers, who have in their several ages, posts, and stations, 
 overcome the world, and won the crown. It is the real Christian that is 
 the proper hero, who vanquishes the world and rejoices in a universal 
 victory. Nor does he (for he is far superior to the Grecian monarch) 
 mourn that there is not another world to be subdued, but lays hold on 
 the eternal world of life, and in a sacred sense takes the kingdom of 
 heaven by violence too. Who in all the world but the believer on Jesus 
 Christ can thus overcome the world?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  This is he that came by water and blood, <I>even</I> Jesus Christ;
 not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit
 that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
 &nbsp; 7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
 the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
 &nbsp; 8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit,
 and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
 &nbsp; 9  If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
 greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified
 of his Son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The faith of the Christian believer (or the believer in Christ) being 
 thus mighty and victorious, it had need to be well founded, to be 
 furnished with unquestionable celestial evidence concerning the divine 
 mission, authority, and office of the Lord Jesus; and it is so; he 
 brings his credentials along with him, and he brings them in a way by 
 which he came and in the witness that attends him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the way and manner by which he came; not barely by which he came 
 into the world, but by and with which he came, and appeared, and acted, 
 as a Saviour in the world: <I>This is he that came by water and 
 blood.</I> He came to save us from our sins, to give us eternal life, 
 and bring us to God; and, that he might the more assuredly do this, 
 <I>he came by,</I> or with, <I>water and blood. Even Jesus Christ;</I> 
 Jesus Christ, I say, did so; and none but he. And I say it again, not 
 by or with <I>water only, but by</I> and with <I>water and blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>Jesus Christ came with water and blood,</I> as the notes and 
 signatures of the true effectual Saviour of the world; and he came by 
 water and blood as the means by which he would heal and save us. That
 he must and did thus come in his saving office may appear by our 
 remembering these things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are inwardly and outwardly defiled. 

 (1.) Inwardly, by the power and pollution of sin and in our nature.
 For our cleansing from this we need spiritual water; such as can reach 
 the soul and the powers of it. Accordingly, there is in and by Christ
 Jesus <I>the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy 
 Ghost.</I> And this was intimated to the apostles by our Lord, when he 
 washed their feet, and said to Peter, who refused to be washed, 
 <I>Except I wash thee, thou hast no part in me.</I> 

 (2.) We are defiled outwardly, by the guilt and condemning power of sin 
 upon our persons. By this we are separated from God, and banished from
 his favourable, gracious, beatific presence for ever. From this we must 
 be purged by atoning blood. It is the law or determination in the court 
 of heaven <I>that without shedding of blood there shall be no 
 remission,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.

 The Saviour from sin therefore must come with blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Both these ways of cleansing were represented in the old ceremonial 
 institutions of God. Persons and things must be purified by water and 
 blood. <I>There were divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed till 
 the time of reformation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>.

 <I>The ashes of a heifer,</I> mixed with water, <I>sprinkling the
 unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:13,Nu+19:9">Heb. ix. 13; Num. xix. 9</A>.

 <I>And likewise almost all things are, by the law, purged with
 blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.

 As those show us our double defilement, so they indicate the Saviour's
 two-fold purgation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. At and upon the death of Jesus Christ, his side being pierced with a 
 soldier's spear, out of the wound there immediately issued water and 
 blood. This the beloved apostle saw, and he seems to have been affected 
 with the sight; he alone records it, and seems to reckon himself 
 obliged to record it, and seems to reckon himself obliged to record it, 
 as containing something mysterious in it: <I>And he that saw it bore 
 record, and his record is true. And he knoweth,</I> being an 
 eye-witness, <I>that he saith true, that you might believe,</I> and 
 that you might believe this particularly, that out of his pierced side 
 <I>forthwith there came water and blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:34,35">John xix. 34, 35</A>.

 Now this water and blood are comprehensive of all that is necessary and
 effectual to our salvation. By the water our souls are washed and 
 purified for heaven and the region of saints in light. By the blood God 
 is glorified, his law is honoured, and his vindictive excellences are 
 illustrated and displayed. <I>Whom God hath set forth,</I> or purposed, 
 or proposed, <I>a propitiation through faith in his blood,</I> or a 
 propitiation in or by his blood through faith, <I>to declare his 
 righteousness, that he may be just, and the justifier of him that 
 believeth in Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25,26">Rom. iii. 25, 26</A>.

 By the blood we are justified, reconciled, and presented righteous to
 God. By the blood, the curse of the law being satisfied, and purifying 
 Spirit is obtained for the internal ablution of our natures. <I>Christ 
 hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, that the blessing of 
 Abraham might come on the Gentiles, that we might receive the promise 
 of the Spirit,</I> the promised Spirit, <I>through faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Gal. iii. 13</A>,

 &c. The water, as well as the blood, issued out of the side of the
 sacrificed Redeemer. The water and the blood then comprehend all
 things that can be requisite to our salvation. They will consecrate and
 sanctify to that purpose all that God shall appoint or make use of in
 order to that great end. <I>He loved the church, and gave himself for
 it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
 the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25-27">Eph. v. 25-27</A>.

 He who comes by water and blood is an accurate perfect Saviour. And
 this is he who comes by water and blood, even Jesus Christ! Thus we see 
 in what way and manner, or, if you please, with what utensils, he 
 comes. But we see his credentials also,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the witness that attends him, and that is, the divine Spirit, 
 that Spirit to whom the perfecting of the works of God is usually 
 attributed: <I>And it is the Spirit that beareth witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It was meet that the commissioned Saviour of the world should have a 
 constant agent to support his work, and testify of him to the world. It 
 was meet that a divine power should attend him, his gospel, and 
 servants; and notify to the world upon what errand and office they 
 came, and by what authority they were sent: this was done in and by the 
 Spirit of God, according to the Saviour's own prediction, "<I>He shall 
 glorify me,</I> even when I shall be rejected and crucified by men, 
 <I>for he shall receive</I> or take <I>of mine.</I> He shall not 
 receive my immediate office; he shall not die and rise again for you; 
 <I>but he shall receive of mine,</I> shall proceed on the foundation I 
 have laid, shall take up my institution, and truth, and cause, <I>and 
 shall</I> further <I>show it unto you,</I> and by you to the world,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:14">John xvi. 14</A>.

 And then the apostle adds the commendation or the acceptableness of
 this witness: <I>Because the Spirit is truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He is the Spirit of God, and cannot lie. There is a copy that would 
 afford us a very suitable reading thus: <I>because,</I> or that, 
 <I>Christ is the truth.</I> And so it indicates the matter of the 
 Spirit's testimony, the thing which he attests, and that is, the truth 
 of Christ: <I>And it is the Spirit that beareth witness that Christ is 
 the truth;</I> and consequently that Christianity, or the Christian 
 religion, is the truth of the day, the truth of God. But it is meet 
 that one or two copies should alter the text; and our present reading 
 is very agreeable, and so we retain it. <I>The Spirit is truth.</I> He 
 is indeed the Spirit of truth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:17">John xiv. 17</A>.

 And that the Spirit is truth, and a witness worthy of all acceptation,
 appears in that he is a heavenly witness, or one of the witnesses that 
 in and from heaven bore testimony concerning the truth and authority of 
 Christ. <I>Because</I> (or for) <I>there are three that bear record in 
 heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are 
 one.</I> And so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>

 most appositely occurs, as a proof of the authenticity of the Spirit's 
 testimony; he must needs be true, or even truth itself, if he be not 
 only a witness in heaven, but <I>even one</I> (not in testimony only, 
 for so an angel may be, but in being and essence) <I>with the Father 
 and the Word.</I> But here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are stopped in our course by the contest there is about the 
 genuineness of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is alleged that many old Greek manuscripts have it not. We shall not 
 here enter into the controversy. It should seem that the critics are 
 not agreed what manuscripts have it and what not; nor do they 
 sufficiently inform us of the integrity and value of the manuscripts 
 they peruse. Some may be so faulty, as I have an old printed Greek 
 Testament so full of <I>errata,</I> that one would think no critic 
 would establish a various lection thereupon. But let the judicious 
 collators of copies manage that business. There are some rational 
 surmises that seem to support the present text and reading. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If we admit 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,
 
 in the room of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 it looks too like a tautology and repetition of what was included in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 <I>This is he that came by water and blood, not by water only, but by 
 water and blood; and it is the Spirit that beareth witness. For there
 are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood.</I> 
 This does not assign near so noble an introduction of these three 
 witnesses as our present reading does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is observed that many copies read that distinctive clause, 
 <I>upon the earth: There are three that bear record upon the earth.</I> 
 Now this bears a visible opposition to some witness or witnesses 
 elsewhere, and therefore we are told, by the adversaries of the text, 
 that this clause must be supposed to be omitted in most books that want 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 But it should for the same reason be so in all. Take we 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 <I>This is he that came by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that 
 beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.</I> It would not now 
 naturally and properly be added, <I>For there are three that bear 
 record on earth,</I> unless we should suppose that the apostle would 
 tell us that all the witnesses are such as are on earth, when yet he 
 would assure us that one is infallibly true, or even truth itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It is observed that there is a variety of reading even in the 
 Greek text, as in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Some copies read <B><I>hen eisi</I></B>--<I>are one;</I> others (at 
 least the <I>Complutensian</I>) <B><I>eis to hen eisin</I></B>--<I>are 
 to one,</I> or <I>agree in one;</I> and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>

 (in that part that it is supposed should be admitted), instead of the 
 common <B><I>en te ge</I></B>--<I>in earth, the Complutensian</I> reads 
 <B><I>epi tes ges</I></B>--<I>upon earth,</I> which seems to show that 
 that edition depended upon some Greek authority, and not merely, as 
 some would have us believe, upon the authority either of the vulgar 
 Latin or of <I>Thomas Aquinas,</I> though his testimony may be added 
 thereto.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7">seventh verse</A>

 is very agreeable to the style and the theology of our apostle; as,
 
 [1.] He delights in the title <I>the Father,</I> whether he indicates 
 thereby God only, or a divine person distinguished from the Son. I 
 <I>and</I> the Father <I>are one. And Yet I am not alone; because</I> 
 the Father <I>is with me. I will pray</I> the Father, <I>and he shall 
 give you another comforter. If any man love the world, the love of</I> 
 the Father <I>is not in him. Grace be with you, and peace from God</I> 
 the Father, <I>and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of</I> the 
 Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:3">
 2 John 3</A>.
 
 Then,

 [2.] The name <I>the Word</I> is known to be almost (if not quite)
 peculiar to this apostle. Had the text been devised by another, it had 
 been more easy and obvious, from the form of baptism, and the common 
 language of the church, to have used the name <I>Son</I> instead of 
 that of the <I>Word.</I> As it is observed that Tertullian and Cyprian 
 use that name, even when they refer to this verse; or it is made an 
 objection against their referring to this verse, because they speak of 
 the Son, not the Word; and yet Cyprian's expression seems to be very 
 clear by the citation of Facundus himself. <I>Quod Johannis apostoli
 testimonium beatus Cyprianus, Carthaginensis antistes et martyr, in 
 epistol&acirc; sive libro, quem de Trinitate scripsit, de Patre, Filio, 
 et Spiritu sancto dictum intelligit; ait enim, Dicit Dominus, Ego et 
 Pater unum sumus; et iterum de Patre, Filio, et Spiritu sancto scriptum 
 est, Et hi tres unum sunt.--Blessed Cyprian, the Carthaginian bishop 
 and martyr, in the epistle or book he wrote concerning the Trinity, 
 considered the testimony of the apostle John as relating to the Father, 
 the Son, and Holy Spirit; for he says, the Lord says, I and the Father 
 are one; and again, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit it is 
 written, And these three are one.</I> Now it is nowhere written that 
 these are one, but in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is probable then that St. Cyprian, either depending on his memory,
 or rather intending things more than words, persons more than names, or 
 calling persons by their names more usual in the church (both in 
 popular and polemic discourses), called the second by the name of the 
 <I>Son</I> rather than of the <I>Word.</I> If any man can admit 
 Facundus's fancy, that Cyprian meant that the Spirit, the water, and 
 the blood, were indeed the Father, Word, and Spirit, that John said 
 were one, he may enjoy his opinion to himself. For,

 <I>First,</I> He must suppose that Cyprian not only changed all the 
 names, but the apostle's order too. For the blood (the Son), which 
 Cyprian puts second, the apostle puts last. And, 

 <I>Secondly,</I> He must suppose that Cyprian thought that by the blood 
 which issued out of the side of the Son the apostle intended the Son 
 himself, who might as well have been denoted by the water,--that by the 
 water, which also issued from the side of the Son, the apostle intended 
 the person of the Holy Ghost,--that by the Spirit, which in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>

 is said to be truth, and in the gospel is called the Spirit of truth, 
 the apostle meant the person of the Father, though he is nowhere else 
 so called when joined with the Son and the Holy Ghost. We require good 
 proof that the <I>Carthaginian</I> father could so understand the 
 apostle. He who so understands him must believe too that the Father, 
 Son, and Holy Spirit, are said to be three witnesses on earth.

 <I>Thirdly, Facundus</I> acknowledges that Cyprian says that of his
 three it is written, <I>Et hi tres unum sunt--and these three are 
 one.</I> Now these are the words, not of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,
 
 but of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They are not used concerning the three on earth, the Spirit, the water, 
 and the blood; but the three in heaven, the Father, and the Word, and 
 the Holy Ghost. So we are told that the author of the book <I>De 
 baptismo h&aelig;reticorum,</I> allowed to be contemporary with 
 Cyprian, cites John's words, agreeably to the Greek manuscripts and the 
 ancient versions, thus: <I>Ait enim Johannes de Domino nostro in 
 epistol&acirc; nos docens, Hic es qui venit per aquam et sanguinem, 
 Jesus Christus, non in aqu&acirc; tant&ugrave;m, sed in aqu&acirc; et 
 sanguine; et Spiritus est qui testimonium perhibet, quia Spiritus est 
 veritas; quia tres testimonium perhibent, Spiritus et aqua et sanguis, 
 et isti tres in unum sunt--For John, in his epistle, says concerning 
 our Lord, This is he, Jesus Christ, who came by water and blood, not in 
 water only, but in water and blood; and it is the Spirit that bears 
 witness, because the Spirit is truth; for there are three that bear 
 witness, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree in 
 one.</I> If all the Greek manuscripts and ancient versions say 
 concerning the Spirit, the water, and the blood, that <I>in unum 
 sunt--they agree in one,</I> then it was not of them that Cyprian 
 spoke, whatever variety there might be in the copies in his time, when 
 he said it is written, <I>unum sunt--they are one.</I> And therefore 
 Cyprian's words seem still to be a firm testimony to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,

 and an intimation likewise that a forger of the text would have 
 scarcely so exactly hit upon the apostolical name for the second 
 witness in heaven, <I>the Word.</I> Them,

 [3.] As only this apostle records the history of the water and blood 
 flowing out of the Saviour's side, so it is he only, or he principally, 
 who registers to us the Saviour's promise and prediction of the Holy 
 spirit's coming to glorify him, and to testify of him, and to convince 
 the world of its own unbelief and of his righteousness, as in his 
 gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16,17,26,15:26,16:7-15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16, 17, 26; xv. 26; xvi. 7-15</A>.

 It is most suitable then to the diction and to the gospel of this
 apostle thus to mention the Holy Ghost as a witness for Jesus Christ.
 Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) It was far more easy for a transcriber, by turning away his eye, 
 or by the obscurity of the copy, it being obliterated or defaced on the 
 top or bottom of a page, or worn away in such materials as the ancients 
 had to write upon, to lose and omit the passage, than for an 
 interpolator to devise and insert it. He must be very bold and impudent 
 who could hope to escape detection and shame; and profane too, who 
 durst venture to make an addition to a supposed sacred book. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) It can scarcely be supposed that, when the apostle is representing 
 the Christian's faith in overcoming the world, and the foundation it 
 relies upon in adhering to Jesus Christ, and the various testimony that 
 was attended him, especially when we consider that he meant to infer, 
 as he does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for 
 this</I> (which he had rehearsed before) <I>is the witness of God which 
 he hath testified of his Son.</I> Now in the three witnesses on earth 
 there is neither all the witness of God, nor indeed any witness who is 
 truly and immediately God. The antitrinitarian opposers of the text 
 will deny that either the Spirit, or the water, or the blood, is God 
 himself; but, upon our present reading, here is a noble enumeration of 
 the several witnesses and testimonies supporting the truth of the Lord 
 Jesus and the divinity of his institution. Here is the most excellent 
 abridgment or breviate of the motives to faith in Christ, of the 
 credentials the Saviour brings with him, and of the evidences of our 
 Christianity, that is to be found, I think, in the book of God, upon 
 which single account, even waiving the doctrine of the divine Trinity, 
 the text is worthy of all acceptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having these rational grounds on out side, we proceed. The apostle, 
 having told us that the Spirit that bears witness to Christ is truth, 
 shows us that he is so, by assuring us that he is in heaven, and that 
 there are others also who cannot but be true, or truth itself, 
 concurring in testimony with him: <I>For there are three that bear 
 record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these 
 three are one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a trinity of heavenly witnesses, such as have testified 
 and vouched to the world the veracity and authority of the Lord Jesus 
 in his office and claims, where, 

 [1.] The first that occurs in order is <I>the Father;</I> he set his
 seal to the commission of the Lord Christ all the while he was here;
 more especially, 
 
 <I>First,</I> In proclaiming him at his baptism,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> In confirming his character at the transfiguration,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> In accompanying him with miraculous power and works:
 <I>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do,
 though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and
 believe that the Father is in me, and I in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:37,38">John x. 37, 38</A>.
 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> In avouching at his death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:54">Matt. xxvii. 54</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> In raising him from the dead, and receiving him up to
 his glory: <I>He shall convince the world-of righteousness, because I 
 go to my Father, and you see me no more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:10,Ro+1:4">John xvi. 10, and Rom. i. 4</A>.

 [2.] The second witness in the Word, a mysterious name, importing the
 highest nature that belongs to the Saviour of Jesus Christ, wherein he
 existed before the world was, whereby he made the world, and whereby he
 was truly God with the Father. He must bear witness to the human
 nature, or to the man Christ Jesus, in and by whom he redeemed and
 saved us; and he bore witness,

 <I>First,</I> By the mighty works that he wrought.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17">John v. 17</A>,

 <I>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

 Secondly,</I> In conferring a glory upon him at his transfiguration.
 <I>And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the 
 Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> In raising him from the dead.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19">John ii. 19</A>,

 <I>Destroy this temple, and in three days will I raise it up.</I>

 [3.] The third witness is the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Spirit, and
 august, venerable name, the possessor, proprietor, and author of 
 holiness. True and faithful must he be to whom the Spirit of holiness 
 sets his seal and solemn testimony. So he did to the Lord Jesus, the 
 head of the Christian world; and that in such instances as these:--

 <I>First,</I> In the miraculous production of his immaculate human
 nature in the virgin's womb. <I>The Holy Ghost shall come upon 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>,

 &c.

 <I>Secondly,</I> In the visible descent upon him at his baptism.
 <I>The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:22">Luke iii. 22</A>,

 &c.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> In an effectual conquest of the spirits of hell and
 darkness. <I>If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the 
 kingdom of God has come unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:28">Matt. xii. 28</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> In the visible potent descent upon the apostles, to 
 furnish them with gifts and powers to preach him and his gospel to the 
 world after he himself had gone to heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:4,5,2:2-4">Acts i. 4, 5; ii. 2-4</A>,

 &c.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> In supporting the name, gospel, and interest of Christ,
 by miraculous gifts and operations by and upon the disciples, and in 
 the churches, for two hundred years 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:7">1 Cor. xii. 7</A>),

 concerning which see Dr. Whitby's excellent discourse in the preface to
 the second volume of his <I>Commentary on the New Testament.</I> These 
 are witnesses in heaven; and they bear record from heaven; and they are 
 one, it should seem, not only in testimony (for that is implied in 
 their being three witnesses to one and the same thing), but upon a 
 higher account, as they are in heaven; they are one in their heavenly 
 being and essence; and, if one with the Father, they must be one 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To these there is opposed, though with them joined, a trinity of 
 witnesses on earth, such as continue here below: <I>And there are three 
 that bear witness on earth, the spirit, the water, and the blood; and 
 these three agree in one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 [1.] Of these witnesses the first is the <I>spirit.</I> This must be
 distinguished from the person of the Holy Ghost, who is in heaven. We
 must say then, with the Saviour (according to what is reported by this
 apostle), <I>that which is born of the Spirit is spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:6">John iii. 6</A>.
 
 The disciples of the Saviour are, as well as others, born after the
 flesh. They come into the world endued with a corrupt carnal 
 disposition, which is enmity to God. This disposition must be mortified 
 and abolished. A new nature must be communicated. Old lusts and 
 corruptions must be eradicated, and the true disciple become a new 
 creature. The regeneration or renovation of souls is a testimony to the 
 Saviour. It is his actual though initial salvation. It is a testimony 
 on earth, because it continues with the church here, and is not 
 performed in that conspicuous astonishing manner in which signs from 
 heaven are accomplished. To this Spirit belong not only the 
 regeneration and conversion of the church, but its progressive 
 sanctification, victory over the world, her peace, and love, and joy, 
 and all that grace by which she is made meet for the inheritance of the 
 saints in light.

 [2.] The second is the <I>water.</I> This was before considered as a
 means of salvation, now as a testimony to the Saviour himself, and
 intimates his purity and purifying power. And so it seems to
 comprehend, 

 <I>First,</I> The purity of his own nature and conduct in the world.
 <I>He was holy, harmless, and undefiled. 

 Secondly,</I> The testimony of John's baptism, who bore witness of him,
 prepared a people for him, and referred them to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:4,7,8">Mark i. 4, 7, 8</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The purity of his own doctrine, by which souls are
 purified and washed. <I>Now you are clean through the word that I have
 spoken unto you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3">John xv. 3</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The actual and active purity and holiness of his
 disciples. His body is the holy catholic church. <I>Seeing you have
 purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:22">1 Pet. i. 22</A>.

 And this signed and sealed by,

 <I>Fifthly,</I> The baptism that he has appointed for the initiation or
 introduction of his disciples, in which he signally (or by that sign) 
 says, <I>Except I wash thee, thou hast no part in me. Not the putting
 away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience 
 towards God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1 Pet. iii. 21</A>.

 [3.] The third witness is the blood; this he shed, and this was our
 ransom. This testifies for Jesus Christ, 

 <I>First,</I> In that it sealed up and finished the sacrifices of the
 Old Testament, <I>Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us. 
 
 Secondly,</I> In that it confirmed his own predictions, and the truth 
 of all his ministry and doctrine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> In that it showed unparalleled love to God, in that he
 would die a sacrifice to his honour and glory, in making atonement for
 the sins of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30,31">John xiv. 30, 31</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> In that it demonstrated unspeakable love to us; and
 none will deceive those whom they entirely love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:13-15">John xiv. 13-15</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> In that it demonstrated the disinterestedness of the
 Lord Jesus as to any secular interest and advantage. No impostor and
 deceiver ever proposes to himself contempt and a violent cruel death,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36">John xviii. 36</A>.

 <I>Sixthly,</I> In that it lays obligation on his disciple to suffer 
 and die for him. No deceiver would invite proselytes to his side and
 interest at the rate that the Lord Jesus did. <I>You shall be hated of 
 all men for my sake. They shall put you out of their synagogues; and 
 the time comes that whosoever kills you will think that he doeth God 
 service,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.

 He frequently calls his servants to a conformity with him in
 sufferings: <I>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp,
 bearing his reproach,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13">Heb. xiii. 13</A>.

 This shows that neither he nor his kingdom is of this world.
 
 <I>Seventhly,</I> The benefits accruing and procured by his blood (well
 understood) must immediately demonstrate that he is indeed the Saviour 
 of the world. And then, 

 <I>Eighthly,</I> These are signified and sealed in the institution of
 his own supper: <I>This is my blood of the New Testament</I> (which
 ratifies the New Testament), <I>which is shed for many, for the
 remission of sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:28">Matt. xxvi. 28</A>.

 Such are the witnesses on earth. Such is the various testimony given to
 the author of our religion. No wonder if the rejector of all this
 evidence be judged as a blasphemer of the Spirit of God, and be left to
 perish without remedy in his sins. These three witnesses (being more
 different than the three former) are not so properly said to be <I>one 
 as</I> to be <I>for one,</I> to be for one and the same purpose and 
 cause, <I>or to agree in one,</I> in one and the same thing among 
 themselves, and in the same testimony with those who bear record from 
 heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle justly concludes, <I>If we receive the witness of men, 
 the witness of God is greater; for this is the witness of God, that he 
 hath testified of his Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Here we have, 

 1. A supposition well founded upon the premises. <I>Here is the witness 
 of God,</I> the witness whereby God hath testified of his Son, which 
 surely must intimate some immediate irrefragable testimony, and that of 
 the Father concerning his Son; he has by himself proclaimed and 
 avouched him to the world. 

 2. The authority and acceptableness of his testimony; and that argued
 from the less to the greater: <I>If we receive the witness of men</I> 
 (and such testimony is and must be admitted in all judicatories and in 
 all nations), <I>the witness of God is greater.</I> It is truth itself, 
 of highest authority and most unquestionable infallibility. And then 
 there is, 

 3. The application of the rule to the present case: <I>For this is the
 witness,</I> and here is the witness <I>of God</I> even of the Father, 
 as well as of the Word and Spirit, <I>which he hath testified of,</I> 
 and wherein he hath attested, <I>his Son. God, that cannot lie,</I> 
 hath given sufficient assurance to the world that Jesus Christ is his 
 Son, the Son of his love, and Son by office, to reconcile and recover 
 the world unto himself; he testified therefore the truth and divine 
 origin of the Christian religion, and that it is the sure appointed way 
 and means of bringing us to God.</P>

 name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal
 life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In those words we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The privilege and stability of the real Christian: <I>He that 
 believeth on the Son of God,</I> hath been prevailed with unfeignedly 
 to cleave to him for salvation, <I>hath the witness in himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He hath not only the outward evidence that others have, but he hath in 
 his own heart a testimony for Jesus Christ. He can allege what Christ 
 and the truth of Christ have done for his soul and what he has seen and 
 found in him. As, 

 1. He has deeply seen his sin, and guilt, and misery, and his abundant
 need of such a Saviour. 

 2. He has seen the excellency, beauty, and office of the Son of God,
 and the incomparable suitableness of such a Saviour to all his 
 spiritual wants and sorrowful circumstances. 

 3. He sees and admires the wisdom and love of God in preparing and
 sending such a Saviour to deliver him from sin and hell, and to raise 
 him to pardon, peace, and communion with God. 

 4. He has found and felt the power of the word and doctrine of Christ,
 wounding, humbling, healing, quickening, and comforting his soul. 

 5. He finds that the revelation of Christ, as it is the greatest
 discovery and demonstration of the love of God, so it is the most apt 
 and powerful means of kindling, fomenting, and inflaming love to the 
 holy blessed God.

 6. He is born of God by the truth of Christ, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He has a new heart and nature, a new love, disposition, and delight,
 and is not the man that formerly he was. 

 7. He finds yet such a conflict with himself, with sin, with the flesh,
 the world, and invisible wicked powers, as is described and provided 
 for in the doctrine of Christ. 

 8. He finds such prospects and such strength afforded him by the faith
 of Christ, that he can despise and overcome the world, and travel on 
 towards a better.

 9. He finds what interest the Mediator has in heaven, by the audiency
 and prevalency of those prayers that are sent thither in his name, 
 according to his will, and through his intercession.

 10. He is begotten again to a lively hope, to a holy confidence in God,
 in his good-will and love, to a pleasant victory over terrors of 
 conscience, dread of death and hell, to a comfortable prospect of life 
 and immortality, being enriched with the earnest of the Spirit and 
 sealed to the day of redemption. Such assurance has the gospel 
 believer; he has a witness in himself. Christ is formed in him, and he 
 is growing up to the fulness and perfection, or perfect image of 
 Christ, in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The aggravation of the unbeliever's sin, the sin of unbelief: <I>He 
 that believeth not God hath made him a liar.</I> He does, in effect, 
 give God the lie, <I>because he believeth not the record that God gave 
 of his Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He must believe that God did not send his Son into the world, when he 
 has given us such manifold evidence that he did, or that Jesus Christ 
 was not the Son of God, when all that evidence relates to and 
 terminates upon him, or that he sent his Son to deceive the world and 
 to lead it into error and misery, or that he permits men to devise a 
 religion which, in all the parts of it, is a pure, holy, heavenly, 
 undefiled institution, and so worthy to be embraced by the reason of 
 mankind, and yet is but a delusion and a lie, and then lends them his 
 Spirit and power to recommend and obtrude it upon the world, which is 
 to make God the Father, the author and abettor, of the lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The matter, the substance, or contents of all this divine 
 testimony concerning Jesus Christ: <I>And this is the record, that God 
 hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 This is the sum of the gospel. This is the sum and epitome of the whole 
 record given us by all the aforesaid six witnesses. 

 1. That <I>God hath given to us eternal life.</I> He has designed it 
 for us in his eternal purpose. He has prepared all the means that are 
 necessary to bring us to it. He has made it over to us by his covenant 
 and promise. And he actually confers a right and title thereto on all 
 who believe on and actually embrace the Son of God. Then, 

 2. <I>This life is in the Son.</I> The Son is life; eternal life in his
 own essence and person,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:4,1Jo+1:2">John i. 4; 1 John i. 2</A>.

 He is eternal life to us, the spring of our spiritual and glorious
 life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4">Col. iii. 4</A>.

 From him life is communicated to us, both here and in heaven. And
 thereupon it must follow,

 (1.) <I>He that hath the Son hath life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He that is united to the Son is united to life. He who hath a title to 
 the Son hath a title to life, to eternal life. Such honour hath the 
 Father put upon the Son: such honour must we put upon him too. We must 
 come and kiss the Son, and we shall have life.

 (2.) <I>He that hath not the Son of God hath not life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He continues under the condemnation of the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>);

 he refuses the Son, who is life itself, who is the procurer of life,
 and the way to it; he provokes God to deliver him over to endless death 
 for making him a liar, since he believes not this record that God hath 
 given concerning his Son.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The end and reason of the apostle's preaching this to believers. 

 1. For their satisfaction and comfort: <I>These things have I written
 unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know 
 that you have eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Upon all this evidence, and these witnesses, it is but just and meet 
 that there should be those who believe on the name of the Son of God. 
 God increase their number! How much testimony from heaven has the world 
 to answer for! And to three witnesses in heaven must the world be 
 accountable. These believers have eternal life. They have it in the 
 covenant of the gospel, in the beginning and first-fruits of it within 
 them, and in their Lord and head in heaven. These believers may come to 
 know that they have eternal life, and should be quickened, encouraged, 
 and comforted, in the prospect of it: and they should value the 
 scriptures, which are so much written for their consolation and 
 salvation. 

 2. For their confirmation and progress in their holy faith: <I>And that
 you may believe on the name of the Son of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 may go on believing. Believers must persevere, or they do nothing. To 
 withdraw from believing on the name of the Son of God is to renounce 
 eternal life, and draw back unto perdition. Therefore the evidences of 
 religion and the advantage of faith are to be presented to believers, 
 in order to hearten and encourage them to persevere to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
 ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:
 &nbsp; 15  And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know
 that we have the petitions that we desired of him.
 &nbsp; 16  If any man see his brother sin a sin <I>which is</I> not unto
 death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin
 not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
 shall pray for it.
 &nbsp; 17  All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto
 death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A privilege belonging to faith in Christ, namely, audience in 
 prayer: <I>This is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask 
 any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The Lord Christ emboldens us to come to God in all circumstances, with 
 all our supplications and requests. Through him our petitions are 
 admitted and accepted of God. The matter of our prayer must be 
 agreeable to the declared will of God. It is not fit that we should ask 
 what is contrary either to his majesty and glory or to our own good, 
 who are his and dependent on him. And then we may have confidence that 
 the prayer of faith shall be heard in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The advantage accruing to us by such privilege: <I>If we know that 
 he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions 
 that we desired of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Great are the deliverances, mercies, and blessings, which the holy 
 petitioner needs. To know that his petitions are heard or accepted is 
 as good as to know that they are answered; and therefore that he is so 
 pitied, pardoned, or counselled, sanctified, assisted, and saved (or 
 shall be so) as he is allowed to ask of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Direction in prayer in reference to the sins of others: <I>If any 
 man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, 
 and he shall give him life for those that sin not unto death. There is 
 a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here we may observe, 

 1. We ought to pray for others as well as for ourselves; for our 
 brethren of mankind, that they may be enlightened, converted, and 
 saved; for our brethren in the Christian profession, that they may be 
 sincere, that their sins may be pardoned, and that they may be 
 delivered from evils and the chastisements of God, and preserved in 
 Christ Jesus. 

 2. There is a great distinction in the heinousness and guilt of sin:
 <I>There is a sin unto death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 <I>and there is a sin not unto death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) <I>There is a sin unto death.</I> All sin, as to the merit and 
 legal sentence of it, is unto death. <I>The wages of sin is death;</I> 
 and <I>cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are 
 written in the book of the law, to do them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Gal. iii. 10</A>.

 But there is a sin unto death in opposition to such sin as is here said 
 <I>not to be unto death.</I> There is therefore,

 (2.) <I>A sin not unto death.</I> This surely must include all such sin
 as by divine or human constitution may consist with life; in the human 
 constitution with temporal or corporal life, in the divine constitution 
 with corporal or with spiritual evangelical life.

 [1.] There are sins which, by human righteous constitution, are not 
 unto death; as divers pieces of injustice, which may be compensated 
 without the death of the delinquent. In opposition to this there are 
 sins which, by righteous constitution, are to death, or to a legal 
 forfeiture of life; such as we call <I>capital crimes.</I>

 [2.] Then there are sins which, by divine constitution, are unto death;
 and that either death corporal or spiritual and evangelical.
 
 <I>First,</I> Such as are, or may be, to death corporal. Such may the
 sins be either of gross hypocrites, as Ananias and Sapphira, or, for
 aught we know, of sincere Christian brethren, as when the apostle says
 of the offending members of the church of Corinth, <I>For this cause
 many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:30">1 Cor. xi. 30</A>.
 
 There may be sin unto corporal death among those who may not be
 condemned with the world. Such sin, I said, is, or may be, to corporal
 death. The divine penal constitution in the gospel does not positively
 and peremptorily threaten death to the more visible sins of the members
 of Christ, but only some gospel-chastisement; <I>for whom the Lord
 loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:6">Heb. xii. 6</A>.

 There is room left for divine wisdom or goodness, or even gospel
 severity, to determine how far the chastisement or the scourge shall 
 proceed. And we cannot say but that sometimes it may (<I>in 
 terrorem--for warning to others</I>) proceed even to death. Then, 
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> There are sins which, by divine constitution, are unto
 death spiritual and evangelical, that is, are inconsistent with 
 spiritual and evangelical life, with spiritual life in the soul and 
 with an evangelical right to life above. Such are total impenitence and 
 unbelief for the present. Final impenitence and unbelief are infallibly 
 to death eternal, as also a blaspheming of the Spirit of God in the 
 testimony that he has given to Christ and his gospel, and a total 
 apostasy from the light and convictive evidence of the truth of the 
 Christian religion. These are sins involving the guilt of everlasting 
 death. Then comes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The application of the direction for prayer according to the 
 different sorts of sin thus distinguished. The prayer is supposed to be 
 for life: <I>He shall ask, and he</I> (God) <I>shall give them 
 life.</I> Life is to be asked of God. He is the God of life; he gives 
 it when and to whom he pleases, and takes it away either by his 
 constitution or providence, or both, as he thinks meet. In the case of 
 a brother's sin, which is not (in the manner already mentioned) unto 
 death, we may in faith and hope pray for him; and particularly for the 
 life of soul and body. But, in case of the sin unto death in the 
 forementioned ways, we have no allowance to pray. Perhaps the apostle's 
 expression, <I>I do not say, He shall pray for it,</I> may intend no 
 more than, "I have no promise for you in that case; no foundation for 
 the prayer of faith." 

 1. The laws of punitive justice must be executed, for the common safety 
 and benefit of mankind: and even an offending brother in such a case 
 must be resigned to public justice (which in the foundation of it is 
 divine), and at the same time also to the mercy of God.

 2. The removal of evangelical penalties (as they may be called), or the
 prevention of death (which may seem to be so consequential upon, or 
 inflicted for, some particular sin), can be prayed for only 
 conditionally or provisionally, that is, with proviso that it consist 
 with the wisdom, will, and glory of God that they should be removed, 
 and particularly such death prevented. 

 3. We cannot pray that the sins of the impenitent and unbelieving
 should, while they are such, be forgiven them, or that any mercy of 
 life or soul, that suppose the forgiveness of sin, should be granted to 
 them, while they continue such. But we may pray for their repentance 
 (supposing them but in the common case of the impenitent world), for 
 their being enriched with faith in Christ, and thereupon for all other 
 saving mercies. 

 4. In case it should appear that any have committed the irremissible
 blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and the total apostasy from the 
 illuminating convictive powers of the Christian religion, it should 
 seem that they are not to be prayed for at all. For <I>what remains but 
 a certain fearful expectation of judgment, to consume such 
 adversaries?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:27">Heb. x. 27</A>.

 And these last seem to be the sins chiefly intended by the apostle by
 the name of <I>sins unto death.</I> Then,

 5. The apostle seems to argue that there is sin that is not unto death;
 thus, <I>All unrighteousness is sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 but, were all unrighteousness unto death (since we have all some
 unrighteousness towards God or man, or both, in omitting and neglecting 
 something that is their due), then we were all peremptorily bound over 
 to death, and, since it is not so (the Christian brethren, generally 
 speaking, having right to life), there must be sin that is not to 
 death. Though there is no venial sin (in the common acceptation), there 
 is pardoned sin, sin that does not involve a plenary obligation to 
 eternal death. If it were not so, there could be no justification nor 
 continuance of the justified state. The gospel constitution or covenant 
 abbreviates, abridges, or rescinds the guilt of sin.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A recapitulation of the privileges and advantages of sound Christian 
 believers. 

 1. They are secured against sin, against the fulness of its dominion or
 the fulness of its guilt: <I>We know that whosoever is born of God</I>
 (and the believer in Christ is born of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 <I>sinneth not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>sinneth not</I> with that fulness of heart and spirit that the 
 unregenerate do (as was said

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:6,9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 6, 9</A>),

 and consequently not with that fulness of guilt that attends the sins
 of others; and so he is secured against that sin which is unavoidably 
 unto death, or which infallibly binds the sinner over unto the wages of 
 eternal death; the new nature, and the inhabitation of the divine 
 Spirit thereby, prevent the admission of such unpardonable sin. 

 2. They are fortified against the devil's destructive attempts: <I>He
 that is begotten of God keepeth himself,</I> that is, is enabled to 
 guard himself, <I>and the wicked one toucheth him not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, that the wicked one may not touch him, namely, to death. It 
 seems not to be barely a narration of the duty or the practice of the 
 regenerate; but an indication of their power by virtue of their 
 regeneration. They are thereby prepared and principled against the 
 fatal touches, the sting, of the wicked one; he touches not their 
 souls, to infuse his venom there as he does in others, or to expel that
 regenerative principle which is an antidote to his poison, or to induce 
 them to that sin which by the gospel constitution conveys an 
 indissoluble obligation to eternal death. He may prevail too far with 
 them, to draw them to some acts of sin; but it seems to be the design 
 of the apostle to assert that their regeneration secures them from such 
 assaults of the devil as will bring them into the same case and actual 
 condemnation with the devil. 

 3. They are on God's side and interest, in opposition to the state of
 the world: <I>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth 
 in wickedness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Mankind are divided into two great parties of dominions, that which 
 belongs to God and that which belongs to wickedness or to the wicked 
 one. The Christian believers belong to God. They are of God, and from 
 him, and to him, and for him. They succeed into the right and room of 
 the ancient Israel of God, of whom it is said, <I>The Lord's people is 
 his portion,</I> his estate in this world; <I>Jacob is the lot of his 
 inheritance,</I> the dividend that has fallen to him by the lot of his 
 own determination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:9">Deut. xxxii. 9</A>);

 while, on the contrary, <I>the whole world,</I> the rest, being by far
 the major part, <I>lieth in wickedness,</I> in the jaws in the bowels 
 of the wicked one. There are, indeed, were we to consider the 
 individuals, many wicked ones, many wicked spirits, in the heavenly or 
 the ethereal places; but they are united in wicked nature, policy, and 
 principle, and they are united also in one head. There is the prince of
 the devils and of the diabolical kingdom. There is a head of the 
 malignity and of the malignant world; and he has such sway here that he 
 is called <I>the god of this world.</I> Strange that such a knowing 
 spirit should be so implacably incensed against the Almighty and all 
 his interests, when he cannot but know that it must end in his own 
 overthrow and everlasting damnation! How tremendous is the judgment of 
 God upon that wicked one! May the God of the Christian world 
 continually demolish his dominion in this world, and translate souls 
 into <I>the kingdom of his dear Son!</I> 

 4. They are enlightened in the knowledge of the true eternal God:
 <I>"And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given as an 
 understanding, that we may know him that is true,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The Son of God has come into our world, and we have seen him, and know 
 him by all the evidence that has already been asserted; he has revealed 
 unto us the true God (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>),

 and he has opened our minds too to understand that revelation, given us
 an internal light in our understandings, whereby we may discern the 
 glories of the true God; and we are assured that it is the true God 
 that he hath discovered to us. He is infinitely superior in purity, 
 power, and perfection, to all the gods of the Gentiles. He has all the 
 excellences, beauties, and riches, of the living and true God. It is 
 the same God that, according to Moses's account, made the heavens and 
 the earth, the same who took our fathers and patriarchs into peculiar 
 covenant with himself, the same who brought our ancestors out of Egypt, 
 who gave us the fiery law upon mount Sinai, who gave us his holy 
 oracles, promised the call and conversion of the Gentiles. By his 
 counsels and works, by his love and grace, by his terrors and 
 judgments, we know that he, and he alone, in the fulness of his being, 
 is the living and true God." It is a great happiness to know the true 
 God, to know him in Christ; it is eternal life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3">John xvii. 3</A>.

 It is the glory of the Christian revelation that it gives the best
 account of the true God, and administers the best eye-salve for our 
 discerning the living and true God. 

 5. They have a happy union with God and his Son: "<I>And we are in him
 that is true, even</I> (or and) <I>in his Son Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The Son leads us to the Father, and we are in both, in the love and 
 favour of both, in covenant and federal alliance with both, in 
 spiritual conjunction with both by the inhabitation and operation of 
 their Spirit: and, that you may know how great a dignity and felicity 
 this is, you must remember that this true one is <I>the true God and 
 eternal life</I>" or rather (as it should seem a more natural 
 construction), "This same Son of God is himself also <I>the true God 
 and eternal life</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>,
 
 and here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),

 "so that in union with either, much more with both, we are united to
 <I>the true God and eternal life.</I>" Then we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle's concluding monition: "<I>Little children</I>" (dear 
 children, as it has been interpreted), "<I>keep yourselves from 
 idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Since you know the true God, and are in him, let your light and love 
 guard you against all that is advanced in opposition to him, or 
 competition with him. Flee from the false gods of the heathen world. 
 They are not comparable to the God whose you are and whom you serve. 
 Adore not your God by statues and images, which share in his worship. 
 Your God is an incomprehensible Spirit, and is disgraced by such sordid 
 representations. Hold no communion with your heathen neighbours in 
 their idolatrous worship. Your God is jealous, and would have you come 
 out, and be separated from among them; mortify the flesh, and be 
 crucified to the world, that they may not usurp the throne of dominion 
 in the heart, which is due only to God. The God whom you have known is 
 he who made you, who redeemed you by his Son, who has sent his gospel 
 to you, who has pardoned your sins, begotten you unto himself by his 
 Spirit, and given you eternal life. Cleave to him in faith, and love, 
 and constant obedience, in opposition to all things that would alienate 
 your mind and heart from God. To this living and true God be glory and 
 dominion for ever and ever. <I>Amen.</I>"</P>
