 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having plainly asserted and largely proved that
 justification and salvation are to had by faith only, and not by the
 works of the law, by Christ and not by Moses, comes in this and the
 following chapters to anticipate an objection which might be made
 against this. If this be so, then what becomes of the Jews, of them all
 as a complex body, especially those of them that do not embrace Christ,
 nor believe the gospel? By this rule they must needs come short of
 happiness; and then what becomes of the promise made to the fathers,
 which entailed salvation upon the Jews? Is not that promise nullified
 and made of none effect? Which is not a thing to be imagined concerning
 any word of God. That doctrine therefore, might they say, is not to be
 embraced, from which flows such a consequence as this. That the
 consequence of the rejection of the unbelieving Jews follows from
 Paul's doctrine he grants, but endeavours to soften and mollify,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1-15">ver. 1-5</A>.

 But that from this it follows that the word of God takes no effect he
 denies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6">ver. 6</A>),

 and proves the denial in the rest of the chapter, which serves likewise 
 to illustrate the great doctrine of predestination, which he had spoken
 of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:28"><I>ch.</I> viii. 28</A>)

 as the first wheel which in the business of salvation sets all the
 other wheels a-going.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
 bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
 &nbsp; 2  That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
 &nbsp; 3  For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
 brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
 &nbsp; 4  Who are Israelites; to whom <I>pertaineth</I> the adoption, and
 the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
 service <I>of God,</I> and the promises;
 &nbsp; 5  Whose <I>are</I> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh
 Christ <I>came,</I> who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the apostle's solemn profession of a great concern for the 
 nation and people of the Jews--that he was heartily troubled that so
 many of them were enemies to the gospel, and out of the way of 
 salvation. For this he had <I>great heaviness and continual sorrow.</I> 
 Such a profession as this was requisite to take off the odium which 
 otherwise he might have contracted by asserting and proving their 
 rejection. It is wisdom as much as may be to mollify those truths which 
 sound harshly and seem unpleasant: dip the nail in oil, it will drive 
 the better. The Jews had a particular pique at Paul above any of the 
 apostles, as appears by the history of the Acts, and therefore were the 
 more apt to take things amiss of him, to prevent which he introduces 
 his discourse with this tender and affectionate profession, that they 
 might not think he triumphed or insulted over the rejected Jews or was 
 pleased with the calamities that were coming upon them. Thus Jeremiah 
 appeals to God concerning the Jews of his day, whose ruin was hastening 
 on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:16">Jer. xvii. 16</A>),

 <I>Neither have I desired the woeful day, thou knowest.</I> Nay, Paul
 was so far from desiring it that he most pathetically deprecates it. 
 And lest this should be thought only a copy of his countenance, to 
 flatter and please them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He asserts it with a solemn protestation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I say the truth in Christ,</I> "I speak it as a Christian, one of 
 God's people, children that will not lie, as one that knows not how to 
 give flattering title." Or, "I appeal to Christ, who searches the 
 heart, concerning it." He appeals likewise to his own conscience, which 
 was instead of a thousand witnesses. That which he was going to assert 
 was not only a great and weighty thing (such solemn protestations are 
 not to be thrown away upon trifles), but it was likewise a secret; it 
 was concerning a sorrow in his heart to which none was a capable 
 competent witness but God and his own conscience.--<I>That I have great 
 heaviness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He does not say for what; the very mention of it was unpleasant and 
 invidious; but it is plain that he means for the rejection of the 
 Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He backs it with a very serious imprecation, which he was ready to 
 make, out of love to the Jews. <I>I could wish;</I> he does not say, I 
 do wish, for it was no proper means appointed for such an end; but, if 
 it were, <I>I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my 
 brethren</I>--a very high pang of zeal and affection for his countrymen.
 He would be willing to undergo the greatest misery to do them good. 
 Love is apt to be thus bold, and venturous, and self-denying. Because 
 the glory of God's grace in the salvation of many is to be preferred 
 before the welfare and happiness of a single person, Paul, if they were 
 put in competition, would be content to forego all his own happiness to 
 purchase theirs. 

 1. He would be content to be cut off from the land of the living, in
 the most shameful and ignominious manner, as an anathema, or a devoted
 person. They thirsted for his blood, persecuted him as the most
 obnoxious person in the world, the curse and plague of his generation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13,Ac+22:22">1 Cor. iv. 13; Acts xxii. 22</A>.

 "Now," says Paul, "I am willing to bear all this, and a great deal
 more, for your good. Abuse me as much as you will, count and call me at 
 your pleasure; your unbelief and rejection create in my heart a 
 heaviness so much greater than all these troubles can that I could look 
 upon them not only as tolerable, but as desirable, rather than this 
 rejection." 

 2. He would be content to be excommunicated from the society of the
 faithful, to be separated from the church, and from the communion of 
 saints, as a heathen man and a publican, if that would do them any 
 good. He could wish himself no more remembered among the saints, his
 name blotted out of the church-records; though he had been so great a 
 planter of churches, and the spiritual father of so many thousands, yet 
 he would be content to be disowned by the church, cut off from all 
 communion with it, and have his name buried in oblivion or reproach, 
 for the good of the Jews. It may be, some of the Jews had a prejudice 
 against Christianity for Paul's sake; such a spleen they had at him 
 that they hated the religion he was of: "If this stumble you," says 
 Paul, "I could wish I might be cast out, not embraced as a Christian, 
 so you might but be taken in." Thus Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:33">Exod. xxxii. 33</A>),

 in a like holy passion of concern, <I>Blot me, I pray thee, out of the 
 book which thou hast written.</I> 

 3. Nay, some think that the expression goes further, and that he could 
 be content to be cut off from all his share of happiness in Christ, if 
 that might be a means of their salvation. It is a common charity that 
 begins at home; this is something higher, and more noble and 
 generous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives us the reason of this affection and concern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because of their relation to them: <I>My brethren, my kinsmen, 
 according to the flesh.</I> Though they were very bitter against him 
 upon all occasions, and gave him the most unnatural and barbarous 
 usage, yet thus respectfully does he speak of them. It shows him to be
 a man of a forgiving spirit. <I>Not that I had aught to accuse my 
 nation of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:19">Acts xxviii. 19</A>.

 <I>My kinsmen.</I> Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews. We ought to be in
 a special manner concerned for the spiritual good of our relations, our 
 brethren and kinsmen. To them we lie under special engagements, and we 
 have more opportunity of doing good to them; and concerning them, and 
 our usefulness to them, we must in a special manner give account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Especially because of their relation to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>Who are Israelites,</I> the seed of Abraham, God's friend, and of 
 Jacob his chosen, taken into the covenant of peculiarity, dignified and 
 distinguished by visible church-privileges, many of which are here 
 mentioned:--

 (1.) <I>The adoption;</I> not that which is saving, and which entitled
 to eternal happiness, but that which was external and typical, and 
 entitled them to the land of Canaan. <I>Israel is my son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22">Exod. iv. 22</A>.
 
 (2.) <I>And the glory;</I> the ark with the mercy-seat, over which God 
 dwelt between the cherubim--this was the glory of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:21">1 Sam. iv. 21</A>.
 
 The many symbols and tokens of the divine presence and guidance, the
 cloud, the Shechinah, the distinguishing favours conferred upon 
 them--these were the glory. 

 (3.) <I>And the covenants</I>--the covenant made with Abraham, and 
 often renewed with his seed upon divers occasions. There was a covenant 
 at Sinai 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1-18">Exod. xxiv.</A>),

 in the plains of Moab 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:1-29">Deut. xxix.</A>),

 at Shechem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:1-33">Josh. xxiv.</A>),

 and often afterwards; and still these pertained to Israel. Or, the
 covenant of peculiarity, and in that, as in the type, the covenant of 
 grace. 

 (4.) <I>And the giving of the law.</I> It was to them that the 
 ceremonial and judicial law were given, and the moral law in writing 
 pertained to them. It is a great privilege to have the law of God among 
 us, and it is to be accounted so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19,20">Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20</A>.

 This was the grandeur of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7,8">Deut. iv. 7, 8</A>.

 (5.) <I>And the service of God.</I> They had the ordinances of God's
 worship among them--the temple, the altars, the priests, the 
 sacrifices, the feasts, and the institutions relating to them. They 
 were in this respect greatly honoured, that, while other nations were 
 worshipping and serving stocks, and stones, and devils, and they knew 
 not what other idols of their own invention, the Israelites were 
 serving the true God in the way of his own appointment.

 (6.) <I>And the promises</I>--particular promises added to the general 
 covenant, promises relating to the Messiah and the gospel state.
 Observe, The promises accompany the giving of the law, and the service 
 of God; for the comfort of the promises is to be had in obedience to 
 that law and attendance upon that service. 

 (7.) <I>Whose are the fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, those men of renown, that stood so high in 
 the favour of God. The Jews stand in relation to them, are their 
 children, and proud enough they are of it: <I>We have Abraham to our 
 father.</I> It was for the father's sake that they were taken into 
 covenant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28"><I>ch.</I> xi. 28</A>.

 (8.) But the greatest honour of all was that <I>of them as concerning
 the flesh</I> (that is, as to his human nature) <I>Christ came;</I> for
 he took on him the seed of Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:16">Heb. ii. 16</A>.

 As to his divine nature, he is the Lord from heaven; but, as to his
 human nature, he is of the seed of Abraham. This was the great 
 privilege of the Jews, that Christ was of kin to them. Mentioning
 Christ, he interposes a very great word concerning him, that he is 
 <I>over all, God blessed for ever.</I> Lest the Jews should think 
 meanly of him, because he was of their alliance, he here speaks thus 
 honourably concerning him: and it is a very full proof of the Godhead 
 of Christ; he is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed 
 for ever. Therefore, how much sorer punishment were they worthy of that 
 rejected him! It was likewise the honour of the Jews, and one reason 
 why Paul had a kindness for them, that, seeing God blessed for ever 
 would be a man, he would be a Jew; and, considering the posture and 
 character of that people at that time, it may well be looked upon as a 
 part of his humiliation.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having made his way to that which he had to say, 
 concerning the rejection of the body of his countrymen, with a 
 protestation of his own affection for them and a concession of their 
 undoubted privileges, comes in these verses, and the following part of
 the chapter, to prove that the rejection of the Jews, by the 
 establishment of the gospel dispensation, did not at all invalidate the 
 word of God's promise to the patriarchs: <I>Not as though the word of 
 God hath taken no effect</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 which, considering the present state of the Jews, which created to Paul 
 so much <I>heaviness and continual sorrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 might be suspected. We are not to ascribe inefficacy to any word of 
 God: nothing that he has spoken does or can fall to the ground; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10,11">Isa. lv. 10, 11</A>.

 The promises and threatenings shall have their accomplishment; and, one
 way or other, he will magnify the law and make it honourable. This is 
 to be understood especially of the promise of God, which by subsequent 
 providences may be to a wavering faith very doubtful; but it is not, it 
 cannot be, made of no effect; at the end it will speak and not lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the difficulty is to reconcile the rejection of the unbelieving 
 Jews with the word of God's promise, and the external tokens of the 
 divine favour, which had been conferred upon them. This he does in four 
 ways:--
 
 1. By explaining the true meaning and intention of the promise,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6-13"><I>v.</I> 6-13</A>.

 2. By asserting and proving the absolute sovereignty of God, in
 disposing of the children of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:14-24"><I>v.</I> 14-24</A>.

 3. By showing how this rejection of the Jews, and the taking in of the 
 Gentiles, were foretold in the Old Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:25-29"><I>v.</I> 25-29</A>.

 4. By fixing the true reason of the Jews' rejection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>,

 to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this paragraph the apostle explains the true meaning and intention 
 of the promise. When we mistake the word, and misunderstand the 
 promise, no marvel if we are ready to quarrel with God about the 
 accomplishment; and therefore the sense of this must first be duly 
 stated. Now he here makes it out that, when God said he would be <I>a 
 God to Abraham, and to his seed</I> (which was the famous promise made 
 unto the fathers), he did not mean it of all his seed according to the 
 flesh, as if it were a necessary concomitant of the blood of Abraham; 
 but that he intended it with a limitation only to such and such. And as 
 from the beginning it was appropriated to Isaac and not to Ishmael, to 
 Jacob and not to Esau, and yet for all this the word of God was not 
 made of no effect; so now the same promise is appropriated to believing 
 Jews that embrace Christ and Christianity, and, though it throws off 
 multitudes that refuse Christ, yet the promise is not therefore 
 defeated and invalidated, any more than it was by the typical rejection 
 of Ishmael and Esau.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down this proposition--that <I>they are not all Israel who
 are of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>neither because they are,</I> &c.,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Many that descended from the loins of Abraham and Jacob, and were of
 that people who were surnamed by the name of Israel, yet were very far
 from being Israelites indeed, interested in the saving benefits of the
 new covenant. They are not all really Israel that are so in name and
 profession. It does not follow that, because they are the seed of
 Abraham, therefore they must needs be the children of God, though they
 themselves fancied so, boasted much of, and built much upon, their
 relation to Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9,Joh+8:38,39">Matt. iii. 9; John viii. 38, 39</A>.

 But it does not follow. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are
 saving benefits inseparably annexed to external church privileges, 
 though it is common for people thus to stretch the meaning of God's 
 promise, to bolster themselves up in a vain hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proves this by instances; and therein shows not only that some 
 of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but that God therein 
 wrought according to the counsel of his own will; and not with regard 
 to that law of commandments to which the present unbelieving Jews were 
 so strangely wedded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He specifies the case of Isaac and Ishmael, both of them the seed of 
 Abraham; and yet Isaac only taken into covenant with God, and Ishmael 
 rejected and cast out. For this he quotes 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:12">Gen. xxi. 12</A>,

 <I>In Isaac shall thy seed be called,</I> which comes in there as a 
 reason why Abraham must be willing to cast out the bond-woman and her 
 son, because the covenant was to be established with Isaac,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:19">Gen. xvii. 19</A>.

 And yet the word which God had spoken, that he would be a God to
 Abraham and to his seed, did not therefore fall to the ground; for the 
 blessings wrapt up in that great word, being communicated by God as a 
 benefactor, he was free to determine on what head they should rest, and 
 accordingly entailed them upon Isaac, and rejected Ishmael. This he 
 explains further

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 and shows what God intended to teach us by this dispensation. 

 (1.) That the children of the flesh, as such, by virtue of their 
 relation to Abraham according to the flesh, are not therefore the 
 children of God, for then Ishmael had put in a good claim. This remark 
 comes home to the unbelieving Jews, who boasted of their relation to 
 Abraham according to the flesh, and looked for justification in a 
 fleshly way, by those carnal ordinances which Christ had abolished. 
 They had confidence in the flesh, and looked for justification in a 
 fleshly way, by those carnal ordinances which Christ had abolished. 
 They had confidence in the flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>.

 Ishmael was a child of the flesh, conceived by Hagar, who was young and
 fresh, and likely enough to have children. There was nothing
 extraordinary or supernatural in his conception, as there was in 
 Isaac's; he was born after the flesh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:29">Gal. iv. 29</A>),

 representing those that expect justification and salvation by their own 
 strength and righteousness.

 (2.) That the <I>children of the promise are counted for the seed.</I> 
 Those that have the honour and happiness of being counted for the seed 
 have it not for the sake of any merit or desert of their own, but 
 purely by virtue of the promise, in which God hath obliged himself of 
 his own good pleasure to grant the promised favour. Isaac was a child 
 of promise; this his proves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,
 
 quoted from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:10">Gen. xviii. 10</A>.

 He was a child promised (so were many others), and he was also
 conceived and born by force and virtue of the promise, and so a proper 
 type and figure of those who are now counted for the seed, even true 
 believers, who are born, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will 
 of man, but of God--of the incorruptible seed, even the word of 
 promise, by virtue of the special promise of a new heart: see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:28">Gal. iv. 28</A>.

 It was through faith that Isaac was conceived,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11">Heb. xi. 11</A>.

 Thus were the great mysteries of salvation taught under the Old
 Testament, not in express words, but by significant types and 
 dispensations of providence, which to them then were not so clear as 
 they are to us now, when the veil is taken away, and the types are 
 expounded by the antitypes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The case of Jacob and Esau 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>),

 which is much stronger, to show that the carnal seed of Abraham were 
 not, as such, interested in the promise, but only such of them as God 
 in sovereignty had appointed. There was a previous difference between
 Ishmael and Isaac, before Ishmael was cast out: Ishmael was the son of 
 the bond-woman, born long before Isaac, was of a fierce and rugged 
 disposition, and had mocked or persecuted Isaac, to all which it might 
 be supposed God had regard when he appointed Abraham to cast him out. 
 But, in the case of Jacob and Esau, it was neither so nor so, they were 
 both the sons of Isaac by one mother; they were conceived <B><I>hex 
 henos</I></B>--<I>by one conception;</I> <B><I>hex henos 
 koitou,</I></B> so some copies read it. The difference was made
 between them by the divine counsel before they were born, or had done 
 any good or evil. Both lay struggling alike in their mother's womb, 
 when it was said, <I>The elder shall serve the younger,</I> without 
 respect to good or bad works done or foreseen, <I>that the purpose of 
 God according to election might stand</I>--that this great truth may be 
 established, that God chooses some and refuses others as a free agent, 
 by his own absolute and sovereign will, dispensing his favours or 
 withholding them as he pleases. This difference that was put between 
 Jacob and Esau he further illustrates by a quotation from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:2,3">Mal. i. 2, 3</A>,

 where it is said, not of Jacob and Esau the person, but the Edomites 
 and Israelites their posterity, <I>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I 
 hated.</I> The people of Israel were taken into the covenant of 
 peculiarity, had the land of Canaan given them, were blessed with the 
 more signal appearances of God for them in special protections, 
 supplies, and deliverances, while the Edomites were rejected, had no 
 temple, altar, priests, nor prophets--no such particular care taken of 
 them nor kindness shown to them. Such a difference did God put between 
 those two nations, that both descended from the loins of Abraham and 
 Isaac, as at first there was a difference put between Jacob and Esau, 
 the distinguishing heads of those two nations. So that all this 
 choosing and refusing was typical, and intended to shadow forth some 
 other election and rejection. 

 (1.) Some understand it of the election and rejection of conditions or 
 qualifications. As God chose Isaac and Jacob, and rejected Ishmael and 
 Esau, so he might and did choose faith to be the condition of salvation 
 and reject the works of the law. Thus Arminius understands it, <I>De 
 rejectis et assumptis talibus, certa qualitate notatis--Concerning such 
 as are rejected and such as are chosen, being distinguished by 
 appropriate qualities;</I> so John Goodwin. But this very much strains 
 the scripture; for the apostle speaks all along of persons, he has 
 mercy on whom (he does not say on what kind of people) he will have 
 mercy, besides that against this sense those two objections 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:14,19"><I>v.</I> 14, 19</A>)
 
 do not at all arise, and his answer to them concerning God's absolute 
 sovereignty over the children of men is not at all pertinent if no more 
 be meant than his appointing the conditions of salvation. 

 (2.) Others understand it of the election and rejection of particular 
 person--some loved, and others hated, from eternity. But the apostle 
 speaks of Jacob and Esau, not in their own persons, but as 
 ancestors--Jacob the people, and Esau the people; nor does God condemn 
 any, or decree so to do, merely because he will do it, without any 
 reason taken from their own deserts. 

 (3.) Others therefore understand it of the election and rejection of 
 people considered complexly. His design is to justify God, and his 
 mercy and truth, in calling the Gentiles, and taking them into the 
 church, and into covenant with himself, while he suffered the obstinate 
 part of the Jews to persist in unbelief, and so to un-church 
 themselves--thus hiding from their eyes the things that belonged to 
 their peace. The apostle's reasoning for the explication and proof of 
 this is, however, very applicable to, and, no doubt (as is usual in 
 scripture) was intended for the clearing of the methods of God's grace 
 towards particular person, for the communication of saving benefits 
 bears some analogy to the communication of church-privileges. The 
 choosing of Jacob the younger, and preferring him before Esau the elder 
 (so crossing hands), were to intimate that the Jews, though the natural 
 seed of Abraham, and the first-born of the church, should be laid 
 aside; and the Gentiles, who were as the younger brother, should be 
 taken in in their stead, and have the birthright and blessing. The 
 Jews, considered as a body politic, a nation and people, knit together 
 by the bond and cement of the ceremonial law, the temple and 
 priesthood, the centre of their unity, had for many ages been the 
 darlings and favourites of heaven, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, 
 dignified and distinguished by God's miraculous appearances among them 
 and for them. Now that the gospel was preached, and Christian churches 
 were planted, this national body was thereby abandoned, their 
 church-polity dissolved; and Christian churches (and in process of time 
 Christian nations), embodied in like manner, become their successors in 
 the divine favour, and those special privileges and protections which 
 were the products of that favour. To clear up the justice of God in 
 this great dispensation is the scope of the apostle here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having asserted the true meaning of the promise, comes 
 here to maintain and prove the absolute sovereignty of God, in 
 disposing of the children of men, with reference to their eternal 
 state. And herein God is to be considered, not as a rector and 
 governor, distributing rewards and punishments according to his 
 revealed laws and covenants, but as an owner and benefactor, giving to 
 the children of men such grace and favour as he has determined in and 
 by his secret and eternal will and counsel: both the favour of visible 
 church-membership and privileges, which is given to some people and 
 denied to others, and the favour of effectual grace, which is given to 
 some particular persons and denied to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this part of his discourse is in answer to two objections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It might be objected, <I>Is there unrighteousness with God?</I> If 
 God, in dealing with the children of men, do thus, in an arbitrary 
 manner, choose some and refuse others, may it not be suspected that 
 there is unrighteousness with him? This the apostle startles at the 
 thought of: <I>God forbid!</I> Far be it from us to think such a thing; 
 shall not the judge of all the earth do right? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25,Ro+3:5,6">Gen. xviii. 25; <I>ch.</I> iii. 5, 6</A>.

 He denies the consequences, and proves the denial.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In respect of those to whom he shows mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 He quotes that scripture to show God's sovereignty in dispensing his 
 favours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:19">Exod. xxxiii. 19</A>):

 <I>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</I> All God's reasons
 of mercy are taken from within himself. All the children of men being 
 plunged alike into a state of sin and misery, equally under guilt and 
 wrath, God, in a way of sovereignty, picks out some from this fallen 
 apostatized race, to be vessels of grace and glory. He dispenses his 
 gifts to whom he will, without giving us any reason: according to his 
 own good pleasure he pitches upon some to be monuments of mercy and 
 grace, preventing grace, effectual grace, while he passes by others.
 The expression is very emphatic, and the repetition makes it more so: 
 <I>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</I> It imports a 
 perfect absoluteness in God's will; he will do what he will, and giveth 
 not account of any of his matters, nor is it fit he should. As these 
 great words, <I>I am that I am</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>)

 do abundantly express the absolute independency of his being, so these 
 words, <I>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</I> do as fully 
 express the absolute prerogative and sovereignty of his will. To 
 vindicate the righteousness of God, in showing mercy to whom he will, 
 the apostle appeals to that which God himself had spoken, wherein he 
 claims this sovereign power and liberty. God is a competent judge, even 
 in his own case. Whatsoever God does, or is resolved to do, is both by 
 the one and the other proved to be just. <B><I>Eleeso on han 
 heleo</I></B>--<I>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</I> When 
 I begin, I will make an end. Therefore God's mercy endures for ever, 
 because the reason of it is fetched from within himself; therefore his 
 gifts and callings are without repentance. Hence he infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 <I>It is not of him that willeth.</I> Whatever good comes from God to 
 man, the glory of it is not to be ascribed to the most generous desire, 
 nor to the most industrious endeavour, of man, but only and purely to 
 the free grace and mercy of God. In Jacob's case it was <I>not of him 
 that willeth, nor of him that runneth;</I> it was not the earnest will 
 and desire of Rebecca that Jacob might have the blessing; it was not 
 Jacob's haste to get it (for he was compelled to run for it) that 
 procured him the blessing, but only the mercy and grace of God. Wherein 
 the holy happy people of God differ from other people, it is God and 
 his grace that make them differ. Applying this general rule to the 
 particular case that Paul has before him, the reason why the unworthy, 
 undeserving, ill-deserving Gentiles are called, and grafted into the 
 church, while the greatest part of the Jews are left to perish in 
 unbelief, is not because those Gentiles were better deserving or better 
 disposed for such a favour, but because of God's free grace that made 
 that difference. The Gentiles did neither will it, nor run for it, for 
 they <I>sat in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:16">Matt. iv. 16</A>.

 In darkness, therefore not willing what they knew not; <I>sitting</I>
 in darkness, a contented posture, therefore not running to meet it, but 
 anticipated with these invaluable blessings of goodness. Such is the 
 method of God's grace towards all that partake of it, for he is found 
 of those that sought him not

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>);

 in this preventing, effectual, distinguishing grace, he acts as a 
 benefactor, whose grace is his own. Our eye therefore must not be evil 
 because his is good; but, of all the grace that we or others have, he 
 must have the glory: <I>Not unto us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1">Ps. cxv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In respect of those who perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God's sovereignty, manifested in the ruin of sinners, is here
 discovered in the instance of Pharaoh; it is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:16">Exod. ix. 16</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What God did with Pharaoh. He raised him up, brought him into the 
 world, made him famous, gave him the kingdom and power,--set him up as a
 beacon upon a hill, as the mark of all his plagues (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:14">Exod. ix. 14</A>)--

 hardened his heart, as he had said he would 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:21">Exod. iv. 21</A>):

 <I>I will harden his heart,</I> that is, withdraw softening grace, 
 leave him to himself, let Satan loose against him, and lay hardening 
 providences before him. Or, by raising him up may be meant the 
 intermission of the plagues which gave Pharaoh respite, and the 
 reprieve of Pharaoh in those plagues. In the Hebrew, <I>I have made 
 thee stand,</I> continued thee yet in the land of the living. Thus doth 
 God raise up sinners, make them for himself, even for the day of evil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:4">Prov. xvi. 4</A>),

 raise them up in outward prosperity, external privileges 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:23">Matt. xi. 23</A>),
 
 sparing mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he designed in it: <I>That I might show my power in thee.</I> 
 God would, by all this, serve the honour of his name, and manifest his 
 power in baffling the pride and insolence of that great and daring 
 tyrant, who bade defiance to Heaven itself, and trampled upon all that 
 was just and sacred. If Pharaoh had not been so high and might, so bold 
 and hardy, the power of God had not been so illustrious in the ruining 
 of him; but the taking off of the spirit of such a prince, who hectored 
 at that rate, did indeed proclaim God glorious in holiness, fearful in 
 praises, doing wonders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 This is Pharaoh, and all his multitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) His conclusion concerning both these we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he 
 hardeneth.</I> The various dealings of God, by which he makes some to 
 differ from others, must be resolved into his absolute sovereignty. He 
 is debtor to no man, his grace is his own, and he may give it or 
 withhold it as it pleaseth him; we have none of us deserved it, nay, we 
 have all justly forfeited it a thousand times, so that herein the work 
 of our salvation is admirably well ordered that those who are saved 
 must thank God only, and those who perish must thank themselves only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:9">Hos. xiii. 9</A>.

 We are bound, as God hath bound us, to do our utmost for the salvation
 of all we have to do with; but God is bound no further than he has been 
 pleased to bind himself by his own covenant and promise, which is his 
 revealed will; and that is that he will receive, and not cast out, 
 those that come to Christ; but the drawing of souls in order to that 
 coming is a preventing distinguishing favour to whom he will. Had he
 mercy on the Gentiles? It was because he would have mercy on them. Were 
 the Jews hardened? It was because it was his own pleasure to deny them 
 softening grace, and to give them up to their chosen affected unbelief.
 <I>Even so, Father, because it seemed good unto thee.</I> That 
 scripture excellently explains this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21">Luke x. 21</A>,

 and, as this, shows the sovereign will of God in giving or withholding
 both the means of grace and the effectual blessing upon those 
 means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It might be objected, <I>Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath 
 resisted his will?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Had the apostle been arguing only for God's sovereignty in appointing 
 and ordering the terms and conditions of acceptance and salvation, 
 there had not been the least colour for this objection; for he might 
 well find fault if people refused to come up to the terms on which such 
 a salvation is offered; the salvation being so great, the terms could 
 not be hard. But there might be colour for the objection against his 
 arguing for the sovereignty of God in giving and withholding 
 differencing and preventing grace; and the objection is commonly and 
 readily advanced against the doctrine of distinguishing grace. If God, 
 while he gives effectual grace to some, denies it to others, why doth 
 he find fault with those to whom he denies it? If he hath rejected the 
 Jews, and hid from their eyes the things that belong to their peace, 
 why doth he find fault with them for their blindness? If it be his 
 pleasure to discard them as not a people, and not obtaining mercy, 
 their knocking off themselves was no resistance of his will. This 
 objection he answers at large,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By reproving the objector 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Nay but, O man.</I> This is not an objection fit to be made by the 
 creature against his Creator, by man against God. The truth, as it is 
 in Jesus, is that which abases man as nothing, less than nothing, and 
 advances God as sovereign Lord of all. Observe how contemptibly he 
 speaks of man, when he comes to argue with God his Maker: "<I>Who art 
 thou,</I> thou that art so foolish, so feeble, so short-sighted, so 
 incompetent a judge of the divine counsels? Art thou able to fathom 
 such a depth, dispute such a case, to trace that way of God which is in 
 the sea, his path in the great waters?" <I>That repliest against 
 God.</I> It becomes us to submit to him, not to reply against him; to 
 lie down under his hand, not to fly in his face, nor to charge him with 
 folly. <B><I>Ho antapokrinomenos</I></B>--<I>That answerest again.</I> 
 God is our master, and we are his servants; and it does not become 
 servants to answer again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:9">Tit. ii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By resolving all into the divine sovereignty. We are the thing 
 formed, and he is the former; and it does not become us to challenge or 
 arraign his wisdom in ordering and disposing of us into this or that 
 shape of figure. The rude and unformed mass of matter hath no right to 
 this or that form, but is shaped at the pleasure of him that formeth 
 it. God's sovereignty over us is fitly illustrated by the power that 
 the potter hath over the clay; compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:6">Jer. xviii. 6</A>,

 where, by a like comparison, God asserts his dominion over the nation
 of the Jews, when he was about to magnify his justice in their 
 destruction by Nebuchadnezzar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gives us the comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The potter, out of the same lump, may make either a fashionable vessel, 
 and a vessel fit for creditable and honourable uses, or a contemptible 
 vessel, and a vessel in which is no pleasure; and herein he acts 
 arbitrarily, as he might have chosen whether he would make any vessel 
 of it at all, or whether he would leave it in the hole of the pit, out 
 of which it was dug.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The application of the comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>.

 Two sorts of vessels God forms out of the great lump of fallen 
 mankind:--

 [1.] <I>Vessels of wrath</I>--vessels filled with wrath, as a vessel of
 wine is a vessel filled with wine; <I>full of the fury of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>.

 In these God is willing to show his wrath, that is, his punishing
 justice, and his enmity to sin. This must be shown to all the world, 
 God will make it appear that he hates sin. He will likewise make his 
 power known, <B><I>to dynaton autou.</I></B> It is a power of strength 
 and energy, an inflicting power, which works and effects the 
 destruction of those that perish; it is a destruction that proceeds 
 from the <I>glory of his power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:9">2 Thess. i. 9</A>.

 The eternal damnation of sinners will be an abundant demonstration of
 the power of God; for he will act in it himself immediately, his wrath 
 preying as it were upon guilty consciences, and his arm stretched out 
 totally to destroy their well-being, and yet at the same instant 
 wonderfully to preserve the being of the creature. In order to this, 
 God <I>endured them with much long-suffering</I>--exercised a great 
 deal of patience towards them, let them alone to fill up the measure of 
 sin, to grow till they were ripe for ruin, and so they became <I>fitted 
 for destruction,</I> fitted by their own sin and self-hardening. The 
 reigning corruptions and wickedness of the soul are its preparedness 
 and disposedness for hell: a soul is hereby made combustible matter, 
 fit for the flames of hell. When Christ said to the Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32">Matt. xxiii. 32</A>),

 <I>Fill you up then the measure of your father, that upon you may come 
 all the righteous blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 he did, as it were, endure them with much long-suffering, that they 
 might, by their own obstinacy and wilfulness in sin, fit themselves for 
 destruction. 

 [2.] <I>Vessels of mercy</I>--filled with mercy. The happiness bestowed 
 upon the saved remnant is the fruit, not of their merit, but of God's 
 mercy. The spring of all the joy and glory of heaven is that mercy of 
 God which endures for ever. Vessels of honour must to eternity own 
 themselves vessels of mercy. Observe, <I>First,</I> What he designs in 
 them: <I>To make known the riches of his glory,</I> that is, of his 
 goodness; for God's goodness is his greatest glory, especially when it 
 is communicated with the greatest sovereignty. <I>I beseech thee show 
 me thy glory,</I> says Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:18">Exod. xxxiii. 18</A>.
 
 <I>I will make all my goodness to pass before thee,</I> says God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and that given out freely: <I>I will be gracious to whom I will be
 gracious.</I> God makes known his glory, this goodness of his, in the 
 preservation and supply of all the creatures: the earth is full of his 
 goodness, and the year crowned with it; but when he would demonstrate 
 the riches of his goodness, unsearchable riches, he does it in the 
 salvation of the saints, that will be to eternity glorious monuments of 
 divine grace. <I>Secondly,</I> What he does for them he does before
 <I>prepare them to glory.</I> Sanctification is the preparation of the 
 soul for glory, making it meet to partake of the inheritance of the 
 saints in light. This is God's work. We can destroy ourselves fast
 enough, but we cannot save ourselves. Sinners fit themselves for hell, 
 but it is God that prepares saints for heaven; and all those that God 
 designs for heaven hereafter he prepares and fits for heaven now: he
 works them to the self-same thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5">2 Cor. v. 5</A>.

 And would you know who these <I>vessels of mercy are?</I> Those whom he 
 hath called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 for whom he did predestinate those he also called with an effectual
 call: and these not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles; for, the 
 partition-wall being taken down, the world was laid in common, and not 
 (as it had been) God's favour appropriated to the Jews, and they put a 
 degree nearer his acceptance than the rest of the world. They now stood 
 upon the same level with the Gentiles; and the question is not now 
 whether of the seed of Abraham or no, that is neither here nor there, 
 but whether or no called according to his purpose.</P>

 &nbsp; 29  And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had
 left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto
 Gomorrha.

 Having explained the promise, and proved the divine sovereignty, the 
 apostle here shows how the rejection of the Jews, and the taking in of 
 the Gentiles, were foretold in the Old Testament, and therefore must 
 needs be very well consistent with the promise made to the fathers 
 under the Old Testament. It tends very much to the clearing of a truth 
 to observe how the scripture is fulfilled in it. The Jews would, no 
 doubt, willingly refer it to the Old Testament, the scriptures of which 
 were committed to them. Now he shows how this, which was so uneasy to 
 them, was there spoken of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By the prophet Hosea, who speaks of the taking in of a great many of 
 the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:23,Ho+1:10">Hos. ii. 23 and Hos. i. 10</A>.

 The Gentiles had not been the people of God, not owning him, nor being
 owned by him in that relation: "But," says he, "<I>I will call them my 
 people,</I> make them such and own them as such, notwithstanding all 
 their unworthiness." A blessed change! Former badness is no bar to 
 God's present grace and mercy.--<I>And her beloved which was not 
 beloved.</I> Those whom God calls his people he calls beloved: he loves 
 those that are his own. And lest it might be supposed that they should 
 become God's people only by being proselyted to the Jewish religion, 
 and made members of that nation, he adds, from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10">Hos. i. 10</A>,

 <I>In the place where it was said,</I> &c., <I>there shall they be
 called.</I> They need not be embodied with the Jews, nor go up to 
 Jerusalem to worship; but, wherever they are scattered over the face of 
 the earth, there will God own them. Observe the great dignity and 
 honour of the saints, that they are called the children of the living 
 God; and his calling them so makes them so. Behold, what manner of
 love! This honour have all his saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By the prophet Isaiah, who speaks of the casting off of many of the 
 Jews, in two places.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:22,23">Isa. x. 22, 23</A>,

 which speaks of the saving of a remnant, that is, but a remnant, which, 
 though in the prophecy it seems to refer to the preservation of a 
 remnant from the destruction and desolation that were coming upon them 
 by Sennacherib and his army, yet is to be understood as looking 
 further, and sufficiently proves that it is no strange thing for God to 
 abandon to ruin a great many of the seed of Abraham, and yet maintain 
 his word of promise to Abraham in full force and virtue. This is 
 intimated in the supposition that the number of children of Israel was 
 as the sand of the sea, which was part of the promise made to Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>.

 And yet only a remnant shall be saved; for many are called, but few are
 chosen. In this salvation of the remnant we are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)
 
 from the prophet, 

 (1.) That he will complete the work: <I>He will finish the work.</I> 
 When God begins he will make an end, whether in ways of judgment or of 
 mercy. The rejection of the unbelieving Jews god would finish in their 
 utter ruin by the Romans, who soon after this quite took away their 
 place and nation. The assuming of Christian churches into the divine 
 favour, and the spreading of the gospel in other nations, was a work 
 which God would likewise finish, and be known by his name 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>. As for God, his work is perfect. Margin,
 <I>He will finish the account.</I> God, in his eternal counsels, has 
 taken an account of the children of men, allotted them to such or such 
 a condition, to such a share of privileges; and, as they come into 
 being, his dealings with them are pursuant to these counsels: and he 
 will finish the account, complete the mystical body, call in as many as 
 belong to the election of grace, and then the account will be finished.

 (2.) That he will contract it; not only finish it, but finish it 
 quickly. Under the Old Testament he seemed to tarry, and to make a 
 longer and more tedious work of it. The wheels moved but slowly towards 
 the extent of the church; but now he will <I>cut it short,</I> and make 
 a short work upon the earth. Gentile converts were now flying as a 
 cloud. But he will cut it short <I>in righteousness,</I> both in wisdom 
 and in justice. Men, when they cut short, do amiss; they do indeed 
 despatch causes; but, when God cuts short, it is always in 
 righteousness. So the fathers generally apply it. Some understand it of 
 the evangelical law and covenant, which Christ has introduced and 
 established in the world: he has in that finished the work, put an end 
 to the types and ceremonies of the Old Testament. Christ said, <I>It is 
 finished,</I> and then the veil was rent, echoing as it were to the 
 word that Christ said upon the cross. And he will cut it short. <I>The 
 work</I> (it is <B><I>logos</I></B>--<I>the word,</I> the law) was 
 under the Old Testament very long; a long train of institutions, 
 ceremonies, conditions: but now it is cut short. Our duty is now, under 
 the gospel, summed up in much less room than it was under the law; the 
 covenant was abridged and contracted; religion is brought into a less 
 compass. And it is in righteousness, in favour to us, in justice to his 
 own design and counsel. With us contractions are apt to darken 
 things:--</P>

 <P> 

 but it is not so in this case. Though it be cut short, it is clear and 
 plain; and, because short, the more easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Another is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:9">Isa. i. 9</A>,

 where the prophet is showing how in a time of general calamity and
 destruction God would preserve a seed. This is to the same purport
 with the former; and the scope of it is to show that it was no strange 
 thing for God to leave the greatest part of the people of the Jews to 
 ruin, and to reserve to himself only a small remnant: so he had done 
 formerly, as appears by their own prophets; and they must not wonder if 
 he did so now. Observe,

 (1.) What God is. He is <I>the Lord of sabaoth,</I> that is, the Lord
 of hosts--a Hebrew word retained in the Greek, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">James v. 4</A>.

 All the host of heaven and earth are at his beck and disposal. When God
 secures a seed to himself out of a degenerate apostate world, he acts
 as Lord of sabaoth. It is an act of almighty power and infinite
 sovereignty.

 (2.) What his people are; they are a <I>seed,</I> a small number. The 
 corn reserved for next year's seedings is but little, compared with 
 that which is spent and eaten. But they are a useful number--the seed, 
 the substance, of the next generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">Isa. vi. 13</A>.

 It is so far from being an impeachment of the justice and righteousness
 of God that so many perish and are destroyed, that it is a wonder of 
 divine power and mercy that all are not destroyed, that there are any 
 saved; for even those that are left to be a seed, if God had dealt with 
 them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This is the 
 great truth which this scripture teacheth us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed
 not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the
 righteousness which is of faith.
 &nbsp; 31  But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,
 hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
 &nbsp; 32  Wherefore? Because <I>they sought it</I> not by faith, but as it
 were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that
 stumblingstone;
 &nbsp; 33  As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and
 rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be
 ashamed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle comes here at last to fix the true reason of the reception 
 of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews. There was a difference 
 in the way of their seeking, and therefore there was that different 
 success, though still it was the free grace of God that made them 
 differ. He concludes like an orator, <I>What shall we say then?</I> 
 What is the conclusion of the whole dispute?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the Gentiles observe, 

 1. How they had been alienated from righteousness: the followed not
 after it; they knew not their guilt and misery, and therefore were not 
 at all solicitous to procure a remedy. In their conversion preventing
 grace was greatly magnified: God was <I>found of those that sought him 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.

 There was nothing in them to dispose them for such a favour more than
 what free grace wrought in them. Thus doth God delight to dispense 
 grace in a way of sovereignty and absolute dominion. 

 2. How they attained to righteousness, notwithstanding: <I>By
 faith;</I> not by being proselyted to the Jewish religion, and 
 submitting to the ceremonial law, but by embracing Christ, and 
 believing in Christ, and submitting to the gospel. They attained to 
 that by the short cut of believing sincerely in Christ for which the 
 Jews had been long in vain beating about the bush.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the Jews observe, 

 1. How they missed their end: they <I>followed after the law of
 righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)--

 they talked much of justification and holiness, seemed very ambitious
 of being the people of God and the favourites of heaven, but they did 
 not attain to it, that is, the greatest part of them did not; as many 
 as stuck to their old Jewish principles and ceremonies, and pursued a 
 happiness in those observances, embracing the shadows now that the 
 substance was come, these fell short of acceptance with God, were not 
 owned as his people, nor went to their house justified. 

 2. How they mistook their way, which was the cause of their missing the
 end,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 They sought, but not in the right way, not in the humbling way, not in
 the instituted appointed way. <I>Not by faith,</I> not by embracing the 
 Christian religion, and depending upon the merit of Christ, and 
 submitting to the terms of the gospel, which were the very life and end 
 of the law. But they sought by the <I>works of the law;</I> as if they 
 were to expect justification by their observance of the precepts and 
 ceremonies of the law of Moses. This was the <I>stumbling-stone at 
 which they stumbled.</I> They could not get over this corrupt principle 
 which they had espoused, That the law was given them for no end but 
 that merely by their observance of it, and obedience to it, they might 
 be justified before God: and so they could by no means be reconciled to 
 the doctrine of Christ, which brought them off from that to expect 
 justification through the merit and satisfaction of another. Christ 
 himself is to some a stone of stumbling, for which he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14,28:16">Isa. viii. 14; xxviii. 16</A>.

 It is sad that Christ should be set for the fall of any, and yet it is
 so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>),

 that ever poison should be sucked out of the balm of Gilead, that the
 foundation-stone should be to any a stone of stumbling, and the rock of 
 salvation a rock of offence; so he is to multitudes; so he was to the 
 unbelieving Jews, who rejected him, because he put an end to the 
 ceremonial law. But still there is a remnant that do believe on him; 
 and they <I>shall not be ashamed,</I> that is, their hopes and 
 expectations of justification by him shall not be disappointed, as 
 theirs are who expect it by the law. So that, upon the whole, the 
 unbelieving Jews have no reason to quarrel with God for rejecting them; 
 they had a fair offer of righteousness, and life, and salvation, made 
 to them upon gospel terms, which they did not like, and would not come 
 up to; and therefore, if they perish, they may thank themselves--their 
 blood is upon their own heads.</P>
