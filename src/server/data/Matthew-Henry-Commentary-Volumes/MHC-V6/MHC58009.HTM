 The apostle, having declared the Old-Testament dispensation antiquated 
 and vanishing away, proceeds to let the Hebrews see the correspondence 
 there was between the Old Testament and the New; and that whatever was 
 excellent in the Old was typical and representative of the New, which 
 therefore must as far excel the Old as the substance does the shadow. 
 The Old Testament was never intended to be rested in, but to prepare 
 for the institutions of the gospel. And here he treats, 

 I. Of the tabernacle, the place of worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Of the worship and services performed in the tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 III. He delivers the spiritual sense and the main design of all,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then verily the first <I>covenant</I> had also ordinances of
 divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 2  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein <I>was</I> the
 candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called
 the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 3  And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
 Holiest of all;
 &nbsp; 4  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
 overlaid round about with gold, wherein <I>was</I> the golden pot that
 had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
 covenant;
 &nbsp; 5  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat;
 of which we cannot now speak particularly.
 &nbsp; 6  Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
 always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service <I>of
 God.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  But into the second <I>went</I> the high priest alone once every
 year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and <I>for</I>
 the errors of the people:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The apostle gives an account of the tabernacle, that place of 
 worship which God appointed to be pitched on earth; it is called <I>a 
 worldly</I> sanctuary, wholly of this world, as to the materials of 
 which it was built, and a building that must be taken down; it is 
 called a worldly <I>sanctuary,</I> because it was the court and palace 
 of the King of Israel. God was their King, and, as other kings, had his 
 court or place of residence, and attendants, furniture, and provision, 
 suitable thereto. This tabernacle (of which we have the model,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:1-27:21">Exod. xxv.-xxvii.</A>)

 was a moving temple, shadowing forth the unsettled state of the church
 militant, and the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the 
 fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. Now of this tabernacle it is said 
 that it was divided into two parts, called a first and a second 
 tabernacle, an inner and an outer part, representing the two states of 
 the church militant and triumphant, and the two natures of Christ, 
 human and divine. We are also told what was placed in each part of the 
 tabernacle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the outer part: and there were several things, of which you have 
 here a sort of schedule. 

 (1.) The candlestick; doubtless not an empty and unlighted one, but 
 where the lamps were always burning. And there was need of it, for 
 there were no windows in the sanctuary; and this was to convince the 
 Jews of the darkness and the mysterious nature of that dispensation. 
 Their light was only candle-light, in comparison of the fullness of 
 light which Christ, the Sun of righteousness, would bring along with 
 him, and communicate to his people; for all our light is derived from 
 him the fountain of light. 

 (2.) The table and the show-bread set upon it. This table was set 
 directly opposite to the candlestick, which shows that by light from 
 Christ we must have communion with him and with one another. We must 
 not come in the dark to his table, but by light from Christ must 
 discern the Lord's body. On this table were placed twelve loaves for 
 the twelve tribes of Israel, a loaf for a tribe, which stood from 
 sabbath to sabbath, and on that day were renewed. This show-bread may 
 be considered either as the provision of the palace (though the King of 
 Israel needed it not, yet, in resemblance of the palaces of earthly 
 kings, there must be this provision laid in weekly), or the provision 
 made in Christ for the souls of his people, suitable to the wants and 
 to the relief of their souls. He is the bread of life; in our Father's 
 house there is bread enough and to spare; we may have fresh supplies 
 from Christ, especially every Lord's day. This outer part is called 
 <I>the sanctuary or holy,</I> because erected to the worship of a holy 
 God, to represent a holy Jesus, and to entertain a holy people, for 
 their further improvement in holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have an account of what was in the inner part of the sanctuary, 
 which was within the second veil, and is called <I>the holiest of 
 all.</I> This second veil, which divided between the holy and the most 
 holy place, was a type of the body of Christ, by the rending whereof 
 not only a view, but a way, was opened for us into the holiest of all, 
 the type of heaven itself. Now in this part were, 

 (1.) The golden censer, which was to hold the incense, or the golden 
 altar set up to burn the incense upon; both the one and the other were 
 typical of Christ, of his pleasing and prevailing intercession which he 
 makes in heaven, grounded upon the merits and satisfaction of his 
 sacrifice, upon which we are to depend for acceptance and the blessing 
 from God.

 (2.) The ark of the covenant overlaid round about with pure gold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This typified Christ, his perfect obedience to the law and his 
 fulfilling of all righteousness for us. Now here we are told both what 
 was in this ark and what was over it. 

 [1.] What was in it. <I>First, The golden pot that had manna,</I>
 which, when preserved by the Israelites in their own houses, contrary 
 to the command of God, presently putrefied; but now, being by God's 
 appointment deposited here in this house, was kept from putrefaction, 
 always pure and sweet; and this to teach us that it is only in Christ 
 that our persons, our graces, our performances are kept pure. It was 
 also a type of the bread of life we have in Christ, the true ambrosia 
 that gives immortality. This was also a memorial of God's miraculously
 feeding his people in the wilderness, that they might never forget such 
 signal favour, nor distrust God for the time to come. <I>Secondly, 
 Aaron's rod that budded,</I> and thereby showed that God had chosen him 
 of the tribe of Levi to minister before him of all the tribes of 
 Israel, and so an end was put to the murmuring of the people, and to 
 their attempt to invade the priest's office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+17:1-13">Num. xvii</A>.

 This was that rod of God with which Moses and Aaron wrought such
 wonders; and this was a type of Christ, who is styled <I>the man, the 
 branch</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12">Zech. vi. 12</A>),

 by whom God has wrought wonders for the spiritual deliverance, defence, 
 and supply of his people, and for the destruction of their enemies. It 
 was a type of divine justice, by which Christ the Rock was smitten, and 
 from whom the cool refreshing waters of life flow into our souls. 
 <I>Thirdly, The tables of the covenant,</I> in which the moral law was 
 written, signifying the regard God has to the preservation of his holy 
 law, and the care we all ought to have that we keep the law of 
 God--that this we can only do in and through Christ, by strength from 
 him nor can our obedience by accepted but through him. 

 [2.] What was over the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat. First,</I>
 The mercy-seat, which was the covering of the ark; it was called <I>the 
 propitiatory,</I> and it was of pure gold, as long and as broad as the 
 ark in which the tables of the law were laid. It was an eminent type
 of Christ, and of his perfect righteousness, ever adequate to the 
 dimensions of the law of God, and covering all our transgressions, 
 interposing between the Shechinah, or symbol of God's presence, and our 
 sinful failures, and covering them. <I>Secondly, The cherubim of 
 glory</I> shadowing the mercy-seat, representing the holy angels of 
 God, who take pleasure in looking into the great work of our redemption 
 by Christ, and are ready to perform every good office, under the 
 Redeemer, for those who are the heirs of salvation. The angels
 attended Christ at his birth, in his temptation, under his agonies, at 
 his resurrection, and in his ascension, and will attend his second 
 coming. God manifest in the flesh was seen, observed, visited, by the 
 angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From the description of the place of worship in the Old-Testament 
 dispensation, the apostle proceeds to speak of the duties and services 
 performed in those places, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When the several parts and furniture of the tabernacle were thus 
 settled, then what was to be done there?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The ordinary priests went always into the first tabernacle, to 
 accomplish the service of God. Observe, 

 (1.) None but priests were to enter into the first part of the 
 tabernacle, and this to teach us all that persons not qualified, not 
 called of God, must not intrude into the office and work of the 
 ministry. 

 (2.) The ordinary priests were only to enter into the first part of the 
 tabernacle, it would have been fatal presumption in them to have gone 
 into the holiest of all; and this teaches us that even ministers 
 themselves must know and keep in their proper stations, and not presume 
 to usurp the prerogative of Christ, by offering up incense of their 
 own, or adding their own inventions to the ordinances of Christ, or 
 lording it over men's consciences.

 (3.) These ordinary priests were to enter into the first tabernacle 
 always; that is, they were to devote themselves and all their time to 
 the work of their office, and not alienate themselves at any time from 
 it; they were to be in an habitual readiness for the discharge of their 
 office, and at all stated appointed times were actually to attend to 
 their work. 

 (4.) The ordinary priests must enter into the first tabernacle, that 
 they might there accomplish the service of God. They must not do the 
 work of God partially or by halves, but stand complete in the whole of 
 his will and counsel; not only beginning well, but proceeding well, and 
 persevering to the end, fulfilling the ministry they had received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Into the second, the interior part, went the high priest along, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This part was an emblem of heaven, and Christ's ascension thither.
 Here observe,

 (1.) None but the high priest must go into the holiest; so none but 
 Christ could enter into heaven in his own name, by his own right, and 
 by his own merits. 

 (2.) In entering into the holiest, the high priest must first go 
 through the outer sanctuary, and through the veil, signifying that 
 Christ went to heaven through a holy life and a violent death; the veil 
 of his flesh was rent asunder. 

 (3.) The high priest entered but once a year into the holiest, and in 
 this the antitype excels the type (as in every thing else), for he has 
 entered once for all, during the whole dispensation of the gospel. 

 (4.) The high priest must not enter without blood, signifying that 
 Christ, having undertaken to be our high priest, could not have been 
 admitted into heaven without shedding his blood for us, and that none 
 of us can enter either into God's gracious presence here or his 
 glorious presence hereafter, but by the blood of Jesus.

 (5.) The high priest, under the law, entering into the holiest, offered 
 up that blood for himself and his own errors first, and then for the 
 errors of the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This teaches us that Christ is a more excellent person and high priest 
 than any under the law, for he has no errors of his own to offer for. 
 And it teaches us that ministers, when in the name of Christ they 
 intercede for others, must first apply the blood of Christ to 
 themselves for their pardon.

 (6.) When the legal high priest had offered for himself, he must not 
 stop there, but must also offer for the errors of the people. Our high
 priest, though he needs not to offer for himself, yet forgets not to 
 offer for his people; he pleads the merit of his sufferings for the 
 benefit of his people on earth. Observe,

 [1.] Sins are errors, and great errors, both in judgment and practice. 
 We greatly err when we sin against God; and who can understand all his 
 errors?

 [2.] They are such errors as leave guilt upon the conscience, not to be 
 washed away but by the blood of Christ; and the sinful errors of 
 priests and people must be all done away by the same means, the 
 application of the blood of Christ; we must plead this blood on earth, 
 while he is pleading it in heaven for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
 of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle
 was yet standing:
 &nbsp; 9  Which <I>was</I> a figure for the time then present, in which were
 offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that
 did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
 &nbsp; 10  <I>Which stood</I> only in meats and drinks, and divers washings,
 and carnal ordinances, imposed <I>on them</I> until the time of
 reformation.
 &nbsp; 11  But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come,
 by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
 that is to say, not of this building;
 &nbsp; 12  Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
 blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
 eternal redemption <I>for us.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
 heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
 the flesh:
 &nbsp; 14  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
 eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
 conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle undertakes to deliver to us the mind and 
 meaning of the Holy Ghost in all the ordinances of the tabernacle and 
 legal economy, comprehending both place and worship. The scriptures of 
 the Old Testament were given by inspiration of God; holy men of old 
 spoke and wrote as the Holy Ghost directed them. And these 
 Old-Testament records are of great use and significancy, not only to 
 those who first received them, but even to Christians, who ought not to 
 satisfy themselves with reading the institutes of the Levitical law, 
 but should learn what the Holy Ghost signifies and suggests to them 
 thereby. Now here are several things mentioned as the things that the 
 Holy Ghost signified and certified to his people hereby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, 
 while the first tabernacle was standing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This was one lesson the Holy Ghost would teach us by these types; the 
 way to heaven was not so clear and plain, nor so much frequented, under 
 the Old Testament as under the New. It is the honour of Christ and the 
 gospel, and the happiness of those who live under it, that now life and 
 immortality are brought to light. There was not that free access to God 
 then that there is now; God has now opened a wider door; and there is 
 room for more, yea, even for as many as are truly willing to return 
 unto him by Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the first tabernacle was only a figure for the time then 
 present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It was a dark dispensation, and but of short continuance, only designed 
 for awhile to typify the great things of Christ and the gospel, that 
 were in due time to shine forth in their own brightness, and thereby 
 cause all the shadows to flee away and disappear, as the stars before 
 the rising sun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That none of the gifts and sacrifices there offered could make the 
 offerers perfect as pertaining to conscience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 that is, they could not take away the desert, or defilement, or 
 dominion, of sin; they could not deliver conscience from a dread of the 
 wrath of God; they could neither discharge the debts, nor resolve the 
 doubts, of him who did the service. A man might run through them all in 
 their several orders and frequent returns, and continue to do so all 
 his days, and yet not find his conscience either pacified or purified 
 by them; he might thereby be saved from corporal and temporal 
 punishments that were threatened against the non-observers, but he 
 could not be saved by them from sin or hell, as all those are who 
 believe in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Holy Ghost hereby signifies that the Old-Testament institutions
 were by external carnal ordinances imposed upon them until the time of 
 reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Their imperfection lay in three things:--

 1. Their nature. They were but external and carnal meats and drinks,
 and divers washings. All these were bodily exercises, which profit 
 little; they could only satisfy the flesh, or at best sanctify to the 
 purifying of the flesh. 

 2. They were not such as were left indifferent to them to use or
 disuse, but they were imposed upon them by grievous corporal 
 punishments, and this was ordered on purpose to make them look more to 
 the promised Seed, and long more for him. 

 3. These were never designed for a perpetuity, but only to continue
 till the time of reformation, till the better things provided for them 
 were actually bestowed upon them. Gospel times are and should be times 
 of reformation,--of clearer light as to all things necessary to be 
 known,--of greater love, inducing us to bear ill-will to none, but 
 good-will to all, and to have complacency in all that are like God,--of 
 greater liberty and freedom both of spirit and speech--and of a more 
 holy living according to the rule of the gospel. We have far greater 
 advantages under the gospel than they had under the law; and either we 
 must be better or we shall be worse. A conversation becoming the gospel 
 is an excellent way of living; nothing mean, foolish, vain, or servile 
 becomes the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The Holy Ghost signifies to us hereby that we never make the right 
 use of types but when we apply them to the antitype; and, whenever we 
 do so, it will be very evident that the antitype (as in reason it 
 should) greatly excels the type, which is the main drift and design of 
 all that is said. And, as he writes to those who believed that Christ 
 had come and that Jesus was the Christ, so he very justly infers that 
 he is infinitely above all legal high priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 and he illustrates it very fully. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Christ is a high priest of good things to come,</I> by which may 
 be understood, 

 (1.) All the good things that were to come during the Old Testament, 
 and now have come under the New. All the spiritual and eternal 
 blessings the Old-Testament saints had in their day and under their 
 dispensation were owing to the Messiah to come, on whom they believed. 
 The Old Testament set forth in shadows what was to come; the New 
 Testament is the accomplishment of the Old. 

 (2.) All the good things yet to come and to be enjoyed in a gospel 
 state, when the promises and prophecies made to the gospel church in 
 the latter days shall be accomplished; all these depend upon Christ and 
 his priesthood, and shall be fulfilled. 

 (3.) Of all the good things to come in the heavenly state, which will 
 perfect both the Testaments; as the state of glory will perfect the 
 state of grace, this state will be in a much higher sense the 
 perfection of the New Testament than the New Testament was the 
 perfection of the Old. Observe, All things past, present, and to come, 
 were, and are, founded upon, and flowing from, the priestly office of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ is a high priest <I>by a greater and more perfect tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 a tabernacle not made with hands, that is to say, not of this 
 building,</I> but his own body, or rather human nature, conceived by 
 the Holy Ghost overshadowing the blessed virgin. This was a new fabric, 
 a new order of building, infinitely superior to all earthly structures, 
 not excepting the tabernacle of the temple itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ, our high priest, has entered into heaven, not as their high 
 priest entered into the holiest, with the blood of bulls and of goats, 
 but by his own blood, typified by theirs, and infinitely more precious. 
 And this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Not for one year only, which showed the imperfection of that 
 priesthood, that it did but typically obtain a year's reprieve or 
 pardon. But our high priest entered into heaven <I>once for all,</I> 
 and has obtained not a yearly respite, but eternal redemption, and so 
 needs not to make an annual entrance. In each of the types there was 
 something that showed it was a type, and resembled the antitype, and 
 something that showed it was but a type, and fell short of the 
 antitype, and therefore ought by no means to be set up in competition 
 with the antitype.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The Holy Ghost further signified and showed what was the efficacy of 
 the blood of the Old-Testament sacrifices, and thence is inferred the 
 much greater efficacy of the blood of Christ. 

 (1.) The efficacy of the blood of the legal sacrifices extended to the 
 purifying of the flesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 it freed the outward man from ceremonial uncleanness and from temporal 
 punishment, and entitled him to, and fitted him for, some external 
 privileges. 

 (2.) He infers very justly hence the far greater efficacy of the blood 
 of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>How much more shall the blood of Christ,</I> &c. Here observe,

 [1.] What it was that gave such efficacy to the blood of Christ.
 <I>First,</I> It was his offering himself to God, the human nature upon 
 the altar of his divine nature, he being priest, altar, and sacrifice, 
 his divine nature serving for the two former, and his human nature for 
 the last; now such a priest, altar, and sacrifice, could not but be 
 propitiatory. <I>Secondly,</I> It was Christ's offering up himself to 
 God through the eternal Spirit, not only as the divine nature supported 
 the human, but the Holy Ghost, which he had without measure, helping 
 him in all, and in this great act of obedience offering himself.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> It was Christ's offering himself to God without spot, 
 without any sinful stain either in his nature or life; this was 
 conformable to the law of sacrifices, which required them to be without 
 blemish. Now further observe,

 [2.] What the efficacy of Christ's blood is; it is very great. For, 
 <I>First,</I> It is sufficient to purge the conscience from dead works, 
 it reaches to the very soul and conscience, the defiled soul, defiled 
 with sin, which is a dead work, proceeds from spiritual death, and 
 tends to death eternal. As the touching of a dead body gave a legal
 uncleanness, so meddling with sin gives a moral and real defilement, 
 fixes it in the very soul; but the blood of Christ has efficacy to 
 purge it out. <I>Secondly,</I> It is sufficient to enable us to serve
 the living God, not only by purging away that guilt which separates 
 between God and sinners, but by sanctifying and renewing the soul 
 through the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit, purchased by Christ 
 for this purpose, that we might be enabled to serve the living God in a 
 lively manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle considers the gospel under the notion of a 
 will or testament, the new or last will and testament of Christ, and 
 shows the necessity and efficacy of the blood of Christ to make this 
 testament valid and effectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The gospel is here considered as a testament, the new and last will 
 and testament of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is observable 
 that the solemn transactions that pass between God and man are 
 sometimes called a covenant, here a testament. A covenant is an 
 agreement between two or more parties about things that are in their 
 own power, or may be so, and this either with or without a mediator; 
 this agreement takes effect at such time and in such manner as therein 
 declared. A testament is a voluntary act and deed of a single person, 
 duly executed and witnessed, bestowing legacies on such legatees as are 
 described and characterized by the testator, and which can only take 
 effect upon his death. Now observe, Christ is the Mediator of a New 
 Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 and he is so for several ends and purposes here mentioned. 

 1. To redeem persons from their transgressions committed against the
 law or first testament, which makes every transgression a forfeiture of
 liberty, and makes men debtors, and slaves or prisoners, who need to be
 redeemed. 

 2. To qualify all those that are effectually called to receive the
 promise of an eternal inheritance. These are the great legacies that 
 Christ by his last will and testament has bequeathed to the truly 
 characterized legatees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To make this New Testament effectual, it was necessary that Christ 
 should die; the legacies accrue by means of death. This he proves by 
 two arguments:--

 1. From the general nature of every will or testamentary disposition,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Where a testament is, where it acts and operates, there must of 
 necessity by the death of the testator; till then the property is still 
 in the testator's hand, and he has power to revoke, cancel, or alter, 
 his will as he pleases; so that no estate, no right, is conveyed by 
 will, till the testator's death has made it unalterable and effectual.
 
 2. From the particular method that was taken by Moses in the
 ratification of the first testament, which was not done without blood,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>,

 &c. All men by sin had become guilty before God, had forfeited their
 inheritance, their liberties, and their very lives, into the hands of 
 divine justice; but God, being willing to show the greatness of his 
 mercy, proclaimed a covenant of grace, and ordered it to be typically 
 administered under the Old Testament, but not without the blood and 
 life of the creature; and God accepted the blood of bulls and goats, as 
 typifying the blood of Christ; and by these means the covenant of grace 
 was ratified under the former dispensation. The method taken by Moses, 
 according to the direction he had received from God, is here 
 particularly related 

 (1.) Moses spoke every precept to all the people, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He published to them the tenour of the covenant, the duties required, 
 the rewards promised to those who did their duty, and the punishment 
 threatened against the transgressors, and he called for their consent 
 to the terms of the covenant; and this in an express manner.

 (2.) Then he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and 
 scarlet wool, and hyssop, and applied this blood by sprinkling it.
 This blood and water signified the blood and water that came out of our 
 Saviour's pierced side, for justification and sanctification, and also 
 shadowed forth the two sacraments of the New Testament, baptism and the 
 Lord's supper, with scarlet wool, signifying the righteousness of 
 Christ with which we must be clothed, the hyssop signifying that faith 
 by which we must apply all. Now with these Moses sprinkled, 

 [1.] The book of the law and covenant, to show that the covenant of 
 grace is confirmed by the blood of Christ and made effectual to our 
 good.

 [2.] The people, intimating that the shedding of the blood of Christ 
 will be no advantage to us if it be not applied to us. And the 
 sprinkling of both the book and the people signified the mutual consent 
 of both parties, God and man, and their mutual engagements to each 
 other in this covenant through Christ, Moses at the same time using 
 these words, <I>This is the blood of the testament which God hath 
 enjoined unto you.</I> This blood, typifying the blood of Christ, is 
 the ratification of the covenant of grace to all true believers.

 [3.] He sprinkled the tabernacle and all the utensils of it, intimating 
 that all the sacrifices offered up and services performed there were 
 accepted only through the blood of Christ, which procures the remission 
 of that iniquity that cleaves to our holy things, which could not have 
 been remitted but by that atoning blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  <I>It was</I> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in
 the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly
 things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
 &nbsp; 24  For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
 hands, <I>which are</I> the figures of the true; but into heaven
 itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
 &nbsp; 25  Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high
 priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of
 others;
 &nbsp; 26  For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
 the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared
 to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
 &nbsp; 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
 the judgment:
 &nbsp; 28  So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and
 unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time
 without sin unto salvation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this last part of the chapter, the apostle goes on to tell us what 
 the Holy Ghost has signified to us by the legal purifications of the 
 patterns of the things in heaven, inferring thence the necessity of 
 better sacrifices to consecrate the heavenly things themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The necessity of purifying the patterns of the things in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This necessity arises both from the divine appointment, which must 
 always be obeyed, and from the reason of that appointment, which was to 
 preserve a proper resemblance between the things typifying and the 
 things typified. It is observable here that the sanctuary of God on 
 earth is a pattern of heaven, and communion with God in his sanctuary 
 is to his people a heaven upon earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The necessity that the heavenly things themselves should be 
 purified with better sacrifices than of bulls and goats; the things 
 themselves are better than the patterns, and must therefore be 
 consecrated with better sacrifices. These heavenly things are the 
 privileges of the gospel state, begun in grace, perfected in glory. 
 These must be ratified by a suitable sanction or consecration; and this 
 was the blood of Christ. Now it is very evident that the sacrifice of 
 Christ is infinitely better than those of the law. 

 1. From the places in which the sacrifices under the law, and that
 under the gospel, were offered. Those under the law were the holy 
 places made with hands, which are but figures of the true sanctuary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Christ's sacrifice, though offered upon earth, was by himself carried 
 up into heaven, and is there presented in a way of daily intercession; 
 for he appears in the presence of God for us. He has gone to heaven, 
 not only to enjoy the rest and receive the honour due to him, but to 
 appear in the presence of God for us, to present our persons and our 
 performances, to answer and rebuke our adversary and accuser, to secure 
 our interest, to perfect all our affairs, and to prepare a place for 
 us. 
 
 2. From the sacrifices themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Those under the law were the lives and blood of other creatures of a
 different nature from the offerers--the blood of beasts, a thing of 
 small value, and which would have been of none at all in this matter 
 had it not had a typical respect to the blood of Christ; but the 
 sacrifice of Christ was the oblation of himself; he offered his own 
 blood, truly called, by virtue of the hypostatical union, <I>the blood 
 of God;</I> and therefore of infinite value. 

 3. From the frequent repetition of the legal sacrifices. This showed
 the imperfection of that law; but it is the honour and perfection of 
 Christ's sacrifice that, being once offered, it was sufficient to all 
 the ends of it; and indeed the contrary would have been absurd, for 
 then he must have been still dying and rising again, and ascending and 
 then again descending and dying; and the great work had been always 
 <I>in fieri--always doing,</I> and always to do, but never finished, 
 which would be as contrary to reason as it is to revelation, and to the 
 dignity of his person: <I>But now once in the end of the world hath he 
 appeared, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</I> The gospel 
 is the last dispensation of the grace of God to men. 

 4. From the inefficacy of the legal sacrifices, and the efficacy of
 Christ's sacrifice. The legal sacrifices could not of themselves put 
 away sin, neither procure pardon for it now power against it. Sin would 
 still have lain upon us, and had dominion over us; but Jesus Christ by 
 one sacrifice has made an end of sin, he has destroyed the works of the 
 devil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle illustrates the argument from the appointment of God 
 concerning men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 and observes something like it in the appointment of God concerning 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The appointment of God concerning men contains in it two 
 things:--

 (1.) That they must once die, or, at least, undergo a change equivalent
 to death. It is an awful thing to die, to have the vital knot loosed or 
 cut asunder, all relations here dropped at once, an end put to our 
 probation and preparation state, and to enter into another world. It is 
 a great work, and it is a work that can be but once done, and therefore 
 had need to be well done. This is matter of comfort to the godly, that 
 they shall die well and die but once; but it is matter of terror to the 
 wicked, who die in their sins, that they cannot return again to do that 
 great work better. 

 (2.) It is appointed to men that after death they shall come to 
 judgment, to a particular judgment immediately after death; for the 
 soul returns to God as to its judge, to be determined to its eternal 
 state; and men shall be brought to the general judgment, at the end of 
 the world. This is the unalterable decree of God concerning men--they 
 must die, and they must be judged. It is appointed for them, and it is 
 to be believed and seriously considered by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The appointment of God concerning Christ, bearing some resemblance 
 to the other. 

 (1.) He must be once offered, to bear the sins of many, of all the 
 Father had given to him, of all who should believe in his name. He was 
 not offered for any sin of his own; he was wounded for our 
 transgressions. God laid on him the iniquity of all his people; and 
 these are many, though not so many as the rest of mankind; yet, when 
 they are all gathered to him, he will be the first-born among many 
 brethren. 

 (2.) It is appointed that Christ shall appear the second time without 
 sin, to the salvation of those who look for him. 

 [1.] He will then appear without sin; at his first appearance, though 
 he had no sin of his own, yet he stood charged with the sins of many; 
 he was the Lamb of God that bore upon him the sins of the world, and 
 then he appeared in the form of sinful flesh; but his second appearance 
 will be without any such charge upon him, he having fully discharged it 
 before, and then his visage shall not be marred, but shall be 
 exceedingly glorious.

 [2.] This will be to the salvation of all who look for him; he will
 then perfect their holiness, their happiness; their number shall then 
 be accomplished, and their salvation completed. Observe, It is the 
 distinguishing character of true believers that they are looking for 
 Christ; they look to him by faith; they look for him by hope and holy 
 desires. They look for him in every duty, in every ordinance, in every 
 providence now; and they expect his second coming, and are preparing 
 for it; and though it will be sudden destruction to the rest of the 
 world, who scoff at the report of it, it will be eternal salvation to 
 those who look for it.</P>
