 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have gone through the former part of this epistle, which consists of 
 several important doctrinal truths, contained in the three preceding 
 chapters. We enter now on the latter part of it, in which we have the 
 most weighty and serious exhortations that can be given. We may observe 
 that in this, as in most others of Paul's epistles, the former part is 
 doctrinal, and fitted to inform the minds of men in the great truths 
 and doctrines of the gospel, the latter is practical, and designed for 
 the direction of their lives and manners, all Christians being bound to 
 endeavour after soundness in the faith, and regularity in life and 
 practice. In what has gone before we have heard of Christian 
 privileges, which are the matter of our comfort. In what follows we 
 shall hear of Christian duties, and what the Lord our God requires of 
 us in consideration of such privileges vouchsafed to us. The best way 
 to understand the mysteries and partake of the privileges of which we 
 have read before is conscientiously to practise the duties prescribed 
 to us in what follows: as, on the other hand, a serious consideration
 and belief of the doctrines that have been taught us in the foregoing 
 chapters will be a good foundation on which to build the practice of 
 the duties prescribed in those which are yet before us. Christian faith 
 and Christian practice mutually befriend each other. In this chapter we 
 have divers exhortations to important duties. 

 I. One that is more general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. An exhortation to mutual love, unity, and concord, with the proper
 means and motives to promote them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:2-16">ver. 2-16</A>.

 III. An exhortation to Christian purity and holiness of life; and that 
 both more general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>)

 and in several particular instances,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25-32">ver. 25,
 to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye
 walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a general exhortation to walk as becomes our Christian 
 profession. Paul was now a prisoner at Rome; and he was the <I>prisoner 
 of the Lord,</I> or in the Lord, which signifies as much as for the 
 Lord. See of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 He mentions this once and again, to show that he was not ashamed of his
 bonds, well knowing that he suffered not as an evil doer: and likewise 
 to recommend what he wrote to them with the greater tenderness and with 
 some special advantage. It was a doctrine he thought worth suffering 
 for, and therefore surely they should think it worthy their serious 
 regards and their dutiful observance. We have here the petition of a 
 poor prisoner, one of Christ's prisoners: "<I>I therefore, the prisoner 
 of the Lord, beseech you,</I>" &c. Considering what God has done for
 you, and to what a state and condition he has called you, as has been 
 discoursed before, I now come with an earnest request to you (not to 
 send me relief, nor to use your interest for the obtaining of my 
 liberty, the first thing which poor prisoners are wont to solicit from 
 their friends, but) that you would approve yourselves good Christians, 
 and live up to your profession and calling; <I>That you walk 
 worthily,</I> agreeably, suitably, and congruously to those happy 
 circumstances into which the grace of God has brought you, whom he has 
 converted from heathenism to Christianity. Observe, Christians ought to 
 accommodate themselves to the gospel by which they are called, and to 
 the glory to which they are called; both are their vocation. We are 
 called Christians; we must answer that name, and live like Christians. 
 We are called to God's kingdom and glory; that kingdom and glory 
 therefore we must mind, and walk as becomes the heirs of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering,
 forbearing one another in love;
 &nbsp; 3  Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
 peace.
 &nbsp; 4  <I>There is</I> one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in
 one hope of your calling;
 &nbsp; 5  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
 &nbsp; 6  One God and Father of all, who <I>is</I> above all, and through
 all, and in you all.
 &nbsp; 7  But unto every one of us is given grace according to the
 measure of the gift of Christ.
 &nbsp; 8  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led
 captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
 &nbsp; 9  (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended
 first into the lower parts of the earth?
 &nbsp; 10  He that descended is the same also that ascended up far
 above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
 &nbsp; 11  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
 evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
 &nbsp; 12  For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
 ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
 &nbsp; 13  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
 knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
 of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
 &nbsp; 14  That we <I>henceforth</I> be no more children, tossed to and fro,
 and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of
 men, <I>and</I> cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
 deceive;
 &nbsp; 15  But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
 things, which is the head, <I>even</I> Christ:
 &nbsp; 16  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted
 by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
 working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body
 unto the edifying of itself in love.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle proceeds to more particular exhortations. Two he 
 enlarges upon in this chapter:--To unity an love, purity and holiness,
 which Christians should very much study. We do not <I>walk worthy of 
 the vocation wherewith we are called</I> if we be not faithful friends 
 to all Christians, and sworn enemies to all sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This section contains the exhortation to mutual love, unity, and 
 concord, with the proper means and motives to promote them. Nothing is 
 pressed upon us more earnestly in the scriptures than this. Love is the 
 law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, the livery of his 
 family. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The means of unity: <I>Lowliness and meekness, long-suffering, and 
 forbearing one another in love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 By lowliness we are to understand humility, entertaining mean thoughts 
 of ourselves, which is opposed to pride. By <I>meekness,</I> that 
 excellent disposition of soul which makes men unwilling to provoke 
 others, and not easily to be provoked or offended with their 
 infirmities; and it is opposed to angry resentments and peevishness. 
 <I>Long-suffering</I> implies a patient bearing of injuries, without 
 seeking revenge. <I>Forbearing one another in love</I> signifies 
 bearing their infirmities out of a principle of love, and so as not to 
 cease to love them on the account of these. The best Christians have 
 need to bear one with another, and to make the best one of another, to 
 provoke one another's graces and not their passions. We find much in 
 ourselves which it is hard to forgive ourselves; and therefore we must 
 not think it much if we find that in others which we think hard to 
 forgive them, and yet we must forgive them as we forgive ourselves. Now 
 without these things unity cannot be preserved. The first step towards 
 unity is humility; without this there will be no meekness, no patience, 
 or forbearance; and without these no unity. Pride and passion break the 
 peace, and make all the mischief. Humility and meekness restore the
 peace, and keep it. <I>Only by pride comes contention;</I> only by 
 humility comes love. The more lowly-mindedness the more 
 like-mindedness. We do not walk worthy of the vocation wherewith we are 
 called if we be not meek and lowly of heart: for he by whom we are 
 called, he to whom we are called, was eminent for meekness and 
 lowliness of heart, and has commanded us therein to learn of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The nature of that unity which the apostle prescribes: it is <I>the 
 unity of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The seat of Christian unity is in the heart or spirit: it does not lie 
 in one set of thoughts, nor in one form and mode of worship, but in one 
 heart and one soul. This unity of heart and affection may be said to be 
 of the Spirit of God; it is wrought by him, and is one of the fruits of 
 the Spirit. This we should endeavour to keep. <I>Endeavouring</I> is a 
 gospel word. We must do our utmost. If others will quarrel with us, we 
 must take all possible care not to quarrel with them. If others will 
 despise and hate us, we must not despise and hate them. <I>In the bond 
 of peace.</I> Peace is a bond, as it unites persons, and makes them 
 live friendly one with another. A peaceable disposition and conduct 
 bind Christians together, whereas discord and quarrelling disband and 
 disunite their hearts and affections. Many slender twigs, bound 
 together, become strong. The bond of peace is the strength of society. 
 Not that it can be imagined that all good people, and all the members 
 of societies, should be in every thing just of the same length, and the 
 same sentiments, and the same judgment: buy the bond of peace unites 
 them all together, with a <I>non obstante</I> to these. As in a bundle 
 of rods, they may be of different lengths and different strength; but, 
 when they are tied together by one bond, they are stronger than any, 
 even than the thickest and strongest was of itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The motives proper to promote this Christian unity and concord. 
 The apostle urges several, to persuade us thereto.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Consider how many unities there are that are the joy and glory of 
 our Christian profession. There should be one heart; for <I>there is 
 one body, and one spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Two hearts in one body would be monstrous. If there be but one body, 
 all that belong to that body should have one heart. The Catholic church 
 is one mystical body of Christ, and all good Christians make up but one 
 body, incorporated by one charter, that of the gospel, animated by one 
 Spirit, the same Holy Spirit who by his gifts and graces quickens, 
 enlivens, and governs that body. If we belong to Christ, we are all 
 actuated by one and the same Spirit, and therefore should be one. 
 <I>Even as you are called in one hope of your calling.</I> Hope is here 
 put for its object, the thing hoped for, the heavenly inheritance, to 
 the hope of which we are called. All Christians are called to the same 
 hope of eternal life. There is one Christ that they all hope in, and
 one heaven that they are all hoping for; and therefore they should be 
 of one heart. <I>One Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, Christ, the head of the church, to whom, by God's appointment, 
 all Christians are immediately subject. <I>One faith,</I> that is, the 
 gospel, containing the doctrine of the Christian faith: or, it is the 
 same grace of faith (faith in Christ) whereby all Christians are saved. 
 <I>One baptism,</I> by which we profess our faith, being baptized in 
 the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and so the same 
 sacramental covenant, whereby we engage ourselves to the Lord Christ. 
 <I>One God and Father of all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 One God, who owns all the true members of the church for his children; 
 for he is the Father of all such by special relation, as he is the 
 Father of all men by creation: and he <I>is above all,</I> by his 
 essence, and with respect to the glorious perfections of his nature, 
 and as he has dominion over all creatures and especially over his 
 church, <I>and through all,</I> by his providence upholding and 
 governing them: <I>and in you all,</I> in all believers, in whom he 
 dwells as in his holy temple, by his Spirit and special grace. If then 
 there be so many <I>ones,</I> it is a pity but there should be one 
 more--one heart, or one soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Consider the variety of gifts that Christ has bestowed among 
 Christians: <I>But unto every one of us is given grace according to the 
 measure of the gift of Christ.</I> Though the members of Christ's 
 church agree in so many things, yet there are some things wherein they 
 differ: but this should breed no difference of affection among them, 
 since they are all derived from the same bountiful author and designed 
 for the same great ends. Unto every one of us Christians is given 
 grace, some gift of grace, in some kind or degree or other, for the 
 mutual help of one another. Unto every one of us ministers is given 
 grace; to some a greater measure of gifts, to others a less measure. 
 The different gifts of Christ's ministers proved a great occasion of 
 contention among the first Christians: one was for Paul, and another 
 for Apollos. The apostle shows that they had no reason to quarrel about 
 them, but all the reason in the world to agree in the joint use of 
 them, for common edification; because all was given <I>according to the 
 measure of the gift of Christ,</I> in such a measure as seemed best to 
 Christ to bestow upon every one. Observe, All the ministers, and all 
 the members of Christ, owe all the gifts and graces that they are 
 possessed of to him; and this is a good reason why we should love one 
 another, <I>because to every one of us is given grace.</I> All to whom 
 Christ has given grace, and on whom he has bestowed his gifts (though 
 they are of different sizes, different names, and different sentiments, 
 yet), <I>ought to love one another.</I> The apostle takes this occasion 
 to specify some of the gifts which Christ bestowed. And that they were 
 bestowed by Christ he makes appear by those words of David wherein he 
 foretold this concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),

 <I>Wherefore he saith</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that is, the Psalmist saith, <I>When he ascended up on high, he led 
 captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</I> David prophesied of the 
 ascension of Christ; and the apostle descants upon it here, and in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9-11">three following verses</A>.

 <I>When he ascended up on high.</I> We may understand the apostle both
 of the place into which he ascended in his human nature, that is, the 
 highest heavens, and particularly of the state to which he was 
 advanced, he being then highly exalted, and eminently glorified, by his 
 Father. Let us set ourselves to think of the ascension of Jesus Christ: 
 that our blessed Redeemer, having risen from the dead, in gone to 
 heaven, where he sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high, which 
 completed the proof of his being the Son of God. As great conquerors, 
 when they rode in their triumphal chariots, used to be attended with 
 the most illustrious of their captives led in chains, and were wont to 
 scatter their largesses and bounty among the soldiers and other 
 spectators of their triumphs, so Christ, when he ascended into heaven, 
 as a triumphant conqueror, <I>led captivity captive.</I> It is a phrase 
 used in the Old Testament to signify a conquest over enemies, 
 especially over such as formerly had led others captive; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:12">Judges v. 12</A>.

 Captivity is here put for captives, and signifies all our spiritual
 enemies, who brought us into captivity before. He conquered those who 
 had conquered us; such as sin, the devil, and death. Indeed, he 
 triumphed over these <I>on the cross;</I> but the triumph was completed 
 at his ascension, when he became Lord over all, and had the keys of 
 death and hades put into his hands. <I>And he gave gifts unto men:</I>
 in the psalm it is, <I>He received gifts for men.</I> He received for 
 them, that he might give to them, a large measure of gifts and graces; 
 particularly, he enriched his disciples with the gift of the Holy 
 Ghost. The apostle, thus speaking of the ascension of Christ, takes 
 notice that he <I>descended first,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 As much as if he had said, "When David speaks of Christ's ascension, he 
 intimates the knowledge he had of Christ's humiliation on earth; for, 
 when it is said that he ascended, this implies that he first descended: 
 for what is it but a proof or demonstration of his having done so?" 
 <I>Into the lower parts of the earth;</I> this may refer either to his 
 incarnation, according to that of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15">Ps. cxxxix. 15</A>,

 <I>My substance was not hidden from thee, when I was made in secret, 
 and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth;</I> or, to his 
 burial, according to that of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:9">Ps. lxiii. 9</A>,

 <I>Those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts 
 of the earth.</I> He calls his death (say some of the fathers) <I>his 
 descent into the lower parts of the earth.</I> He descended to the 
 earth in his incarnation. He descended into the earth in his burial. 
 <I>As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so 
 was the Son of man in the heart of the earth. He that descended is the 
 same also that ascended up far above all heavens</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 far above the airy and starry (which are the visible) heavens, into the
 heaven of heavens; <I>that he might fill all things,</I> all the 
 members of his church, with gifts and graces suitable to their several 
 conditions and stations. Observe, Our Lord humbled himself first, and 
 then he was exalted. He descended first, and then ascended. The
 apostle next tells us what were Christ's gifts at his ascension: <I>He 
 gave some apostles,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Indeed he sent forth some of these before his ascension,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1-5">Matt. x. 1-5</A>.
 
 But one was then added, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:26">Acts i. 26</A>.

 And all of them were more solemnly installed, and publicly confirmed,
 in their office, by his visibly pouring forth the Holy Ghost in an 
 extraordinary manner and measure upon them. Note, The great gift that 
 Christ gave to the church at his ascension was that of the ministry of 
 peace and reconciliation. The gift of the ministry is the fruit of 
 Christ's ascension. And ministers have their various gifts, which are 
 all given them by the Lord Jesus. The officers which Christ gave to his 
 church were of two sorts--<I>extraordinary</I> ones advanced to a 
 higher office in the church: such were <I>apostles, prophets,</I> and 
 <I>evangelists.</I> The apostles were chief. These Christ immediately 
 called, furnished them with extraordinary gifts and the power of 
 working miracles, and with infallibility in delivering his truth; and, 
 they having been the witnesses of his miracles and doctrine, he sent 
 them forth to spread the gospel and to plant and govern churches. The 
 prophets seem to have been such as expounded the writings of the Old 
 Testament, and foretold things to come. The evangelists were ordained 
 persons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:6">2 Tim. i. 6</A>),

 whom the apostles took for their companions in travel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1">Gal. ii. 1</A>),

 and sent them out to settle and establish such churches as the apostles 
 themselves had planted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22">Acts xix. 22</A>),

 and, not being fixed to any particular place, they were to continue
 till recalled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:9">2 Tim. iv. 9</A>.

 And then there are <I>ordinary</I> ministers, employed in a lower and 
 narrower sphere; as <I>pastors</I> and <I>teachers.</I> Some take these 
 two names to signify one office, implying the duties of ruling and 
 teaching belonging to it. Others think they design two distinct 
 offices, both ordinary, and of standing use in the church; and then 
 pastors are such as are fixed at the head of particular churches, with 
 design to guide, instruct, and feed them in the manner appointed by 
 Christ; and they are frequently called bishops and elders: and the 
 teachers were those whose work it was also to preach the gospel and to 
 instruct the people by way of exhortation. We see here that it is
 Christ's prerogative to appoint what officers and offices he pleases in 
 his church. And how rich is the church, that had at first such a 
 variety of officers and has still such a variety of gifts! How kind is 
 Christ to his church! How careful of it and of its edification! When he 
 ascended, he procured the gift of the Holy Ghost; and the gifts of the 
 Holy Ghost are various: some have greater, others have less measures; 
 but all for the good of the body, which brings us to the third 
 argument,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Which is taken from Christ's great end and design in giving gifts 
 unto men. The gifts of Christ were intended for the good of his church, 
 and in order to advance his kingdom and interest among men. All these 
 being designed for one common end is a good reason why all Christians 
 should agree in brotherly love, and not envy one another's gifts. All 
 are <I>for the perfecting of the saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 that is, according to the import of the original, to bring into an 
 orderly spiritual state and frame those who had been as it were 
 dislocated and disjointed by sin, and then to strengthen, confirm, and 
 advance them therein, that so each, in his proper place and function, 
 might contribute to the good of the whole.--<I>For the work of the 
 ministry, or for the work of dispensation;</I> that is, that they might 
 dispense the doctrines of the gospel, and successfully discharge the 
 several parts of their ministerial function.--<I>For the edifying of 
 the body of Christ;</I> that is, to build up the church, which is 
 Christ's mystical body, by an increase of their graces, and an addition 
 of new members. All are designed to prepare us for heaven: <I>Till we 
 all come,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The gifts and offices (some of them) which have been spoken of are to 
 continue in the church till the saints be perfected, which will not be 
 <I>till they all come in the unity of the faith</I> (till all true 
 believers meet together, by means of the same precious faith) <I>and of 
 the knowledge of the Son of God,</I> by which we are to understand, not 
 a bare speculative knowledge, or the acknowledging of Christ to be the 
 Son of God and the great Mediator, but such as is attended with 
 appropriation and affection, with all due honour, trust, and 
 obedience.--<I>Unto a perfect man,</I> to our full growth of gifts and 
 graces, free from those childish infirmities that we are subject to in 
 the present world.--<I>Unto the measure of the stature of the fulness 
 of Christ,</I> so as to be Christians of a full maturity and ripeness 
 in all the graces derived from Christ's fulness: or, according to the 
 measure of that stature which is to make up the fulness of Christ, 
 which is to complete his mystical body. Now we shall never come to the 
 perfect man, till we come to the perfect world. There is a fulness in 
 Christ, and a fulness to be derived from him; and a certain stature of 
 that fulness, and a measure of that stature, are assigned in the 
 counsel of God to every believer, and we never come to that measure 
 till we come to heaven. God's children, as long as they are in this 
 world, are growing. Dr Lightfoot understands the apostle as speaking 
 here of Jews and Gentiles knit in the unity of the faith and of the 
 knowledge of the Son of God, so making a perfect man, and the measure 
 of the stature of the fulness of Christ. The apostle further shows, in 
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14-16">following verses</A>,

 what was God's design in his sacred institutions, and what effect they
 ought to have upon us. As, 

 (1.) <I>That we henceforth be no more children,</I> &c. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 that is, that we may be no longer children in knowledge, weak in the 
 faith, and inconstant in our judgments, easily yielding to every 
 temptation, readily complying with every one's humour, and being at 
 every one's back. Children are easily imposed upon. We must take care
 of this, and of being <I>tossed to and fro,</I> like ships without 
 ballast, <I>and carried about,</I> like clouds in the air, with such 
 doctrines as have no truth nor solidity in them, but nevertheless 
 spread themselves far and wide, and are therefore compared to wind. 
 <I>By the sleight of men;</I> this is a metaphor taken from gamesters, 
 and signifies the mischievous subtlety of seducers: <I>and cunning 
 craftiness,</I> by which is meant their skilfulness in finding ways to
 seduce and deceive; for it follows, <I>whereby they lie in wait to 
 deceive,</I> as in an ambush, in order to circumvent the weak, and draw 
 them from the truth. Note, Those must be very wicked and ungodly men
 who set themselves to seduce and deceive others into false doctrines 
 and errors. The apostle describes them here as base men, using a great 
 deal of devilish art and cunning, in order thereunto. The best method 
 we can take to fortify ourselves against such is to study the sacred 
 oracles, and to pray for the illumination and grace of the Spirit of 
 Christ, that we may know the truth as it is in Jesus, and be 
 established in it. 
 
 (2.) That we should <I>speak the truth in love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 or follow the truth in love, or be sincere in love to our 
 fellow-christians. While we adhere to the doctrine of Christ, which is 
 the truth, we should live in love one with another. Love is an 
 excellent thing; but we must be careful to preserve truth together with 
 it. Truth is an excellent thing; yet it is requisite that we speak it 
 in love, and not in contention. These two should go together--truth
 and peace. 

 (3.) That we should <I>grow up into Christ in all things.</I> Into 
 Christ, so as to be more deeply rooted in him. In all things; in 
 knowledge, love, faith, and all the parts of the new man. We should 
 grow up towards maturity, which is opposed to being children. Those
 are improving Christians who grow up into Christ. The more we grow
 into an acquaintance with Christ, faith in him, love to him, dependence 
 upon him, the more we shall flourish in every grace. He is the head;
 and we should thus grow, that we may thereby honour our head. The
 Christian's growth tends to the glory of Christ. 

 (4.) We should be assisting and helpful one to another, as members of 
 the same body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Here the apostle makes a comparison between the natural body and 
 Christ's mystical body, that body of which Christ is the head: and he 
 observes that as there must be communion and mutual communications of 
 the members of the body among themselves, in order to their growth and 
 improvement, so there must be mutual love and unity, together with the 
 proper fruits of these, among Christians, in order to their spiritual 
 improvement and growth in grace. <I>From whom,</I> says he (that is, 
 from Christ their head, who conveys influence and nourishment to every 
 particular member), <I>the whole body of Christians, fitly joined 
 together and compacted</I> (being orderly and firmly united among 
 themselves, every one in his proper place and station), <I>by that 
 which every joint supplies</I> (by the assistance which every one of 
 the parts, thus united, gives to the whole, or by the Spirit, faith, 
 love, sacraments, &c., which, like the veins and arteries in the body, 
 serve to unite Christians to Christ their head, and to one another as 
 fellow-members), <I>according to the effectual working in the measure 
 of every part</I> (that is, say some, according to the power which the 
 Holy Ghost exerts to make God's appointed means effectual for this 
 great end, in such a measure as Christ judges to be sufficient and 
 proper for every member, according to its respective place and office 
 in the body; or, as others, according to the power of Christ, who, as 
 head, influences and enlivens every member; or, according to the 
 effectual working of every member, in communicating to others of what 
 it has received, nourishment is conveyed to all in their proportions, 
 and according to the state and exigence of every part) <I>makes 
 increase of the body,</I> such an increase as is convenient for the 
 body. Observe, Particular Christians receive their gifts and graces 
 from Christ for the sake and benefit of the whole body. <I>Unto the 
 edifying of itself in love.</I> We may understand this two 
 ways:--Either that all the members of the church may attain a greater 
 measure of love to Christ and to one another; or that they are moved to 
 act in the manner mentioned from love to Christ and to one another.
 Observe, Mutual love among Christians is a great friend to spiritual 
 growth: it is in love that the body edifies itself; whereas <I>a 
 kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
 henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
 their mind,
 &nbsp; 18  Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
 life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
 blindness of their heart:
 &nbsp; 19  Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
 lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
 &nbsp; 20  But ye have not so learned Christ;
 &nbsp; 21  If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by
 him, as the truth is in Jesus:
 &nbsp; 22  That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old
 man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
 &nbsp; 23  And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
 &nbsp; 24  And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created
 in righteousness and true holiness.
 &nbsp; 25  Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
 neighbour: for we are members one of another.
 &nbsp; 26  Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
 wrath:
 &nbsp; 27  Neither give place to the devil.
 &nbsp; 28  Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
 working with <I>his</I> hands the thing which is good, that he may
 have to give to him that needeth.
 &nbsp; 29  Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but
 that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
 grace unto the hearers.
 &nbsp; 30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
 unto the day of redemption.
 &nbsp; 31  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and
 evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
 &nbsp; 32  And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
 another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having gone through his exhortation to mutual love, unity, 
 and concord, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:16">foregoing verses</A>, 

 there follows in these an exhortation to Christian purity and holiness
 of heart and life, and that both more general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:17-24"><I>v.</I> 17-24</A>)

 and in several particular instances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25-32"><I>v.</I> 25-32</A>.

 This is solemnly introduced: "<I>This I say therefore, and testify in 
 the Lord;</I> that is, seeing the matter is as above described, seeing 
 you are members of Christ's body and partakers of such gifts, this I 
 urge upon your consciences, and bear witness to as your duty in the 
 Lord's name, and by virtue of the authority I have derived from him." 
 Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The more general exhortation to purity and holiness of heart and 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It begins thus, "<I>That you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles 
 walk</I>--that for the time to come you do not live, and behave
 yourselves, as ignorant and unconverted heathens do, who are wholly 
 guided by an understanding employed about vain things, their idols and 
 their worldly possessions, things which are no way profitable to their 
 souls, and which will deceive their expectations." Converted Gentiles 
 must not live as unconverted Gentiles do. Though they live among them, 
 they must not live like them. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The apostle takes occasion to describe the wickedness of the 
 Gentile world, out of which regenerate Christians were snatched as 
 brands out of the burning. 

 [1.] Their <I>understandings were darkened,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They were void of all saving knowledge; yea, ignorant of many things 
 concerning God which the light of nature might have taught them. They 
 sat in darkness, and they loved it rather than light: and by their 
 ignorance they were <I>alienated from the life of God.</I> They were 
 estranged from, and had a dislike and aversion to, a life of holiness, 
 which is not only that way of life which God requires and approves, and 
 by which we live to him, but which resembles God himself, in his 
 purity, righteousness, truth, and goodness. Their wilful ignorance was 
 the cause of their estrangement from this life of God, which begins in 
 light and knowledge. Gross and affected ignorance is destructive to 
 religion and godliness. And what was the cause of their being thus 
 ignorant? It was <I>because of the blindness</I> or the hardness <I>of 
 their heart.</I> It was not because God did not make himself known to 
 them by his works, but because they would not admit the instructive 
 rays of the divine light. They were ignorant because they would be so. 
 Their ignorance proceeded from their obstinacy and the hardness of 
 their hearts, their resisting the light and rejecting all the means of 
 illumination and knowledge. 

 [2.] Their consciences were debauched and seared: <I>Who being past 
 feeling,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They had no sense of their sin, nor of the misery and danger of their 
 case by means of it; whereupon they <I>gave themselves over unto 
 lasciviousness.</I> They indulged themselves in their filthy lusts; 
 and, yielding themselves up to the dominion of these, they became the 
 slaves and drudges of sin and the devil, <I>working all uncleanness 
 with greediness.</I> They made it their common practice to commit all 
 sorts of uncleanness, and even the most unnatural and monstrous sins, 
 and that with insatiable desires. Observe, When men's consciences are
 once seared, there are no bounds to their sins. When they set their 
 hearts upon the gratification of their lusts, what can be expected but 
 the most abominable sensuality and lewdness, and that their horrid 
 enormities will abound? This was the character of the Gentiles;
 but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) These Christians must distinguish themselves from such Gentiles: 
 <I>You have not so learned Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It may be read, <I>But you not so; you have learned Christ.</I> Those 
 who have learned Christ are saved from the darkness and defilement 
 which others lie under; and, as they know more, they are obliged to 
 live in a better manner than others. It is a good argument against sin 
 that we have not so learned Christ. Learn Christ! Is Christ a book, a 
 lesson, a way, a trade? The meaning is, "You have not so learned 
 Christianity--the doctrines of Christ and the rules of life prescribed 
 by him. Not so as to do as others do. <I>If so be,</I> or since, 
 <I>that you have heard him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 have heard his doctrine preached by us, <I>and have been taught by 
 him,</I> inwardly and effectually, by his Spirit." Christ is the 
 lesson; we must learn Christ: and Christ is the teacher; we are taught 
 by him. <I>As the truth is in Jesus.</I> This may be understood two 
 ways: either, "You have been taught the real truth, as held forth by 
 Christ himself, both in his doctrine and in his life." Or thus, "The 
 truth has made such an impression on your hearts, in your measure, as 
 it did upon the heart of Jesus." The truth of Christ then appears in 
 its beauty and power, when it appears as in Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Another branch of the general exhortation follows in those words, 
 <I>That you put off, concerning the former conversation, the old 
 man,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>.

 "This is a great part of the doctrine which has been taught you, and
 which you have learned." Here the apostle expresses himself in 
 metaphors taken from garments. The principles, habits, and dispositions 
 of the soul must be changed, before there can be a saving change of the 
 life. There must be sanctification, which consists of these two 
 things:--

 (1.) The old man must be put off. The corrupt nature is called a man, 
 because, like the human body, it consists of divers parts, mutually 
 supporting and strengthening one another. It is the old man, as old 
 Adam, from whom we derive it. It is bred in the bone, and we brought it 
 into the world with us. It is subtle as the old man; but in all God's 
 saints decaying and withering as an old man, and ready to pass away. It 
 is said to be corrupt; for sin in the soul is the corruption of its 
 faculties: and, where it is not mortified, it grows daily worse and 
 worse, and so tends to destruction. <I>According to the deceitful 
 lusts.</I> Sinful inclinations and desires are deceitful lusts: they 
 promise men happiness, but render them more miserable, and if not 
 subdued and mortified betray them into destruction. These therefore 
 must be put off as an old garment that we should be ashamed to be seen 
 in: they must be subdued and mortified. These lusts prevailed against 
 them in their <I>former conversation,</I> that is, during their state 
 of unregeneracy and heathenism. 

 (2.) The new man must be put on. It is not enough to shake off corrupt 
 principles, but we must be actuated by gracious ones. We must embrace 
 them, espouse them, and get them written on our hearts: it is not 
 enough to cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. "<I>Be 
 renewed in the spirit of your mind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 that is, use the proper and prescribed means in order to have the mind, 
 which is a spirit, renewed more and more." <I>And that you put on the 
 new man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 By the new man is meant the new nature, the new creature, which is 
 actuated by a new principle, even regenerating grace, enabling a man to 
 lead a new life, that life of righteousness and holiness which 
 Christianity requires. This new man <I>is created,</I> or produced out 
 of confusion and emptiness, by God's almighty power, whose workmanship 
 it is, truly excellent and beautiful. <I>After God,</I> in imitation
 of him, and in conformity to that grand exemplar and pattern. The loss 
 of God's image upon the soul was both the sinfulness and misery of 
 man's fallen state; and that resemblance which it bears to God is the 
 beauty, the glory, and the happiness, of the new creature. <I>In 
 righteousness</I> towards men, including all the duties of the second 
 table; <I>and in holiness</I> towards God, signifying a sincere 
 obedience to the commands of the first table; <I>true holiness</I> in 
 opposition to the outward and ceremonial holiness of the Jews. We are 
 said to put on this new man when, in the use of all God's appointed 
 means, we are endeavouring after this divine nature, this new creature.
 This is the more general exhortation to purity and holiness of heart 
 and life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle proceeds to some things more particular. Because 
 generals are not so apt to affect, we are told what are those 
 particular limbs of the old man that must be mortified, those filthy 
 rags of the old nature that must be put off, and what are the peculiar 
 ornaments of the new man wherewith we should adorn our Christian 
 profession. 

 1. Take heed of lying, and be ever careful to speak the truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Wherefore,</I> since you have been so well instructed in your duty, 
 and are under such obligations to discharge it, let it appear, in your 
 future behaviour and conduct, that there is a great and real change 
 wrought in you, particularly by <I>putting away lying.</I>" Of this sin 
 the heathen were very guilty, affirming that a profitable lie was 
 better than a hurtful truth; and therefore the apostle exhorts them to 
 cease from lying, from every thing that is contrary to truth. This is a 
 part of the old man that must be put off; and that branch of the new 
 man that must be put on in opposition to it is <I>speaking the 
 truth</I> in all our converse with others. It is the character of God's 
 people that they are <I>children who will not lie,</I> who dare not 
 lie, who hate and abhor lying. All who have grace make conscience of 
 speaking the truth, and would not tell a deliberate lie for the 
 greatest gain and benefit to themselves. The reason here given for 
 veracity is, <I>We are members one of another.</I> Truth is a debt we 
 owe to one another; and, if we love one another, we shall not deceive 
 nor lie one to another. We belong to the same society or body, which 
 falsehood or lying tends to dissolve; and therefore we should avoid it, 
 and speak truth. Observe, Lying is a very great sin, a peculiar 
 violation of the obligations which Christians are under, and very 
 injurious and hurtful to Christian society. 

 2. "Take heed of anger and ungoverned passions. <I>Be you angry, and
 sin not,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This is borrowed from the LXX. translation of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:4">Ps. iv. 4</A>,

 where we render it, <I>Stand in awe, and sin not.</I> Here is an easy 
 concession; for as such we should consider it, rather than as a 
 command. <I>Be you angry.</I> This we are apt enough to be, God knows: 
 but we find it difficult enough to observe the restriction, <I>and sin 
 not.</I> "If you have a just occasion to be angry at any time, see that 
 it be without sin; and therefore take heed of excess in your anger." If 
 we would be angry and not sin (says one), we must be angry at nothing 
 but sin; and we should be more jealous for the glory of God than for 
 any interest or reputation of our own. One great and common sin in 
 anger is to suffer it to burn into wrath, and then to let it rest; and 
 therefore we are here cautioned against that. "If you have been 
 provoked and have had your spirits greatly discomposed, and if you have 
 bitterly resented any affront that has been offered, before night calm 
 and quiet your spirits, be reconciled to the offender, and let all be 
 well again: <I>Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.</I> If it burn 
 into wrath and bitterness of spirit, O see to it that you suppress it 
 speedily." Observe, Though anger in itself is not sinful, yet there is 
 the upmost danger of its becoming so if it be not carefully watched and 
 speedily suppressed. And therefore, though anger may come into the 
 bosom of a wise man, <I>it rests</I> only <I>in the bosom of fools. 
 Neither give place to the devil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Those who persevere in sinful anger and in wrath let the devil into 
 their hearts, and suffer him to gain upon them, till he bring them to 
 malice, mischievous machinations, &c. "<I>Neither give place to
 the</I> calumniator, or the false accuser" (so some read the words); 
 that is, "let your ears be deaf to whisperers, talebearers, and 
 slanderers." 

 3. We are here warned against the sin of stealing, the breach of the
 eighth commandment, and advised to honest industry and to beneficence: 
 <I>Let his that stole steal no more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is a caution against all manner of wrong-doing, by force or fraud. 
 "Let those of you who, in the time of your gentilism, have been guilty 
 of this enormity, be no longer guilty of it." But we must not only take 
 heed of the sin, but conscientiously abound in the opposite duty: not 
 only not steal, <I>but rather let him labour, working with his hands 
 the thing that is good.</I> Idleness makes thieves. So Chrysostom, 
 <B><I>To gar kleptein argias estin</I></B>.--<I>Stealing is the effect 
 of idleness.</I> Those who will not work, and who are ashamed to beg, 
 expose themselves greatly to temptations to thievery. Men should 
 therefore be diligent and industrious, not in any unlawful way, but in 
 some honest calling: <I>Working the thing which is good.</I> Industry, 
 in some honest way, will keep people out of temptation of doing wrong.
 But there is another reason why men ought to be industrious, namely, 
 that they may be capable of doing some good, as well as that they may 
 be preserved from temptation: <I>That he may have to give to him that 
 needeth.</I> They must labour not only that they may live themselves, 
 and live honestly, but they may distribute for supplying the wants of 
 others. Observe, Even those who get their living by their labour should 
 be charitable out of their little to those who are disabled for labour.
 So necessary and incumbent a duty is it to be charitable to the poor 
 that even labourers and servants, and those who have but little for 
 themselves, must cast their mite into the treasury. God must have his 
 dues and the poor are his receivers. Observe further, Those alms that 
 are likely to be acceptable to God must not be the produce of 
 unrighteousness and robbery, but of honesty and industry. <I>God hates 
 robbery for burnt-offerings.</I> 

 4. We are here warned against corrupt communication; and directed to
 that which is useful and edifying,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Filthy and unclean words and discourse are poisonous and infectious, as 
 putrid rotten meat: they proceed from and prove a great deal of 
 corruption in the heart of the speaker, and tend to corrupt the minds 
 and manners of others who hear them; and therefore Christians should 
 beware of all such discourse. It may be taken in general for all that 
 which provokes the lusts and passions of others. We must not only put 
 off corrupt communications, but <I>put on that which is good to the use 
 of edifying.</I> The great use of speech is to edify those with whom we 
 converse. Christians should endeavour to promote a useful conversation: 
 <I>that it may minister grace unto the hearers;</I> that it may be good 
 for, and acceptable to, the hearers, in the way of information, 
 counsel, pertinent reproof, or the like. Observe, It is the great duty 
 of Christians to take care that they offend not with their lips, and 
 that they improve discourse and converse, as much as may be, for the 
 good of others. 

 5. Here is another caution against wrath and anger, with further advice
 to mutual love and kindly dispositions towards each other,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 By <I>bitterness, wrath,</I> and <I>anger,</I> are meant violent inward 
 resentment and displeasure against others: and, by <I>clamour,</I> big 
 words, loud threatenings, and other intemperate speeches, by which 
 bitterness, wrath, and anger, vent themselves. Christians should not
 entertain these vile passions in their hearts not be clamorous with 
 their tongues. <I>Evil speaking</I> signifies all railing, reviling, 
 and reproachful speeches, against such as we are angry with. And by 
 <I>malice</I> we are to understand that rooted anger which prompts men 
 to design and to do mischief to others. The contrary to all this 
 follows: <I>Be you kind one to another.</I> This implies the principle 
 of love in the heart, and the outward expressions of it, in an affable, 
 humble, courteous behaviour. It becomes the disciples of Jesus to be 
 kind one to another, as those who have learned, and would teach, the 
 art of obliging. <I>Tender-hearted;</I> that is, merciful, and having 
 tender sense of the distresses and sufferings of others, so as to be 
 quickly moved to compassion and pity. <I>Forgiving one another.</I> 
 Occasions of difference will happen among Christ's disciples; and 
 therefore they must be placable, and ready to forgive, therein 
 resembling God himself, who <I>for Christ's sake hath forgiven 
 them,</I> and that more than they can forgive one another. Note, With 
 God there is forgiveness; and he forgives sin for the sake of Jesus 
 Christ, and on account of that atonement which he has made to divine 
 justice. Note again, Those who are forgiven of God should be of a 
 forgiving spirit, and should forgive even as God forgives, sincerely 
 and heartily, readily and cheerfully, universally and for ever, upon 
 the sinner's sincere repentance, as remembering that they pray, 
 <I>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against 
 us.</I> Now we may observe concerning all these particulars that the 
 apostle has insisted on that they belong to the second table, whence 
 Christians should learn the strict obligations they are under to the 
 duties of the second table, and that he who does not conscientiously 
 discharge them can never fear nor love God in truth and in sincerity, 
 whatever he may pretend to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the midst of these exhortations and cautions the apostle interposes 
 that general one, <I>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 By looking to what precedes, and to what follows, we may see what it is 
 that grieves the Spirit of God. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:25-29">previous verses</A> 

 it is intimated that all lewdness and filthiness, lying, and corrupt
 communications that stir up filthy appetites and lusts, grieve the 
 Spirit of God. In what follows it is intimated that those corrupt 
 passions of bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil 
 speaking, and malice, grieve this good Spirit. By this we are not to 
 understand that this blessed Being could properly be grieved or vexed 
 as we are; but the design of the exhortation is that we act not towards 
 him in such a manner as is wont to be grievous and disquieting to our 
 fellow-creatures: we must not do that which is contrary to his holy 
 nature and his will; we must not refuse to hearken to his counsels, nor 
 rebel against his government, which things would provoke him to act 
 towards us as men are wont to do towards those with whom they are 
 displeased and grieved, withdrawing themselves and their wonted 
 kindness from such, and abandoning them to their enemies. O provoke not 
 the blessed Spirit of God to withdraw his presence and his gracious 
 influences from you! It is a good reason why we should not grieve him 
 that <I>by him we are sealed unto the day of redemption.</I> There is 
 to be a day of redemption; the body is to be redeemed from the power of 
 the grave at the resurrection-day, and then God's people will be 
 delivered from all the effects of sin, as well as from all sin and 
 misery, which they are not till rescued out of the grave: and then 
 their full and complete happiness commences. All true believers are 
 sealed to that day. God has distinguished them from others, having set 
 his mark upon them; and he gives them the earnest and assurance of a 
 joyful and glorious resurrection; and the Spirit of God is the seal.
 Wherever that blessed Spirit is as a sanctifier, he is the earnest of 
 all the joys and glories of the redemption-day; and we should be undone 
 should God take away his Holy Spirit from us.</P>
