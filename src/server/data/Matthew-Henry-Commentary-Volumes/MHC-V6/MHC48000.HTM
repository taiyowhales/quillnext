 epistle of Paul is directed not to the church or churches of a single 
 city, as some others are, but of a country or province, for so Galatia 
 was. It is very probable that these Galatians were first converted to 
 the Christian faith by his ministry; or, if he was not the instrument 
 of planting, yet at least he had been employed in watering these 
 churches, as is evident from this epistle itself, and also from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:23">Acts xviii. 23</A>,

 where we find him going over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in 
 order, strengthening all the disciples. While he was with them, they 
 had expressed the greatest esteem and affection both for his person and 
 ministry; but he had not been long absent from them before some 
 judaizing teachers got in among them, by whose arts and insinuations 
 they were soon drawn into a meaner opinion both of the one and of the 
 other. That which these false teachers chiefly aimed at was to draw 
 them off from the truth as it is in Jesus, particularly in the great 
 doctrine of justification, which they grossly perverted, by asserting 
 the necessity of joining the observance of the law of Moses with faith 
 in Christ in order to it: and, the better to accomplish this their 
 design, they did all they could to lessen the character and reputation 
 of the apostle, and to raise up their own on the ruins of his, 
 representing him as one who, if he was to be owned as an apostle, yet 
 was much inferior to others, and particularly who deserved not such a 
 regard as Peter, James, and John, whose followers, it is likely, they 
 pretended to be: and in both these attempts they had but too great 
 success. This was the occasion of his writing this epistle, wherein he 
 expresses his great concern that they had suffered themselves to be so 
 soon turned aside from the faith of the gospel, vindicates his own 
 character and authority as an apostle against the aspersions of his 
 enemies, showing that his mission and doctrine were both divine, and 
 that he was not, upon any account, <I>behind the very chief of the 
 apostles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5">2 Cor. xi. 5</A>.

 He then sets himself to assert and maintain the great gospel doctrine
 of justification by faith without the works of the law, and to obviate
 some difficulties that might be apt to arise in their minds concerning
 it: and, having established this important doctrine, he exhorts them to
 stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ had made them free, cautions
 them against the abuse of this liberty, gives them several very needful
 counsels and directions and then concludes the epistle by giving them a
 just description of those false teachers by whom they had been
 ensnared, and, on the contrary, of his own temper and behaviour. In all
 this his great scope and design were to recover those who had been
 perverted, to settle those who might be wavering, and to confirm such
 among them as had kept their integrity.</P>
