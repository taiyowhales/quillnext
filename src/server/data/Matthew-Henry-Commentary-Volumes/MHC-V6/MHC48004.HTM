 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, in this chapter, is still carrying on the same general 
 design as in the former--to recover these Christians from the
 impressions made upon them by the judaizing teachers, and to represent 
 their weakness and folly in suffering themselves to be drawn away from 
 the gospel doctrine of justification, and to be deprived of their 
 freedom from the bondage of the law of Moses. For this purpose he makes 
 use of various considerations; such as, 

 I. The great excellence of the gospel state above the legal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The happy change that was made in them at their conversion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 III. The affection they had had for him and his ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.
 
 IV. The character of the false teachers by whom they had been perverted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.
 
 V. The very tender affection he had for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.
 
 VI. The history of Isaac and Ishmael, by a comparison taken from which 
 he illustrates the difference between such as rested in Christ and such 
 as trusted in the law. And in all these, as he uses great plainness and 
 faithfulness with them, so he expresses the tenderest concern for 
 them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now I say, <I>That</I> the heir, as long as he is a child,
 differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
 &nbsp; 2  But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of
 the father.
 &nbsp; 3  Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
 elements of the world:
 &nbsp; 4  But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
 Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
 &nbsp; 5  To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
 the adoption of sons.
 &nbsp; 6  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
 his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
 &nbsp; 7  Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a
 son, then a heir of God through Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle deals plainly with those who hearkened to 
 the judaizing teachers, who cried up the law of Moses in competition 
 with the gospel of Christ, and endeavored to bring them under the 
 bondage of it. To convince them of their folly, and to rectify their 
 mistake herein, in these verses he prosecutes the comparison of a child 
 under age, which he had touched upon in the foregoing chapter, and 
 thence shows what great advantages we have now, under the gospel, above 
 what they had under the law. And here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He acquaints us with the state of the Old-Testament church: it was 
 like a child under age, and it was used accordingly, being kept in a 
 state of darkness and bondage, in comparison of the greater light and 
 liberty which we enjoy under the gospel. That was indeed a
 dispensation of grace, and yet it was comparatively a dispensation of 
 darkness; for as the heir, in his minority, is <I>under tutors and 
 governors till the time appointed of his father,</I> by whom he is 
 educated and instructed in those things which at present he knows 
 little of the meaning of, though afterwards they are likely to be of 
 great use to him; so it was with the Old-Testament church--the Mosaic
 economy, which they were under, was what they could not fully 
 understand the meaning of; for, as the apostle says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>),

 <I>They could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is 
 abolished.</I> But to the church, when grown up to maturity, in gospel 
 days, it becomes of great use. And as that was a dispensation of 
 darkness, so of bondage too; for <I>they were in bondage under the 
 elements of the world,</I> being tied to a great number of burdensome 
 rites and observances, by which, as by a kind of first rudiments, they 
 were taught and instructed, and whereby they were kept in a state of 
 subjection, like a child under tutors and governors. The church then 
 lay more under the character of <I>a servant,</I> being obliged to do 
 every thing according to the command of God, without being fully 
 acquainted with the reason of it; but the service under the gospel 
 appears to be more reasonable than that was. The time appointed of the 
 Father having come, when the church was to arrive at its full age, the 
 darkness and bondage under which it before lay are removed, and we are 
 under a dispensation of greater light and liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He acquaints us with the much happier state of Christians under the 
 gospel-dispensation, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4-7"><I>v.</I> 4-7</A>.

 <I>When the fulness of time had come,</I> the time appointed of the 
 Father, when he would put an end to the legal dispensation, and set up 
 another and a better in the room of it, <I>he sent forth his Son,</I> 
 &c. The person who was employed to introduce this new dispensation was 
 no other than the Son of God himself, the only-begotten of the Father, 
 who, as he had been prophesied of and promised from the foundation of 
 the world, so in due time he was manifested for this purpose. He, in 
 pursuance of the great design he had undertaken, submitted to be 
 <I>made of a woman</I>--there is his incarnation; and to be <I>made 
 under the law</I>--there is his subjection. He who was truly God for 
 our sakes became man; and he who was Lord of all consented to come into 
 a state of subjection and to take upon him the form of a servant; and 
 one great end of all this was <I>to redeem those that were under the 
 law</I>--to save us from that intolerable yoke and to appoint gospel 
 ordinances more rational and easy. He had indeed something more and 
 greater in his view, in coming into the world, than merely to deliver 
 us from the bondage of the ceremonial law; for he came in our nature, 
 and consented to suffer and die for us, that hereby he might redeem us 
 from the wrath of God, and from the curse of the moral law, which, as 
 sinners, we all lay under. But that was one end of it, and a mercy
 reserved to be bestowed at the time of his manifestation; then the more 
 servile state of the church was to come to a period, and a better to 
 succeed in the place of it; for he was sent to redeem us, <I>that we 
 might receive the adoption of sons</I>--that we might no longer be 
 accounted and treated as servants, but as sons grown up to maturity, 
 who are allowed greater freedoms, and admitted to larger privileges, 
 than while they were under tutors and governors. This the course of the 
 apostle's argument leads us to take notice of, as one thing intended by 
 this expression, though no doubt it may also be understood as 
 signifying that gracious adoption which the gospel so often speaks of 
 as the privilege of those who believe in Christ. Israel was God's son, 
 his first-born, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.

 But now, under the gospel, particular believers receive the adoption;
 and, as an earnest and evidence of it, they have together therewith the 
 Spirit of adoption, putting them upon the duty of prayer, and enabling 
 them in prayer to eye God as a Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Because you are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into 
 your hearts, crying Abba, Father.</I> And hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 the apostle concludes this argument by adding, <I>Wherefore thou art no 
 more a servant, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir of God through 
 Christ;</I> that is, Now, under the gospel state, we are no longer 
 under the servitude of the law, but, upon our believing in Christ, 
 become the sons of God; we are thereupon accepted of him, and adopted 
 by him; and, being the sons, we are also heirs of God, and are entitled 
 to the heavenly inheritance (as he also reasons 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>),

 and therefore it must needs be the greatest weakness and folly to turn 
 back to the law, and to seek justification by the works of it. From 
 what the apostle says in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1-7">these verses</A>,

 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The wonders of divine love and mercy towards us, particularly of God 
 the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us,--of
 the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much, for us, in 
 pursuance of that design,--and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to
 dwell in the hearts of believers for such gracious purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great and invaluable advantages which Christians enjoy under the 
 gospel; for, 

 (1.) We receive <I>the adoption of sons.</I> Whence note, It is the 
 great privilege which believers have through Christ that they are 
 adopted children of the God of heaven. We who by nature are children of 
 wrath and disobedience have become by grace children of love. 

 (2.) We receive <I>the Spirit of adoption.</I> Note, 

 [1.] All who have the privilege of adoption have the Spirit of 
 adoption--all who are received into the number partake of the nature of 
 the children of God; for he will have all his children to resemble him.

 [2.] The Spirit of adoption is always the Spirit of prayer, and it is 
 our duty in prayer to eye God as a Father. Christ has taught us in 
 prayer to eye God as our Father in heaven.

 [3.] If we are his sons, then his heirs. It is not so among men, with 
 whom the eldest son is heir; but all God's children are heirs. Those 
 who have the nature of sons shall have the inheritance of sons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle puts them in mind of what they were before 
 their conversion to the faith of Christ, and what a blessed change 
 their conversion had made upon them; and thence endeavours to convince 
 them of their great weakness in hearkening to those who would bring 
 them under the bondage of the law of Moses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He reminds them of their past state and behaviour, and what they 
 were before the gospel was preached to them. Then <I>they knew not 
 God;</I> they were grossly ignorant of the true God, and the way 
 wherein he is to be worshipped: and at that time they were under the 
 worst of slaveries, for <I>they did service to those which by nature 
 were no gods,</I> they were employed in a great number of superstitious 
 and idolatrous services to those who, though they were accounted gods, 
 were yet really no gods, but mere creatures, and perhaps of their own 
 making, and therefore were utterly unable to hear and help them. Note, 
 
 1. Those who are ignorant of the true God cannot but be inclined to 
 false gods. Those who forsook the God who made the world, rather than 
 be without gods, worshipped such as they themselves made. 

 2. Religious worship is due to none but to him who is by nature God; 
 for, when the apostle blames the doing service to such as by nature 
 were no gods, he plainly shows that he only who is by nature God is the 
 proper object of our religious worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He calls upon them to consider the happy change that was made in 
 them by the preaching of the gospel among them. Now <I>they had known 
 God</I> (they were brought to the knowledge of the true God and of his 
 Son Jesus Christ, whereby they were recovered out of the ignorance and 
 bondage under which they before lay) <I>or rather were known of 
 God;</I> this happy change in their state, whereby they were turned 
 from idols to the living God, and through Christ had received the 
 adoption of sons, was not owing to themselves, but to him; it was the 
 effect of his free and rich grace towards them, and as such they ought 
 to account it; and therefore hereby they were laid under the greater 
 obligation to adhere to the liberty wherewith he had made them free.
 Note, All our acquaintance with God begins with him; we know him, 
 because we are known of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Hence he infers the unreasonableness and madness of their 
 suffering themselves to be brought again into a state of bondage. He 
 speaks of it with surprise and deep concern of mind that such as they 
 should do so: <I>How turn you again,</I> &c., says he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 "How is it that you, who have been taught to worship God in the gospel 
 way, should not be persuaded to comply with the ceremonial way of 
 worship? that you, who have been acquainted with a dispensation of 
 light, liberty, and love, as that of the gospel is, should now submit 
 to a dispensation of darkness, and bondage, and terror, as that of the 
 law is?" This they had the less reason for, since they had never been 
 under the law of Moses, as the Jews had been; and therefore on this 
 account they were more inexcusable than the Jews themselves, who might 
 be supposed to have some fondness for that which had been of such long 
 standing among them. Besides, what they suffered themselves to be 
 brought into bondage to were but <I>weak and beggarly elements,</I> 
 such things as had no power in them to cleanse the soul, nor to afford 
 any solid satisfaction to the mind, and which were only designed for 
 that state of pupillage under which the church had been, but which had 
 now come to a period; and therefore their weakness and folly were the 
 more aggravated, in submitting to them, and in symbolizing with the 
 Jews in observing their various festivals, here signified by <I>days, 
 and months, and times, and years.</I> Here note, 

 1. It is possible for those who have made great professions of religion 
 to be afterwards drawn into very great defections from the purity and 
 simplicity of it, for this was the case of these Christians. And, 

 2. The more mercy God has shown to any, in bringing them into an
 acquaintance with the gospel, and the liberties and privileges of it, 
 the greater are their sin and folly in suffering themselves to be 
 deprived of them; for this the apostle lays a special stress upon, that 
 after they had known God, or rather were known of him, they desired to 
 be in bondage under the weak and beggarly elements of the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Hereupon he expresses his fears concerning them, <I>lest he had 
 bestowed on them labour in vain.</I> He had been at a great deal of 
 pains about them, in preaching the gospel to them, and endeavouring to 
 confirm them in the faith and liberty of it; but now they were giving 
 up these, and thereby rendering his labour among them fruitless and 
 ineffectual, and with the thoughts of this he could not but be deeply 
 affected. Note, 

 1. A great deal of the labour of faithful ministers is labour in vain; 
 and, when it is so, it cannot but be a great grief to those who desire 
 the salvation of souls. Note, 

 2. The labour of ministers is in vain upon those who begin in the 
 Spirit and end in the flesh, who, though they seem to set out well, yet 
 afterwards turn aside from the way of the gospel. Note, 

 3. Those will have a great deal to answer for upon whom the faithful
 ministers of Jesus Christ bestow labour in vain.</P>

 &nbsp; 13  Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the
 gospel unto you at the first.
 &nbsp; 14  And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
 rejected; but received me as an angel of God, <I>even</I> as Christ
 Jesus.
 &nbsp; 15  Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you
 record, that, if <I>it had been</I> possible, ye would have plucked
 out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
 &nbsp; 16  Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the
 truth?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That these Christians might be the more ashamed of their defection from 
 the truth of the gospel which Paul had preached to them, he here 
 reminds them of the great affection they formerly had for him and his 
 ministry, and puts them upon considering how very unsuitable their 
 present behaviour was to what they then professed. And here we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How affectionately he addresses himself to them. He styles them 
 brethren, though he knew their hearts were in a great measure alienated 
 from him. He desires that all resentments might be laid aside, and that 
 they would bear the same temper of mind towards him which he did to 
 them; he would have them <I>to be as he was, for he was as they 
 were,</I> and moreover tells them that <I>they had not injured him at 
 all.</I> He had no quarrel with them upon his own account. Though, in 
 blaming their conduct, he had expressed himself with some warmth and 
 concern of mind he assured them that it was not owing to any sense of 
 personal injury or affront (as they might be ready to think), but 
 proceeded wholly from a zeal for the truth and purity of the gospel, 
 and their welfare and happiness. Thus he endeavours to mollify their 
 spirits towards him, that so they might be the better disposed to 
 receive the admonitions he was giving them. Hereby he teaches us that 
 in reproving others we should take care to convince them that our 
 reproofs do not proceed from any private pique or resentment, but from 
 a sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their truest 
 welfare; for they are then likely to be most successful when they 
 appear to be most disinterested.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he magnifies their former affection to him, that hereby they 
 might be the more ashamed of their present behaviour towards him. To 
 this purpose, 

 1. He puts them in mind of the difficulty under which he laboured when 
 he came first among them: <I>I knew,</I> says he, <I>how, through 
 infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel unto you at the 
 first.</I> What this <I>infirmity of the flesh</I> was, which in the 
 following words he expresses by <I>his temptation that was in his 
 flesh</I> (though, no doubt, it was well known to those Christians to 
 whom he wrote), we can now have no certain knowledge of: some take it 
 to have been the persecutions which he suffered for the gospel's sake; 
 others, to have been something in his person, or manner of speaking, 
 which might render his ministry less grateful and acceptable, referring
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:10,12:7-10">2 Cor. x. 10,
 and to <I>ch.</I> xii. 7-10</A>.

 But, whatever it was, it seems it made no impression on them to his
 disadvantage. For, 

 2. He takes notice that, notwithstanding this his infirmity (which 
 might possibly lessen him in the esteem of some others), they did not 
 despise nor reject him on the account of it, but, on the contrary, 
 <I>received him as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</I> They 
 showed a great deal of respect to him, he was a welcome messenger to 
 them, even as though an angel of God or Jesus Christ himself had 
 preached to them; yea, so great was their esteem of him, that, if it 
 would have been any advantage to him, <I>they could have plucked out 
 their own eyes, and have given them to him.</I> Note, How uncertain the 
 respects of people are, how apt they are to change their minds, and how 
 easily they are drawn into contempt of those for whom they once had the 
 greatest esteem and affection, so that they are ready to pluck out the 
 eyes of those for whom they would before have plucked out their own! We 
 should therefore labour to be accepted of God, <I>for it is a small 
 thing to be judged of man's judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:2">1 Cor. iv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How earnestly he expostulates with them hereupon: <I>Where is 
 then,</I> says he, <I>the blessedness you spoke of?</I> As if he had 
 said, "Time was when you expressed the greatest joy and satisfaction in 
 the glad tidings of the gospel, and were very forward in pouring out 
 your blessings upon me as the publisher of them; whence is it that you 
 are now so much altered, that you have so little relish of them or 
 respect for me? You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the 
 gospel; have you now any reason to think otherwise?" Note, Those who 
 have left their first love would do well to consider, Where is now the 
 blessedness they once spoke of? What has become of that pleasure they 
 used to take in communion with God, and in the company of his servants? 
 The more to impress upon them a just shame of their present conduct, he 
 again asks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 "<I>Am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</I> How is it 
 that I, who was heretofore your favourite, am now accounted your enemy? 
 Can you pretend any other reason for it than that I have told you the 
 truth, endeavoured to acquaint you with, and to confirm you in, the 
 truth of the gospel? And, if not, how unreasonable must your 
 disaffection be!" Note, 

 1. It is no uncommon thing for men to account those their enemies who 
 are really their best friends; for so, undoubtedly, those are, whether 
 ministers or others, who tell them the truth, and deal freely and 
 faithfully with them in matters relating to their eternal salvation, as 
 the apostle now did with these Christians.

 2. Ministers may sometimes create enemies to themselves by the faithful
 discharge of their duty; for this was the case of Paul, he was 
 accounted their enemy for telling them the truth. 

 3. Yet ministers must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of
 offending others and drawing their displeasure upon them. 

 4. They may be easy in their own minds, when they are conscious to
 themselves that, if others have become their enemies, it is only for 
 telling them the truth.</P>

 The apostle is still carrying on the same design as in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:12-16">foregoing verses</A>,

 which was, to convince the Galatians of their sin and folly in
 departing from the truth of the gospel: having just before been 
 expostulating with them about the change of their behaviour towards him 
 who endeavoured to establish them in it, he here gives them the 
 character of those false teachers who made it their business to draw 
 them away from it, which if they would attend to, they might soon see 
 how little reason they had to hearken to them: whatever opinion they 
 might have of them, he tells them they were designing men, who were 
 aiming to set up themselves, and who, under their specious pretences, 
 were more consulting their own interest than theirs: "<I>They zealously 
 affect you,</I>" says he; "they show a mighty respect for you, and 
 pretend a great deal of affection to you, <I>but not well;</I> they do 
 it not with any good design, they are not sincere and upright in it, 
 for <I>they would exclude you, that you might affect them.</I> That 
 which they are chiefly aiming at is to engage your affections to them; 
 and, in order to this, they are doing all they can to draw off your 
 affections from me and from the truth, that so they may engross you to 
 themselves." This, he assures them, was their design, and therefore 
 they must needs be very unwise in hearkening to them. Note, 

 1. There may appear to be a great deal of zeal where yet there is but
 little truth and sincerity. 

 2. It is the usual way of seducers to insinuate themselves into 
 people's affections, and by that means to draw them into their 
 opinions. 

 3. Whatever pretences such may make, they have usually more regard to
 their own interest than that of others, and will not stick at ruining 
 the reputation of others, if by that means they can raise their own. On 
 this occasion the apostle gives us that excellent rule which we have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 <I>It is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing.</I> What 
 our translation renders <I>in a good man,</I> and so consider the 
 apostle as pointing to himself; this sense, they think, is favoured 
 both by the preceding context and also by the words immediately 
 following, <I>and not only when I am present with you,</I> which may be 
 as if he had said, "Time was when you were zealously affected towards 
 me; you once took me for a good man, and have now no reason to think 
 otherwise of me; surely then it would become you to show the same 
 regard to me, now that I am absent from you, which you did when I was 
 present with you." But, if we adhere to our own translation, the 
 apostle here furnishes us with a very good rule to direct and regulate 
 us in the exercise of our zeal: there are two things which to this 
 purpose he more especially recommends to us:--

 (1.) That it be exercised only upon that which is good; for zeal is
 then only good when it is in a good thing: those who are zealously 
 affected to that which is evil will thereby only to do so much the more 
 hurt. And, 

 (2.) That herein it be constant and steady: it is good to be zealous 
 always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, like the 
 heat of an ague-fit, but, like the natural heat of the body, constant. 
 Happy would it be for the church of Christ if this rule were better 
 observed among Christians!</P>

 That the apostle might the better dispose these Christians to bear with 
 him in the reproofs which he was obliged to give them, he here 
 expresses his great affection to them, and the very tender concern he 
 had for their welfare: he was not like them--one thing when among them
 and another when absent from them. Their disaffection to him had not 
 removed his affection from them; but he still bore the same respect to 
 them which he had formerly done, nor was he like their false teachers, 
 who pretended a great deal of affection to them, when at the same time 
 they were only consulting their own interest; but he had a sincere 
 concern for their truest advantage; he sought not theirs, but them. 
 They were too ready to account him their enemy, but he assures them 
 that he was their friend; nay, not only so, but that he had the bowels 
 of a parent towards them. He calls them <I>his children,</I> as he 
 justly might, since he had been the instrument of their conversion to 
 the Christian faith; yea, he styles them his <I>little children,</I> 
 which, as it denotes a greater degree of tenderness and affection to 
 them, so it may possibly have a respect to their present behaviour, 
 whereby they showed themselves too much like little children, who are 
 easily wrought upon by the arts and insinuations of others. He 
 expresses his concern for them, and earnest desire of their welfare and 
 soul-prosperity, by the pangs of a travailing woman: <I>He travailed in
 birth for them:</I> and the great thing which he was in so much pain 
 about, and which he was so earnestly desirous of, was not so much that 
 they might affect him as <I>that Christ might be formed in them,</I> 
 that they might become Christians indeed, and be more confirmed and 
 established in the faith of the gospel. From this we may note, 

 1. The very tender affection which faithful ministers bear towards
 those among whom they are employed; it is like that of the most 
 affectionate parents to their little children. 

 2. That the chief thing they are longing and even travailing in birth 
 for, on their account, is that Christ may be formed in them; not so 
 much that they may gain their affections, much less that they may make 
 a prey of them, but that they may be renewed in the spirit of their 
 minds, wrought into the image of Christ, and more fully settled and 
 confirmed in the Christian faith and life: and how unreasonably must 
 those people act who suffer themselves to be prevailed upon to desert 
 or dislike such ministers! 

 3. That Christ is not fully formed in men till they are brought off
 from trusting in their own righteousness, and made to rely only upon 
 him and his righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As further evidence of the affection and concern which the apostle had 
 for these Christians, he adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 that <I>he desired to be then present with them</I>--that he would be 
 glad of an opportunity of being among them, and conversing with them, 
 and that thereupon he might find occasion <I>to change his voice</I> 
 towards them; for at present <I>he stood in doubt of them.</I> He knew 
 not well what to think of them. He was not so fully acquainted with 
 their state as to know how to accommodate himself to them. He was full 
 of fears and jealousies concerning them, which was the reason of his 
 writing to them in such a manner as he had done; but he would be glad 
 to find that matters were better with them than he feared, and that he 
 might have occasion to commend them, instead of thus reproving and 
 chiding them. Note, Though ministers too often find it necessary to 
 reprove those they have to do with, yet this is no grateful work to 
 them; they had much rather there were no occasion for it, and are 
 always glad when they can see reason to change their voice towards 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear
 the law?
 &nbsp; 22  For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
 bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
 &nbsp; 23  But he <I>who was</I> of the bondwoman was born after the flesh;
 but he of the freewoman <I>was</I> by promise.
 &nbsp; 24  Which things are an allegory: for these are the two
 covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to
 bondage, which is Agar.
 &nbsp; 25  For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
 Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
 &nbsp; 26  But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of
 us all.
 &nbsp; 27  For it is written, Rejoice, <I>thou</I> barren that bearest not;
 break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate
 hath many more children than she which hath a husband.
 &nbsp; 28  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
 &nbsp; 29  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him
 <I>that was born</I> after the Spirit, even so <I>it is</I> now.
 &nbsp; 30  Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the
 bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be
 heir with the son of the freewoman.
 &nbsp; 31  So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but
 of the free.

 In these verses the apostle illustrates the difference between 
 believers who rested in Christ only and those judaizers who trusted in 
 the law, by a comparison taken from the story of Isaac and Ishmael. 
 This he introduces in such a manner as was proper to strike and impress 
 their minds, and to convince them of their great weakness in departing 
 from the truth, and suffering themselves to be deprived of the liberty 
 of the gospel: <I>Tell me,</I> says he, <I>you that desire to be under 
 the law, do you not hear the law?</I> He takes it for granted that they 
 did hear the law, for among the Jews it was wont to be read in their 
 public assemblies every sabbath day; and, since they were so very fond 
 of being under it, he would have them duly to consider what is written 
 therein (referring to what is recorded 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:1-16,21:1-34">
 Gen. xvi. and xxi.</A>),

 for, if they would do this, they might soon see how little reason they
 had to trust in it. And here,

 1. He sets before them the history itself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):

 <I>For it is written, Abraham had two sons,</I> &c. Here he represents
 the different state and condition of these two sons of Abraham--that the
 one, Ishmael, <I>was by a bond-maid,</I> and the other, Isaac, <I>by a 
 free-woman;</I> and that whereas the former <I>was born after the 
 flesh,</I> or by the ordinary course of nature, the other <I>was by 
 promise,</I> when in the course of nature there was no reason to expect 
 that Sarah should have a son. 

 2. He acquaints them with the meaning and design of this history, or 
 the use which he intended to make of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:24-27"><I>v.</I> 24-27</A>):

 <I>These things,</I> says he, <I>are an allegory,</I> wherein, besides
 the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God might 
 design to signify something further to us, and that was, That these 
 two, Agar and Sarah, <I>are the two covenants,</I> or were intended to 
 typify and prefigure the two different dispensations of the covenant. 
 The former, Agar, represented that which was given from mount Sinai, 
 and <I>which gendereth to bondage,</I> which, though it was a 
 dispensation of grace, yet, in comparison of the gospel state, was a 
 dispensation of bondage, and became more so to the Jews, through their 
 mistake of the design of it, and expecting to be justified by the works 
 of it. <I>For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia</I> (mount Sinai was 
 then called Agar by the Arabians), <I>and it answereth to Jerusalem 
 which now is, and is in bondage with her children;</I> that is, it 
 justly represents the present state of the Jews, who, continuing in 
 their infidelity and adhering to that covenant, are still in bondage 
 with their children. But the other, Sarah, was intended to prefigure
 Jerusalem which is above, or the state of Christians under the new and 
 better dispensation of the covenant, which is free both from the curse 
 of the moral and the bondage of the ceremonial law, and <I>is the 
 mother of us all</I>--a state into which all, both Jews and Gentiles, 
 are admitted, upon their believing in Christ. And to this greater 
 freedom and enlargement of the church under the gospel dispensation, 
 which was typified by Sarah the mother of the promised seed, the 
 apostle refers that of the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>,

 where it is written, <I>Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
 forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for the desolate hath many 
 more children than she who hath a husband.</I>

 3. He applies the history thus explained to the present case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 <I>Now we, brethren,</I> says he, <I>as Isaac was, are the children of 
 the promise.</I> We Christians, who have accepted Christ, and rely upon 
 him, and look for justification and salvation by him alone, as hereby 
 we become the spiritual, though we are not the natural, seed of 
 Abraham, so we are entitled to the promised inheritance and interested 
 in the blessings of it. But lest these Christians should be stumbled at 
 the opposition they might meet with from the Jews, who were so 
 tenacious of their law as to be ready to persecute those who would not 
 submit to it, he tells them that this was no more than what was pointed 
 to in the type; for <I>as then he that was born after the flesh 
 persecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</I> they must expect it 
 would be <I>so now.</I> But, for their comfort in this case, he desires 
 them to consider what the scripture saith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:10">Gen. xxi. 10</A>),

 <I>Cast out the bond-woman and her son, for the son of the bond-woman 
 shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</I> Though the 
 judaizers should persecute and hate them, yet the issue would be that 
 Judaism would sink, and wither, and perish; but true Christianity 
 should flourish and last for ever. And then, as a general inference 
 from the whole of the sum of what he had said, he concludes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 <I>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the 
 free.</I></P>
