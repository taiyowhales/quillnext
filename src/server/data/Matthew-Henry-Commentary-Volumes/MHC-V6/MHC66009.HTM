 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from
 heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the
 bottomless pit.
 &nbsp; 2  And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out
 of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the
 air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
 &nbsp; 3  And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and
 unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
 power.
 &nbsp; 4  And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
 of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only
 those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
 &nbsp; 5  And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
 that they should be tormented five months: and their torment
 <I>was</I> as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
 &nbsp; 6  And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find
 it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
 &nbsp; 7  And the shapes of the locusts <I>were</I> like unto horses
 prepared unto battle; and on their heads <I>were</I> as it were crowns
 like gold, and their faces <I>were</I> as the faces of men.
 &nbsp; 8  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were
 as <I>the teeth</I> of lions.
 &nbsp; 9  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;
 and the sound of their wings <I>was</I> as the sound of chariots of
 many horses running to battle.
 &nbsp; 10  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were
 stings in their tails: and their power <I>was</I> to hurt men five
 months.
 &nbsp; 11  And they had a king over them, <I>which is</I> the angel of the
 bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue <I>is</I> Abaddon, but
 in the Greek tongue hath <I>his</I> name Apollyon.
 &nbsp; 12  One woe is past; <I>and,</I> behold, there come two woes more
 hereafter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon the sounding of this trumpet, the things to be observed are, 

 1. <I>A star falling from heaven to the earth.</I> Some think this
 star represents some eminent bishop in the Christian church, some angel 
 of the church; for, in the same way of speaking by which pastors are 
 called stars, the church is called heaven; but who this is expositors 
 do not agree. Some understand it of Boniface the third bishop of Rome, 
 who assumed the title of universal bishop, by the favour of the emperor 
 Phocas, who, being a usurper and tyrant in the state, allowed Boniface 
 to be so in the church, as the reward of his flattery. 

 2. To this fallen star <I>was given the key of the bottomless pit.</I> 
 Having now ceased to be a minister of Christ, he becomes the 
 antichrist, the minister of the devil; and by the permission of Christ, 
 who had taken from him the keys of the church, he becomes the devil's 
 turnkey, to let loose the powers of hell against the churches of 
 Christ. 

 3. Upon the opening of the bottomless pit <I>there arose a great
 smoke,</I> which darkened the sun and the air. The devils are the 
 powers of darkness; hell is the place of darkness. The devil carries on 
 his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by extinguishing light and 
 knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. He first deceives men, 
 and then destroys them; wretched souls follow him in the dark, or they 
 durst not follow him. 

 4. Out of this dark smoke there came a swarm of locusts, one of the 
 plagues of Egypt, the devil's emissaries headed by the antichrist, all 
 the rout and rabble of antichristian orders, to promote superstition, 
 idolatry, error, and cruelty; and these had, by the just permission of 
 God, power to hurt those who had not the mark of God in their 
 foreheads. 

 5. The hurt they were to do them was not a bodily, but a spiritual
 hurt. They should not in a military way destroy all by fire and sword; 
 the trees and the grass should be untouched, and those they hurt should 
 not be slain; it should not be a persecution, but a secret poison and 
 infection in their souls, which should rob them of their purity, and 
 afterwards of their peace. Heresy is a poison in the soul, working 
 slowly and secretly, but will be bitterness in the end. 

 6. They had no power so much as to hurt those who had the seal of God 
 in their foreheads. God's electing, effectual, distinguishing grace 
 will preserve his people from total and final apostasy. 

 7. The power given to these factors for hell is limited in point of
 time: <I>five months,</I> a certain season, and but a short season, 
 though how short we cannot tell. Gospel-seasons have their limits, and 
 times of seduction are limited too. 

 8. Though it would be short, it would be very sharp, insomuch that
 those who were made to feel the malignity of this poison in their 
 consciences would be weary of their lives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 <I>A wounded spirit who can bear?</I>

 9. These locusts were of a monstrous size and shape,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>,

 &c. They were equipped for their work like horses prepared to battle.
 
 (1.) They pretended to great authority, and seemed to be assured of 
 victory: <I>They had crowns like gold on their heads;</I> it was not a 
 true, but a counterfeit authority. 

 (2.) They had the show of wisdom and sagacity, <I>the faces of men,</I> 
 though the spirit of devils. 

 (3.) They had all the allurements of seeming beauty, to ensnare and 
 defile the minds of men--<I>hair like women;</I> their way of worship 
 was very gaudy and ornamental. 

 (4.) Though they appeared with the tenderness of women, they had <I>the 
 teeth of lions,</I> were really cruel creatures.

 (5.) They had the defence and protection of earthly 
 powers--<I>breastplates of iron.</I> 

 (6.) They made a mighty noise in the world; they flew about from one 
 country to another, and the noise of their motion was like that of an 
 army with chariots and horses. 

 (7.) Though at first they soothed and flattered men with a fair 
 appearance, there was a sting in their tails; the cup of their 
 abominations contained that which, though luscious at first, would at 
 length bite like a serpent and sting like an adder.

 (8.) The king and commander of this hellish squadron is here described, 
 
 [1.] As an angel; so he was by nature, an angel, once one of the angels 
 of heaven. 

 [2.] <I>The angel of the bottomless pit;</I> an angel still, but a 
 fallen angel, fallen into the bottomless pit, vastly large, and out of 
 which there is no recovery.

 [3.] In these infernal regions he is a sort of prince and governor, and 
 has the powers of darkness under his rule and command.

 [4.] His true name is <I>Abaddon, Apollyon--a destroyer,</I> for that 
 is his business, his design, and employment, to which he diligently 
 attends, in which he is very successful, and takes a horrid hellish 
 pleasure; it is about this destroying work that he sends out his 
 emissaries and armies to destroy the souls of men. And now here we have 
 the end of one woe; and where one ends another begins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the
 four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
 &nbsp; 14  Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the
 four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 15  And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an
 hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third
 part of men.
 &nbsp; 16  And the number of the army of the horsemen <I>were</I> two
 hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
 &nbsp; 17  And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat
 on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and
 brimstone: and the heads of the horses <I>were</I> as the heads of
 lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and
 brimstone.
 &nbsp; 18  By these three was the third part of men killed, by the
 fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of
 their mouths.
 &nbsp; 19  For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for
 their tails <I>were</I> like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
 them they do hurt.
 &nbsp; 20  And the rest of the men which were not killed by these
 plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they
 should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and
 brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear,
 nor walk:
 &nbsp; 21  Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
 sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here let us consider the preface to this vision, and then the vision 
 itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface to this vision: <I>A voice was heard from the horns of 
 the golden altar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. The power of the church's enemies is restrained till God gives the 
 word to have them turned loose. 

 2. When nations are ripe for punishment, those instruments of God's 
 anger that were before restrained are let loose upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 3. The instruments that God makes use of to punish a people may
 sometimes lie at a great distance from them, so that no danger may be 
 apprehended from them. These four messengers of divine judgment lay 
 bound in the river Euphrates, a great way from the European nations. 
 Here the Turkish power had its rise, which seems to be the story of 
 this vision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision itself: <I>And the four angels that had been bound in 
 the great river Euphrates were now loosed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.
 
 And here observe, 

 1. The time of their military operations and executions is limited to 
 <I>an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year.</I> Prophetic 
 characters of time are hardly to be understood by us; but in general 
 the time is fixed to an hour, when it shall begin and when it shall 
 end; and how far the execution shall prevail, even to a third part of 
 the inhabitants of the earth. God will make the wrath of man praise 
 him, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain. 

 2. The army that was to execute this great commission is mustered, and 
 the number found to be of horsemen <I>two hundred thousand 
 thousand;</I> but we are left to guess what the infantry must be. In 
 general, it tells us, the armies of the Mahomedan empire should be 
 vastly great; and so it is certain they were.

 3. Their formidable equipage and appearance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 As the horses were fierce, like lions, and eager to rush into the 
 battle, so those who sat upon them were clad in bright and costly 
 armour, with all the ensigns of martial courage, zeal, and resolution.
 
 4. The vast havoc and desolation that they made in the Roman empire,
 which had now become antichristian: A third part of them were killed; 
 they went as far as their commission suffered them, and they could go 
 no further. 

 5. Their artillery, by which they made such slaughter, described <I>by
 fire, smoke, and brimstone,</I> issuing out of the mouths of their 
 horses, and the stings that were in their tails. It is Mr. Mede's 
 opinion that this is a prediction of great guns, those instruments of 
 cruelty which make such destruction: he observes, These were first used 
 by the Turks at the siege of Constantinople, and, being new and 
 strange, were very terrible, and did great execution. However, here 
 seems to be an allusion to what is mentioned in the former vision, 
 that, as antichrist had his forces of a spiritual nature, like 
 scorpions poisoning the minds of men with error and idolatry, so the 
 Turks, who were raised up to punish the antichristian apostasy, had 
 their scorpions and their stings too, to hurt and kill the bodies of 
 those who had been the murderers of so many souls. 

 6. Observe the impenitency of the antichristian generation under these
 dreadful judgments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 the rest of the men who were not killed repented not, they still 
 persisted in those sins for which God was so severely punishing them, 
 which were, 

 (1.) Their idolatry; they would not cast away their images, though they 
 could do them no good, <I>could not see, nor hear, nor walk.</I> 

 (2.) Their murders 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which they had committed upon the saints and servants of Christ. Popery 
 is a bloody religion, and seems resolved to continue such. 

 (3.) Their sorceries; they have their charms, and magic arts, and rites 
 in exorcism and other things. 

 (4.) Their fornication; they allow both spiritual and carnal impurity, 
 and promote it in themselves and others.

 (5.) Their thefts; they have by unjust means heaped together a vast 
 deal of wealth, to the injury and impoverishing of families, cities, 
 princes, and nations. These are the flagrant crimes of antichrist and
 his agents; and, though God has revealed his wrath from heaven against 
 them, they are obstinate, hardened, and impenitent, and judicially so, 
 for they must be destroyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From this sixth trumpet we learn, 

 1. God can make one enemy of the church to be a scourge and plague to
 another. 

 2. He who is the Lord of hosts has vast armies at his command, to serve
 his own purposes. 

 3. The most formidable powers have limits set them, which they cannot
 transgress. 

 4. When God's judgments are in the earth, he expects the inhabitants 
 thereof should repent of sin, and learn righteousness. 

 5. Impenitency under divine judgments is an iniquity that will be the
 ruin of sinners; for where God judges he will overcome.</P>
