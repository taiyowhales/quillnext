 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having in the foregoing chapter exhorted them to proceed 
 and advance in the Christian race, now comes to remove, as much as in 
 him lay, what he could not but apprehend would hinder their complying 
 with his exhortation. He therefore gives them fair warning of false 
 teachers, by whom they might be in danger of being seduced. To prevent 
 this, 

 I. He describes these seducers as impious in themselves, and very
 pernicious to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He assures them of the punishment that shall be inflicted on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 III. He tells us how contrary the method is which God takes with those
 who fear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 IV. He fills up the rest of the chapter with a further description of 
 those seducers of whom he would have them beware.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
 there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring
 in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and
 bring upon themselves swift destruction.
 &nbsp; 2  And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of
 whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.
 &nbsp; 3  And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
 merchandise of you--
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the end of the former chapter there is mention made of holy men 
 of God, who lived in the times of the Old Testament, and were used as 
 the amanuenses of the Holy Ghost, in writing the sacred oracles; but in 
 the beginning of this he tells us they had, even at that time, false 
 prophets in the church as well as true. In all ages of the church, and 
 under all dispensations, when God sends true prophets, the devil sends 
 some to seduce and deceive, false prophets in the Old Testament, and 
 false Christs, false apostles, and seducing teachers, in the New. 
 Concerning these observe, 

 1. Their business is to bring in destructive errors, <I>even damnable
 heresies,</I> as the business of teachers sent of God is to show the 
 way of truth, even the true way to everlasting life. There are damnable 
 heresies as well as damnable practices; and false teachers are 
 industrious to spread pernicious errors. 

 2. Damnable heresies are commonly brought in privily, under the cloak
 and colour of truth. Those who introduce destructive heresies <I>deny 
 the Lord that bought them.</I> They reject and refuse to hear and learn 
 of the great teacher sent from God, though he is the only Saviour and 
 Redeemer of men, who paid a price sufficient to redeem as many worlds 
 of sinners as there are sinners in the world. 

 4. Those who bring in errors destructive to others bring swift (and
 therefore sure) <I>destruction upon themselves.</I> Self-destroyers are 
 soon destroyed; and those who are so hardened as to propagate errors 
 destructive to others shall surely and suddenly be destroyed, and that 
 without remedy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proceeds, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:2">second verse</A>,

 to tell us the consequence with respect to others; and here we may
 learn, 

 1. Corrupt leaders seldom fail of many to follow them; though the way
 of error is a pernicious way, yet many are ready to walk therein. Men 
 drink in iniquity like water, and are pleased to live in error. <I>The 
 prophets prophesy falsely, and the people love to have it so.</I> 

 2. The spreading of error will bring up an evil report on the way of
 truth; that is, the way of salvation by Jesus Christ, who is <I>the 
 way, the truth, and the life.</I> The Christian religion is from the 
 God of truth as the author, leads to true happiness in the enjoyment of 
 the true God as the end, and works truth in the inward part as the 
 means of acceptably serving God. And yet this way of truth is traduced 
 and blasphemed by those who embrace and advance destructive errors.
 This the apostle has foretold as what should certainly come to pass.
 Let us not be offended at any thing of this in our day, but take care 
 that we give no occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the holy name 
 whereby we are called, or speak evil of that way whereby we hope to be 
 saved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe, in the next place, the method seducers take to draw 
 disciples after them: they use <I>feigned words;</I> they flatter, and 
 by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple, 
 inducing them to yield entirely to the opinions which these seducers 
 endeavour to propagate, and sell and deliver themselves over to the 
 instruction and government of these false teacher, who make a gain of 
 those whom they make their proselytes, serving themselves and making 
 some advantage of them; for all this is through covetousness, with a 
 desire and design to get more wealth, or credit, or commendation, by 
 increasing the number of their followers. The faithful ministers of 
 Christ, who show men the way of truth, desire the profit and advantage 
 of their followers, that they may be saved; but these seducing teachers 
 desire and design only their own temporal advantage and worldly 
 grandeur.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>--3 Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth
 not, and their damnation slumbereth not.
 &nbsp; 4  For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <I>them</I>
 down to hell, and delivered <I>them</I> into chains of darkness, to be
 reserved unto judgment;
 &nbsp; 5  And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
 <I>person,</I> a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon
 the world of the ungodly;
 &nbsp; 6  And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
 condemned <I>them</I> with an overthrow, making <I>them</I> an ensample
 unto those that after should live ungodly;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Men are apt to think that a reprieve is the forerunner of a pardon, and 
 that if judgment be not speedily executed it is, or will be, certainly 
 reversed. But the apostle tells us that how successful and prosperous 
 soever false teachers may be, and that for a time, yet their 
 <I>judgment lingereth not.</I> God has determined long ago how he will 
 deal with them. Such unbelievers, who endeavour to turn others from the 
 faith, are condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on them. The 
 righteous Judge will speedily take vengeance; the day of their calamity 
 is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. To 
 prove this assertion, here are several examples of the righteous 
 judgment of God, in taking vengeance on sinners, proposed to our 
 serious consideration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See how God dealt with the angels who sinned. Observe, 

 1. No excellency will exempt a sinner from punishment. If the angels, 
 who excel us vastly in strength and knowledge, violate the law of God, 
 the sentence which that law awards shall be executed upon them, and 
 that without mercy or mitigation, for God did not spare them. Hence
 observe,

 2. By how much the more excellent the offender, by so much the more
 severe the punishment. These angels, who had the advantage of men as to 
 the dignity of their nature, are immediately punished. There is no 
 sparing them for a few days, no favour at all shown them. 

 3. Sin debases and degrades the persons who commit it. The angels of
 heaven are cast down from the height of their excellency, and divested 
 of all their glory and dignity, upon their disobedience. Whoever sins 
 against God does a manifest hurt to himself. 

 4. Those who rebel against the God of heaven shall all be sent down to
 hell. There is no place nor state between the height of glory and the 
 depth of misery in which they shall be allowed to rest. If creatures 
 sin in heaven, they must suffer in hell. 

 5. Sin is the work of darkness, and darkness is the wages of sin. The
 darkness of misery and torment follows the darkness of sin. Those who
 will not walk according to the light and direction of God's law shall 
 be deprived of the light of God's countenance and the comforts of his 
 presence. 

 6. As sin binds men over to punishment, so misery and torment hold men
 under punishment. The darkness which is their misery keeps them so that 
 they cannot get away from their torment. 

 7. The last degree of torment is not till the day of judgment. The
 sinning angels, though in hell already, are yet reserved to the 
 judgment of the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how God dealt with the old world, even in much the same way 
 that he dealt with the angels. He spared not the old world. Here 
 observe, 

 1. The number of offenders signifies no more to procure any favour than
 the quality. If the sin be universal, the punishment shall likewise 
 extend to all. But, 

 2. If there be but a few righteous, they shall be preserved. God does
 not destroy the good with the bad. In wrath he remembers mercy. 

 3. Those who are <I>preachers of righteousness</I> in an age of
 universal corruption and degeneracy, <I>holding forth the word of 
 life</I> in an unblamable and exemplary conversation, shall be 
 preserved in a time of general destruction. 

 4. God can make use of those creatures as the instruments of his
 vengeance in punishing sinners which he at first made and appointed for 
 their service and benefit. He destroyed the whole world by water; but 
 observe, 

 5. What was the procuring cause of this: <I>it was a world of ungodly
 men.</I> Ungodliness puts men out of the divine protection, and exposes 
 them to utter destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See how God dealt with Sodom and Gomorrah; though they were 
 situated in a country like the garden of the Lord, yet, if in such a 
 fruitful soil they abound in sin, God can soon turn a fruitful land 
 into barrenness and a well-watered country into dust and ashes. 
 Observe, 

 1. No political union or confederacy can keep off judgments from a
 sinful people. Sodom and the neighbouring cities were no more secured 
 by their regular government than the angels by the dignity of their 
 nature or the old world by their vast number. 

 2. God can make use of contrary creatures to punish incorrigible
 sinners. He destroys the <I>old world by water,</I> and Sodom by fire. 
 He who keeps fire and water from hurting his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2">Isa. xliii. 2</A>)

 can make either to destroy his enemies; therefore they are never safe. 
 
 3. Most heinous sins bring most grievous judgments. Those who were
 abominable in their vices were remarkable for their plagues. Those who 
 are sinners exceedingly before the Lord must expect the most dreadful 
 vengeance.

 4. The punishment of sinners in former ages is designed for the example
 of those who come after. "Follow them, not only in the time of living, 
 but in their <I>course and way of living.</I>" Men who live ungodly 
 must see what they are to expect if they go on still in a course of 
 impiety. Let us take warning by all the instances of God's taking 
 vengeance, which are recorded for our admonition, and to prevent our 
 promising ourselves impunity, though we go on in a course of sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
 the wicked:
 &nbsp; 8  (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
 hearing, vexed <I>his</I> righteous soul from day to day with <I>their</I>
 unlawful deeds;)
 &nbsp; 9  The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
 and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
 punished:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When God sends destruction on the ungodly, he commands deliverance for 
 the righteous; and, if he rain fire and brimstone on the wicked, he 
 will cover the head of the just, and they shall be hid in the day of 
 his anger. This we have an instance of in his preserving Lot. Here 
 observe, 

 1. The character given of Lot; he is called <I>a just man;</I> this he
 was as to the generally prevailing bent of his heart and through the 
 main of his conversation. God does not account men just or unjust from 
 one single act, but from their general course of life. And here is a 
 just man in the midst of a most corrupt and profligate generation 
 universally gone off from all good. He does not follow the multitude to 
 do evil, but in a city of injustice he walks uprightly. 

 2. The impression the sins of others made upon this righteous man.
 Though the sinner takes pleasure in his wickedness, it is a grief and 
 vexation to the soul of the righteous. In bad company we cannot escape 
 either guilt or grief. Let the sins of others be a trouble to us, 
 otherwise it will not be possible for us to keep ourselves pure. 

 3. Here is a particular mention of the duration and continuance of
 this good man's grief and vexation: it was <I>from day to day.</I> 
 Being accustomed to hear and see their wickedness did not reconcile him 
 to it, nor abate of the horror that was occasioned by it. This is the 
 righteous man whom God preserved from the desolating judgment that 
 destroyed all round about him. From this instance we are taught to 
 argue that God knows how to deliver his people and punish his enemies.
 It is here presupposed that the righteous must have their temptations 
 and trials. The devil and his instruments will thrust sore at them, 
 that they may fall; and, if we will get to heaven, it must be through 
 many tribulations. It is therefore our duty to reckon upon and prepare 
 for them. Observe here,

 (1.) <I>The Lord knows those that are his.</I> He has set apart him who 
 is godly for himself; and, if there is but one in five cities, he knows 
 him; and where there is a greater number he cannot be ignorant of nor 
 overlook any one of them. 

 (2.) The wisdom of God is never at a loss about ways and means to 
 deliver his people. They are often utterly at a loss, and can see no 
 way; he can deliver a great many.

 (3.) The deliverance of the godly is the work of God, that which he 
 concerns himself in, both his wisdom to contrive the way and his power 
 to work out the deliverance <I>out of temptation,</I> to prevent their 
 falling into sin and their being ruined by their troubles. And surely, 
 if he can deliver out of temptation, he could keep from falling into it 
 if he did not see such trials to be necessary. 

 (4.) God makes a very great difference in his dealings with the godly 
 and the wicked. When he saves his people from destruction, he delivers 
 over his enemies to deserved ruin. The unjust has no share in the 
 salvation God works out for the righteous. The wicked are <I>reserved 
 to the day of judgment.</I> Here we see, 

 [1.] There is a day of judgment. <I>God has appointed a day wherein he 
 will judge the world.</I>

 [2.] The preservation of impenitent sinners is only a reserving of them 
 to the day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
 uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous <I>are they,</I>
 selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
 &nbsp; 11  Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring
 not railing accusation against them before the Lord.
 &nbsp; 12  But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
 destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and
 shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
 &nbsp; 13  And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, <I>as</I> they
 that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots <I>they are</I>
 and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings
 while they feast with you;
 &nbsp; 14  Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from
 sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with
 covetous practices; cursed children:
 &nbsp; 15  Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
 following the way of Balaam <I>the son</I> of Bosor, who loved the
 wages of unrighteousness;
 &nbsp; 16  But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with
 man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
 &nbsp; 17  These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with
 a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
 &nbsp; 18  For when they speak great swelling <I>words</I> of vanity, they
 allure through the lusts of the flesh, <I>through much</I> wantonness,
 those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
 &nbsp; 19  While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
 servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the
 same is he brought in bondage.
 &nbsp; 20  For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
 through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they
 are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is
 worse with them than the beginning.
 &nbsp; 21  For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
 righteousness, than, after they have known <I>it,</I> to turn from the
 holy commandment delivered unto them.
 &nbsp; 22  But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
 The dog <I>is</I> turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
 washed to her wallowing in the mire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle's design being to warn us of, and arm us against, seducers, 
 he now returns to discourse more particularly of them, and give us an 
 account of their character and conduct, which abundantly justifies the 
 righteous Judge of the world in reserving them in an especial manner 
 for the most severe and heavy doom, as Cain is taken under special 
 protection that he might be kept for uncommon vengeance. But why will 
 God thus deal with these false teachers? This he shows in what 
 follows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>These walk after the flesh;</I> they follow the devices and 
 desires of their own hearts, they give up themselves to the conduct of 
 their own fleshly mind, refusing to make their reason stoop to divine 
 revelation, and to <I>bring every thought to the obedience of 
 Christ;</I> they, in their lives, act directly contrary to God's 
 righteous precepts, and comply with the demands of corrupt nature. Evil 
 opinions are often accompanied with evil practices; and those who are 
 for propagating error are for improving in wickedness. They will not 
 sit down contented in the measure of iniquity to which they have 
 attained, nor is it enough for them to stand up, and maintain, and 
 defend, what wickedness they have already committed, but they <I>walk 
 after the flesh,</I> they go on in their sinful course, and increase 
 unto more ungodliness and greater degrees of impurity and uncleanness 
 too; they also pour contempt on those whom God has set in authority 
 over them and requires them to honour. These therefore despise <I>the 
 ordinance of God,</I> and we need not wonder at it, for they are bold 
 and daring, obstinate and refractory, and will not only cherish 
 contempt in their hearts, but with their tongues will utter slanderous 
 and reproachful words of those who are set over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This he aggravates, by setting forth the very different conduct of 
 more excellent creatures, even the <I>angels,</I> of whom observe, 

 1. They <I>are greater in power and might,</I> and that even than
 those who are clothed with authority and power among the sons of men, 
 and much more than those false teachers who are slanderous revilers of 
 magistrates and governors; the good angels vastly exceed us in all 
 natural and moral excellences, in strength, understanding, and holiness 
 too. 

 2. Good angels are accusers of sinful creatures, either of their own
 kind, or ours, or both. Those who are allowed to behold the face of 
 God, and stand before his throne, cannot but have a zeal for his 
 honour, and accuse and blame those who dishonour him. 

 3. <I>Angels bring</I> their <I>accusations</I> of sinful creatures
 <I>before the Lord;</I> they do not publish their faults, and tell 
 their crimes to their fellow-creatures, in a way of calumny and 
 slander; but it is before the Lord, who is the Judge, and will be the 
 avenger, of all impiety and injustice. 

 4. Good angels mingle no bitter revilings nor base reproaches with any
 of the accusations or charges they bring against the wickedest and 
 worst of criminals. Let us, who pray that God's <I>will may be done on 
 earth as it is in heaven,</I> imitate the angels in this particular; if 
 we complain of wicked men, let it be to God, and that not with rage and 
 reviling, but with compassion and composedness of mind, that may 
 evidence that we belong to him who is meek and merciful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle, having shown 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 how unlike seducing teachers are to the most excellent creatures, 
 proceeds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 to show how like they are to the most inferior: they are <I>like the 
 horse and mule, which have no understanding;</I> they are <I>as natural 
 brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed.</I> Men, under the power 
 of sin, are so far from observing divine revelation that they do not 
 exercise reason, nor act according to the direction thereof. They 
 <I>walk by sight, and not by faith,</I> and judge of things according 
 to their senses; as these represent things pleasant and agreeable, so 
 they must be approved and esteemed. Brute-creatures follow the
 instinct of their sensitive appetite, and sinful man follows the 
 inclination of his carnal mind; these refuse to employ the 
 understanding and reason God has given them, and so are ignorant of 
 what they might and ought to know; and therefore observe, 

 1. Ignorance is the cause of evil-speaking; and,

 2. Destruction will be the effect of it. These persons shall be
 utterly destroyed in their own corruption. Their vices not only expose 
 them to the wrath of God in another world, but often bring them to 
 misery and ruin in this life; and surely such impudent offenders, who 
 <I>glory in their shame,</I> and to whom openness in sin is an 
 improvement of the pleasure of sinning, most justly deserve all the 
 plagues of this life and the pains of the next in the greatest 
 extremity. Therefore whatever they meet with is the just <I>reward of 
 their unrighteousness.</I> Such sinners as sport themselves in mischief 
 deceive themselves and disgrace all they belong to, for by one sort of 
 sins they prepare themselves for another; their extravagant feastings, 
 their intemperance in eating and drinking, bring them to commit all 
 manner of lewdness, so that their <I>eyes are full of adultery,</I> 
 their wanton looks show their own impure lusts and are designed and 
 directed to kindle the like in others; and this is what they <I>cannot 
 cease</I> from--the heart is insatiate in lusting and the eye incessant 
 in looking after what may gratify their unclean desires, and those who 
 are themselves impudent and incessant in sin are very diligent and 
 often successful in deceiving others and drawing others into the same 
 excess of riot. But here observe who those are who are in the greatest
 danger of being led away into error and impiety, even the 
 <I>unstable.</I> Those whose hearts are not established with grace are 
 easily turned into the way of sin, or else such sensual wretches would 
 not be able to prevail upon them, for these are not only riotous and 
 lascivious, but <I>covetous</I> also, and these practices their hearts 
 are exercised with; they pant after riches, and the desire of their 
 souls is to the wealth of this world: it is a considerable part of 
 their work to contrive to get wealth; in this their hearts are 
 exercised, and then they execute their projects; and, if men abandon 
 themselves to all sorts of lusts, we cannot wonder that the apostle 
 should call them <I>cursed children,</I> for they are liable to the 
 curse of God denounced against such <I>ungodly and unrighteous men,</I> 
 and they bring a curse upon all who hearken and adhere to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>)

 proves that they are <I>cursed children,</I> even such covetous persons 
 as <I>the Lord abhors,</I> by showing,

 1. They <I>have forsaken the right way;</I> and it cannot be but such
 self-seekers must be out of the right way, which is a self-denying way.

 2. They have gone into a wrong way: they have erred and strayed from
 the way of life, and gone over into the path which leads to death, and 
 takes hold of hell; and this he makes out by showing it to be <I>the 
 way of Balaam, the son of Bosor.</I> 

 (1.) That is a way of unrighteousness into which men are led by the 
 wages of unrighteousness.

 (2.) Outward temporal good things are the wages sinners expect and 
 promise themselves, though they are often disappointed. 

 (3.) The inordinate love of the good things of this world turns men out 
 of the way which leads to the unspeakably better things of another 
 life; the love of riches and honour turned Balaam out of the way of his 
 duty, although he knew that the way he took displeased the Lord. 

 (4.) Those who from the same principle are guilty of the same practices 
 with notorious sinners are, in the judgment of God, the followers of 
 such vile offenders, and therefore must reckon upon being at last where 
 they are: <I>they shall have their portion</I> with those in another 
 world whom they imitated in this. 

 (5.) Heinous and hardened sinners sometimes meet with rebukes for their 
 iniquity. God stops them in their way, and opens the mouth of 
 conscience, or by some startling providence startles and affrights 
 them. 

 (6.) Though some more uncommon and extraordinary rebuke may for a 
 little while cool men's courage, and hinder their violent progress in 
 the way of sin, it will not make them forsake the way of iniquity and 
 go over into the way of holiness. If rebuking a sinner for his
 iniquity could have made a man return to his duty, surely the rebuke of 
 Balaam must have produced this effect; for here is a surprising miracle 
 wrought: <I>the dumb ass,</I> in whose mouth no man can expect to meet 
 with reproof, is enabled to speak, and that with a human voice, and to 
 her owner and master (who is here called a <I>prophet,</I> for the Lord
 appeared and spoke sometimes to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23,24">Num. xxii. 23, 24</A>,

 but indeed he was among the prophets of the Lord as Judas among the 
 apostles of Jesus Christ), and she exposes <I>the madness</I> of his 
 conduct and opposes his going on in this evil way, and yet all in vain. 
 Those who will not yield to usual methods of reproof will be but little 
 influenced by miraculous appearances to turn them from their sinful 
 courses. Balaam was indeed restrained from actually <I>cursing the 
 people,</I> but he had so strong a desire after the honours and riches 
 that were promised him that he went as far as he could, and did his 
 utmost to get from under the restraint that was upon him.</P>

 V. The apostle proceeds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 to a further description of seducing teachers, whom he sets forth,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As <I>wells,</I> or fountains, <I>without water.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Ministers should be as wells or fountains, where the people may 
 find instruction, direction, and comfort; but 

 (2.) False teachers have nothing of this to impart to those who consult 
 them: the word of truth is the water of life, which refreshes the souls 
 that receive it; but these deceivers are set upon spreading and 
 promoting error, and therefore are set forth as empty, because there is 
 no truth in them. In vain then are all our expectations of being fed 
 and filled with knowledge and understanding by those who are themselves 
 ignorant and empty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As <I>clouds carried with a tempest.</I> When we see a cloud we 
 expect a refreshing shower from it; but these are clouds which yield no 
 rain, for they are driven with the wind, but not of the Spirit, but the 
 stormy wind or tempest of their own ambition and covetousness. They 
 espouse and spread those opinions that will procure most applause and 
 advantage to themselves; and as clouds obstruct the light of the sun, 
 and darken the air, so do these <I>darken counsel by words without 
 knowledge</I> and wherein there is no truth; and, seeing these men are 
 for promoting darkness in this world, it is very just that the mist of 
 darkness should be their portion in the next. Utter darkness was 
 prepared for the devil, the great deceiver, and his angels, those 
 instruments that he uses to turn men from the truth, and therefore for 
 them it is reserved, and that for ever; the fire of hell is 
 everlasting, and the smoke of the bottomless pit rises up for ever and 
 ever. And it is just with God to deal thus with them, because 

 (1.) They allure those they deal with, and draw them into a net, or 
 catch them as men do fish; and, 

 (2.) It is <I>with great swelling words of vanity,</I> lofty 
 expressions, which have a great sound, but little sense. 

 (3.) They work upon <I>the corrupt affections</I> and <I>carnal fleshly 
 lusts of men,</I> proposing what is grateful to them. And, 

 (4.) They seduce persons who in reality avoided and kept at a distance 
 from those who spread and those who embraced hurtful and destructive 
 errors. Observe,

 [1.] By application and industry men attain a skilfulness and dexterity 
 in promoting error. They are as artful and as successful as the fisher, 
 who makes angling his daily employment. The business of these men is to 
 draw disciples after them, and in their methods and management there 
 are some things worth observing, how they suit their bait to those they 
 desire to catch.

 [2.] Erroneous teachers have a peculiar advantage to win men over to 
 them, because they have sensual pleasure to take them with; where as 
 the ministers of Christ put men upon self-denial, and the mortifying of 
 those lusts that others gratify and please: wonder not therefore that 
 truth prevails no more, or that errors spread so much.

 [3.] Persons who have for a while adhered to the truth, and kept clear 
 of errors, may by the subtlety and industry of seducers be so far 
 deceived as to fall into those errors they had for a while <I>clean 
 escaped.</I> "Be therefore always upon your guard, maintain a godly 
 jealousy of yourselves, search the scriptures, pray for the Spirit to 
 instruct and establish you in the truth, walk humbly with God, and 
 watch against every thing that may provoke him to give you up to a 
 reprobate mind, that you may not be taken with the fair and specious 
 pretences of these false teachers, who promise liberty to all who will 
 hearken to them, not true Christian liberty for the service of God, but 
 a licentiousness in sin, to follow the devices and desires of their own 
 hearts." To prevent these men's gaining proselytes, he tells us that, 
 in the midst of all their talk of liberty, they themselves are the 
 vilest slaves, for they are the servants of corruption; their own lusts 
 have gotten a complete victory over them, and they are actually in 
 bondage to them, making <I>provision for the flesh,</I> to satisfy its 
 cravings, comply with its directions, and obey its commands. Their 
 minds and hearts are so far corrupted and depraved that they have 
 neither power nor will to refuse the task that is imposed on them. They 
 are conquered and captivated by their spiritual enemies, and yield 
 their members servants of unrighteousness: and what a shame it is to be 
 overcome and commanded by those who are themselves <I>the servants of 
 corruption, and slaves to their own lusts!</I> This consideration 
 should prevent our being led away by these seducers; and to this he 
 adds another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 it is not only a shame and disgrace to be seduced by those who are 
 themselves the slaves of sin, and led captive by the devil at his 
 pleasure, but it is a real detriment to those who have clean escaped 
 from those who live in error, for hereby their latter end is made worse 
 than their beginning. Here we see, <I>First,</I> It is an advantage to
 escape the pollutions of the world, to be kept from gross and 
 scandalous sins, though men are not thoroughly converted and savingly 
 changed; for hereby we are kept from grieving those who are truly 
 serious and emboldening those who are openly profane; whereas, if we 
 run with others to the same excess of riot and abandon ourselves to the 
 sins of the age, we afflict and dishearten those who endeavour to walk 
 as becomes the gospel, and strengthen the hands of those who are 
 already engaged in open rebellion against the Most High, as well as 
 alienate ourselves more from God, and harden our hearts against him.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Some men are, for a time, <I>kept from the pollutions 
 of the world, by the knowledge of Christ,</I> who are not savingly 
 renewed in the spirit of their mind. A religious education has 
 restrained many whom the grace of God has not renewed: if we receive 
 the light of the truth, and have a notional knowledge of Christ in our 
 heads, it may be of some present service to us; but we must receive the 
 love of the truth, and hide God's word in our heart, or it will not 
 sanctify and save us. <I>Thirdly,</I> Those who have, for a time, 
 escaped the pollutions of the world, are at first ensnared and 
 entangled by false teachers, who first perplex men with some plausible 
 and specious objections against the truths of the gospel; and the more 
 ignorant and unstable are hereby made to stagger, and brought to 
 question the truth of doctrines they have received, because they cannot 
 solve all the difficulties, nor answer all the objections, that are 
 urged by these seducers. <I>Fourthly,</I> When men are once entangled,
 they are easily overcome; therefore should Christians keep close to the 
 word of God, and watch against those who seek to perplex and bewilder 
 them, and that because, if men who have once <I>escaped are again 
 entangled, the latter end is worse with them than the 
 beginning.</I></P>

 VI. The apostle, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:21,22">last two verses of the chapter</A>,

 sets himself to prove that a state of apostasy is worse
 than a state of ignorance; for it is a <I>condemning of the way of 
 righteousness,</I> after they have had some knowledge of it, and 
 expressed some liking to it; it carries in it a declaring that they 
 have found some iniquity in the way of righteousness and some falsehood 
 in the word of truth. Now to bring up such an evil report upon the good 
 way of God, and such a false charge against the way of truth, must 
 necessarily expose to the heaviest condemnation; the misery of such 
 deserters of Christ and his gospel is more unavoidable and more 
 intolerable than that of other offenders; for, 

 1. God is more highly provoked by those who by their conduct despise
 the gospel, as well as disobey the law, and who reproach and pour 
 contempt upon God and his grace. 

 2. The devil more narrowly watches and more closely confines those whom
 he has recovered, after they had once gone off from him and professed 
 to be the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:45">Matt. xii. 45</A>);
 
 they are kept under a stronger guard, and no wonder it should be so
 when they have licked up their own vomit again, returning to the same 
 errors and impieties that they had once cast off and seemed to detest 
 and loathe, and wallowing in that filthiness from which they appeared 
 once to be really cleansed. Well, if the scripture gives such an 
 account of Christianity on the one hand, and of sin on the other, as we 
 have here in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:21,22">these two verses</A>,

 we certainly ought highly to approve of the former and persevere
 therein, because it is a way of righteousness, and a holy commandment, 
 and to loathe and keep at the greatest distance from the latter because 
 it is set forth as most offensive and abominable.</P>
