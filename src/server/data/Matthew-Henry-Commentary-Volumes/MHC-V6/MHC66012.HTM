 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is generally agreed by the most learned expositors that the 
 narrative we have in this and the two following chapters, from the 
 sounding of the seventh trumpet to the opening of the vials, is not a 
 prediction of things to come, but rather a recapitulation and 
 representation of things past, which, as God would have the apostle to 
 foresee while future, he would have him to review now that they were 
 past, that he might have a more perfect idea of them in his mind, and 
 might observe the agreement between the prophecy and that Providence 
 that is always fulfilling the scriptures. In this chapter we have an 
 account of the contest between the church and antichrist, the seed of 
 the woman and the seed of the serpent. 

 I. As it was begun in heaven,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
 with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
 crown of twelve stars:
 &nbsp; 2  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
 pained to be delivered.
 &nbsp; 3  And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
 great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
 crowns upon his heads.
 &nbsp; 4  And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and
 did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman
 which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon
 as it was born.
 &nbsp; 5  And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all
 nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God,
 and <I>to</I> his throne.
 &nbsp; 6  And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a
 place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
 two hundred <I>and</I> threescore days.
 &nbsp; 7  And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
 against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
 &nbsp; 8  And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called
 the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
 cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
 &nbsp; 10  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
 salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
 power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
 down, which accused them before our God day and night.
 &nbsp; 11  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
 word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
 death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see that early prophecy eminently fulfilled in which God said 
 he would <I>put enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of 
 the serpent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.
 
 You will observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The attempts of Satan and his agents to prevent the increase of the 
 church, by devouring her offspring <I>as soon as it was born;</I> of 
 this we have a very lively description in the most proper images.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We see how the church is represented in this vision. 

 (1.) As a <I>woman,</I> the weaker part of the world, but the spouse of 
 Christ, and the mother of the saints. 

 (2.) As <I>clothed with the sun,</I> the imputed righteousness of the 
 Lord Jesus Christ. Having put on Christ, who is <I>the Sun of 
 righteousness,</I> she, by her relation to Christ, is invested with 
 honourable rights and privileges, and shines in his rays. 

 (3.) As having <I>the moon under her feet</I> (that is, the world); she
 stands upon it, but lives above it; her heart and hope are not set upon 
 sublunary things, but on the things that are in heaven, where her head 
 is. 

 (4.) As having on her head <I>a crown of twelve stars,</I> that is, the 
 doctrine of the gospel preached by the twelve apostles, which is a 
 crown of glory to all true believers. 

 (5.) As in travail, crying out, and <I>pained to be delivered.</I> She 
 was pregnant, and now in pain to bring forth a holy progeny to Christ, 
 desirous that what was begun in the conviction of sinners might end in 
 their conversion, that when the children were brought to the birth 
 there might be strength to bring forth, and that she might see of the 
 travail of her soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the grand enemy of the church is represented. 

 (1.) As a <I>great red dragon</I>--a dragon for strength and terror--a 
 red dragon for fierceness and cruelty. 

 (2.) As <I>having seven heads,</I> that is, placed on seven hills, as 
 Rome was; and therefore it is probable that pagan Rome is here meant. 
 
 (3.) As having <I>ten horns,</I> divided into ten provinces, as the 
 Roman empire was by Augustus C&aelig;sar. 

 (4.) As having <I>seven crowns upon his head,</I> which is afterwards 
 expounded to be seven kings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:10"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 10</A>.

 (5.) As drawing with his tail a <I>third part of the stars in
 heaven,</I> and <I>casting them down to the earth,</I> turning the 
 ministers and professors of the Christian religion out of their places 
 and privileges and making them as weak and useless as he could. 

 (6.) As standing <I>before the woman, to devour her child as soon as it 
 should be born,</I> very vigilant to crush the Christian religion in 
 its birth and entirely to prevent the growth and continuance of it in 
 the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The unsuccessfulness of these attempts against the church; for, 

 1. She was safely delivered of a <I>man-child</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 by which some understand Christ, others Constantine, but others, with 
 greater propriety, a race of true believers, strong and united, 
 resembling Christ, and designed, under him, <I>to rule the nations with 
 a rod of iron;</I> that is, to judge the world by their doctrine and 
 lives now, and as assessors with Christ at the great day. 

 2. Care was taken of this child: it <I>was caught up to God, and to his 
 throne;</I> that is, taken into his special, powerful, and immediate 
 protection. The Christian religion has been from its infancy the
 special care of <I>the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</I> 

 3. Care was taken of the mother as well as of the child,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 She <I>fled into the wilderness, a place prepared</I> both for her 
 safety and her sustenance. The church was in an obscure state, 
 dispersed; and this proved her security, through the care of divine 
 Providence. This her obscure and private state was for a limited time, 
 not to continue always.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The attempts of the dragon not only proved unsuccessful against 
 the church, but fatal to his own interests; for, upon his endeavour to 
 devour the man-child, he engaged all the powers of heaven against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>There was war in heaven. Heaven</I> will espouse the quarrel of the
 church. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The seat of this war--<I>in heaven,</I> in the church, which is
 <I>the kingdom of heaven</I> on earth, under the care of heaven and in 
 the same interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The parties--<I>Michael and his angels</I> on one side, and <I>the
 dragon and his angels</I> on the other: Christ, the great Angel of the 
 covenant, and his faithful followers; and Satan and all his 
 instruments. This latter party would be much superior in number and 
 outward strength to the other; but the strength of the church lies in 
 having the Lord Jesus for the captain of their salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The success of the battle: <I>The dragon and his angels fought and 
 prevailed not;</I> there was a great struggle on both sides, but the 
 victory fell to Christ and his church, and the dragon and his angels 
 were not only conquered, but cast out; the pagan idolatry, which was a 
 worshipping of devils, was extirpated out of the empire in the time of 
 Constantine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The triumphant song that was composed and used on this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) How the conqueror is adored: <I>Now have come salvation, strength, 
 and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.</I> Now God 
 has shown himself to be a mighty God; now Christ has shown himself to 
 be a strong and mighty Saviour; his own arm has brought salvation, and 
 now his kingdom will be greatly enlarged and established. The salvation 
 and strength of the church are all to be ascribed to the king and head 
 of the church. 

 (2.) How the conquered enemy is described. 

 [1.] By his malice; he was <I>the accuser of the brethren,</I> and 
 <I>accused them before their God night and day;</I> he appeared before 
 God as an adversary to the church, continually bringing in indictments 
 and accusations against them, whether true or false; thus he accused 
 Job, and thus he accused Joshua the high priest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:1">Zech. iii. 1</A>.

 Though he hates the presence of God, yet he is willing to appear there 
 to accuse the people of God. Let us therefore take heed that we give 
 him no cause of accusation against us; and that, when we have sinned, 
 we presently go in before the Lord, and accuse and condemn ourselves, 
 and commit our cause to Christ as our Advocate. 

 [2.] By his disappointment and defeat: he and all his accusations are 
 cast out, the indictments quashed, and the accuser turned out of the 
 court with just indignation.

 (3.) How the victory was gained. The servants of God overcame Satan, 
 
 [1.] <I>By the blood of the Lamb,</I> as the meritorious cause. Christ 
 by dying <I>destroyed him that hath the power of death, that is, the 
 devil.</I> 

 [2.] <I>By the word of their testimony,</I> as the great instrument of 
 war, <I>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,</I>--by a 
 resolute powerful preaching of the everlasting gospel, <I>which is 
 mighty, through God, to pull down strongholds,</I>--and by their 
 courage and patience in sufferings; <I>they loved not their lives unto 
 the death,</I> when the love of life stood in competition with their 
 loyalty to Christ; they loved not their lives so well but they could 
 give them up <I>to death,</I> could lay them down in Christ's cause; 
 their love to their own lives was overcome by stronger affections of 
 another nature; and this their courage and zeal helped to confound 
 their enemies, to convince many of the spectators, to confirm the souls 
 of the faithful, and so contributed greatly to this victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Therefore rejoice, <I>ye</I> heavens, and ye that dwell in them.
 Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil
 is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
 that he hath but a short time.
 &nbsp; 13  And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
 persecuted the woman which brought forth the man <I>child.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that
 she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is
 nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face
 of the serpent.
 &nbsp; 15  And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
 the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
 flood.
 &nbsp; 16  And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
 mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of
 his mouth.
 &nbsp; 17  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
 war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
 God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of this war, so happily finished in heaven, or 
 in the church, as it was again renewed and carried on in the 
 wilderness, the place to which the church had fled, and where she had 
 been for some time secured by the special care of her God and Saviour. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The warning given of the distress and calamity that should fall upon 
 the inhabitants of the world in general, through the wrath and rage of 
 the devil. For, though his malice is chiefly bent against the servants 
 of God, yet he is an enemy and hater of mankind as such; and, being 
 defeated in his designs against the church, he is resolved to give all 
 the disturbance he can to the world in general: <I>Woe to the 
 inhabitants of the earth, and the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The rage of Satan grows so much the greater as he is limited both in 
 place and time; when he was confined to the wilderness, and had but a 
 short time to reign there, he comes with the greater wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His second attempt upon the church now in the wilderness: <I>He 
 persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The care that God had taken of his church. He had conveyed her as on 
 eagles' wings, into a place of safety provided for her, where she was 
 to continue for a certain space of time, couched in prophetic 
 characters, taken from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25">Dan. vii. 25</A>.

 2. The continual malice of the dragon against the church. Her obscurity 
 could not altogether protect her; the old subtle serpent, which at 
 first lurked in paradise, now follows the church into the wilderness, 
 and <I>casts out a flood of water after her, to carry her away.</I> 
 This is thought to be meant of a flood of error and heresy, which was 
 breathed by Arius, Nestorius, Pelagius, and many more, by which the 
 church of God was in danger of being overwhelmed and carried away. The 
 church of God is in more danger from heretics than from persecutors; 
 and heresies are as certainly from the devil as open force and 
 violence. 

 3. The seasonable help provided for the church in this dangerous
 juncture: <I>The earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and 
 swallowed up the flood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Some think we are to understand the swarms of Goths and Vandals that 
 invaded the Roman empire, and found work for the Arian rulers, who 
 otherwise would have been as furious persecutors as the pagan had been, 
 and had exercised great cruelties already; but God opened a breach of 
 war, and the flood was in a manner swallowed up thereby, and the church 
 enjoyed some respite. God often sends the sword to avenge the quarrel 
 of his covenant; and, when men choose new gods, then there is danger of 
 war in the gates; intestine broils and contentions often end in the 
 invasions of a common enemy. 

 4. The devil, being thus defeated in his designs upon the universal 
 church, now turns his rage against particular persons and places; his 
 malice against the woman pushes him on to <I>make war with the remnant 
 of her seed.</I> Some think hereby are meant the Albigenses, who were 
 first by Dioclesian driven up into barren and mountainous places, and 
 afterwards cruelly murdered by popish rage and power, for several 
 generations; and for no other reason than because <I>they kept the 
 commandments of God</I> and <I>held the testimony of Jesus Christ.</I> 
 Their fidelity to God and Christ, in doctrine, worship, and practice, 
 was that which exposed them to the rage of Satan and his instruments; 
 and such fidelity will expose men still, less or more, to the end of 
 the world, when <I>the last enemy shall be destroyed.</I></P>
