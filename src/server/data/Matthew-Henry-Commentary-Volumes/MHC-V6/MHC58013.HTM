 The apostle, having treated largely of Christ, and faith, and free 
 grace, and gospel privileges, and warned the Hebrews against apostasy, 
 now, in the close of all, recommends several excellent duties to them, 
 as the proper fruits of faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>);

 he then bespeaks their prayers for him, and offers up his prayers to
 God for them, gives them some hope of seeing himself and Timothy, and
 ends with the general salutation and benediction,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Let brotherly love continue.
 &nbsp; 2  Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some
 have entertained angels unawares.
 &nbsp; 3  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; <I>and</I>
 them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the
 body.
 &nbsp; 4  Marriage <I>is</I> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
 whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>Let your</I> conversation <I>be</I> without covetousness; <I>and be</I>
 content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will
 never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
 &nbsp; 6  So that we may boldly say, The Lord <I>is</I> my helper, and I
 will not fear what man shall do unto me.
 &nbsp; 7  Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
 unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end
 of <I>their</I> conversation.
 &nbsp; 8  Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
 &nbsp; 9  Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For
 <I>it is</I> a good thing that the heart be established with grace;
 not with meats, which have not profited them that have been
 occupied therein.
 &nbsp; 10  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
 serve the tabernacle.
 &nbsp; 11  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
 the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the
 camp.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
 his own blood, suffered without the gate.
 &nbsp; 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
 his reproach.
 &nbsp; 14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to
 come.
 &nbsp; 15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
 continually, that is, the fruit of <I>our</I> lips giving thanks to
 his name.
 &nbsp; 16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
 sacrifices God is well pleased.
 &nbsp; 17  Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
 yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
 account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for
 that <I>is</I> unprofitable for you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The design of Christ in giving himself for us is that he may purchase 
 <I>to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</I> Now the 
 apostle calls the believing Hebrews to the performance of many 
 excellent duties, in which it becomes Christians to excel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To brotherly love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 by which he does not only mean a general affection to all men, as our 
 brethren by nature, all made of the same blood, nor that more limited 
 affection which is due to those who are of the same immediate parents, 
 but that special and spiritual affection which ought to exist among the 
 children of God. 

 1. It is here supposed that the Hebrews had this love one for another.
 Though, at this time, that nation was miserably divided and distracted 
 among themselves, both about matters of religion and the civil state, 
 yet there was true brotherly love left among those of them who believed 
 on Christ; and this appeared in a very eminent manner presently after 
 the shedding forth of the Holy Ghost, when they had all things common, 
 and sold their possessions to make a general fund of subsistence to 
 their brethren. The spirit of Christianity is a spirit of love. Faith 
 works by love. The true religion is the strongest bond of friendship; 
 if it be not so, it has its name for nothing. 

 2. This brotherly love was in danger of being lost, and that in a time
 of persecution, when it would be most necessary; it was in danger of 
 being lost by those disputes that were among them concerning the 
 respect they ought still to have to the ceremonies of the Mosaic law. 
 Disputes about religion too often produce a decay of Christian 
 affection; but this must be guarded against, and all proper means used 
 to preserve brotherly love. Christians should always love and live as
 brethren, and the more they grow in devout affection to God their 
 heavenly Father the more they will grow in love to one another for his 
 sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To hospitality: <I>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers for his 
 sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We must add to brotherly kindness charity. Here observe,

 1. The duty required--<I>to entertain strangers,</I> both those that
 are strangers to the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to our 
 persons, especially those who know themselves to be strangers here and 
 are seeking another country, which is the case of the people of God, 
 and was so at this time: the believing Jews were in a desperate and 
 distressed condition. But he seems to speak of strangers as such; 
 though we know not who they are, nor whence they come, yet, seeing they 
 are without any certain dwelling place, we should allow them room in 
 our hearts and in our houses, as we have opportunity and ability. 

 2. The motive: <I>Thereby some have entertained angels unawares;</I>
 so Abraham did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:1-32">Gen. xviii.</A>),

 and Lot

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:1-38">Gen. xix.</A>),

 and one of those that Abraham
 entertained was the Son of God; and, though we cannot suppose this will 
 ever be our case, yet what we do to strangers, in obedience to him, he 
 will reckon and reward as done to himself. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:35">Matt. xxv. 35</A>,

 <I>I was a stranger, and you took me in.</I> God has often bestowed
 honours and favours upon his hospitable servants, beyond all their 
 thoughts, <I>unawares.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To Christian sympathy: <I>Remember those that are in bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty--to <I>remember those that are in bonds</I> and in
 <I>adversity.</I> 

 (1.) God often orders it so that while some Christians and churches are 
 in adversity others enjoy peace and liberty. All are not called at the 
 same time to resist unto blood. 

 (2.) Those that are themselves at liberty must sympathize with those 
 that are in bonds and adversity, as if they were bound with them in the 
 same chain: they must fell the sufferings of their brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason of the duty: <I>As being yourselves in the body;</I> not 
 only in the body natural, and so liable to the like sufferings, and you 
 should sympathize with them now that others may sympathize with you 
 when your time of trial comes; but in the same mystical body, under the 
 same head, <I>and if one member suffer all the rest suffer with it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:26">1 Cor. xii. 26</A>.

 It would be unnatural in Christians not to bear each other's
 burdens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To purity and chastity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Here you have, 

 1. A recommendation of God's ordinance of marriage, that it <I>is 
 honourable in all,</I> and ought to be so esteemed by all, and not 
 denied to those to whom God has not denied it. It is honourable, for 
 God instituted it for man in paradise, knowing it was not good for him 
 to be alone. He married and blessed the first couple, the first parents 
 of mankind, to direct all to look unto God in that great concern, and 
 to marry in the Lord. Christ honoured marriage with his presence and
 first miracle. It is honourable as a means to prevent impurity and a 
 defiled bed. It is <I>honourable</I> and happy, when persons come 
 together pure and chaste, and preserve the marriage bed undefiled, not 
 only from unlawful but inordinate affections. 

 2. A dreadful but just censure of impurity and lewdness:
 <I>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</I>

 (1.) God knows who are guilty of such sins, no darkness can hide them 
 from him. 

 (2.) He will call such sins by their proper names, not by the names of 
 love and gallantry, but of whoredom and adultery, whoredom in the 
 single state and adultery in the married state. 

 (3.) He will bring them into judgment, he will judge them, either by 
 their own consciences here, and <I>set their sins in order before 
 them</I> for their deep humiliation (and conscience, when awakened, 
 will be very severe upon such sinners), or he will set them at his 
 tribunal at death, and in the last day; he will convict them, condemn 
 them, and cast them out for ever, if they die under the guilt of this 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. To Christian contentment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. The sin that is contrary to this grace and 
 duty--<I>covetousness,</I> an over eager desire of the wealth of this 
 world, envying those who have more than we. This sin we must allow no 
 place in our conversation; for, though it be a secret lust lurking in 
 the heart, if it be not subdued it will enter into our conversation, 
 and discover itself in our manner of speaking and acting. We must take 
 care not only to keep this sin down, but to root it out of our souls. 
 
 2. The duty and grace that is contrary to covetousness--being satisfied
 and pleased <I>with such things as we have;</I> present things, for 
 past things cannot be recalled, and future things are only in the hand 
 of God. What God gives us from day to day we must be content with, 
 though it fall short of what we have enjoyed heretofore, and though it 
 do not come up to our expectations for the future. We must be content 
 with our present lot. We must bring our minds to our present condition, 
 and this is the sure way to contentment; and those who cannot do it 
 would not be contented though God should raise their condition to their 
 minds, for the mind would rise with the condition. Haman was the great 
 court-favourite, and yet not contented--Ahab on the throne, and yet not 
 contented--Adam in paradise, and yet not contented; yea, the angels in 
 heaven, and yet not contented; but Paul, though abased and empty, had 
 <I>learned in</I> every <I>state, in</I> any <I>state, therewith to be 
 content.</I> 

 3. What reason Christians have to be contented with their lot.

 (1.) <I>God hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 This was said to Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 but belongs to all the faithful servants of God. Old-Testament promises
 may be applied to New-Testament saints. This promise contains the sum
 and substance of all the promises. <I>I will never,</I> no, <I>never 
 leave thee, nor</I> ever <I>forsake thee.</I> Here are no fewer than 
 five negatives heaped together, to confirm the promise; the true 
 believer shall have the gracious presence of God with him in life, at 
 death, and for ever. 

 (2.) From this comprehensive promise they may assure themselves of help 
 from God: <I>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper; I will 
 not fear what man shall do unto me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Men can do nothing against God, and God can make all that men do 
 against his people to turn to their good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. To the duty Christians owe to their ministers, and that both to 
 those that are dead and to those that are yet alive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To those that are dead: <I>Remember those that have had the rule 
 over you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The description given of them. They were such as had the rule over 
 them, and had spoken to them the word of God; their guides and 
 governors, who had spoken to them the word of God. Here is the dignity 
 to which they were advanced--to be rulers and leaders of the people, not
 according to their own will, but the will and word of God; and this 
 character they filled up with suitable duty: they did not rule at a 
 distance, and rule by others, but they ruled by personal presence and 
 instruction, according to the word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The duties owing to them, even when they were dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] "<I>Remember them</I>--their preaching, their praying, their
 private counsel, their example."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "<I>Follow</I> their <I>faith;</I> be stedfast in the profession 
 of the faith they preached to you, and labour after the grace of faith 
 by which they lived and died so well. <I>Consider the end of their 
 conversation,</I> how quickly, how comfortably, how joyfully, they 
 finished their course!" Now this duty of following the same true faith 
 in which they had been instructed the apostle enlarges much upon, and 
 presses them earnestly to it, not only from the remembrance of their 
 faithful deceased guides, but from several other motives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> From the immutability and eternity of the Lord Jesus 
 Christ. Though their ministers were some dead, others dying, yet the 
 great head and high priest of the church, <I>the bishop of their 
 souls,</I> ever lives, and is ever the same; and they should be 
 stedfast and immovable, in imitation of Christ, and should remember 
 that Christ ever lives to observe and reward their faithful adherence 
 to his truths, and to observe and punish their sinful departure from 
 him. Christ is the same in the Old-Testament day, in the gospel day, 
 and will be so to his people for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> From the nature and tendency of those erroneous 
 doctrines that they were in danger of falling in with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> They were divers and various 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 different from what they had received from their former faithful 
 teachers, and inconsistent with themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> They were strange doctrines: such as the gospel church was 
 unacquainted with foreign to the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> They were of an unsettling, distracting nature, like the wind 
 by which the ship is tossed, and in danger of being driven from its 
 anchor, carried away, and split upon the rocks. They were quite 
 contrary to that grace of God which fixes and establishes the heart, 
 which is an excellent thing. These strange doctrines keep the heart 
 always fluctuating and unsettled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>d.</I> They were mean and low as to their subject. They were about 
 external, little, perishing things, such as <I>meats and drinks,</I> 
 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>e.</I> They were unprofitable. Those who were most taken with them, 
 and employed about them, got no real good by them to their own souls. 
 They did not make them more holy, nor more humble, nor more thankful, 
 nor more heavenly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>f.</I> They would exclude those who embraced them from the 
 privileges of the Christian altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>We have an altar.</I> This is an argument of the great weight, and 
 therefore the apostle insists the longer upon it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) The Christian church has its altar. It was objected against 
 the primitive Christians that their assemblies were destitute of an 
 altar; but this was not true. <I>We have an alter,</I> not a material 
 altar, but a personal one, and that is Christ; he is both our altar, 
 and our sacrifice; he sanctifies the gift. The altars under the law 
 were types of Christ; the brazen altar of the sacrifice, the golden 
 altar of his intercession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) This altar furnishes out a feast for true believers, a 
 feast upon the sacrifice, a <I>feast of fat things,</I> spiritual 
 strength and growth, and holy delight and pleasure. The Lord's table is 
 not our altar, but it is furnished with provision from the altar. 
 <I>Christ our passover is sacrificed for us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1 Cor. v. 7</A>),

 and it follows, <I>therefore let us keep the feast.</I> The Lord's 
 supper is the feast of the gospel passover.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>c.</I>) Those who adhere to the tabernacle or the Levitical 
 dispensation, or return to it again, exclude themselves from the 
 privileges of this altar, from the benefits purchased by Christ. If 
 they serve the tabernacle, they are resolved to subject themselves to 
 antiquated rites and ceremonies, to renounce their right to the 
 Christian altar; and this part of the argument he first proves and then 
 improves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] He proves that this servile adherence to the Jewish state 
 is a bar to the privileges of the gospel altar; and he argues 
 thus:--Under the Jewish law, no part of the sin-offering was to be
 eaten, but all must be burnt without the camp while they dwelt in 
 tabernacles, and without the gates when they dwelt in cities: now, if 
 they will still be subject to that law, they cannot eat at the 
 gospel-altar; for that which is eaten there is furnished from Christ, 
 who is the great sin-offering. Not that it is the very sin-offering
 itself, as the papists affirm; for then it was not to be eaten, but 
 burnt; but the gospel feast is the fruit and procurement of the 
 sacrifice, which those have no right to who do not acknowledge the 
 sacrifice itself. And that it might appear that Christ was really the 
 antitype of the sin-offering, and, as such, might sanctify or cleanse 
 his people with his own blood, he conformed himself to the type, in 
 suffering without the gate. This was a striking specimen of his 
 humiliation, as if he had not been fit either for sacred or civil 
 society! And this shows how sin, which was the meritorious cause of the 
 sufferings of Christ, is a forfeiture of all sacred and civil rights, 
 and the sinner a common plague and nuisance to all society, if God 
 should be strict to mark iniquity. Having thus shown that adherence to 
 the Levitical law would, even according to its own rules, debar men 
 from the Christian altar, he proceeds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] To improve this argument 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>)

 in suitable advices.

 <I>First, Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp;</I> go
 forth from the ceremonial law, from sin, from the world, from 
 ourselves, our very bodies, when he calls us.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Let us be willing to <I>bear his reproach,</I> be 
 willing to be accounted the offscouring of all things, not worthy to 
 live, not worthy to die a common death. This was his reproach, and we 
 must submit to it; and we have the more reason because, whether we go 
 forth from this world to Christ or no, we must necessarily go forth in 
 a little time by death; for <I>here we have no continuing city.</I> 
 Sin, sinners, death, will not suffer us to continue long here; and 
 therefore we should go forth now by faith, and seek in Christ the rest 
 and settlement which this world cannot afford us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Let us make a right use of this altar; not only partake 
 of the privileges of it, but discharge the duties of the altar, as 
 those whom Christ has made priests to attend on this altar. Let us 
 bring our sacrifices to this altar, and to this our high priest, and 
 offer them up by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Now what are the sacrifices which we must bring and offer on this 
 altar, even Christ? Not any expiatory sacrifices; there is no need of 
 them. Christ has offered the great <I>sacrifice of atonement,</I> ours 
 are only the sacrifices of acknowledgment; and they are, 

 1. The sacrifice of praise to God, which we should offer up to God
 continually. In this are included all adoration and prayer, as well as 
 thanksgiving; this is <I>the fruit of our lips;</I> we must speak forth 
 the praises of God from unfeigned lips; and this must be offered only 
 to God, not to angels, nor saints, nor any creature, but to the name of 
 God alone; and it must be by Christ, in a dependence upon his 
 meritorious satisfaction and intercession. 

 2. The sacrifice of alms-deeds, and Christian charity: <I>To do good,
 and to communicate, forget now; for with such sacrifices God is well 
 pleased,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 We must, according to our power, <I>communicate</I> to the necessities 
 of the souls and bodies of men; not contenting ourselves to offer the 
 sacrifice of our lips, mere words, but the sacrifice of good deeds; and 
 these we must lay down upon this altar, not depending upon the merit of 
 our good deeds, but of our great high priest; and with such sacrifices 
 as these, adoration and alms thus offered up, God is well pleased; he 
 will accept the offering with pleasure, and will accept and bless the 
 offers through Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having thus told us the duty Christians owe to their deceased 
 ministers, which principally consists in following their faith and not 
 departing from it, the apostle tells us what is the duty that people 
 owe to their living ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)
 
 and the reasons of that duty:
 
 (1.) The duty--to obey them, and submit themselves to them. It is not an
 implicit obedience, or absolute submission, that is here required, but 
 only so far as is agreeable to the mind and will of God revealed in his 
 word; and yet it is truly obedience and submission, and that not only 
 to God, but to the authority of the ministerial office, which is of God 
 as certainly, in all things belonging to that office, as the authority 
 of parents or of civil magistrates in the things within their sphere. 
 Christians must submit to be instructed by their ministers, and not 
 think themselves too wise, too good, or too great, to learn from them; 
 and, when they find that ministerial instructions are agreeable to the 
 written word, they must obey them. 

 (2.) The motives to this duty. 

 [1.] They have the rule over the people; their office, though not 
 magisterial, yet is truly authoritative. They have no authority to lord 
 it over the people, but to lead them in the ways of God, by informing 
 and instructing them, explaining the word of God to them, and applying 
 it to their several cases. They are not to make laws of their own, but 
 to interpret the laws of God; nor is their interpretation to be 
 immediately received without examination, but the people must search 
 the scriptures, and so far as the instructions of their minister are 
 according to that rule they ought to receive them, <I>not as the word 
 of men, but, as they are indeed, the word of God, that works 
 effectually in those that believe.</I>

 [2.] They watch for the souls of the people, not to ensnare them, but 
 to save them; to gain them, not to themselves, but to Christ; to build 
 them up in knowledge, faith, and holiness. They are to watch against 
 every thing that may be hurtful to the souls of men, and to give them 
 warning of dangerous errors, of the devices of Satan, of approaching 
 judgments; they are to watch for all opportunities of helping the souls 
 of men forward in the way to heaven.

 [3.] They must give an account how they have discharged their duty, and 
 what has become of the souls committed to their trust, whether any have 
 been lost through their neglect, and whether any of them have been 
 brought in and built up under their ministry.

 [4.] They would be glad to give a good account of themselves and their 
 hearers. If they can then give in an account of their own fidelity and
 success, it will be a joyful day to them; those souls that have been 
 converted and confirmed under their ministry <I>will be their joy, and 
 their crown, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</I>

 [5.] If they give up their account with grief, it will be the people's 
 loss as well as theirs. It is the interest of hearers that the account 
 their ministers give of them may be with joy, and not with grief. If 
 faithful ministers be not successful, the grief will be theirs, but the 
 loss will be the people's. Faithful ministers have delivered their own 
 souls, but a fruitless and faithless people's blood and ruin will be 
 upon their own heads.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
 things willing to live honestly.
 &nbsp; 19  But I beseech <I>you</I> the rather to do this, that I may be
 restored to you the sooner.
 &nbsp; 20  Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
 Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood
 of the everlasting covenant,
 &nbsp; 21  Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working
 in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus
 Christ; to whom <I>be</I> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 &nbsp; 22  And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation:
 for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
 &nbsp; 23  Know ye that <I>our</I> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with
 whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
 &nbsp; 24  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the
 saints. They of Italy salute you.
 &nbsp; 25  Grace <I>be</I> with you all. Amen.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The apostle recommends himself, and his fellow-sufferers, to the 
 prayers of the Hebrew believers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Pray for us;</I> for me and Timothy" (mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 "and for all those of us who labour in the ministry of the gospel."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is one part of the duty which people owe to their ministers. 
 Ministers need the prayers of the people; and the more earnestly the 
 people pray for their ministers the more benefit they may expect to 
 reap from their ministry. They should pray that God would teach those 
 who are to teach them, that he would make them vigilant, and wise, and 
 zealous, and successful--that he would assist them in all their labours,
 support them under all their burdens, and strengthen them under all 
 their temptations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There are good reasons why people should pray for their ministers; 
 he mentions two:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>We trust we have a good conscience,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Many of the Jews had a bad opinion of Paul, because he, being a Hebrew
 of the Hebrews, had cast off the Levitical law and preached up Christ: 
 now he here modestly asserts his own integrity: <I>We trust we have a 
 good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. We trust!</I> 
 he might have said, <I>We know;</I> but he chose to speak in a humble 
 style, to teach us all not to be too confident of ourselves, but to 
 maintain a godly jealousy over our own hearts. "We trust we have a 
 <I>good conscience,</I> an enlightened and well-informed conscience, a 
 clean and pure conscience, a tender and faithful conscience, a 
 conscience testifying for us, not against us: a good conscience <I>in 
 all things,</I> in the duties both of the first and second table, 
 towards God and towards men, and especially in all things pertaining to 
 our ministry; we would act honestly and sincerely in all things." 
 Observe, 

 [1.] A good conscience has a respect to all God's commands and all our 
 duty.

 [2.] Those who have this good conscience, yet need the prayers of 
 others.

 [3.] Conscientious ministers are public blessings, and deserve the 
 prayers of the people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Another reason why he desires their prayers is that he hoped 
 thereby to be the sooner restored to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 intimating that he had been formerly among them,--that, now he was 
 absent from them, he had a great desire and real intention to come 
 again to them,--and that the best way to facilitate his return to them, 
 and to make it a mercy to him and them, was to make it a matter of 
 their prayer. When ministers come to a people as a return of prayer, 
 they come with greater satisfaction to themselves and success to the 
 people. We should fetch in all our mercies by prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He offers up his prayers to God for them, being willing to do for 
 them as he desired they should do for him: <I>Now the God of peace,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 In this excellent prayer observe, 

 1. The title given to God--<I>the God of peace,</I> who was found out a
 way for peace and reconciliation between himself and sinners, and who 
 loves peace on earth and especially in his churches. 

 2. The great work ascribed to him: <I>He hath brought again from the
 dead our Lord Jesus,</I> &c. Jesus raised himself by his own power;
 and yet the Father was concerned in it, attesting thereby that justice 
 was satisfied and the law fulfilled. He rose again for our 
 justification; and that divine power by which he was raised is able to 
 do every thing for us that we stand in need of. 

 3. The titles given to Christ--our Lord Jesus, our sovereign, our
 Saviour, and the great shepherd of the sheep, promised in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>,

 declared by himself to be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:14,15">John x. 14, 15</A>.

 Ministers are under-shepherds, Christ is the great shepherd. This
 denotes his interest in his people. They are the flock of his pasture,
 and his care and concern are for them. He feeds them, and leads them, 
 and watches over them.

 4. The way and method in which God is reconciled, and Christ raised
 from the dead: <I>Through the blood of the everlasting covenant.</I> 
 The blood of Christ satisfied divine justice, and so procured Christ's 
 release from the prison of the grace, as having paid our debt, 
 according to an eternal covenant or agreement between the Father and 
 the Son; and this blood is the sanction and seal of an everlasting 
 covenant between God and his people. 

 5. The mercy prayed for: <I>Make you perfect in every good work,</I>
 &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 (1.) The perfection of the saints in every good work is the great thing
 desired by them and for them, that they may here have a perfection of 
 integrity, a clear mind, a clean heart, lively affections, regular and 
 resolved wills, and suitable strength for every good work to which they 
 are called now, and at length a perfection of degrees to fit them for 
 the employment and felicity of heaven. 

 (2.) The way in which God makes his people perfect; it is by working in 
 them always what is pleasing in his sight, and that <I>through Jesus 
 Christ, to whom be glory for ever.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] There is no good thing wrought in us but it is the work of God; he 
 works in us, before we are fit for any good work.

 [2.] No good thing is wrought in us by God, but through Jesus Christ, 
 for his sake and by his Spirit. And therefore,

 [3.] Eternal glory is due to him, who is the cause of all the good 
 principles wrought in us and all the good works done by us. To this 
 every one should say, <I>Amen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives the Hebrews an account of Timothy's liberty and his hopes 
 of seeing them with him in a little time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It seems, Timothy had been a prisoner, doubtless for the gospel, but 
 now he was set at liberty. The imprisonment of faithful ministers is an 
 honour to them, and their enlargement is matter of joy to the people. 
 He was pleased with the hopes of not only seeing Timothy, but seeing 
 the Hebrews with him. Opportunities of writing to the churches of 
 Christ are desired by the faithful ministers of Christ, and pleasant to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Having given a brief account of this his letter, and begged their 
 attention to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 he closes with salutations, and a solemn, though short benediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The salutation. 

 (1.) From himself to them, directed to all their ministers who had rule 
 over them, and to all the saints; to them all, ministers and people. 
 
 (2.) From the Christians in Italy to them. It is a good thing to have 
 the law of holy love and kindness written in the hearts of Christians 
 one towards another. Religion teaches men the truest civility and 
 good-breeding. It is not a sour nor morose thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The solemn, though short benediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Grace be with you all. Amen.</I> Let the favour of God be towards 
 you, and his grace continually working in you, and with you, bringing 
 forth the fruits of holiness, as the first-fruits of glory. When the 
 people of God have been conversing together by word or writing, it is 
 good to part with prayer, desiring for each other the continuance of 
 the gracious presence of God, that they may meet together again in the 
 world of praise.</P>
