 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle directs them about the use of their 
 spiritual gifts, preferring those that are best and fitted to do the 
 greatest good. 

 I. He begins with advising them of all spiritual gifts to prefer
 prophesying, and shows that this is much better than speaking with 
 tongues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He goes on to show them how unprofitable the speaking of foreign
 languages is, and useless to the church; it is like piping in one tone, 
 like sounding a trumpet without any certain note, like talking 
 gibberish; whereas gifts should be used for the good of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:6-14">ver. 6-14</A>.

 III. He advises that worship should be celebrated so that the most
 ignorant might understand, and join in prayer and praise, and presses
 the advice by his own example, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>.

 IV. He informs them that tongues were a sign for unbelievers rather
 than those that believe; and represents the advantage of prophecy above 
 speaking with tongues, from the different suggestions they would give 
 to the mind of an unbeliever coming into their assemblies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:21-25">ver. 21-25</A>.
 
 V. He blames them for the disorder and confusion they had brought into
 the assembly, by their vanity and ostentation of their gifts; and 
 directs them in using the gifts both of tongues and prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:26-33">ver. 26-33</A>.

 VI. He forbids women speaking in the church; and closes this subject by 
 requiring them to perform every thing in the public worship with order 
 and decency, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:34-40">ver. 34, to the end</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Follow after charity, and desire spiritual <I>gifts,</I> but

 spirit he speaketh mysteries.

 &nbsp; 4  He that speaketh in an <I>unknown</I> tongue edifieth himself; but
 he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
 &nbsp; 5  I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye
 prophesied: for greater <I>is</I> he that prophesieth than he that
 speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may
 receive edifying.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, in the foregoing chapter, had himself preferred, and 
 advised the Corinthians to prefer, Christian charity to all spiritual 
 gifts. Here he teaches them, among spiritual gifts, which they should 
 prefer, and by what rules they should make comparison. He begins the 
 chapter,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With an exhortation to charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Follow after charity,</I> pursue it. The original, 
 <B><I>diokete,</I></B> when spoken of a thing, signifies a singular 
 concern to obtain it; and is commonly taken in a good and laudable 
 sense. It is an exhortation to obtain charity, to get this excellent 
 disposition of mind upon any terms, whatever pains or prayers it may 
 cost: as if he had said, "In whatever you fail, see you do not miss of 
 this; the principal of all graces is worth your getting at any 
 rate."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He directs them which spiritual gift to prefer, from a principle of 
 charity: "<I>Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may 
 prophesy,</I> or chiefly that you may prophesy." While they were in 
 close pursuit of charity, and made this Christian disposition their 
 chief scope, they might be zealous of spiritual gifts, be ambitious of 
 them in some measure, but especially of prophesying, that is, of 
 interpreting scripture. This preference would most plainly discover 
 that they were indeed upon such pursuit, that they had a due value for 
 Christian charity, and were intent upon it. Note, Gifts are fit objects 
 of our desire and pursuit, in subordination to grace and charity. That 
 should be sought first and with the greatest earnestness which is most 
 worth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He assigns the reasons of this preference. And it is remarkable 
 here that he only compares prophesying with speaking with tongues. It 
 seems, this was the gift on which the Corinthians principally valued 
 themselves. This was more ostentatious than the plain interpretation of 
 scripture, more fit to gratify pride, but less fit to pursue the 
 purposes of Christian charity; it would not equally edify nor do good 
 to the souls of men. For, 

 1. He that spoke with tongues must wholly speak between God and
 himself; for, whatever mysteries might be communicated in his language, 
 none of his own countrymen could understand them, because they did not 
 understand the language,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Note, What cannot be understood can never edify. No advantage can be 
 reaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in 
 unintelligible language, such as the audience can neither speak nor 
 understand: but he that prophesies speaks to the advantage of his 
 hearers; they may profit by his gift. Interpretation of scripture will 
 be for their edification; they may be exhorted and comforted by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And indeed these two must go together. Duty is the proper way to 
 comfort; and those that would be comforted must bear being exhorted. 

 2. He that speaks with tongues may edify himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He may understand and be affected with what he speaks; and so every 
 minister should; and he that is most edified himself is in the 
 disposition and fitness to do good to others by what he speaks; but he 
 that speaks with tongues, or language unknown, can only edify himself; 
 others can reap no benefit from his speech. Whereas the end of speaking 
 in the church is to edify the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 to which prophesying, or interpreting scripture by inspiration or 
 otherwise, is immediately adapted. Note, That is the best and most 
 eligible gift which best answers the purposes of charity and does most 
 good; not that which can edify ourselves only, but that which will 
 edify the church. Such is prophesying, or preaching, and interpreting 
 scripture, compared with speaking in an unknown tongue. 

 3. Indeed, no gift is to be despised, but the best gifts are to be
 preferred. <I>I could wish,</I> says the apostle, <I>that you all spoke 
 with tongues, but rather that you prophesied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Every gift of God is a favour from God, and may be improved for his 
 glory, and as such is to be valued and thankfully received; but then 
 those are to be most valued that are most useful. <I>Greater is he that 
 prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret, 
 that the church may receive edifying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Benevolence makes a man truly great. <I>It is more blessed to give than 
 to receive.</I> And it is true magnanimity to study and seek to be 
 useful to others, rather than to raise their admiration and draw their 
 esteem. Such a man has a large soul, copious and diffused in proportion 
 to his benevolence and bent of mind for public good. Greater is he who 
 interprets scripture to edify the church than he who speaks tongues to 
 recommend himself. And what other end he who spoke with tongues could 
 have, unless he interpreted what he spoke, is not easy to say, Note, 
 That makes most for the honour of a minister which is most for the 
 church's edification, not that which shows his gifts to most advantage. 
 He acts in a narrow sphere, while he aims at himself; but his spirit 
 and character increase in proportion to his usefulness, I mean his own 
 intention and endeavours to be useful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
 shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by
 revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
 &nbsp; 7  And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or
 harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it
 be known what is piped or harped?
 &nbsp; 8  For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare
 himself to the battle?
 &nbsp; 9  So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to
 be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
 speak into the air.
 &nbsp; 10  There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,
 and none of them <I>is</I> without signification.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
 unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh <I>shall
 be</I> a barbarian unto me.
 &nbsp; 12  Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual
 <I>gifts,</I> seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
 &nbsp; 13  Wherefore let him that speaketh in an <I>unknown</I> tongue pray
 that he may interpret.
 &nbsp; 14  For if I pray in an <I>unknown</I> tongue, my spirit prayeth, but
 my understanding is unfruitful.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this paragraph he goes on to show how vain a thing the ostentation 
 of speaking unknown and unintelligible language must be. It was 
 altogether unedifying and unprofitable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>If I come to you speaking with tongues, what will it profit you, 
 unless I speak to you by revelation, or by knowledge, or by 
 prophesying, or by doctrine?</I> It would signify nothing to utter any 
 of these in an unknown tongue. An apostle, with all his furniture, 
 could not edify, unless he spoke to the capacity of his hearers. New 
 revelations, the most clear explications of old ones, the most 
 instructive discourses in themselves, would be unprofitable in a 
 language not understood. Nay, interpretations of scripture made in an 
 unknown tongue would need to be interpreted over again, before they 
 could be of any use.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He illustrates this by several allusions. 

 1. To a pipe and a harp playing always in one tone. Of what use can
 this be to those who are dancing? If there be no distinction of sounds, 
 how should they order their steps or motions? Unintelligible language 
 is like piping or harping without distinction of sounds: it gives no 
 more direction how a man should order his conversation than a pipe with 
 but one stop or a harp with but one string can direct a dancer how he 
 should order his steps,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 2. To a trumpet giving an <I>uncertain sound,</I> <B><I>adelon 
 phonen,</I></B> a sound not manifest; either not the proper sound for 
 the purpose, or not distinct enough to be discerned from every other 
 sound. If, instead of sounding on onset, it sounded a retreat, or 
 sounded one knew not what, who would prepare for the battle? To talk in 
 an unknown language in a Christian assembly is altogether as vain and 
 to no purpose as for a trumpet to give no certain sound in the field or 
 day of battle. The army in one case, and the congregation in the other, 
 must be all in suspense, and at a perfect nonplus. To speak words that 
 have no significancy to those who hear them is to leave them ignorant 
 of what is spoken; it is speaking to the air, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Words without a meaning can convey no notion nor instruction to the 
 mind; and words not understood have no meaning with those who do not 
 understand them: to talk to them in such language is to waste our 
 breath. 

 3. He compares the speaking in an unknown tongue to the gibberish of
 barbarians. There are, as he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 many kinds of voices in the world, none of which is without its proper 
 signification. This is true of the several languages spoken by 
 different nations. All of them have their proper signification. Without 
 this they would be <B><I>phonai aphonoi</I></B>--<I>a voice, and no 
 voice.</I> For that is no language, nor can it answer the end of 
 speaking, which has no meaning. But whatever proper signification the 
 words of any language may have in themselves, and to those who 
 understand them, they are perfect gibberish to men of another language, 
 who understand them not. In this case, speaker and hearers are 
 barbarians to each other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 they talk and hear only sounds without sense; for this is to be a 
 barbarian. For thus says the polite Ovid, when banished into 
 Pontus,</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>Barbarus hic ego sum, quia non intelligor ulli,
 <BR>
 <BR>I am a barbarian here, none understand me.</TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To speak in the church in an unknown tongue is to talk gibberish; it is 
 to play the barbarian; it is to confound the audience, instead of 
 instructing them; and for this reason is utterly vain and 
 unprofitable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having thus established his point, in the two next verses he 
 applies, 

 1. By advising them to be chiefly desirous of those gifts that were
 most for the church's edification,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "Forasmuch as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, this way it will 
 become commendable zeal, be zealous to edify the church, to promote 
 Christian knowledge and practice, and covet those gifts most that will 
 do the best service to men's souls." This is the great rule he gives, 
 which, 

 2. He applies to the matter in hand, that, if they did speak a foreign
 language, they should beg of God the gift of interpreting it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 That these were different gifts, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:10"><I>ch.</I> xii. 10</A>.

 Those might speak and understand a foreign language who could not
 readily translate it into their own: and yet was this necessary to the 
 church's edification; for the church must understand, that it might be 
 edified, which yet it could not do till the foreign language was 
 translated into its own. Let him therefore pray for the gift of 
 interpreting what he speaks in an unknown tongue; or rather covet and 
 ask of God the gift of interpreting than of speaking in a language that 
 needs interpretation, this being most for the church's benefit, and 
 therefore among the gifts that excel; <I>vide</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Some understand it, "Let him pray so as to interpret what he utters in 
 prayer in a language unintelligible without it." The sum is that they 
 should perform all religious exercises in their assemblies so that all 
 might join in them and profit by them. 

 3. He enforces this advice with a proper reason, that, if <I>he prayed
 in an unknown tongue, his spirit might pray,</I> that is, a spiritual 
 gift might be exercised in prayer, or his own mind might be devoutly 
 engaged, <I>but his understanding would be unfruitful</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that is, the sense and meaning of his words would be unfruitful, he 
 would not be understood, nor therefore would others join with him in 
 his devotions. Note, It should be the concern of such as pray in public 
 to pray intelligibly, not in a foreign language, nor in a language 
 that, if it be not foreign, is above the level of his audience. 
 Language that is most obvious and easy to be understood is the most 
 proper for public devotion and other religious exercises.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will
 pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit,
 and I will sing with the understanding also.
 &nbsp; 16  Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he
 that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving
 of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
 &nbsp; 17  For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not
 edified.
 &nbsp; 18  I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
 &nbsp; 19  Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my
 understanding, that <I>by my voice</I> I might teach others also, than
 ten thousand words in an <I>unknown</I> tongue.
 &nbsp; 20  Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in
 malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here sums up the argument hitherto, and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Directs them how they should sing and pray in public 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with 
 the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit,</I> &c. He does 
 not forbid their praying or singing under a divine <I>afflatus,</I> or 
 when they were inspired for this purpose, or had such a spiritual gift 
 communicated to them; but he would have them perform both so as to be 
 understood by others, that others might join with them. Note, Public 
 worship should be performed so as to be understood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He enforces the argument with several reasons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That otherwise the unlearned could not say Amen to their prayers or 
 thanksgivings, could not join in the worship, for they did not 
 understand it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He who fills up or occupies the place of the unlearned, that is, as the 
 ancients interpret it, the body of the people, who, in most Christian 
 assemblies, are illiterate; how should they say <I>Amen</I> to prayers 
 in an unknown tongue? How should they declare their consent and 
 concurrence? This is saying <I>Amen,</I> So be it. <I>God grant the 
 thing we have requested;</I> or, We join in the confession that has 
 been made of sin, and in the acknowledgment that has been made of 
 divine mercies and favours. This is the import of saying <I>Amen.</I> 
 All should say <I>Amen</I> inwardly; and it is not improper to testify 
 this inward concurrence in public prayers and devotions, by an audible 
 <I>Amen.</I> The ancient Christians said <I>Amen</I> aloud. <I>Vide</I> 
 Just. Mart. <I>apol.</I> 2. <I>prop&egrave; fin.</I> Now, how should
 the people say <I>Amen</I> to what they did not understand? Note, There 
 can be no concurrence in those prayers that are not understood. The 
 intention of public devotions is therefore entirely destroyed if they 
 are performed in an unknown tongue. He who performs may pray well, and 
 give thanks well, but not in that time and place, because others are 
 not, cannot be, edified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)
 
 by what they understand not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He alleges his own example, to make the greater impression,
 concerning which observe, 

 (1.) That he did not come behind any of them in this spiritual gift: 
 "<I>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);
 
 not only more than any single person among you, but more than all 
 together." It was not envy at their better furniture that made Paul 
 depreciate what they so highly valued and so much vaunted of; he 
 surpassed them all in this very gift of tongues, and did not vilify 
 their gift because he had it not. This spirit of envy is too common in 
 the world. But the apostle took care to guard against this 
 misconstruction of his purpose, by letting them know there was more 
 ground for them to envy him upon this head than for him to envy them. 
 Note, When we beat down men's unreasonable value for themselves, or any 
 of their possessions or attainments, we should let them see, if 
 possible, that this does not proceed from an envious and grudging 
 spirit. We miss our aim if they can fairly give our conduct this 
 invidious turn. Paul could not be justly censured, nor suspected for 
 any such principle in this whole argument. He spoke more language than 
 they all. Yet, 

 (2.) He had rather <I>speak five words with understanding,</I> that is, 
 so as to be understood, and instruct and edify others, <I>than ten 
 thousand words in an unknown tongue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He was so far from valuing himself upon talking languages, or making 
 ostentation of his talents of this kind, that he had rather speak five 
 intelligible words, to benefit others, than make a thousand, ten 
 thousand fine discourses, that would do no one else any good, because 
 they did not understand them. Note, A truly Christian minister will 
 value himself much more upon doing the least spiritual good to men's 
 souls than upon procuring the greatest applause and commendation to 
 himself. This is true grandeur and nobleness of spirit; it is acting up 
 to his character; it is approving himself the servant of Christ, and 
 not a vassal to his own pride and vanity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He adds a plain intimation that the fondness then discovered for 
 this gift was but too plain an indication of the immaturity of their 
 judgment: <I>Brethren, be not children in understanding; in malice be 
 you children, but in understanding be men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Children are apt to be struck with novelty and strange appearances. 
 They are taken with an outward show, without enquiring into the true 
 nature and worth of things. Do not you act like them, and prefer noise 
 and show to worth and substance; show a greater ripeness of judgment, 
 and act a more manly part; be like children in nothing but an innocent 
 and inoffensive disposition. A double rebuke is couched in this 
 passage, both of their pride upon account of their gifts, and their 
 arrogance and haughtiness towards each other, and the contests and 
 quarrels proceeding from them. Note, Christians should be harmless and
 inoffensive as children, void of all guile and malice; but should have 
 wisdom and knowledge that are ripe and mature. They should not be 
 unskilful in the word of righteousness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:13">Heb. v. 13</A>),

 though they should be unskilful in all the arts of mischief.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle pursues the argument, and reasons from 
 other topics; as,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tongues, as the Corinthians used them, were rather a token of 
 judgment from God than mercy to any people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>In the law</I> (that is, the Old Testament) <I>it is written, With
 men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and 
 yet for all this they will not hear me, saith the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:11">Isa. xxviii. 11</A>.
 
 Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:46,49">Deut. xxviii. 46, 49</A>.

 To both these passages, it is thought, the apostle refers. Both are
 delivered by way of threatening, and one is supposed to interpret the 
 other. The meaning in this view is that it is an evidence that a people 
 are abandoned of God when he gives them up to this sort of instruction, 
 to the discipline of those who speak in another language. And surely 
 the apostle's discourse implies, "You should not be fond of the tokens 
 of divine displeasure. God can have no gracious regards to those who 
 are left merely to this sort of instruction, and taught in language 
 which they cannot understand. They can never be benefited by such 
 teaching as this; and, when they are left to it, it is a sad sign that 
 God gives them over as past cure." And should Christians covet to be in 
 such a state, or to bring the churches into it? Yet thus did the 
 Corinthian preachers in effect, who would always deliver their 
 inspirations in an unknown tongue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Tongues were rather a sign to unbelievers than to believers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 They were a spiritual gift, intended for the conviction and conversion 
 of infidels, that they might be brought into the Christian church; but 
 converts were to be built up in Christianity by profitable instructions 
 in their own language. The gift of tongues was necessary to spread 
 Christianity, and gather churches; it was proper and intended to 
 convince unbelievers of that doctrine which Christians had already 
 embraced; but prophesying, and interpreting scripture in their own 
 language, were most for the edification of such as did already believe: 
 so that speaking with tongues in Christians assemblies was altogether 
 out of time and place; neither one nor the other was proper for it.
 Note, That gifts may be rightly used, it is proper to know the ends 
 which they are intended to serve. To go about the conversion of 
 infidels, as the apostles did, had been a vain undertaking without the 
 gift of tongues, and the discovery of this gift; but, in an assembly of 
 Christians already converted to the Christian faith, to make use and 
 ostentation of this gift would be perfectly impertinent, because it 
 would be of no advantage to the assembly; not for conviction of truth, 
 because they had already embraced it; not for their edification, 
 because they did not understand, and could not get benefit without 
 understanding, what they heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The credit and reputation of their assemblies among unbelievers 
 required them to prefer prophesying before speaking with tongues. For, 
 
 1. If, when they were all assembled for Christian worship, their
 ministers, or all employed in public worship, should talk 
 unintelligible language, and infidels should drop in, they would 
 conclude them to be mad, to be no better than a parcel of wild 
 fanatics. Who in their right senses could carry on religious worship in 
 such a manner? Or what sort of religion is that which leaves out sense 
 and understanding? Would not this make Christianity ridiculous to a 
 heathen, to hear the ministers of it pray, or preach, or perform any 
 other religious exercise, in a language that neither he nor the 
 assembly understood? Note, The Christian religion is a sober and 
 reasonable thing in itself, and should not, by the ministers of it, be 
 made to look wild or senseless. Those disgrace their religion, and 
 vilify their own character, who do any thing that has this aspect. But, 
 on the other hand, 

 2. If, instead of speaking with tongues, those who minister plainly
 interpret scripture, or preach, in language intelligible and proper, 
 the great truths and rules of the gospel, a heathen or unlearned 
 person, coming in, will probably be convinced, and become a convert to 
 Christianity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>);

 his conscience will be touched, the secrets of his heart will be 
 revealed to him, he will be condemned by the truth he hears, and so 
 will be brought to confess his guilt, to pay his homage to God, and own 
 that he is indeed among you, present in the assembly. Note, 
 Scripture--truth, plainly and duly taught, has a marvellous aptness to 
 awaken the conscience, and touch the heart. And is not this much more 
 for the honour of our religion than that infidels should conclude the 
 ministers of it a set of madmen, and their religious exercises only 
 fits of frenzy? This last would at once cast contempt on them and their 
 religion too. Instead of procuring applause for them, it would render 
 them ridiculous, and involve their profession in the same censure: 
 whereas prophesying would certainly edify the church, much better keep 
 up their credit, and might probably convince and convert infidels who 
 might occasionally hear them. Note, Religious exercises in Christian 
 assemblies should be such as are fit to edify the faithful, and 
 convince, affect, and convert unbelievers. The ministry was not
 instituted to make ostentation of gifts and parts, but to save 
 souls.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle reproves them for their disorder, and 
 endeavours to correct and regulate their conduct for the future.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He blames them for the confusion they introduced into the assembly, 
 by ostentation of their gifts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>When you come together every one hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath 
 a tongue,</I> &c.; that is, "You are apt to confound the several parts 
 of worship; and, while one has a psalm to utter by inspiration, another 
 has a doctrine, or revelation;" or else, "You are apt to be confused in 
 the same branch of worship, many of you having psalms or doctrines to 
 propose at the same time, without staying for one another. Is not this 
 perfect uproar? Can this be edifying? And yet all religious exercises 
 in public assemblies should have this view, <I>Let all things be done 
 to edifying.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He corrects their faults, and lays down some regulations for their 
 future conduct. 

 1. As to speaking in an unknown tongue, he orders that no more than two
 or three should do it at one meeting, and this not altogether, but 
 successively, one after another. And even this was not to be done 
 unless there were some one to interpret

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 some other interpreter besides himself, who spoke; for to speak in an 
 unknown tongue what he himself was afterwards to interpret could only 
 be for ostentation. But, if another were present who could interpret, 
 two miraculous gifts might be exercised at once, and thereby the church 
 edified, and the faith of the hearers confirmed at the same time. But, 
 if there were none to interpret, he was to be silent in the church, and 
 only exercise his gift between God and himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 that is (as I think) in private, at home; for all who are present at
 public worship should join in it, and not be at their private devotions 
 in public assemblies. Solitary devotions are out of time and place when 
 the church has met for social worship. 
 
 2. As to prophesying he orders,
 
 (1.) That two or three only should speak at one meeting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and this successively, not all at once; and that the other should 
 examine and judge what he delivered, that is, discern and determine 
 concerning it, whether it were of divine inspiration or not. There 
 might be false prophets, mere pretenders to divine inspiration; and the 
 true prophets were to judge of these, and discern and discover who was 
 divinely inspired, and by such inspiration interpreted scripture, and 
 taught the church, and who was not--what was of divine inspiration and 
 what was not. This seems to be the meaning of this rule. For where a 
 prophet was known to be such, and under the divine <I>afflatus,</I> he 
 could not be judged; for this were to subject even the Holy Spirit to 
 the judgment of men. He who was indeed inspired, and known to be so, 
 was above all human judgment. 

 (2.) He orders that, if any assistant prophet had a revelation, while 
 another was prophesying, the other should hold his peace, be silent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 before the inspired assistant uttered his revelation. Indeed, it is by 
 many understood that the former speaker should immediately hold his 
 peace. But this seems unnatural, and not so well to agree with the 
 context. For why must one that was speaking by inspiration be 
 immediately silent upon another man's being inspired, and suppress what 
 was dictated to him by the same Spirit? Indeed, he who had the new 
 revelation might claim liberty of speech in his turn, upon producing 
 his vouchers; but why must liberty of speech be taken from him who was 
 speaking before, and his mouth stopped, when he was delivering the 
 dictates of the same Spirit, and could produce the same vouchers? Would 
 the Spirit of God move one to speak, and, before he had delivered what 
 he had to say, move another to interrupt him, and put him to silence?
 This seems to me an unnatural thought. Nor is it more agreeable to the 
 context, and the reason annexed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>That all might prophesy, one by one,</I> or one after another, which 
 could not be where any one was interrupted and silenced before he had 
 done prophesying; but might easily be if he who was afterwards inspired 
 forbore to deliver his new revelation till the former prophet had 
 finished what he had to say. And, to confirm this sense, the apostle
 quickly adds, <I>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the 
 prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 that is, the spiritual gifts they have leave them still possessed of 
 their reason, and capable of using their own judgment in the exercise 
 of them. Divine inspirations are not, like the diabolical possessions 
 of heathen priests, violent and ungovernable, and prompting them to act 
 as if they were beside themselves; but are sober and calm, and capable 
 of regular conduct. The man inspired by the Spirit of God may still act 
 the man, and observe the rules of natural order and decency in 
 delivering his revelations. His spiritual gift is thus far subject to
 his pleasure, and to be managed by his discretion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle gives the reasons of these regulations. As, 

 1. That they would be for the church's benefit, their instruction and
 consolation. It is that <I>all may learn, and all may be comforted or 
 exhorted,</I> that the prophets were to speak in the orderly manner the 
 apostle advises. Note, The instruction, edification, and comfort of the 
 church, is that for which God instituted the ministry. And surely 
 ministers should, as much as possible, fit their ministrations to these 
 purposes. 

 2. He tells them, <I>God is not the God of confusion, but of peace and
 good order,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Therefore divine inspiration should by no means throw Christian 
 assemblies into confusion, and break through all rules of common 
 decency, which yet would be unavoidable if several inspired men should 
 all at once utter what was suggested to them by the Spirit of God, and 
 not wait to take their turns. Note, The honour of God requires that 
 things should be managed in Christian assemblies so as not to 
 transgress the rules of natural decency. If they are managed in a 
 tumultuous and confused manner, what a notion must this give of the God 
 who is worshipped, to considerate observers! Does it look as if he were 
 the God of peace and order, and an enemy to confusion? Things should be 
 managed so in divine worship that no unlovely nor dishonourable notion 
 of God should be formed in the minds of observers.

 3. He adds that things were thus orderly managed in all the other
 churches: <I>As in all the churches of the saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 they kept to these rules in the exercise of their spiritual gifts, 
 which was a manifest proof that the church of Corinth might observe the 
 same regulations. And it would be perfectly scandalous for them, who 
 exceeded most churches in spiritual gifts, to be more disorderly than 
 any in the exercise of them. Note, Though other churches are not to be 
 our rule, yet the regard they pay to the rules of natural decency and 
 order should restrain us from breaking these rules. Thus far they may 
 be proposed as examples, and it is a shame not to follow them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
 permitted unto them to speak; but <I>they are commanded</I> to be
 under obedience, as also saith the law.
 &nbsp; 35  And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their
 husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the
 church.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle, 

 1. Enjoins silence on their women in public assemblies, and to such a
 degree that they must not ask questions for their own information in 
 the church, but ask their husbands at home. <I>They are to learn in
 silence with all subjection; but,</I> says the apostle, <I>I suffer 
 them not to teach,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:11,12">1 Tim. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 There is indeed an intimation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:5"><I>ch.</I> xi. 5</A>)

 as if the women sometimes did pray and prophecy in their assemblies,
 which the apostle, in that passage, does not simply condemn, but the 
 manner of performance, that is, praying or prophesying with the head 
 uncovered, which, in that age and country, was throwing off the 
 distinction of sexes, and setting themselves on a level with the men. 
 But here he seems to forbid all public performances of theirs. They are 
 not permitted to speak 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 in the church, neither in praying nor prophesying. The connection seems 
 plainly to include the latter, in the limited sense in which it is 
 taken in this chapter, namely, for preaching, or interpreting scripture 
 by inspiration. And, indeed, for a woman to prophesy in this sense were 
 to teach, which does not so well befit her state of subjection. A 
 teacher of others has in that respect a superiority over them, which is 
 not allowed the woman over the man, nor must she therefore be allowed 
 to teach in a congregation: <I>I suffer them not to teach.</I> But 
 praying, and uttering hymns inspired, were not teaching. And seeing 
 there were women who had spiritual gifts of this sort in that age of 
 the church (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:9">Acts xxii. 9</A>),

 and might be under this impulse in the assembly, must they altogether 
 suppress it? Or why should they have this gift, if it must never be
 publicly exercised? For these reasons, some think that these general 
 prohibitions are only to be understood in common cases; but that upon 
 extraordinary occasions, when women were under a divine 
 <I>afflatus,</I> and known to be so, they might have liberty of speech.
 They were not ordinarily to teach, nor so much as to debate and ask 
 questions in the church, but learn in silence there; and, if 
 difficulties occurred, <I>ask their own husbands at home.</I> Note, As 
 it is the woman's duty to learn in subjection, it is the man's duty to 
 keep up his superiority, by being able to instruct her; if it be her 
 duty to ask her husband at home, it is his concern and duty to 
 endeavour at lest to be able to answer her enquiries; if it be a shame 
 for her to speak in the church, where she should be silent, it is a 
 shame for him to be silent when he should speak, and not be able to 
 give an answer, when she asks him at home. 

 2. We have here the reason of this injunction: It is God's law and
 commandment that they should be under obedience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 they are placed in subordination to the man, and it is a shame for them 
 to do any thing that looks like an affectation of changing ranks, which 
 speaking in public seemed to imply, at least in that age, and among 
 that people, as would public teaching much more: so that the apostle 
 concludes it was a shame for women to speak in the church, in the 
 assembly. Shame is the mind's uneasy reflection on having done an 
 indecent thing. And what more indecent than for a woman to quit her 
 rank, renounce the subordination of her sex, or do what in common 
 account had such aspect and appearance? Note, Our spirit and conduct 
 should be suitable to our rank. The natural distinctions God has made, 
 we should observe. Those he has placed in subjection to others should 
 not set themselves on a level, nor affect or assume superiority. The 
 woman was made subject to the man, and she should keep her station and 
 be content with it. For this reason women must be silent in the 
 churches, not set up for teachers; for this is setting up for 
 superiority over the man.</P>

 &nbsp; 40  Let all things be done decently and in order.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle closes his argument, 

 1. With a just rebuke of the Corinthians for their extravagant pride
 and self-conceit: they so managed with their spiritual gifts as no 
 church did like them; they behaved in a manner by themselves, and would 
 not easily endure control nor regulation. Now, says the apostle, to 
 beat down this arrogant humour, "<I>Came the gospel out from you? Or 
 came it to you only?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Did Christianity come our of Corinth? was its original among you? Or, 
 if not, is it now limited and confined to you? are you the only church 
 favoured with divine revelations, that you will depart from the decent 
 usages of all other churches, and, to make ostentation of your 
 spiritual gifts, bring confusion into Christian assemblies? How 
 intolerably assuming is this behaviour! Pray bethink yourselves." When 
 it was needful or proper the apostle could rebuke with all authority; 
 and surely his rebukes, if ever, were proper here. Note, Those must be 
 reproved and humbled whose spiritual pride and self-conceit throw 
 Christian churches and assemblies into confusion, though such men will 
 hardly bear even the rebukes of an apostle. 

 2. He lets them know that what he said to them was the command of God;
 nor durst any true prophet, any one really inspired, deny it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 "<I>If any man think himself a prophet, or spiritual, let him 
 acknowledge,</I> &c., nay, let him be tried by this very rule. If he 
 will not own what I deliver on this head to be the will of Christ, he 
 himself never had the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ can never 
 contradict itself; if it speak in me, and in them, it must speak the 
 same things in both. If their revelations contradict mine, they do not 
 come from the same Spirit; either I or they must be false prophets. 
 <I>By this therefore you may know them.</I> If they say that my 
 directions in this matter are no divine commandments, you may depend 
 upon it they are not divinely inspired. But if any continue after all, 
 through prejudice or obstinacy, uncertain or ignorant whether they or I 
 speak by the Spirit of God, they must be left under the power of this 
 ignorance. If their pretences to inspiration can stand in competition 
 with the apostolical character and powers which I have, I have lost all 
 my authority and influence; and the persons who allow of this 
 competition against me are out of the reach of conviction, and must be 
 left to themselves." Note, It is just with God to leave those to the 
 blindness of their own minds who wilfully shut out the light. Those who 
 would be ignorant in so plain a case were justly left under the power 
 of their mistake. 
 
 3. He sums up all in two general advices:--

 (1.) That though they should not despise the gift of tongues, nor
 altogether disuse it, under the regulations mentioned, yet they should 
 prefer prophesying. This is indeed the scope of the whole argument. It 
 was to be preferred to the other, because it was the more useful gift. 
 
 (2.) He charges them to let all things be done decently and in order 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 that is, that they should avoid every thing that was manifestly 
 indecent and disorderly. Not that they should hence take occasion to 
 bring into the Christian church and worship any thing that a vain mind 
 might think ornamental to it, or that would help to set it off. Such 
 indecencies and disorders as he had remarked upon were especially to be 
 shunned. They must do nothing that was manifestly childish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 or that would give occasion to say they were mad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 nor must they act so as to breed confusion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 This would be utterly indecent; it would make a tumult and mob of a 
 Christian assembly. But they were to do things in order; they were to 
 speak one after another, and not all at once; take their turns, and not 
 interrupt one another. To do otherwise was to destroy the end of a
 Christians ministry, and all assemblies for Christian worship. Note, 
 Manifest indecencies and disorders are to be carefully kept out of all 
 Christian churches, and every part of divine worship. They should have 
 nothing in them that is childish, absurd, ridiculous, wild, or 
 tumultuous; but all parts of divine worship should be carried on in a 
 manly, grave, rational, composed, and orderly manner. God is not to be
