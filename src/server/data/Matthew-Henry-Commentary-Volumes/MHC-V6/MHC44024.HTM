 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left Paul a prisoner at C&aelig;sarea, in Herod's judgment-hall,
 expecting his trial to come on quickly; for in the beginning of his 
 imprisonment his affairs moved very quickly, but afterwards very 
 slowly. In this chapter we have his arraignment and trial before Felix 
 the governor at C&aelig;sarea; here is, 

 I. The appearing of the prosecutors against him, and the setting of the
 prisoner to the bar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The opening of the indictment against him by Tertullus, who was of
 counsel for the prosecutors, and the aggravating of the charge, with 
 abundance of compliments to the judge, and malice to the prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>.

 III. The corroborating of the charge by the testimony of the witnesses,
 or rather the prosecutors themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:9">ver. 9</A>.

 IV. The prisoner's defence, in which, with all due deference to the
 governor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:10">ver. 10</A>),
 
 he denies the charge, and challenges them to prove it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>),
 
 owns the truth, and makes an unexceptionable profession of
 his faith, which he declares was it that they hated him for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>),

 and gives a more particular account of what had passed from their first 
 seizing him, challenging them to specify any ill they had found in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:17-21">ver. 17-21</A>.

 V. The adjourning of the cause, and the continuing of the prisoner in
 custody, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 VI. The private conversation that was between the prisoner and the
 judge, by which the prisoner hoped to do good to the judge and the 
 judge thought to get money by the prisoner, but both in vain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:24-26">ver. 24-26</A>.

 VII. The lengthening out of Paul's imprisonment for two years, till
 another governor came 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:27">ver. 27</A>),

 where he seems as much neglected as there had been ado about him.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with
 the elders, and <I>with</I> a certain orator <I>named</I> Tertullus, who
 informed the governor against Paul.
 &nbsp; 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse
 <I>him,</I> saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and
 that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy
 providence,
 &nbsp; 3 We accept <I>it</I> always, and in all places, most noble Felix,
 with all thankfulness.
 &nbsp; 4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I
 pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
 &nbsp; 5 For we have found this man <I>a</I> pestilent <I>fellow,</I> and a
 mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a
 ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
 &nbsp; 6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
 and would have judged according to our law.
 &nbsp; 7 But the chief captain Lysias came <I>upon us,</I> and with great
 violence took <I>him</I> away out of our hands,
 &nbsp; 8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of
 whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof
 we accuse him.
 &nbsp; 9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must suppose <I>that Lysias, the chief captain,</I> when he had 
 <I>sent away Paul to C&aelig;sarea,</I> gave notice to the chief priests,
 and others that had appeared against Paul, that if they had any thing
 to accuse him of they must follow him to C&aelig;sarea, and there they would
 find him, and a judge ready to hear them-thinking, perhaps, they would
 not have given themselves so much trouble; but what will not malice 
 do?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the cause followed against Paul, and it is vigorously 
 carried on. 

 1. Here is no time lost, for they are ready for a hearing <I>after five
 days;</I> all other business is laid aside immediately, to prosecute 
 Paul; so intent are evil men to do evil! Some reckon <I>these five
 days</I> from Paul's being first seized, and with most probability, for 
 he says here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 <I>that it was but twelve days since he came up to Jerusalem,</I> and 
 he had <I>spent seven in his purifying the temple,</I> so that these 
 five must be reckoned from the last of those. 

 2. Those who had been his judges do themselves appear here as his
 prosecutors. <I>Ananias</I> himself <I>the high priest,</I> who had sat 
 to judge him, now stands to inform against him. One would wonder,

 (1.) That he should thus disparage himself, and forget the dignity of 
 his place. She <I>the high priest</I> turn informer, and leave all his 
 business in <I>the temple at Jerusalem,</I> to go to be called as a 
 prosecutor in <I>Herod's judgment-hall?</I> Justly did God make <I>the 
 priests contemptible and base,</I> when they made themselves so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>.

 (2.) That he should thus discover himself and his enmity against Paul!.
 If men of the first rank have a malice against any, they think it 
 policy to employ others against them, and to play least in sight 
 themselves, because of the odium that commonly attends it; but Ananias 
 is not shamed to own himself a sworn enemy to Paul. <I>The elders</I> 
 attended him, to signify their concurrence with him, and to invigorate 
 the prosecution; for they could not find any attorneys or solicitors 
 that would follow it with so much violence as they desired. The pains 
 that evil men take in an evil matter, their contrivances, their 
 condescensions, and their unwearied industry, should shame us out of 
 our coldness and backwardness, and out indifference in that which is 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the cause pleaded against Paul. The prosecutors 
 brought <I>with them a certain orator named Tertullus,</I> a Roman, 
 skilled in the Roman law and language, and therefore fittest to be 
 employed in a cause before <I>the Roman governor,</I> and most likely 
 to gain favour. The high priest, and elders, though they had their own 
 hearts spiteful enough, did not think their own tongues sharp enough, 
 and therefore retained Tertullus, who probably was noted for a 
 satirical wit, to be of counsel for them; and, no doubt, they gave him 
 a good fee, probably out of the treasury of the temple, which they had 
 the command of, it being a cause wherein the church was concerned and 
 which therefore must not be starved. Paul is set to the bar before 
 Felix the governor: <I>He was called forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Tertullus's business is, on the behalf of the prosecutors, to open the 
 information against him, and he is a man that will say any thing for 
 his fee; mercenary tongues will do so. No cause so unjust but can find 
 advocates to plead it; and yet we hope many advocates are so just as 
 not knowingly to patronise an unrighteous cause, but Tertullus was none 
 of these: his speech (or at least an abstract of it, for it appears, by 
 Tully's orations, that the Roman lawyers, on such occasions, used to 
 make long harangues) is here reported, and it is made up of flattery 
 and falsehood; it calls evil good, and good evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One of the worst of men is here applauded as one of the best of 
 benefactors, only because he was the judge. Felix is represented by the 
 historians of his own nation, as well as by Josephus the Jew, as a very 
 bad man, who, depending upon his interest in the court, allowed himself 
 in all manner of wickedness, was a great oppressor, very cruel, and 
 very covetous, patronising and protecting assassins.--Joseph.
 <I>Antiq.</I> 20. 162-165. And yet Tertullus here, in the name of the
 high priest and elders, and probably by particular directions from them 
 and according to the instructions of his breviate, compliments him, and 
 extols him to the sky, as if he were so good a magistrate as never was 
 the like: and this comes the worse from the high priest and the elders, 
 because he had given a late instance of his enmity to their order; for 
 Jonathan the high priest, or one of the chief priests, having offended 
 him by too free an invective against the tyranny of his government, he 
 had him murdered by some villains whom he hired for that purpose who 
 afterwards did the like for others, as they were hired: <I>Cujus 
 facinoris quia nemo ultor extitit, invitati hac licentia sicarii multos 
 confodiebant, alios propter privatas inimicitias, alios conducti 
 pecunia, etiam in ipso templo--No one being found to punish such enormous
 wickedness, the assassins, encouraged by this impunity, stabbed several 
 persons, some from personal malice, some for hire, and that even in the 
 temple itself.</I> An yet, to engage him to gratify their malice 
 against Paul, and to return them that kindness for their kindness in 
 overlooking all this, they magnify him as the greatest blessing to 
 their church and nation that ever came among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They are very ready to own it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>By thee we,</I> of the church, <I>enjoy great quietness,</I> and we 
 look upon thee as our patron and protector, <I>and very worthy deeds 
 are done,</I> from time to time, <I>to the whole nation of the Jews, by 
 thy providence</I>--thy wisdom, and care, and vigilance." To give him 
 his due, he had been instrumental to suppress the insurrection of that 
 Egyptian of whom the chief captain spoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:38"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 38</A>);

 but will the praise of that screen him from the just reproach of his
 tyranny and oppression afterwards? See here, 

 [1.] The unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is, to 
 have their services magnified beyond measure, and never to be 
 faithfully told of their faults; and hereby they are hardened and 
 encouraged in evil. 

 [2.] The policy of bad men, by flattering princes in what they do amiss 
 to draw them in to do worse. The bishops of Rome got themselves 
 confirmed in their exorbitant church power, and have been assisted in 
 persecuting the servants of Christ, by flattering and caressing 
 usurpers and tyrants, and so making them the tools of their malice, as 
 the high priest, by his compliments, designed to make Felix here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They promise to retain a grateful sense of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>We accept it always, and in all places,</I> every where and at all 
 times we embrace it, we admire it, <I>most noble Felix, with all 
 thankfulness.</I> We will be ready, upon any occasion, to witness for 
 thee, that thou art a wise and good governor, and very serviceable to 
 the country." And, if it had been true that he was such a governor, it 
 had been just that they should thus accept his good offices with all 
 thankfulness. The benefits which we enjoy by government, especially by 
 the administration of wise and good governors, are what we ought to be 
 thankful for, both to God and man. This is part of the honour due to 
 magistrates, to acknowledge the quietness we enjoy under their 
 protection, and the worthy deeds done by their prudence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They therefore expect his favour in this cause, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They pretend a great care not to intrench upon his time: We will <I>not 
 be further tedious to thee;</I> and yet to be very confident of his 
 patience: <I>I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a 
 few words.</I> All this address is only <I>ad captandam benefolentiam--to
 induce him to give countenance to their cause;</I> and they were so 
 conscious to themselves that it would soon appear to have more malice 
 than matter in it that they found it necessary thus to insinuate 
 themselves into his favour. Every body knew that the high priest and 
 the elders were enemies to the Roman government, and were uneasy under 
 all the marks of that yoke, and therefore, in their hearts, hated 
 Felix; and yet, to gain their ends against Paul, they, by their 
 counsel, show him all this respect, as they did to Pilate and 
 C&aelig;sar when they were persecuting our Saviour. Princes cannot 
 always judge of the affections of their people by their applauses; 
 flattery is one thing, and true loyalty is another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. One of the best of men is here accused as one of the worst of 
 malefactors, only because he was the prisoner. After a flourish of 
 flattery, in which you cannot see matter for words, he comes to his 
 business, and it is to inform his excellency concerning the prisoner at 
 the bar; and this part of his discourse is as nauseous for its raillery 
 as the former part is for its flattery. I pity the man, and believe he 
 has no malice against Paul, nor does he think as he speaks in 
 calumniating him, any more than he did in courting Felix; but, a I 
 cannot but be sorry that a man of wit and sense should have such a 
 saleable tongue (as one calls it), so I cannot but be angry at those 
 dignified men that had such malicious hearts as to put such words into 
 his mouth. Two things Tertullus here complains of to Felix, in the
 name of the high priest and the elders:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the peace of the nation was disturbed by Paul. They could not 
 have baited Christ's disciples if they had not first dressed them up in 
 the skins of wild beasts, nor have given them as they did the vilest of 
 treatment if they had not first represented them as the vilest of men, 
 though the characters they gave of them were absolutely false and there 
 was not the least colour nor foundation for them. Innocence, may 
 excellence and usefulness, are no fence against calumny, no, nor 
 against the impressions of calumny upon the minds both of magistrates 
 and multitudes to excite their fury and jealousy; for, be the 
 representation ever so unjust, when it is enforced, as here it was, 
 with gravity and pretence of sanctity, and with assurance and noise, 
 something will stick. The old charge against God's prophets was that 
 they were the troublers of the land, and against God's Jerusalem that 
 it was a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:15,19">Ezra iv. 15, 19</A>),

 and against our Lord Jesus that he perverted the nation, and forbade to 
 give tribute to C&aelig;sar. It is the very same against Paul here; 
 and, though utterly false, is averred with all the confidence 
 imaginable. They do not say, "We suspect him to be a dangerous man, and 
 have taken him up upon that suspicion;" but, as if the thing were past 
 dispute, "<I>We have found him</I> to be so; we have often and long 
 found him so;" as if he were a traitor and rebel already convicted. And 
 yet, after all, there is not a word of truth in this representation; 
 but, if Paul's just character be enquired into, it will be found 
 directly the reverse of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Paul was a useful man, and a great blessing to his country, a man 
 of exemplary candour and goodness, blessing to all, and provoking to 
 none; and yet he is here called <I>a pestilent fellow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "<I>We have found him,</I> <B><I>loimon</I></B>--<I>pestem--the plague</I>
 of the nation, a walking pestilence, which supposes him to be a man of 
 a turbulent spirit, malicious and ill-natured, and one that threw all 
 things in disorder wherever he came." They would have it thought that 
 he had dome a more mischief in his time than a plague could do,--that
 the mischief he did was spreading and infectious, and that he made 
 others as mischievous as himself,--that it was of as fatal consequence
 as the plague is, killing and destroying, and laying all waste,--that it
 was as much to be dreaded and guarded against as a plague is. Many a 
 good sermon he had preached, and many a good work he had done, and for 
 these he is called a pestilent fellow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Paul was a peace-maker, was a preacher of that gospel which has a 
 direct tendency to <I>slay all enmities,</I> and to establish true and 
 lasting peace; he lived peaceably and quietly himself, and taught 
 others to do so too, and yet is here represented as <I>a mover of 
 sedition among all the Jews throughout all the world.</I> The Jews were 
 disaffected to the Roman government; those of them that were most 
 bigoted were the most so. This Felix knew, and had therefore a watchful 
 eye upon them. Now they would fain make him believe that this Paul was 
 the man that made them so, whereas they themselves were the men that 
 sowed the seeds of faction and sedition among them: and they knew it; 
 and the reason why they hated Christ and his religion was because he 
 did not go about to head them in a opposition to the Romans. The Jews 
 were every where much set against Paul, and stirred up the people to 
 clamour against him; they moved sedition in all places where he came, 
 and then cast the blame unjustly upon him as if he had been the mover 
 of the sedition; as Nero not long after set Rome on fire, and then said 
 the Christians did it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Paul was a man of catholic charity, who did not affect to be 
 singular, but made himself the servant of all for their good; and yet 
 he is here charged as being a <I>ringleader of the sect of the 
 Nazarenes,</I> a standard-bearer of that sect, so the word signifies. 
 When Cyprian was condemned to die for being a Christian, this was 
 inserted in hi sentence, that he was <I>auctor iniqui nominis et 
 signifer--The author and standard-bearer of a wicked cause.</I> Now it was
 true that Paul was an active leading man in propagating Christianity. 
 But, <I>First,</I> It was utterly false that this was a sect; he did 
 not draw people to a party or private opinion, nor did he make his own 
 opinions their rule. True Christianity establishes that which is of 
 common concern to all mankind, publishes good-will to men, and shows us 
 God in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and therefore cannot be 
 thought to take its rise from such narrow opinions and private 
 interests as sects owe their origin to. True Christianity has a direct 
 tendency to the uniting of the children of men, and the gathering of 
 them together in one; and, as far as it obtains its just power and 
 influence upon the minds of men, will make them meek and quiet, and 
 peaceable and loving, and every way easy, acceptable, and profitable 
 one to another, and therefore is far from being a sect, which is 
 supposed to lead to division and to sow discord. True Christianity aims 
 at no worldly benefit or advantage, and therefore must by no means be 
 called a sect. Those that espouse a sect are governed in it by their
 secular interest, they aim at wealth and honour; but the professors of 
 Christianity are so far from this that they expose themselves thereby 
 to the loss and ruin of all that is dear to them in this world.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is invidiously called <I>the sect of the 
 Nazarenes,</I> by which Christ was represented as of Nazareth, whence 
 no good thing was expected to arise; whereas he was of Bethlehem, where 
 the Messiah was to be born. Yet he was pleased to call himself, 
 <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:8"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 8</A>.

 And the scripture has put an honour on the name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:23">Matt. ii. 23</A>.

 And therefore, though intended for a reproach, the Christians had not
 reason to be ashamed of sharing with their Master in it. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> It was false that Paul was the author of 
 standard-bearer of this sect; for he did not draw people to himself, 
 but to Christ-did not preach himself, but Christ Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Paul had a veneration for the temple, as it was the place which 
 God had chosen to put his name there, and had lately himself with 
 reverence attended the temple-service; and yet it is here charged upon 
 him that he went about to <I>profane the temple,</I> and that he 
 designedly put contempt upon it, and violated the laws of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Their proof of this failed; for that they alleged as matter of act was 
 utterly false, and they knew it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the course of justice against Paul was obstructed by the 
 chief captain. 

 [1.] They pleaded that they <I>took him, and would have judged him 
 according to their law.</I> This was false; they did not go about to 
 judge him according to their law, but, contrary to all law and equity, 
 went about to <I>beat him to death</I> or to <I>pull him to pieces,</I> 
 without hearing what he had to say for himself-went about, under 
 pretence of having him into their court, to throw him into the hands of 
 ruffians that lay in wait to destroy him. Was this judging him 
 according to their law? It is easy for men, when they know what they 
 should have done, to say, this they would have done, when they meant 
 nothing less. 

 [2.] They reflected upon the chief captain as having done them an 
 injury in rescuing Paul out of their hands; whereas he therein not only 
 did him justice, but them the greatest kindness that could be, in 
 preventing the guilt they were bringing upon themselves: <I>The chief 
 captain Lysias came upon us and with great violence</I> (but really no 
 more than was necessary) <I>took him out of our hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 See how persecutors are enraged at their disappointments, which they 
 ought to e thankful for. When David in a heat of passion was going upon 
 a bloody enterprise, he thanked Abigail for stopping him, and God for 
 sending her to do it, so soon did he correct and recover himself. But 
 these cruel men justify themselves, and reckon him their enemy who kept 
 them (as David there speaks) from shedding blood with their own hands.

 [3.] They referred the matter to Felix and his judgment, yet seeming 
 uneasy that they were under a necessity of doing so, the chief captain 
 having obliged them to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "It was he that forced us to give your excellency this trouble, and 
 ourselves too; for," <I>First,</I> "He <I>commanded his accusers to 
 come to thee,</I> that though mightest hear the charge, when it might 
 as well have been ended in the inferior court." <I>Secondly,</I> "He 
 has left it to thee to examine him, and try what thou canst get out of 
 him, and whether thou canst by his confession come to the knowledge of 
 those things which we lay to his charge."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The assent of the Jews to this charge which Tertullus exhibited 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They confirmed it, saying that those things were so.</I> 

 1. Some think this expresses the proof of their charge by witnesses
 upon oath, that were examined as to the particulars of it, and attested 
 them. And no wonder if, when they had found an orator that would say 
 it, they found witnesses that would swear it, for money. 

 2. It rather seems to intimate the approbation which the high priest
 and the elders gave to what Tertullus said. Felix asked them, "Is this 
 your sense, and is it all that you have to say?" And they answered, 
 "Yes it is;" and so they made themselves guilty of all the falsehood 
 that was in his speech. Those that have not the wit and parts to do
 mischief with that some others have, that cannot make speeches and hold 
 disputes against religion, yet make themselves guilty of the mischiefs 
 others do, by assenting to that which others do, and saying, These 
 things are so, repeating and standing by what is said, to <I>pervert 
 the right ways of the Lord.</I> Many that have not learning enough to 
 plead for Baal yet have wickedness enough to vote for Baal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
 speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many
 years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer
 for myself:
 &nbsp; 11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
 twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.
 &nbsp; 12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any
 man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues,
 nor in the city:
 &nbsp; 13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
 me.
 &nbsp; 14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
 call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all
 things which are written in the law and in the prophets:
 &nbsp; 15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
 that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just
 and unjust.
 &nbsp; 16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
 void of offence toward God, and <I>toward</I> men.
 &nbsp; 17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
 offerings.
 &nbsp; 18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
 temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.
 &nbsp; 19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
 had ought against me.
 &nbsp; 20 Or else let these same <I>here</I> say, if they have found any
 evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
 &nbsp; 21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
 them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in
 question by you this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Paul's defence of himself, in answer to Tertullus's 
 charge, and there appears in it a great deal of the spirit of wisdom 
 and holiness, and an accomplishment of Christ's promise to his 
 followers that when they were before governors and kings, for his sake, 
 it should be <I>given them in that same hour what they should 
 speak.</I> Though Tertullus had said a great many provoking things, yet 
 Paul did not interrupt him, but let him go on to the end of his speech, 
 according to the rules of decency and the method in courts of justice, 
 that the plaintiff be allowed to finish his evidence before the 
 defendant begins his plea. And when he had done, he did not presently 
 fly out into passionate exclamations against the iniquity of the times 
 and the men (<I>O tempora! O mores!--Oh the degeneracy of the
 times!</I>) but he waited for a permission from the judge to speak in 
 his turn, and had it. The <I>governor beckoned to him to speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And now he also may have leave to speak out, under the protection of 
 the governor, which was more than he could hitherto obtain. And, when 
 he did speak, he made no reflections at all upon Tertullus, who he knew 
 spoke for his fee, and therefore despised what he said, and levelled 
 his defence against those that employed him. And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He addressed himself very respectfully to the governor, and with a 
 confidence that he would do him justice. Here are not such flattering 
 compliments as Tertullus soothed him up with, but, which was more truly 
 respectful, a profession that he <I>answered for himself 
 cheerfully,</I> and with good assurance <I>before him,</I> looking upon 
 him, though not as one that was his friend, yet as one that would be 
 fair and impartial. He thus expresses his expectation that he would be 
 so, to engage him to be so. It was likewise the language of one that 
 was conscious to himself of his own integrity, and whose heart did not 
 reproach him, whoever did. He did not stand trembling at the bar; on 
 the contrary, he was very cheerful when he had one to be his judge that 
 was not a party, but an indifferent person. Nay, when he considers who 
 his judge is, he <I>answers the more cheerfully;</I> and why so? He 
 does not say, "Because I know thee to be a judge of inflexible justice 
 and integrity, that hatest bribes, and in giving judgment fearest God, 
 and regardest not man;" for he could not justly say this of him, and 
 therefore would not say it, though it were to gain his favour ever so 
 much; but, <I>I the more cheerfully answer from myself,</I> because 
 <I>I know thou hast been many years a judge to this nation,</I> and 
 this was very true, and being so, 

 1. He could say of his own knowledge that there had not formerly been
 any complaints against Paul. Such clamours as they raised are generally 
 against old offenders; but, though he had long say judge there, he 
 never had Paul brought before him till now; and therefore he was not so 
 dangerous a criminal as he was represented to be. 

 2. He was well acquainted with the Jewish nation, and with their temper
 and spirit. He knew how bigoted they were to their own way, what 
 furious zealots they were against all that did not comply with them, 
 how peevish and perverse they generally were, and therefore would make 
 allowances for that in their accusation of him, and not regard that 
 which he had reason to think came so much from part-malice. Though he 
 did not know him, he knew his prosecutors, and by this might guess what 
 manner of man he was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He denies the facts that he was charged with, upon which their 
 character of him was grounded. <I>Moving sedition,</I> and <I>profaning 
 the temple,</I> were the crimes for which he stood indicted, crimes 
 which they knew the Roman governors were not accustomed to enquire 
 into, and therefore they hoped that the governor would return him back 
 to them to be judged by their law, and this was all they wished for. 
 But Paul desires that though he would not enquire into the crimes he 
 would protect one that was unjustly charged with them from those whom 
 he knew to be spiteful and ill-natured enough. Now he would have him to 
 understand (and what he said he was ready, if required, to make out by 
 witnesses),</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he came up to Jerusalem on purpose to worship God in peace and 
 holiness, so far was he from any design to move sedition among the 
 people or to profane the temple. He came to keep up his communion with 
 the Jews, not to put any affront upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it was but twelve days since he came up to Jerusalem, and he 
 came up to Jerusalem, and he had been six days a prisoner; he was 
 alone, and it could not be supposed that in so short a time he could do 
 the mischief they charged upon him. And, as for what he had done in 
 other countries, they knew nothing of it but by uncertain report, by 
 which the matter was very unfairly represented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he had demeaned himself at Jerusalem very quietly and 
 peaceably, and had made no manner of stir. If it had been true (as they 
 alleged) that he was a <I>mover of sedition among all the Jews,</I> 
 surely he would have been industrious to make a party at Jerusalem: but 
 he did not do so. He was in the temple, attending the public service 
 there. He was in the synagogues where the law was read and opened. He 
 went about in the city among his relations and friends, and conversed 
 freely in the places of concourse; and he was a man of a great genius 
 and an active spirit, and yet they could not charge him with offering 
 any thing either against the faith or against the peace of the Jewish 
 church. 

 (1.) He had nothing in him of a contradicting spirit, as the movers of 
 sedition have; he had no disposition to quarrel or oppose. They never
 found him <I>disputing with any man,</I> either affronting the learned 
 with captious cavils or perplexing the weak and simple with curious 
 subtleties. He was ready, if asked, to give a reason of his own hope, 
 and to give instruction to others; but he never picked a quarrel with 
 any man about his religion, nor made that the subject of debate, and 
 controversy, and perverse dispute, which ought always to be treated of 
 with humility and reverence, with meekness and love. 

 (2.) He had nothing in him of a turbulent spirit: "They never found me 
 <I>raising up the people,</I> by incensing them against their governors 
 in church or state or suggesting to them fears and jealousies 
 concerning public affairs, nor by setting them at variance one with 
 another or sowing discord among them." He behaved as became a Christian 
 and minister, with love and quietness, and due subjection to lawful 
 authority. The weapons of his warfare were not carnal, not did he ever 
 mention or think of such a thing as taking up arms for the propagating 
 of the gospel or the defence of the preachers of it; though he could 
 have made, perhaps, as strong a party among the common people as his 
 adversaries, yet he never attempted it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That as to what they had charged him with, of moving sedition in 
 other countries, he was wholly innocent, and they could not make good 
 the charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Neither can the prove the things whereof the now accuse me.</I> 
 Hereby, 

 (1.) He maintains his own innocency; for when he says, They cannot 
 prove it, he means, The matter is not so. He was no enemy to the public 
 peace; he had done no real prejudice, but a great deal of real service, 
 and would gladly have done more, to the nation of the Jews. He was so 
 far from having any antipathy to them that he had the strongest 
 affection imaginable for them, and a most passionate desire for their 
 welfare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1-3">Rom. ix. 1-3</A>.

 (2.) He bemoans his own calamity, that he was accused of those things
 which could not be proved against him. And it has often been the lot of 
 very worthy good men to be thus injured, to have things laid to their 
 charge which they are the greatest distance from and abhor the though 
 of. But, while they are lamenting this calamity, this may be their 
 rejoicing, even the <I>testimony of their consciences</I> concerning 
 their integrity. 

 (3.) He shows the iniquity of his prosecutors, who said that which they 
 knew they could not prove, and thereby did him wrong in his name, 
 liberty, and life, and did the judge wrong too, in imposing upon him, 
 and doing what in them lay to pervert his judgment.

 (4.) He appeals to the equity of his judge, and awakens him to look 
 about him, that he might not be drawn into a snare by the violence of 
 the prosecution. The judge must give sentence <I>secundum allegata et 
 probata--according to that which is not only alleged but proved,</I> and 
 therefore must enquire, and search, and ask diligently, whether the 
 thing be true and certain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:14">Deut. xiii. 14</A>);

 he cannot otherwise give a right judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives a fair and just account of himself, which does at once 
 both clear him from crime and likewise intimate what was the true 
 reason of their violence in prosecuting him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He acknowledges himself to be one whom they looked upon as a 
 heretic, and that was the reason of their spleen against him. The chief 
 captain had observed, and the governor now cannot but observe, an 
 uncommon violence and fury in his prosecutors, which they know not what 
 to make of, but, guessing at the crime by the cry, conclude he must 
 needs have been a very bad man only for that reason. Now Paul here 
 unriddles the matter: I confess that <I>in the way which they call 
 heresy</I>--or a <I>sect, so worship I the God of my fathers.</I> The
 controversy is in a matter of religion, and such controversies are 
 commonly managed with most fury and violence. Note, It is no new thing 
 for the right way of worshipping God to be called heresy; and for the 
 best of God's servants to be stigmatized and run down as sectaries. The 
 reformed churches are called heretical ones by those who themselves 
 hate to be reformed, and are themselves heretics. Let us therefore 
 never be driven off from any good way by its being put in to an ill 
 name; for true and pure Christianity is never the worse, nor to be the 
 worse thought of, for its being called heresy; no, not though it be 
 called so by the high priest and the elders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He vindicates himself from this imputation. They call Paul a 
 heretic, but he is not so; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>worships the God of his fathers,</I> and therefore is right 
 in the object of his worship. He does not say, <I>Let us go after other 
 gods, which we have not known, and let us serve them,</I> as the false 
 prophet is supposed to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:2">Deut. xiii. 2</A>.

 If so, they might justly call his way heresy, a drawing of them aside
 into a by-path, and a dangerous one; but he worships the God of 
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not only the God whom they worshipped, but 
 the God who took them into covenant with himself, and was and would be 
 called their God. Paul adheres to that covenant, and sets up no other 
 in opposition to it. The <I>promise made unto the fathers</I> Paul 
 preached as <I>fulfilled to the children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:32,33"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 32, 33</A>),

 and so directed both his own devotions and those of others to God, as
 the <I>God of their fathers.</I> He also refers to the practice of all
 his pious ancestors: <I>I worship</I> the same God that all my fathers
 worshipped. His religion was so far from being chargeable with novelty
 that it gloried in its antiquity, and in an uninterrupted succession of
 its professors. Note, It is very comfortable in our worshipping God to
 have an eye to him as the God of our fathers. Our fathers trusted in
 him, and were owned by him, and he engaged to be their God, and the God
 of their seed. He approved himself theirs, and therefore, if we serve
 him as they did, he will be ours; what an emphasis is laid upon this,
 <I>He is my father's God, and I will exalt him!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:2">Exod. xv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>believes all things which are written in the law and the 
 prophets,</I> and therefore is right in the rule of his worship. His 
 religion is grounded upon, and governed by, the holy scriptures; they 
 are his oracle and touchstone, and he speaks and acts according to 
 them. He receives the scriptures entire, and believes all things that 
 are there written; and he receives them pure, for he says no other 
 things than what are contained in them, as he explains himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 22</A>.

 He sets not up any other rule of faith, or practice but the
 scriptures-not tradition, nor the authority of the church, nor the 
 infallibility of any man or company of men on earth, nor the light 
 within, nor human reason; but divine revelation, as it is in the 
 scripture, is that which he resolves to live and die by, and therefore 
 he is not a heretic.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He has his eye upon a future state, and is a believing expectant 
 of that, and therefore is right in the end of his worship. Those that 
 turn aside to heresy have a regard to this world, and some secular 
 interest, but Paul aims to make heaven of his religion, and neither 
 more nor less 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>I have hope towards God,</I> all my expectation is from him, and 
 therefore all my desire is towards him and all my dependence upon him; 
 my hope is towards God and not towards the world, towards another world 
 and not towards this. I depend upon God and upon his power, that 
 <I>there shall be a resurrection of the dead</I> at the end of time, of 
 all, both <I>the just and unjust;</I> and the great thing I aim at in 
 my religion is to obtain a joyful and happy resurrection, a share in 
 the resurrection of the just." Observe here, 

 [1.] That there shall be a resurrection of the dead, the dead bodies of 
 men, of all men from the beginning to the end of time. It is certain, 
 not only that the soul does not die with the body, but that the body 
 itself shall live again; we have not only another life to live when our 
 present life is at an end, but there is to be another world, which 
 shall commence when this world is at an end, into which all the 
 children of men must enter at once by a resurrection from the dead, as 
 they entered into this, one after another, by their birth. 

 [2.] It shall be a resurrection <I>both of the just and of the 
 unjust,</I> the sanctified and the unsanctified, of those that did 
 well, and to them our Saviour has told us that it will be a
 <I>resurrection of life;</I> and of those that did evil, and to them
 that it will be a resurrection of condemnation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:29">John v. 29</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>.

 This implies that it will be a resurrection to a final judgment, by
 which all the children of men will be determined to everlasting 
 happiness or misery in a world of retribution, according to what they 
 were and what they did in this state of probation and preparation. The 
 just shall rise by virtue of their union with Christ as their head; the 
 unjust shall rise by virtue of Christ's dominion over them as their 
 Judge.

 [3.] God is to be depended upon for the resurrection of the dead: I
 have <I>hope towards God,</I> and in God, that there shall be a 
 resurrection; it shall be effected by the almighty power of God, in 
 performance of the word which God hath spoken; so that those who doubt 
 of it betray their ignorance both of the scriptures and of the power of 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:29">Matt. xxii. 29</A>.

 [4.] The resurrection of the dead is a fundamental article of our
 creed, as it was also of that of the Jewish church. It is what <I>they 
 themselves also allow;</I> nay, it was the expectation of the ancient 
 patriarchs, witness Job's confession of his faith; but it is more 
 clearly revealed and more fully confirmed by the gospel, and therefore 
 those who believed it should have been thankful to the preachers of the 
 gospel for their explications and proofs of it, instead of opposing 
 them. 

 [5.] In all our religion we ought to have an eye to the other world, 
 and to serve God in all instances with a confidence in him <I>that 
 there will be a resurrection of the dead,</I> doing all in preparation 
 for that, and expecting our recompence in that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) His conversation is of a piece with his devotion
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of 
 offence towards God and towards men.</I> Prophets and their doctrine 
 were to be tried by their fruits. Paul was far from having made 
 shipwreck of a good conscience, and therefore it is not likely he has 
 made shipwreck of the faith, the mystery of which is best held in a 
 pure conscience. This protestation of Paul's is to the same purport 
 with that which he made before the high priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 1</A>):

 <I>I have lived in all good conscience;</I> and this was his rejoicing.
 Observe, 

 [1.] What was Paul's aim and desire: To <I>have a conscience void of 
 offence.</I> Either, <I>First,</I> "A conscience not offending; not 
 informing me wrong, nor flattering me, nor dealing deceitfully with me, 
 nor in any thing misleading me." Or, <I>Secondly,</I> A conscience not 
 offended; it is like Job's resolution, "<I>My heart shall not reproach 
 me,</I> that is, I will never give it any occasion to do so. This is
 what I am ambitious of, to keep upon good terms with my own conscience, 
 that it may have no cause either to question the goodness of my 
 spiritual state or to quarrel with me for any particular action. I am
 as careful not to offend my conscience as I am not to offend a friend 
 with whom I daily converse; nay, as I am not to offend a magistrate 
 whose authority I am under, and to whom I am accountable; for 
 conscience is God's deputy in my soul." 

 [2.] What was his care and endeavour, in pursuance of this: "<I>I 
 exercise myself</I>--<B><I>asko</I></B>. I make it my constant 
 business, and govern myself by this intention; I discipline myself, and 
 live by rule" (those that did so were called <I>ascetics,</I> from the 
 word here used), "abstain from many a thing which my inclination leads 
 me to, and abound in all the exercises of religion that are most 
 spiritual, with this in my eye, that I may keep peace with my own 
 conscience." 

 [3.] The extent of this care: <I>First,</I> To all times: <I>To have 
 always a conscience void of offence,</I> always void of gross offence; 
 for though Paul was conscious to himself that he <I>had not yet 
 attained perfection,</I> and the evil that he would not do yet he did, 
 yet he was <I>innocent from the great transgression.</I> Sins of 
 infirmity are uneasy to conscience, but they do not wound it, and waste 
 it, as presumptuous sins do; and, though offence may be given to 
 conscience, yet care must be taken that it be not an abiding offence, 
 but that by the renewed acts of faith and repentance the matter may be 
 taken up again quickly. This however we must always exercise ourselves 
 in, and, though we come short, we must follow after. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 To all things: <I>Both towards God, and towards man.</I> His 
 conscientious care extended itself to the whole of his duty, and he was 
 afraid of breaking the law of love either to God or his neighbour.  
 Conscience, like the magistrate, is <I>custos utriusque
 tabul&aelig;--the guardian of each table.</I> We must be very cautious 
 that we do not think, or speak, or do any thing amiss, either against 
 God or man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:21">2 Cor. viii. 21</A>.

 [4.] The inducement to it: <I>Herein,</I> <B><I>en touto,</I></B>
 <I>for this cause;</I> so it may be read. "Because I look for the 
 resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come, therefore I 
 thus exercise myself." The consideration of the future state should 
 engage us to be universally conscientious in our present state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Having made confession of his faith, he gives a plain and faithful 
 account of his case, and of the wrong done him by his persecutors. 
 Twice he had been rescued by the chief captain out of the hands of the 
 Jews, when they were ready to pull him to pieces, and he challenges 
 them to prove him guilty of any crime either time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the temple. Here they fell furiously upon him as an enemy to 
 their nation and the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:28"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 28</A>.

 But was there any colour for the charge? No, but evidence sufficient
 against it, 

 (1.) It was very hard to accuse him as an <I>enemy to their nation,</I> 
 when after long absence from Jerusalem he came to <I>bring alms to his 
 nation,</I> money which (though he had need enough himself of it) he 
 had collected among his friends, for the relief of the poor at 
 Jerusalem. He not only had no malice to that people, but he had a very 
 charitable concern for them, and was ready to do them all good offices; 
 and were they his adversaries for his love? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:4">Ps. cix. 4</A>.

 (2.) It was very hard to accuse him of having profaned the temple when
 he brought offerings to the temple, and was himself at charges therein

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:24"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 24</A>),

 and was found <I>purifying himself in the temple,</I> according to the
 law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and that in a very quiet decent manner, <I>neither with multitude nor 
 with tumult.</I> Though he was a man so much talked of, he was far from 
 coveting to show himself when he came to Jerusalem, or to be crowded 
 after, but went to the temple, as much as was possible, 
 <I>incognito.</I> They were Jews from Asia, his enemies, that caused 
 him to be taken notice of; they had not pretence to make a tumult and 
 raise a multitude against him, for he had neither multitude nor tumult 
 for him. And as to what was perhaps suggested to Felix that he had 
 brought Greeks into the temple, contrary to their law, and the governor 
 ought to reckon with him for that, the Romans having stipulated with 
 the nations that submitted to them to preserve them in their religion, 
 he challenges them to prove it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "Those Jews of Asia ought to have been <I>here before thee,</I> that 
 they might have been examined, whether <I>they had aught against 
 me,</I> that they would stand by and swear to;" for some that will not 
 scruple to tell a lie have such heavings of conscience that they 
 scruple confirming it with an oath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the council: "Since the Jews of Asia are not here to prove any 
 thing upon me done amiss in the temple, let <I>these same</I> that are 
 <I>here,</I> the high priest and the elders, say whether they have 
 <I>found any evil doing in me,</I> or whether I was guilty of any 
 misdemeanor <I>when I stood before the council,</I> when also they were 
 ready to pull me in pieces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When I was there, they could not take offence at any thing I said; for 
 all I said was, <I>Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in 
 question by you this day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which gave no offence to any one but the Sadducees. This I hope was no 
 crime, that I stuck to that which is the faith of the whole Jewish 
 church, excepting those whom they themselves call heretics."</P>

 knowledge of <I>that</I> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias
 the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of
 your matter.
 &nbsp; 23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <I>him</I>
 have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance
 to minister or come unto him.
 &nbsp; 24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife
 Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him
 concerning the faith in Christ.
 &nbsp; 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and
 judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for
 this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
 &nbsp; 26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
 that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener,
 and communed with him.
 &nbsp; 27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room:
 and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the result of Paul's trial before Felix, and what was the 
 consequence of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Felix adjourned the cause, and took further time to consider of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 He <I>had a more perfect knowledge of that way</I> which the Jews 
 called heresy than the high priest and the elders thought he had. He
 understood something of the Christian religion; for, living at 
 C&aelig;sarea, where Cornelius, a Roman centurion, was, who was a 
 Christian, from him and others he had got a notion of Christianity, 
 that it was not such an evil thing as it was represented. He himself 
 knew some of that way to be honest good men, and very conscientious, 
 and therefore he put off the prosecutors with an excuse: "<I>When the 
 chief captain shall come down</I> hither, <I>I will know the uttermost 
 of your matter,</I> or I shall know the truth, whether this Paul did go 
 about to raise sedition or no; you are parties, he is an indifferent 
 person. Either Paul deserves to be punished for raising the tumult, or
 you do for doing it yourselves and then charging it upon him; and I 
 will hear what he says, and determine accordingly between you." Now, 

 1. It was a disappointment to the high priest and the elders that Paul
 was not condemned, or remitted to their judgment, which they wished for 
 and expected. But thus sometimes God restrains the wrath of his 
 people's enemies by the agency, not of their friends, but of such as 
 are strangers to them. And though they be so, if they have but some 
 <I>knowledge of their way,</I> they cannot but appear for their 
 protection. 

 2. It was an injury to Paul that he was not released. Felix ought to
 have <I>avenged him of his adversaries,</I> when he so plainly saw 
 there was nothing but malice in the prosecution, and to have delivered 
 <I>him out of the hand of the wicked,</I> according to the duty of a 
 judge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:4">Ps. lxxxii. 4</A>.

 But he was a judge that neither feared God nor regarded man, and what
 good could be expected from him? It is a wrong not only to deny 
 justice, but to delay it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He detained the prisoner in custody, and would not take bail for 
 him; else here at C&aelig;sarea Paul had friends enough that would gladly
 have been his security. Felix thought a man of such a public character 
 as Paul was had many friends, as well as many enemies, and he might 
 have an opportunity of obliging them, or making a hand of them, if he 
 did not presently release him, and yet did show him countenance; and 
 therefore, 

 1. He continued him a prisoner, commanded a centurion or captain to 
 keep him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He did not commit him to the common jail, but, being first made an 
 army-prisoner, he shall still be so. 

 2. Yet he took care he should be <I>a prisoner at large--in libera
 custodia;</I> his keeper must let him have liberty, not bind him nor 
 lock him up, but make his confinement as easy to him as possible; let 
 him have the liberty of the castle, and, perhaps, he means liberty to 
 take the air, or go abroad upon his parole: and Paul was such an honest 
 man that they might take his word for his return. The high priest and 
 the elders grudged him his life, but Felix generously allows him a sort 
 of liberty; for he had not those prejudices against him and his way 
 that they had. He also gave orders that none of his friends should be 
 hindered from coming to him; the centurion must not forbid any of his 
 acquaintances from ministering to him; and a man's prison is as it were 
 his own house if he has but his friends about him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He had frequent conversation with him afterwards in private, once 
 particularly, not long after his public trial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With what design <I>Felix sent for Paul.</I> He had a mind to have 
 some talk with him <I>concerning the faith in Christ,</I> the Christian 
 religion; he had some knowledge of that way, but he desired to have an 
 account of it from Paul, who was so celebrated a preacher of that 
 faith, above the rest. Those that would enlarge their knowledge must 
 discourse with men of their own profession, and those that would be 
 acquainted with any profession should consult those that excel in the 
 knowledge of it; and therefore Felix had a mind to talk with Paul more 
 freely than he could in open court, where he observed Paul upon his 
 guard, <I>concerning the faith of Christ;</I> and this only to satisfy 
 his curiosity, or rather the curiosity of <I>his wife Drusilla, who was 
 a Jewess,</I> daughter of Herod Agrippa, that was eaten of worms. Being 
 educated in the Jewish religion, she was more inquisitive concerning 
 the Christian religion, which pretended to be the perfection of that, 
 and desired to hear Paul discourse of it. But it was no great matter 
 what religion she was of; for, whatever it was, she was a reproach and 
 scandal to it-a Jewess, but an adulteress; she was another man's wife 
 when Felix took her to be his wife, and she lived with him in whoredom 
 and was noted for an impudent woman, yet she desires to hear 
 <I>concerning the faith of Christ.</I> Many are fond of new notions and 
 speculations in religion, and can hear and speak of them with pleasure, 
 who yet hate to come under the power and influence of religion, can be 
 content to have their judgments informed but not their lives 
 reformed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the account was which Paul gave him of the Christian religion; 
 by the idea he had of it, he expected to be amused with a mystical 
 divinity, but, as Paul represents it to him, he is alarmed with a 
 practical divinity. Paul, being asked <I>concerning the faith in 
 Christ, reasoned</I> (for Paul was always a rational preacher) 
 concerning <I>righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.</I> It 
 is probable that he mentioned the peculiar doctrines of Christianity 
 concerning the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and his being 
 <I>the Mediator between God and man;</I> but he hastened to his 
 application, in which he designed to come home to the consciences of 
 his hearers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He discoursed with clearness and warmth <I>of righteousness, 
 temperance, and judgment to come;</I> and here he showed, 

 [1.] That the faith in Christ is designed to enforce upon the children 
 of men the great laws of justice and temperance. <I>The grace of God 
 teacheth us to live soberly and righteously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:12">Tit. ii. 12</A>.

 Justice and temperance were celebrated virtues among the heathen
 moralists; if the doctrine Paul preaches, which Felix has heard of as 
 proclaiming liberty, will but free him from an obligation to these, he 
 will readily embrace it: "<I>No,</I>" says Paul, "it is so far from 
 doing so that it strengthens the obligations of those sacred laws; it 
 binds all under the highest penalties to be <I>honest in all their 
 dealings,</I> and to <I>render to all their due;</I> to <I>deny 
 themselves,</I> and <I>to keep under the body, and bring it into 
 subjection.</I>" The world and the flesh being in our baptism 
 renounced, all our pursuits of the world and all our gratifications of 
 the desires of the body are to be under the regulations of religion. 
 <I>Paul reasoned of righteousness and temperance,</I> to convince Felix 
 of his unrighteousness and intemperance, of which he had been 
 notoriously guilty, that, seeing the odiousness of them, and his 
 obnoxiousness to the wrath of God for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:6">Eph. v. 6</A>),

 he might enquire concerning the faith of Christ, with a resolution to 
 embrace it. 

 [2.] That by the doctrine of Christ is discovered to us the judgment to 
 come, by the sentence of which the everlasting state of all the 
 children of men will be finally and irreversibly determined. Men have 
 their day now, Felix hath his; but God's day is coming, <I>when 
 everyone shall give account of himself to God, the Judge of all.</I> 
 Paul reasoned concerning this; that is, he showed what reason we have 
 to believe <I>that there is a judgment to come,</I> and what reason we 
 have, in consideration thereof, to be religious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From this account of the heads of Paul's discourse we may gather, 
 
 [1.] That Paul in his preaching had no respect to persons, for the word 
 of God, which he preached, has not: he urged the same convictions and 
 instructions upon the Roman governor that he did upon other people. 
 
 [2.] That Paul in his preaching aimed at the consciences of men, and 
 came close to them, sought not to please their fancy nor to gratify 
 their curiosity, but led them to a sight of their sins and a sense of 
 their duty and interest. 

 [3.] That Paul preferred the serving of Christ, and the saving of 
 souls, before his own safety. He lay at the mercy of Felix, who had 
 power (as Pilate said) <I>to crucify him</I> (or, which was as bad, to 
 deliver him back to the Jews), <I>and he had power to release him.</I> 
 Now when Paul had his ear, and had him in a good humour, he had a fair 
 opportunity of ingratiating himself with him, and obtaining a release, 
 nay, and of incensing him against his prosecutors: and, on the 
 contrary, if he disobliged him, and put him out of humour, he might do 
 himself a great diskindness by it; but he is wholly negligent of these 
 considerations, and is intent upon doing good, at least discharging his 
 duty. 

 [4.] That Paul was willing to take pains, and run hazards, in his work, 
 even where there was little probability of doing good. Felix and 
 Drusilla were such hardened sinners that it was not at all likely they 
 should be brought to repentance by Paul's preaching, especially under 
 such disadvantages; and yet Paul deals with them as one that did not 
 despair of them. Let the watchman give fair warning, and then they have 
 delivered their own souls, though they should not prevail to deliver 
 the souls they watch for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What impressions Paul's discourse made upon this great but wicked 
 man: <I>Felix trembled,</I> <B><I>emphobos genomenos</I></B>--<I>being
 put into a fright,</I> or made <I>a terror to himself, a 
 magor-missabib,</I> as Pashur, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:3,4">Jer. xx. 3, 4</A>.

 Paul never trembled before him, but he was made to tremble before Paul.
 "If this be so, as Paul says, what will become of me in another world? 
 If the unrighteous and intemperate will be condemned in the judgment to 
 come, I am undone, for ever undone, unless I lead a new course of 
 life." We do not find that Drusilla trembled, though she was equally 
 guilty, for she was a Jewess, and depended upon the ceremonial law, 
 which she adhered to the observance of, to justify her; but Felix for 
 the present could fasten upon nothing to pacify his conscience, and 
 therefore trembled. See here,

 (1.) The power of the word of God, when it comes with commission; it is 
 searching, it is startling, it can strike a terror into the heart of 
 the most proud and daring sinner, by <I>setting his sins in order 
 before him,</I> and showing him <I>the terrors of the Lord.</I> 

 (2.) The workings of natural conscience; when it is startled and 
 awakened, it fills the soul with horror and amazement at its own 
 deformity and danger. Those that are themselves <I>the terror of the 
 mighty in the land of the living</I> have hereby been made a terror to 
 themselves. A prospect of the judgment to come is enough to make the 
 stoutest heart to tremble, as when it comes indeed it will make <I>the 
 mighty men and the chief captains</I> to call in vain <I>to rocks and 
 mountains to shelter them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How Felix struggled to get clear of these impressions, and to shake 
 off the terror of his convictions; he did by them as he did by Paul's 
 prosecutors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>he deferred them;</I> he said, <I>Go thy way for this time, when I 
 have a convenient season I will call for thee.</I> 

 (1.) He trembled and that was all. Paul's trembling

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>),
 
 and the <I>jailer's</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:29"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 29</A>),

 ended in their conversion, but this of Felix did not. Many are startled
 by the word of God who are not effectually changed by it. Many are in 
 fear of the consequences of sin, and yet continue in love and league 
 with sin. 

 (2.) He did not fight against his convictions, nor fly in the face of 
 the word or of the preacher of it, to be revenged on them for making 
 his conscience fly in his face; he did not say to Paul, as Amaziah to 
 the prophet, <I>Forbear, why shouldst thou be smitten?</I> He did not 
 threaten him with a closer confinement, or with death, for touching him 
 (as John Baptist did Herod) in the sore place. But, 

 (3.) He artfully shifted off his convictions by putting off the 
 prosecution of them to another time. He has nothing to object against
 what Paul has said; it is weighty and worth considering. But, like a 
 sorry debtor, he begs a day; Paul has spent himself, and has tired him 
 and his lady, and therefore, "<I>Go thy way for this time</I>--break 
 off here, business calls me away; but <I>when I have a convenient 
 season,</I> and have nothing else to do, <I>I will call for thee,</I> 
 and hear what thou hast further to say." Note, 

 [1.] Many lose all the benefit of their convictions for want of 
 striking while the iron is hot. If Felix, now that he trembled, had but 
 asked, as Paul and the jailer did when they trembled, <I>What shall I 
 do?</I> he might have been brought to the faith of Christ, and have 
 been a <I>Felix</I> indeed, <I>happy</I> for ever; but, by dropping his 
 convictions now, he lost them for ever, and himself with them. 

 [2.] In the affairs of our souls, delays are dangerous; nothing is of 
 more fatal consequence than men's putting off their conversion from 
 time to time. They will repent, and turn to God, but not yet; the 
 matter is adjourned to some more convenient season, when such a 
 business or affair is compassed, when they are so much older; and then 
 convictions cool and wear off, good purposes prove to no purpose, and 
 they are more hardened than ever in their evil way. Felix put off this
 matter to a more convenient season, but we do not find that this more 
 convenient season ever came; for the devil cozens us of all our time by 
 cozening us of the present time. The present season is, without doubt, 
 the most convenient season. <I>Behold, now is the accepted time.
 To-day if you will hear his voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. After all, he detained him a prisoner, and left him so, when two 
 years after he was removed from the government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 He was convinced in his conscience that Paul had done <I>nothing worthy 
 of death or of bonds,</I> and yet had not the honesty to release him. 
 To little purpose had Paul reasoned with him about righteousness, 
 though he then trembled at the thought of his own iniquity, who could 
 thus persist in such a palpable piece of injustice. But here we are 
 told what principles he was governed by herein; and they were such as 
 make the matter yet much worse. 

 1. The love of money. He would not release Paul because he hoped to 
 make his market of him, and that at length his friends would make a 
 purse to purchase his liberty, and then he would satisfy his conscience 
 by releasing him when he could withal satisfy his covetousness by it; 
 but he cannot find in his heart to do his duty as a judge, unless he 
 can get money by it: <I>He hoped that money would have been given him 
 of Paul,</I> or somebody for him, and then he would have loosed him, 
 and set him at liberty. In hopes of this, he detains him a prisoner, 
 and <I>sends for him the oftener, and communes with him;</I> not any 
 more about the faith of Christ (he had had enough of that, and of the 
 judgment to come; Paul must not return to those subjects, nor go on 
 with them), but about his discharge, or ransom rather, out of his 
 present captivity. He cannot for shame ask Paul what he will give him 
 to release him, but he sends for him to feel his pulse, and gives him 
 an opportunity to ask why he would take to release him. And now we see 
 what became of his promise both to Paul and to himself, that he would 
 hear more of Christ at some other convenient season. Here were many 
 seasons convenient enough to have talked that matter through, but 
 nothing is done in it; all his business now is to get money by Paul, 
 not to get the knowledge of Christ by him. Note, It is just with God to 
 say concerning those who trifle with their convictions, and think they 
 can have the grace of God at command when they please, <I>My Spirit 
 shall no more strive with them.</I> When men will not hear God's voice 
 <I>to-day, while it is called to-day,</I> the heart is commonly 
 <I>hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</I> Paul was but a poor man 
 himself, <I>silver and gold he had none</I> to give, to purchase his 
 liberty; but Felix knew there were those who wished well to him who 
 were able to assist him. He having lately collected a great deal of 
 money for the poor saints to relieve them, it might also be expected 
 that the rich saints should contribute some to release him, and I 
 wonder it was not done. Though Paul is to be commended that he would 
 not offer money to Felix, nor beg money of the churches (his great and 
 generous soul disdained both), yet I know not whether his friends are 
 to be commended, nay, whether they can be justified, in not doing it 
 for him. They ought to have solicited the governor as pressingly for 
 him as his enemies did against him: and if a <I>gift was necessary to 
 make room for them</I> (as Solomon speaks) and to bring them before 
 great men, they might lawfully have done it. I ought not to bribe a man 
 to do an unjust thing, but, if he will not do me justice without a fee, 
 it is but doing myself justice to give it to him; and, if they might do 
 it, it was a shame they did not do it. I blush for them, that they 
 would let such an eminent and useful man as Paul lie in the jail, when 
 a little money would have fetched him out, and restored him to his 
 usefulness again. The Christians here at C&aelig;sarea, where he now 
 was, had parted with their tears to prevent his going to the prison

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:13"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 13</A>),

 and could they not find in their hearts to part with their money to
 help him out? Yet there might be a providence of God in it; Paul's 
 bonds must be for the furtherance of the gospel of Christ, and 
 therefore he must continue in bonds. However, this will not excuse 
 Felix, who ought to have released an innocent man, without demanding or 
 accepting any thing for it: the judge that will not do right without a 
 bribe will no doubt do wrong for a bribe. 

 2. Men-pleasing. Felix was recalled from his government about <I>two
 years after this,</I> and Porcius Festus was put in his place, and one 
 should have expected he would have at least concluded his government 
 with this act of justice, the release of Paul, but he did not; he 
 <I>left Paul bound,</I> and the reason here given is because he was 
 <I>willing to do the Jews a pleasure.</I> Though he would not deliver 
 him <I>to death, to please them,</I> yet he would continue him a 
 prisoner rather than offend them; and he did it in hope hereby to atone 
 for the many offences he had done against them. He did not think Paul 
 had either interest or inclination to complain of him at court, for 
 detaining him so long in custody, against all law and equity; but he 
 was jealous of the high priest and elders, that they would be his 
 accusers to the emperor for the wrongs he had done them, and therefore 
 hopes by gratifying them in this matter to stop their mouths. Thus 
 those who do some base things are tempted to do more to screen 
 themselves and bear them out. If Felix had not injured the Jews, he 
 needed not to have done this to please them; but, when he had done it, 
 it seems he did not gain his point. The Jews, notwithstanding this, 
 accused him to the emperor, and some historians say he was sent bound 
 to Rome by Festus; and, if so, surely his remembering how light he had 
 made of Paul's bonds would help to make his own chain heavy. Those that 
 aim to please God by doing good will have what they aim at; but so will 
 not those that seek to please men by doing evil.</P>
