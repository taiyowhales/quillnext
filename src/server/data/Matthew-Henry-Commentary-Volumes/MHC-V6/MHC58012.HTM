 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, in this chapter, applies what he has collected in the 
 chapter foregoing, and makes use of it as a great motive to patience 
 and perseverance in the Christian faith and state, pressing home the 
 argument, 

 I. From a greater example than he had yet mentioned, and that is Christ
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. From the gentle and gracious nature of the afflictions they endured
 in their Christian course, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:4-17">ver. 4-17</A>.

 III. From the communion and conformity between the state of the
 gospel-church on earth and the triumphant church in heaven, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18-29">ver. 18, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
 cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
 which doth so easily beset <I>us,</I> and let us run with patience the
 race that is set before us,
 &nbsp; 2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of <I>our</I> faith;
 who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
 despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
 throne of God.
 &nbsp; 3  For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
 against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here observe what is the great duty which the apostle urges upon the 
 Hebrews, and which he so much desires they would comply with, and that 
 is, to <I>lay aside every weight, and the sin that did so easily beset 
 them, and run with patience the race set before them.</I> The duty 
 consists of two parts, the one preparatory, the other perfective.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Preparatory: <I>Lay aside every weight, and the sin,</I> &c. 

 1. <I>Every weight,</I> that is, all inordinate affection and concern
 for the body, and the present life and world. Inordinate care for the 
 present life, or fondness for it, is a dead weight upon the soul, that 
 pulls it down when it should ascend upwards, and pulls it back when it 
 should press forward; it makes duty and difficulties harder and heavier 
 than they would be. 

 2. <I>The sin that doth so easily beset us;</I> the sin that has the
 greatest advantage against us, by the circumstances we are in, our 
 constitution, our company. This may mean either the damning sin of 
 unbelief or rather the darling sin of the Jews, an over-fondness for 
 their own dispensation. <I>Let us lay aside</I> all external and 
 internal hindrances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Perfective: <I>Run with patience the race that is set before 
 us.</I> The apostle speaks in the gymnastic style, taken from the 
 Olympic and other exercises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christians have a race to run, a race of service and a race of 
 sufferings, a course of active and passive obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This race is set before them; it is marked out unto them, both by 
 the word of God and the examples of the faithful servants of God, that 
 cloud of witnesses with which they are compassed about. It is set out 
 by proper limits and directions; the mark they run to, and the prize 
 they run for, are set before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This race must be run with patience and perseverance. There will be 
 need of patience to encounter the difficulties that lie in our way, of 
 perseverance to resist all temptations to desist or turn aside. Faith 
 and patience are the conquering graces, and therefore must be always 
 cultivated and kept in lively exercise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christians have a greater example to animate and encourage them in 
 their Christian course than any or all who have been mentioned before, 
 and that is the Lord Jesus Christ: <I>Looking unto Jesus, the author 
 and finisher of our faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What our Lord Jesus is to his people: he is <I>the author and 
 finisher of</I> their <I>faith</I>--the beginning, perfecter, and
 rewarder of it. 

 [1.] He is the author of their faith; not only the object, but the 
 author. He is the great leader and precedent of our faith, <I>he 
 trusted in God;</I> he is the purchaser of the Spirit of faith, the 
 publisher of the rule of faith, the efficient cause of the grace of 
 faith, and in all respects the author of our faith.

 [2.] He is <I>the finisher of our faith;</I> he is the fulfiller and 
 the fulfilling of all scripture-promises and prophecies; he is the 
 perfecter of the canon of scripture; he is the finisher of grace, and 
 of the work of faith with power in the souls of his people; and he is 
 the judge and the rewarder of their faith; he determines who they are 
 that reach the mark, and from him, and in him, they have the prize.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What trials Christ met with in his race and course. 

 [1.] He <I>endured the contradiction of sinners against himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he bore the opposition that they made to him, both in their words and 
 behaviour. They were continually contradicting him, and crossing in 
 upon his great designs; and though he could easily have both confuted 
 and confounded them, and sometimes gave them a specimen of his power, 
 yet he endured their evil manners with great patience. Their 
 contradictions were levelled against Christ himself, against his person 
 as God-man, against his authority, against his preaching, and yet he 
 endured all. 

 [2.] He <I>endured the cross</I>--all those sufferings that he met with 
 in the world; for he took up his cross betimes, and was at length 
 nailed to it, and endured a painful, ignominious, and accursed death, 
 in which he was numbered with the transgressors, the vilest 
 malefactors; yet all this he endured with invincible patience and 
 resolution.

 [3.] He <I>despised the shame.</I> All the reproaches that were cast 
 upon him, both in his life and at his death, he despised; he was 
 infinitely above them; he knew his own innocency and excellency, and 
 despised the ignorance and malice of his despisers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What it was that supported the human soul of Christ under these 
 unparalleled sufferings; and that was <I>the joy that was set before 
 him.</I> He had something in view under all his sufferings, which was 
 pleasant to him; he rejoiced to see that by his sufferings he should 
 make satisfaction to the injured justice of God and give security to 
 his honour and government, that he should make peace between God and 
 man, that he should seal the covenant of grace and be the Mediator of 
 it, that he should open a way of salvation to the chief of sinners, and 
 that he should effectually save all those whom the Father had given 
 him, and himself be the first-born among many brethren. This was the 
 joy that was set before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The reward of his suffering: he <I>has sat down at the right hand 
 of the throne of God.</I> Christ, as Mediator, is exalted to a station 
 of the highest honour, of the greatest power and influence; he is at 
 the right hand of the Father. Nothing passes between heaven and earth 
 but by him; he does all that is done; <I>he ever lives to make 
 intercession for</I> his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) What is our duty with respect to this Jesus. We must, 

 [1.] Look unto him; that is, we must set him continually before us as 
 our example, and our great encouragement; we must look to him for 
 direction, for assistance, and for acceptance, in all our sufferings.

 [2.] We must consider him, meditate much upon him, and reason with 
 ourselves from his case to our own. We must <I>analogize,</I> as the 
 word is; compare Christ's sufferings and ours; and we shall find that 
 as his sufferings far exceeded ours, in the nature and measure of them, 
 so his patience far excels ours, and is a perfect pattern for us to 
 imitate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The advantage we shall reap by thus doing: it will be a means to 
 prevent our weariness and fainting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Lest you be weary and faint in your minds.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] There is a proneness in the best to grow weary and to faint under 
 their trials and afflictions, especially when they prove heavy and of 
 long continuance: this proceeds from the imperfections of grace and the 
 remains of corruption.

 [2.] The best way to prevent this is to look unto Jesus, and to 
 consider him. Faith and meditation will fetch in fresh supplies of
 strength, comfort, and courage; for he has assured them, if <I>they 
 suffer with him, they shall also reign with him:</I> and this hope will 
 be their helmet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
 &nbsp; 5  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
 as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the
 Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
 &nbsp; 6  For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
 son whom he receiveth.
 &nbsp; 7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
 for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
 &nbsp; 8  But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
 then are ye bastards, and not sons.
 &nbsp; 9  Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
 <I>us,</I> and we gave <I>them</I> reverence: shall we not much rather be
 in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
 &nbsp; 10  For they verily for a few days chastened <I>us</I> after their
 own pleasure; but he for <I>our</I> profit, that <I>we</I> might be
 partakers of his holiness.
 &nbsp; 11  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
 grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit
 of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
 knees;
 &nbsp; 13  And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is
 lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
 &nbsp; 14  Follow peace with all <I>men,</I> and holiness, without which no
 man shall see the Lord:
 &nbsp; 15  Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God;
 lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble <I>you,</I> and
 thereby many be defiled;
 &nbsp; 16  Lest there <I>be</I> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau,
 who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
 &nbsp; 17  For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
 the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
 repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle presses the exhortation to patience and perseverance 
 by an argument taken from the gentle measure and gracious nature of 
 those sufferings which the believing Hebrews endured in their Christian 
 course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the gentle and moderate degree and measure of their sufferings: 
 <I>You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He owns that they had suffered much, they had been striving to an 
 agony against sin. Here, 

 (1.) The cause of the conflict was sin, and to be engaged against sin 
 is to fight in a good cause, for sin is the worst enemy both to God and 
 man. Our spiritual warfare is both honourable and necessary; for we are 
 only defending ourselves against that which would destroy us, if it 
 should get the victory over us; we fight for ourselves, for our lives, 
 and therefore ought to be patient and resolute. 

 (2.) Every Christian is enlisted under Christ's banner, to strive 
 against sin, against sinful doctrines, sinful practices, and sinful 
 habits and customs, both in himself and in others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He puts them in mind that they might have suffered more, that they 
 had not suffered as much as others; for they had <I>not yet resisted 
 unto blood,</I> they had not been called to martyrdom as yet, though 
 they knew not how soon they might be. Learn here, 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus, <I>the captain of our salvation,</I> does not call 
 his people out to the hardest trials at first, but wisely trains them 
 up by less sufferings to be prepared for greater. He will not put new 
 wine into weak vessels, he is <I>the gentle shepherd,</I> who will not 
 overdrive <I>the young ones of the flock.</I> 

 (2.) It becomes Christians to take notice of the gentleness of Christ 
 in accommodating their trial to their strength. They should not magnify 
 their afflictions, but should take notice of the mercy that is mixed 
 with them, and should pity those who are called to the fiery trials to 
 <I>resist to blood;</I> not to shed the blood of their enemies, but to 
 seal their testimony with their own blood. 

 (3.) Christians should be ashamed to faint under less trials, when they 
 see others bear up under greater, and do not know how soon they may 
 meet with greater themselves. If we have run with the footmen and they 
 have wearied us, how shall we contend with horses? If we be wearied in 
 a land of peace, what shall we do in the swellings of Jordan? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5">Jer. xii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He argues from the peculiar and gracious nature of those sufferings 
 that befall the people of God. Though their enemies and persecutors may 
 be the instruments of inflicting such sufferings on them, yet they are 
 divine chastisements; their heavenly Father has his hand in all, and 
 his wise end to serve by all; of this he has given them due notice, and 
 they should not forget it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those afflictions which may be truly persecution as far as men are 
 concerned in them are fatherly rebukes and chastisements as far as God 
 is concerned in them. Persecution for religion is sometimes a 
 correction and rebuke for the sins of professors of religion. Men 
 persecute them because they are religious; God chastises them because 
 they are not more so: men persecute them because they will not give up 
 their profession; God chastises them because they have not lived up to 
 their profession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God has directed his people how they ought to behave themselves 
 under all their afflictions; they must avoid the extremes that many run 
 into. 

 (1.) They must not despise the chastening of the Lord; they must not 
 make light of afflictions, and be stupid and insensible under them, for 
 they are the hand and rod of God, and his rebukes for sin. Those who 
 make light of affliction make light of God and make light of sin.

 (2.) They must not faint when they are rebuked; they must not despond 
 and sink under their trial, nor fret and repine, but bear up with faith 
 and patience. 

 (3.) If they run into either of these extremes, it is a sign they have 
 forgotten their heavenly Father's advice and exhortation, which he has 
 given them in true and tender affection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Afflictions, rightly endured, though they may be the fruits of God's 
 displeasure, are yet proofs of his paternal love to his people and care 
 for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he 
 receiveth.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) The best of God's children need chastisement. They have their 
 faults and follies, which need to be corrected. 

 (2.) Though God may let others alone in their sins, he will correct sin 
 in his own children; they are of his family, and shall not escape his 
 rebukes when they want them. 

 (3.) In this he acts as becomes a father, and treats them like 
 children; no wise and good father will wink at faults in his own 
 children as he would in others; his relation and his affections oblige 
 him to take more notice of the faults of his own children than those of 
 others.

 (4.) To be suffered to go on in sin without a rebuke is a sad sign of 
 alienation from God; such are bastards, not sons. They may call him 
 Father, because born in the pale of the church; but they are the 
 spurious offspring of another father, not of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Those that are impatient under the discipline of their heavenly 
 Father behave worse towards him than they would do towards earthly 
 parents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 Here,

 (1.) The apostle commends a dutiful and submissive behaviour in 
 children towards their earthly parents <I>We gave them reverence,</I> 
 even when they corrected us. It is the duty of children to give the 
 reverence of obedience to the just commands of their parents, and the 
 reverence of submission to their correction when they have been 
 disobedient. Parents have not only authority, but a charge from God, to 
 give their children correction when it is due, and he has commanded 
 children to take such correction well: to be stubborn and discontented 
 under due correction is a double fault; for the correction supposes 
 there has been a fault already committed against the parent's 
 commanding power, and superadds a further fault against his chastening 
 power. Hence, 

 (2.) He recommends humble and submissive behavior towards our heavenly 
 Father, when under his correction; and this he does by an argument from 
 the less to the greater. 

 [1.] Our earthly fathers are but <I>the fathers of our flesh,</I> but 
 God is <I>the Father of our spirits.</I> Our fathers on earth were 
 instrumental in the production of our bodies, which are but flesh, a 
 mean, mortal, vile thing, formed out of the dust of the earth, as the 
 bodies of the beasts are; and yet as they are curiously wrought, and 
 made parts of our persons, a proper tabernacle for the soul to dwell in 
 and an organ for it to act by, we owe reverence and affection to those 
 who were instrumental in their procreation; but then we must own much 
 more to him who is the Father of our spirits. Our souls are not of a 
 material substance, not of the most refined sort; they are not <I>ex 
 traduce--by traduction;</I> to affirm it is bad philosophy, and worse 
 divinity: they are the immediate offspring of God, who, after he had 
 formed the body of man out of the earth, breathed into him a vital 
 spirit, and so he became a living soul.

 [2.] Our earthly parents <I>chastened us for their own pleasure.</I> 
 Sometimes they did it to gratify their passion rather than to reform 
 our manners. This is a weakness the fathers of our flesh are subject 
 to, and this they should carefully watch against; for hereby they 
 dishonour that parental authority which God has put upon them and very 
 much hinder the efficacy of their chastisements. But the Father of our 
 spirits never grieves willingly, nor afflicts the children of men, much 
 less his own children. It is always <I>for our profit;</I> and the 
 advantage he intends us thereby is no less than our being partakers of 
 his holiness; it is to correct and cure those sinful disorders which 
 make us unlike to God, and to improve and to increase those graces 
 which are the image of God in us, that we may be and act more like our 
 heavenly Father. God loves his children so that he would have them to 
 be as like himself as can be, and for this end he chastises them when 
 they need it.

 [3.] The fathers of our flesh corrected us for <I>a few days,</I> in 
 our state of childhood, when minors; and, though we were in that weak 
 and peevish state, we owed them reverence, and when we came to maturity 
 we loved and honoured them the more for it. Our whole life here is a 
 state of childhood, minority, and imperfection, and therefore we must 
 submit to the discipline of such a state; when we come to a state of 
 perfection we shall be fully reconciled to all the measures of God's 
 discipline over us now.

 [4.] God's correction is no condemnation. His children may at first 
 fear lest affliction should come upon that dreadful errand, and we cry, 
 <I>Do not condemn me,</I> but <I>show me wherefore thou contendest with 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:2">Job x. 2</A>.

 But this is so far from being the design of God to his own people that
 he therefore chastens them now <I>that they may not be condemned with 
 the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:32">1 Cor. xi. 32</A>.

 He does it to prevent the death and destruction of their souls, that
 they may live to God, and be like God, and for ever with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The children of God, under their afflictions, ought not to judge of 
 his dealings with them by present sense, but by reason, and faith, and 
 experience: <I>No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but 
 grievous; nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The judgment of sense in this case--Afflictions are not grateful to
 the sense, but grievous; the flesh will feel them, and be grieved by 
 them, and groan under them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The judgment of faith, which corrects that of sense, and declares 
 that a sanctified affliction produces the fruits of righteousness; 
 these fruits are peaceable, and tend to the quieting and comforting of 
 the soul. Affliction produces peace, by producing more righteousness; 
 for the fruit of righteousness is peace. And if the pain of the body 
 contribute thus to the peace of the mind, and short present affliction 
 produce blessed fruits of a long continuance, they have no reason to 
 fret or faint under it; but their great concern is that the chastening 
 they are under may be endured by them with patience, and improved to a 
 greater degree of holiness. 

 [1.] That their affliction may be endured with patience, which is the 
 main drift of the apostle's discourse on this subject; and he again 
 returns to exhort them that for the reason before mentioned they should 
 <I>lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 A burden of affliction is apt to make the Christian's hands hang down, 
 and his knees grow feeble, to dispirit him and discourage him; but this 
 he must strive against, and that for two reasons:--

 <I>First,</I> That he may the better run his spiritual race and course.
 Faith, and patience, and holy courage and resolution, will make him 
 walk more steadily, keep a straighter path, prevent wavering and 
 wandering.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That he may encourage and not dispirit others that are 
 in the same way with him. There are many that are in the way to heaven 
 who yet walk but weakly and lamely in it. Such are apt to discourage 
 one another, and hinder one another; but it is their duty to take 
 courage, and act by faith, and so help one another forward in the way 
 to heaven.

 [2.] That their affliction may be improved to a greater degree of 
 holiness. Since this is God's design, it ought to be the design and 
 concern of his children, that with renewed strength and patience they 
 may <I>follow peace with all men, and holiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 If the children of God grow impatient under affliction, they will 
 neither walk so quietly and peaceably towards men, nor so piously 
 towards God, as they should do; but faith and patience will enable them 
 to follow peace and holiness too, as a man follows his calling, 
 constantly, diligently, and with pleasure. Observe, 

 <I>First,</I> It is the duty of Christians, even when in a suffering
 state, <I>to follow peace with all men,</I> yea, even with those who 
 may be instrumental in their sufferings. This is a hard lesson, and a 
 high attainment, but it is what Christ has called his people to. 
 Sufferings are apt to sour the spirit and sharpen the passions; but the 
 children of God must follow peace with all men. 

 <I>Secondly,</I> Peace and holiness are connected together; there can 
 be no true peace without holiness. There may be prudence and discreet 
 forbearance, and a show of friendship and good-will to all; but this 
 true Christian peaceableness is never found separate from holiness. We 
 must not, under pretence of living peaceably with all men, leave the 
 ways of holiness, but cultivate peace in a way of holiness. 

 <I>Thirdly, Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.</I> The vision
 of God our Saviour in heaven is reserved as the reward of holiness, and 
 the stress of our salvation is laid upon our holiness, though a placid 
 peaceable disposition contributes much to our meetness for heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Where afflictions and sufferings for the sake of Christ are not 
 considered by men as the chastisement of their heavenly Father, and 
 improved as such, they will be a dangerous snare and temptation to 
 apostasy, which every Christian should most carefully watch against 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 <I>Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God,</I> 
 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here the apostle enters a serious caveat against apostasy, and 
 backs it with an awful example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He enters a serious caveat against apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Here you may observe, 

 <I>First,</I> The nature of apostasy: it is <I>failing of the grace of
 God;</I> it is to become bankrupts in religion, for want of a good 
 foundation, and suitable care and diligence; it is <I>failing of the 
 grace of God,</I> coming short of a principle of true grace in the 
 soul, notwithstanding the means of grace and a profession of religion, 
 and so coming short of the love and favour of God here and hereafter.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The consequences of apostasy: where persons fail of
 having the true grace of God, a root of bitterness will spring up, 
 corruption will prevail and break forth. A <I>root of bitterness,</I> a 
 bitter root, producing bitter fruits to themselves and others. It 
 produces to themselves corrupt principles, which lead to apostasy and 
 are greatly strengthened and radicated by apostasy--damnable errors (to 
 the corrupting of the doctrine and worship of the Christian church) and 
 corrupt practices. Apostates generally grow worse and worse, and fall 
 into the grossest wickedness, which usually ends either in downright 
 atheism or in despair. It also produces bitter fruits to others, to the 
 churches to which these men belonged; by their corrupt principles and 
 practices many are troubled, the peace of the church is broken, the 
 peace of men's minds is disturbed, and <I>many are defiled,</I> tainted 
 with those bad principles, and drawn into defiling practices; so that 
 the churches suffer both in their purity and peace. But the apostates 
 themselves will be the greatest sufferers at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The apostle backs the caution with an awful example, and that is, 
 that of Esau, who though born within the pale of the church, and having 
 the birthright as the eldest son, and so entitled to the privilege of 
 being prophet, priest, and king, in his family, was so profane as to 
 despise these sacred privileges, and to sell his birthright for a 
 morsel of meat. Where observe, 

 <I>First,</I> Esau's sin. He profanely despised and sold the
 birthright, and all the advantages attending it. So do apostates, who
 to avoid persecution, and enjoy sensual ease and pleasure, though they 
 bore the character of the children of God, and had a visible right to 
 the blessing and inheritance, give up all pretensions thereto. 
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Esau's punishment, which was suitable to his sin. His
 conscience was convinced of his sin and folly, when it was too late: 
 <I>He would afterwards have inherited the blessing,</I> &c. His 
 punishment lay in two things: 

 1. He was condemned by his own conscience; he now saw that the blessing
 he had made so light of was worth the having, worth the seeking, though 
 with much carefulness and many tears. 

 2. He was rejected of God: <I>He found no place of repentance</I> in
 God or in his father; the blessing was given to another, even to him to 
 whom he sold it for a mess of pottage. Esau, in his great wickedness, 
 had made the bargain, and God in his righteous judgment, ratified and 
 confirmed it, and would not suffer Isaac to reverse it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We may hence learn, 

 [1.] That apostasy from Christ is the fruit of preferring the 
 gratification of the flesh to the blessing of God and the heavenly 
 inheritance.

 [2.] Sinners will not always have such mean thoughts of the divine 
 blessing and inheritance as now they have. The time is coming when they 
 will think no pains too great, no cares no tears too much, to obtain 
 the lost blessing.

 [3.] When the day of grace is over (as sometimes it may be in this 
 life), they will find no place for repentance: they cannot repent 
 aright of their sin; and God will not repent of the sentence he has 
 passed upon them for their sin. And therefore, as the design of all, 
 Christians should never give up their title, and hope of their Father's 
 blessing and inheritance, and expose themselves to his irrevocable 
 wrath and curse, by deserting their holy religion, to avoid suffering, 
 which, though this may be persecution as far as wicked men are 
 concerned in it, is only a rod of correction and chastisement in the 
 hand of their heavenly Father, to bring them near to himself in 
 conformity and communion. This is the force of the apostle's arguing 
 from the nature of the sufferings of the people of God even when they 
 suffer for righteousness' sake; and the reasoning is very strong.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched,
 and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
 tempest,
 &nbsp; 19  And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which
 <I>voice</I> they that heard intreated that the word should not be
 spoken to them any more:
 &nbsp; 20  (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if
 so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or
 thrust through with a dart:
 &nbsp; 21  And so terrible was the sight, <I>that</I> Moses said, I
 exceedingly fear and quake:)
 &nbsp; 22  But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
 living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
 of angels,
 &nbsp; 23  To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which
 are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the
 spirits of just men made perfect,
 &nbsp; 24  And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
 blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than <I>that of</I>
 Abel.
 &nbsp; 25  See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they
 escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more <I>shall
 not</I> we <I>escape,</I> if we turn away from him that <I>speaketh</I> from
 heaven:
 &nbsp; 26  Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
 saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 27  And this <I>word,</I> Yet once more, signifieth the removing of
 those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that
 those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
 &nbsp; 28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let
 us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence
 and godly fear:
 &nbsp; 29  For our God <I>is</I> a consuming fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle goes on to engage the professing Hebrews to 
 perseverance in their Christian course and conflict, and not to relapse 
 again into Judaism. This he does by showing them how much the state of 
 the gospel church differs from that of the Jewish church, and how much 
 it resembles the state of the church in heaven, and on both accounts 
 demands and deserves our diligence, patience, and perseverance in 
 Christianity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows how much the gospel church differs from the Jewish church, 
 and how much it excels. And here we have a very particular description 
 of the state of the church under the Mosaic dispensation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18-21"><I>v.</I> 18-21</A>.

 1. It was a gross sensible state. Mount Sinai, on which that
 church-state was constituted, was a <I>mount that might be touched</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 a gross palpable place; so was the dispensation. It was very much 
 external and earthly, and so more heavy. The state of the gospel church 
 on mount Zion is more spiritual, rational, and easy. 

 2. It was a dark dispensation. Upon that mount there were blackness and
 darkness, and that church-state was covered with dark shadows and 
 types: the gospel state is much more clear and bright. 

 3. It was a dreadful and terrible dispensation; the Jews could not bear
 the terror of it. The thunder and the lightning, the trumpet sounding, 
 the voice of God himself speaking to them, struck them with such dread 
 that they <I>entreated that the word might not be so spoken to them any 
 more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Yea, Moses himself said, <I>I exceedingly fear and quake.</I> The best 
 of men on earth are not able to converse immediately with God and his 
 holy angels. The gospel state is mild, and kind, and condescending, 
 suited to our weak frame. 

 4. It was a limited dispensation; all might not approach to that mount,
 but only Moses and Aaron. Under the gospel we have all access with 
 boldness to God. 

 5. It was a very dangerous dispensation. The mount burned with fire,
 and whatever man or beast touched the mount must <I>be stoned, or 
 thrust through with a dart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It is true, it will be always dangerous for presumptuous and brutish 
 sinners to draw night to God; but it is not immediate and certain 
 death, as here it was. This was the state of the Jewish church, fitted 
 to awe a stubborn and hard-hearted people, to set forth the strict and 
 tremendous justice of God, to wean the people of God from that 
 dispensation, and induce them more readily to embrace the sweet and 
 gentle economy of the gospel church, and adhere to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows how much the gospel church represents the church
 triumphant in heaven, what communication there is between the one and 
 the other. The gospel church is called <I>mount Zion, the heavenly
 Jerusalem, which is free,</I> in opposition to mount Sinai, which 
 tendeth to bondage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:24">Gal. iv. 24</A>.

 This was the hill on which God set his king the Messiah. Now, in coming
 to mount Zion, believers come into heavenly places, and into a heavenly 
 society.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Into heavenly places. 

 (1.) <I>Unto the city of the living God.</I> God has taken up his 
 gracious residence in the gospel church, which on that account is an 
 emblem of heaven. There his people may find him ruling, guiding, 
 sanctifying, and comforting them; there he speaks to them by the gospel 
 ministry; there they speak to him by prayer, and he hears them; there 
 he trains them up for heaven, and gives them the earnest of their 
 inheritance. 

 (2.) To <I>the heavenly Jerusalem</I> as born and bred there, as free 
 denizens there. Here believers have clearer views of heaven, plainer 
 evidences for heaven, and a greater meetness and more heavenly temper 
 of soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To a heavenly society. 

 (1.) <I>To an innumerable company of angels,</I> who are of the same 
 family with the saints, under the same head, and in a great measure 
 employed in the same work, ministering to believers for their good, 
 keeping them in all their ways, and pitching their tents about them. 
 These for number are innumerable, and for order and union are a 
 company, and a glorious one. And those who by faith are joined to the 
 gospel church are joined to the angels, and shall at length be like 
 them, and equal with them. 

 (2.) <I>To the general assembly and church of the first-born, that are 
 written in heaven,</I> that is, to the universal church, however 
 dispersed. By faith we come to them, have communion with them in the 
 same head, by the same Spirit, and in the same blessed hope, and walk 
 in the same way of holiness, grappling with the same spiritual enemies, 
 and hasting to the same rest, victory, and glorious triumph. Here will 
 be the general assembly of the first-born, the saints of former and 
 earlier times, who saw the promises of the gospel state, but received 
 them not, as well as those who first received them under the gospel, 
 and were regenerated thereby, and so were the first-born, and the 
 first-fruits of the gospel church; and thereby, as the first-born, 
 advanced to greater honours and privileges than the rest of the world. 
 Indeed all the children of God are heirs, and every one has the 
 privileges of the first-born. The names of these are written in heaven, 
 in the records of the church here: they have a name in God's house, are 
 written among the living in Jerusalem; they have a good repute for 
 their faith and fidelity, and are enrolled in the Lamb's book of life, 
 as citizens are enrolled in the livery-books.

 (3.) <I>To God the Judge of all,</I> that great God who will judge both 
 Jew and Gentile according to the law they are under: believers come to 
 him now by faith, make supplication to their Judge, and receive a 
 sentence of absolution in the gospel, and in the court of their 
 consciences now, by which they know they shall be justified hereafter.
 
 (4.) <I>To the spirits of just men made perfect;</I> to the best sort 
 of men, the righteous, who are more excellent than their neighbours; to 
 the best part of just men, their spirits, and to these in their best 
 state, made perfect. Believers have union with departed saints in one 
 and the same head and Spirit, and a title to the same inheritance, of 
 which those on earth are heirs, those in heaven possessors. 

 (5.) <I>To Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of 
 sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</I> This is 
 none of the least of many encouragements there are to perseverance in 
 the gospel state, since it is a state of communion with Christ the 
 Mediator of the new covenant, and of communication of his blood, that 
 speaketh better things than the blood of Abel. 

 [1.] The gospel covenant is the new covenant, distinct from the 
 covenant of works; and it is now under a new dispensation, distinct 
 from that of the Old Testament.

 [2.] Christ is the Mediator of this new covenant; he is the middle 
 person that goes between both parties, God and man, to bring them 
 together in this covenant, to keep them together notwithstanding the 
 sins of the people and God's displeasure against them for sin, to offer 
 up our prayers to God, and to bring down the favours of God to us, to 
 plead with God for us and to plead with us for God, and at length to 
 bring God and his people together in heaven, and to be a Mediator of 
 fruition between them for ever, they beholding and enjoying God in 
 Christ and God beholding and blessing them in Christ.

 [3.] This covenant is ratified by the blood of Christ sprinkled upon 
 our consciences, as the blood of the sacrifice was sprinkled upon the 
 altar and the sacrifice. This blood of Christ pacifies God and
 purifies the consciences of men.

 [4.] This is speaking blood, and it speaks better things than that of 
 Abel.

 <I>First,</I> It speaks to God in behalf of sinners; it pleads not for
 vengeance, as the blood of Abel did on him who shed it, but for mercy.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> To sinners, in the name of God. It speaks pardon to
 their sins, peace to their souls; and bespeaks their strictest 
 obedience and highest love and thankfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle, having thus enlarged upon the argument to
 perseverance taken from the heavenly nature of the gospel church state, 
 closes the chapter by improving the argument in a manner suitable to 
 the weight of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 &c.): <I>See then that you refuse not him that speaketh</I>--that
 speaketh by his blood; and not only speaketh after another manner than 
 the blood of Abel spoke from the ground, but than God spoke by the 
 angels, and by Moses spoke on mount Sinai; then he spoke on earth, now 
 he speaks from heaven. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When God speaks to men in the most excellent manner he justly
 expects from them the most strict attention and regard. Now it is in 
 the gospel that God speaks to men in the most excellent manner. For, 
 
 (1.) He now speaks from a higher and more glorious seat and throne, not
 from mount Sinai, which was on this earth, but from heaven. 

 (2.) He speaks now more immediately by his inspired word and by his 
 Spirit, which are his witnesses. He speaks not now any new thing to 
 men, but by his Spirit speaks the same word home to the conscience. 
 
 (3.) He speaks now more powerfully and effectually. Then indeed his 
 voice shook the earth, but now, by introducing the gospel state, he 
 hath shaken not only the earth, but the heavens,--not only shaken the 
 hills and mountains, or the spirits of men, or the civil state of the 
 land of Canaan, to make room for his people,--not only shaken the 
 world, as he then did, but he hath shaken the church, that is, the 
 Jewish nation, and shaken them in their church-state, which was in 
 Old-Testament times a heaven upon earth; this their heavenly spiritual 
 state he hath now shaken. It is by the gospel from heaven that God 
 shook to pieces the civil and ecclesiastical state of the Jewish 
 nation, and introduced a new state of the church, that cannot be 
 removed, shall never be changed for any other on earth, but shall 
 remain till it be made perfect in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When God speaks to men in the most excellent manner, the guilt of
 those who refuse him is the greater, and their punishment will be more 
 unavoidable and intolerable; there is no escaping, no bearing it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The different manner of God's dealing with men under the gospel, in a 
 way of grace, assures us that he will deal with the despisers of the 
 gospel after a different manner than he does with other men, in a way 
 of judgment. The glory of the gospel, which should greatly recommend it 
 to our regard, appears in these three things:--

 (1.) It was by the sound of the gospel trumpet that the former
 dispensation and state of the church of God were shaken and removed; 
 and shall we despise that voice of God that pulled down a church and 
 state of so long standing and of God's own building? 

 (2.) It was by the sound of the gospel trumpet that a new kingdom was 
 erected for God in the world, which can never be so shaken as to be 
 removed. This was a change made once for all; no other change shall 
 take place <I>till time shall be no more.</I> We have now <I>received a 
 kingdom that cannot be moved,</I> shall never be removed, never give 
 way to any new dispensation. The canon of scripture is now perfected, 
 <I>the Spirit of prophecy has ceased,</I> the mystery of God is 
 finished, he has put his last hand to it. The gospel church may be made 
 more large, more prosperous more purified from contracted pollution, 
 but it shall never be altered for another dispensation; those who 
 perish under the gospel perish without remedy. And hence the apostle 
 justly concludes, 

 [1.] How necessary it is for us to obtain <I>grace from God, to serve 
 him acceptably:</I> if we be not accepted of God under this 
 dispensation, we shall never be accepted at all; and we lose all our 
 labour in religion if we be not accepted of God.

 [2.] We cannot worship God acceptably, unless we worship him with 
 <I>godly reverence and fear.</I> As faith, so holy fear, is necessary 
 to acceptable worship.

 [3.] It is only the grace of God that enables us to worship God in a 
 right manner: nature cannot come up to it; it can produce neither that 
 precious faith nor that holy fear that is necessary to acceptable 
 worship.

 [4.] God is the same just and righteous God under the gospel that he
 appeared to be under the law. Though he be our God in Christ, and now
 deals with us in a more kind and gracious way, yet he is in himself a 
 consuming fire; that is, a God of strict justice, who will avenge 
 himself on all the despisers of his grace, and upon all apostates. 
 Under the gospel, the justice of God is displayed in a more awful 
 manner, though not in so sensible a manner as under the law; for here 
 we behold divine justice seizing upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and making 
 him a propitiatory sacrifice, his soul and body an offering for sin, 
 which is a display of justice far beyond what was seen and heard on 
 mount Sinai when the law was given.</P>
