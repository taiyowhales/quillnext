 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
 to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
 &nbsp; 2  To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <I>but</I> gentle,
 showing all meekness unto all men.
 &nbsp; 3  For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
 deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
 and envy, hateful, <I>and</I> hating one another.
 &nbsp; 4  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour
 toward man appeared,
 &nbsp; 5  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
 according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
 regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
 &nbsp; 6  Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
 Saviour;
 &nbsp; 7  That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
 according to the hope of eternal life.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>This is</I> a faithful saying, and these things I will that
 thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God
 might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good
 and profitable unto men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the fourth thing in the matter of the epistle. The apostle had 
 directed Titus in reference to the particular and special duties of 
 several sorts of persons; now he bids him exhort to what concerned them 
 more in common, namely, to quietness and submission to rulers, and 
 readiness to do good, and to equitable and gentle behaviour towards all 
 men--things comely and ornamental of religion; he must therefore put
 them in mind of such things. Ministers are people's remembrancers of 
 their duty. As they are remembrancers for the people to God in prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6">Isa. lxii. 6</A>),

 so are they from God to them in preaching: <I>I will not be negligent 
 to put you always in remembrance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12">2 Pet. i. 12</A>.

 Forgetfulness of duty is a common frailty; there is need therefore of 
 reminding and quickening them thereto. Here are the duties themselves, 
 and the reasons of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duties themselves, which they were to be reminded of. 

 1. <I>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
 obey magistrates.</I> Magistracy is God's ordinance for the good of 
 all, and therefore must be regarded and submitted to by all; not for 
 wrath and by force only, but willingly and for conscience' sake.
 <I>Principalities,</I> and <I>powers,</I> and <I>magistrates,</I> that 
 is, all civil rulers, whether supreme and chief or subordinate, in the 
 government under which they live, of whatever form it be; that they be 
 subject to them and obey them in things lawful and honest, and which it 
 belongs to their office to require. The Christian religion was 
 misrepresented by its adversaries as prejudicial to the rights of 
 princes and civil powers, and tending to faction and sedition, and to 
 rebellion against lawful authority; therefore <I>to put to silence the 
 ignorance of foolish men,</I> and stop the mouths of malicious enemies, 
 Christians must be reminded to show themselves examples rather of all 
 due subjection and obedience to the government that is over them.
 Natural desire of liberty must be guided and bounded by reason and 
 scripture. Spiritual privileges do not make void or weaken, but confirm 
 and strengthen, their obligations to civil duties: "Remind them 
 therefore <I>to be subject to principalities and powers and to obey 
 magistrates.</I>" And, 

 2. <I>To be ready to every good work.</I> Some refer this to such good
 works as are required by magistrates and within their sphere: "Whatever 
 tends to good order, and to promote and secure public tranquility and 
 peace, be not backward, but ready, to promote such things." But, though 
 this be included, if not first intended, yet is it not to be hereto 
 restrained. The precept regards doing good in all kinds, and on every 
 occasion that may offer, whether resecting God, ourselves, or our 
 neighbour--what may bring credit to religion in the world. 
 <I>Whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good 
 report: if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think on these 
 things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>),

 to do and follow and further them. Mere harmlessness, or good words and 
 good meanings only, are not enough without good works. <I>Pure religion 
 and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the 
 fatherless, and the widow in their affliction, and keep unspotted from 
 the world.</I> "Not only take, but seek, occasion for doing good, keep 
 fitness and readiness that way; put it not off to others, but embrace 
 and lay hold on it thyself, delight and rejoice therein, put all in 
 mind of this." And, 

 3. <I>To speak evil of no man:</I> <B><I>medena blasphemein,</I></B> 
 <I>to revile,</I> or <I>curse,</I> or <I>blaspheme none:</I> or (as our 
 translation more generally) <I>to speak evil of none,</I> unjustly and 
 falsely, or unnecessarily, without call, and when it may do hurt but no 
 good to the person himself or any other. If no good can be spoken, 
 rather than speak evil unnecessarily, say nothing. We must never take 
 pleasure in speaking ill of others, nor make the worst of any thing, 
 but the best we can. We must not go up and down as tale-bearers, 
 carrying ill-natured stories, to the prejudice of our neighbour's good 
 name and the destruction of brotherly love. Misrepresentations, or
 insinuations of bad intentions, or of hypocrisy in what is done, things 
 out of our reach or cognizance, these come within the reach of this 
 prohibition. As this evil is too common, so it is of great malignity.
 <I>If any man seemeth to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, that 
 man's religion is vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:26">Jam. i. 26</A>.

 Such loose uncharitable talk is displeasing to God, and hurtful among 
 men.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:9">Prov. xvii. 9</A>,

 <I>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love</I> (that is, to
 himself by this tenderness and charity, or rather to the transgressor); 
 <I>but he that repeateth a matter</I> (that blazes and tells the faults 
 of another abroad) <I>separateth very friends;</I> he raises 
 dissensions and alienates his friend from himself, and perhaps from 
 others. This is among the sins to be put off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:31">Eph. iv. 31</A>);

 for, if indulged, it unfits for Christians communion here and the 
 society of the blessed in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:10">1 Cor. vi. 10</A>.
 
 Remind them therefore to avoid this. And,

 4. <I>To be no brawlers;</I> <B><I>amachous einai</I></B>--<I>no 
 fighters,</I> either with hand or tongue, no quarrelsome contentious 
 persons, apt to give or return ill and provoking language. A holy 
 contending there is for matters good and important, and in a manner 
 suitable and becoming, not with wrath nor injurious violence. Christian 
 must follow the things that are conducive to peace, and that in a 
 peaceful, not a rough and boisterous and hurtful way, but as becomes 
 the servants of the God of peace and love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19">Rom. xii. 19</A>),

 <I>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto 
 wrath;</I> this is the Christian's wisdom and duty. <I>The glory of a
 man is to pass over a transgression;</I> it is the duty of a 
 reasonable, and therefore certainly of a Christian man, whose reason is 
 improved and advanced by religion; such may not, and will not, 
 presently fall foul on one who has offended him, but, like God, will be 
 <I>slow to anger, and ready to forgive.</I> Contention and strife arise 
 from men's lusts, and exorbitant unruly passions, which must be curbed 
 and moderated, not indulged; and Christians need to be reminded of 
 these things, that they do not by a wrathful contentious spirit and 
 behaviour displease and dishonour God and discredit religion, promoting 
 feuds in the places where they live. <I>He that is slow to anger is
 better than the mighty,</I> and he <I>that ruleth his spirit than he 
 that taketh a city.</I> Wherefore it follows, 

 5. <I>But gentle;</I> <B><I>epieikeis,</I></B> <I>equitable and
 just,</I> or candid and fair in constructions of things, not taking 
 words or actions in the worst sense; and for peace sometimes yielding 
 somewhat of strict right. And, 

 6. <I>Showing all meekness to all men.</I> We must be of a mild
 disposition, and not only have meekness in our hearts, but show it in 
 our speech and conduct. <I>All meekness</I>--meekness in all instances 
 and occasions, not towards friends only, but <I>to all men,</I> though 
 still with wisdom, as James admonishes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:13">Jam. iii. 13</A>.

 "Distinguish the person and the sin; pity the one and hate the other.
 Distinguish between sin and sin; look not on all alike, there are 
 <I>motes and beams.</I> Distinguish also between sinner and sinner: 
 <I>of some have compassion, others save with fear, pulling them out of 
 the fire, thus making a difference,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:22,23">Jude 22, 23</A>.

 Mind these things; <I>the wisdom that is from above is pure and
 peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated.</I>" Meekness of spirit and 
 demeanour renders religion amiable; it is a commanded imitation of 
 Christ the grand exemplar, and what brings it own reward with it, in 
 the ease and comfort of the disposition itself and the blessings 
 accompanying it. These shall be glad and rejoice, shall be taught and 
 guided in their way, and satisfied with bread, and beautified with 
 salvation. Thus of the duties themselves, which Titus was to put people 
 in mind of: for which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He adds the reasons, which are derived</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From their own past condition. Consideration of men's natural 
 condition is a great means and ground of equity and gentleness, and all 
 meekness, towards those who are yet in such a state. This has a 
 tendency to abate pride and work pity and hope in reference to those 
 who are yet unconverted: "We ourselves also were so and so, corrupt and 
 sinful, therefore we should not be impatient and bitter, hard and 
 severe, towards those who are but as ourselves once were. Should we 
 then have been willing to be contemned, and proudly and rigorously 
 dealt with? No, but treated with gentleness and humanity; and therefore 
 we should now so treat those who are unconverted, according to that 
 rule of equity: <I>Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris--What you
 would not have done to you that do not you to another.</I>" Their past 
 natural condition is set forth in divers particulars. <I>We ourselves 
 also were sometimes,</I> 

 (1.) <I>Foolish;</I> without true spiritual understanding and 
 knowledge, ignorant of heavenly things. Observe, Those should be most 
 disposed to bear with others' follies who may remember many of their 
 own; those should be meek and gentle, and patient towards others, who 
 once needed and doubtless then expected the same. <I>We ourselves also 
 were sometimes foolish.</I> And, 

 (2.) <I>Disobedient;</I> heady and unpersuadable, resisting the word, 
 and rebellious even against the natural laws of God, and those which 
 human society requires. Well are these set together, <I>foolish</I> and 
 <I>obedient.</I> For what folly like this, to disobey God and his laws, 
 natural or revealed? This is contrary to right reason, and men's true 
 and greatest interests; and what so foolish as to violate and go 
 counter to these? 

 (3.) <I>Deceived,</I> or wandering; namely, out of the ways of truth 
 and holiness. Man in this his degenerate state is of a straying nature, 
 thence compared to a lost sheep; this must be sought and brought back, 
 and guided in the right way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:176">Ps. cxix. 176</A>.

 He is weak, and ready to be imposed upon by the wiles and subtleties of 
 Satan, and of men lying in wait to seduce and mislead.

 (4.) <I>Serving divers lusts and pleasures;</I> namely, as vassals and
 slaves under them. Observe, Men deceived are easily entangled and
 ensnared; they would not serve divers lusts and pleasures as they do, 
 were they not blinded and beguiled into them. See here too what a 
 different notion the word gives of a sensual and fleshly life from what 
 the world generally has of it. Carnal people think they enjoy their
 pleasures; the word calls it servitude and vassalage: they are very 
 drudges and bond slaves under them; so far are they from freedom and 
 felicity in them that they are captivated by them, and serve them as 
 taskmasters and tyrants. Observe further, It is the misery of the 
 servants of sin that they have many masters, one lust hurrying them one 
 way, and another; pride commands one thing, covetousness another, and 
 often a contrary. What vile slaves are sinners, while they conceit 
 themselves free! the lusts that tempt them promise them liberty, but in 
 yielding they become the servants of corruption; for <I>of whom a man 
 is overcome of the same is he brought into bondage.</I> 

 (5.) <I>Living in malice,</I> one of those lusts that bear rule in 
 them. Malice desires hurt to another and rejoices in it.

 (6.) <I>And envy,</I> which grudges and repines at another's good, 
 frets at his prosperity and success in any thing: both are roots of 
 bitterness, whence many evils spring: evil thoughts and speeches, 
 tongues <I>set on fire of hell,</I> detracting from and impairing the 
 just and due praises of others. <I>Their words are swords,</I> 
 wherewith they slay the good name and honour of their neighbour. This 
 was the sin of Satan, and of Cain who was of that evil one, and slew 
 his brother; for wherefore slew he him, but of this envy and malice, 
 <I>because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous?</I> 
 These were some of the sins in which we lived in our natural state.
 And, 

 (7.) <I>Hateful,</I> or odious--deserving to be hated.

 (8.) <I>And hating one another.</I> Observe, Those that are sinful,
 living and allowing themselves in sin, are hateful to God and all good 
 men. Their temper and ways are so, though not simply their persons. It
 is the misery of sinners that thy hate one another, as it is the duty 
 and happiness of saints to love one another. What contentions and 
 quarrels flow from men's corruptions, such as were in the nature of 
 those who by conversion are now good, but in their unconverted state 
 made them ready to run like furious wild beasts one upon another! The 
 consideration of its having been thus with us should moderate our 
 spirits, and dispose us to be more equal and gentle, meek and 
 tenderhearted, towards those who are such. This is the argument from 
 their own past condition here described. And he reasons,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From their present state. "We are delivered out of that our 
 miserable condition by no merit nor strength of our own; but only by 
 the mercy and free grace of God, and merit of Christ, and operation of 
 his Spirit. Therefore we have no ground, in respect of ourselves, to 
 condemn those who are yet unconverted, but rather to pity them, and 
 cherish hope concerning them, that they, though in themselves as 
 unworthy and unmeet as we were, yet may obtain mercy, as we have:" and
 so upon this occasion the apostle again opens the causes of our
 salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:4-7"><I>v.</I> 4-7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We have here the prime author of our salvation--God the Father,
 therefore termed here <I>God our Saviour. All things are of God, who
 hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18">2 Cor. v. 18</A>.

 All things belonging to the new creation, and recovery of fallen man to
 life and happiness, of which the apostle is there speaking, all these 
 things are of God the Father, as contriver and beginner of this work.
 There is an order in acting, as in subsisting. The Father begins, the 
 Son manages, and the Holy Spirit works and perfects all. God (namely, 
 <I>the Father</I>) is a Saviour by Christ, through the Spirit.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16">John iii. 16</A>,

 <I>God so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that
 whoever believes in him might not perish, but have everlasting
 life.</I> He is the Father of Christ, and through him the Father of
 mercies; all spiritual blessings are by Christ from him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph. i. 3</A>.

 <I>We joy in God through Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>.

 <I>And with one mind, and one mouth, glorify God, even the Father of
 our Lord Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:5">Rom. xv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The spring and rise of it--the divine <I>philanthropy,</I> or
 <I>kindness and love of God to man.</I> By grace we are saved from
 First to last. This is the ground and motive. God's pity and mercy to
 man in misery were the first wheel, or rather the Spirit in the wheels,
 that sets and keeps them all in motion. God is not, cannot be, moved by
 any thing out of himself. The occasion is in man, namely, his misery
 and wretchedness. Sin bringing that misery, wrath might have issued out
 rather than compassion; but God, knowing how to adjust all with his own
 honour and perfections, would pity and save rather than destroy. He
 delights in mercy. <I>Where sin abounded, grace did much more
 abound.</I> We read of <I>riches of goodness and mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4,Eph+2:7">Rom. ii. 4; Eph. ii. 7</A>.

 Let us acknowledge this, and give him the glory of it, not turning it
 to wantonness, but to thankfulness and obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is the means, or instrumental cause--the shining out of this
 love and grace of God in the gospel, <I>after it appeared,</I> that is, 
 in the word. The appearing of love and grace has, through the Spirit, 
 great virtue to soften and change and turn to God, and so is <I>the 
 power of God to salvation to every one that believeth.</I> Thus having 
 asserted God to be the author, his free grace the spring, and the 
 manifestation of this in the gospel the means of salvation, that the 
 honour of all still may be the better secured to him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) False grounds and motives are here removed: <I>Not by works of 
 righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved 
 us;</I> not for foreseen works of ours, but his own free grace and 
 mercy alone. Works must be in the saved (where there is room for it), 
 but not among the causes of his salvation; they are the way to the 
 kingdom, not the meriting price of it; all is upon the principle of 
 undeserved favour and mercy from first to last. Election is of grace: 
 we are chosen <I>to be</I> holy, not because it was antecedently seen 
 that we should be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4">Eph. i. 4</A>.

 It is the fruit, not the cause, of election: <I>God hath from the 
 beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit 
 and belief of the truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13">2 Thess. ii. 13</A>.

 So effectual calling, in which election breaks out, and is first seen:
 <I>He hath saved us, and called us with a holy calling; not according 
 to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was 
 given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:9">2 Tim. i. 9</A>.

 We <I>are justified freely by grace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:24">Rom. iii. 24</A>),

 and sanctified and saved by grace: <I>By grace you are saved, through
 faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:8">Eph. ii. 8</A>.
 
 Faith and all saving graces are God's free gift and his work; the
 beginning, increase, and perfection of them in glory, all are from him.
 In building men up to be a holy temple unto God, from the foundation to 
 the top-stone, we must cry nothing but <I>Grace, grace</I> unto it. It 
 is <I>not of works, lest any man should boast; but of grace, that he 
 who glorieth should glory only in the Lord.</I> Thus the true cause is 
 shown, and the false removed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Here is the formal cause of salvation, or that wherein it lies, 
 the beginnings of it at least--in regeneration or spiritual renewing, as
 it is here called. <I>Old things pass away, and all things become 
 new,</I> in a moral and spiritual, not in a physical and natural, 
 sense. It is the same man, but with other dispositions and habits; evil 
 ones are done away, as to the prevalency of them at present; and all 
 remains of them in due time will be so, when the work shall be 
 perfected in heaven. A new prevailing principle of grace and holiness 
 is wrought, which inclines, and sways, and governs, and makes the man a 
 new man, a new creature, having new thoughts, desires, and affections, 
 a new and holy turn of life and actions; the life of God in man, not 
 only from God in a special manner, but conformed and tending to him. 
 Here is salvation begun, and which will be growing and increasing to 
 perfection; therefore it is said, <I>He saved us.</I> What is so begun, 
 as sure to be perfected in time, is expressed as if it already were so. 
 Let us look to this therefore without delay; we must be initially saved 
 now, by regeneration, if on good ground we would expect complete 
 salvation in heaven. The change then will be but in degree, not in 
 kind. Grace is glory begun, as glory is but grace in its perfection. 
 How few mind this! Most act as if they were afraid to be happy before 
 the time; they would have heaven, they pretend, at last, yet care not 
 for holiness now; that is, they would have the end without the 
 beginning; so absurd are sinners. But without regeneration, that is, 
 the first resurrection, there is no attaining the second glorious one, 
 the resurrection of the just. Here then is formal salvation, in the new 
 divine life wrought by the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Here is the outward sign and seal thereof in baptism, called 
 therefore <I>the washing of regeneration.</I> The work itself is inward 
 and spiritual; but it is outwardly signified and sealed in this 
 ordinance. Water is of a cleansing and purifying nature, does away the 
 filth of the flesh, and so was apt to signify the doing away of the 
 guilt and defilement of sin by the blood and Spirit of Christ, though 
 that aptness alone, without Christ's institution, would not have been 
 sufficient. This it is that makes it of this signification on God's 
 part, a seal of righteousness by faith, as circumcision was, in the 
 place of which it succeeds; and on ours an engagement to be the Lord's. 
 Thus baptism saves figuratively and sacramentally, where it is rightly 
 used. <I>Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon 
 the name of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:16">Acts xxii. 16</A>.
 
 So 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:26">Eph. v. 26</A>,

 <I>That he might sanctify and cleanse us by the washing of water by the
 word.</I> Slight not this outward sign and seal, where it may be had 
 according to Christ's appointment; yet rest not in the outward washing, 
 but look to the <I>answer of a good conscience,</I> without which the 
 external washing will avail nothing. The covenant sealed in baptism 
 binds to duties, as well as exhibits and conveys benefits and 
 privileges; if the former be not minded, in vain are the latter 
 expected. Sever not what God has joined; in both the outer and inner 
 part is baptism complete; as he that was circumcised became debtor to 
 the whole law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:3">Gal. v. 3</A>),
 
 so is he that is baptized to the gospel, to observe all the commands 
 and ordinances thereof, as Christ appointed. <I>Disciple all nations, 
 baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
 Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have 
 commanded you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 This is the outward sign and seal of salvation, baptism, called here
 <I>the washing of regeneration.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) Here is the principal efficient, namely, the Spirit of God; it is 
 the <I>renewing of the Holy Ghost;</I> not excluding the Father and the 
 Son, who in all works without themselves are concurring; nor the use of 
 means, the word and sacraments, by which the Spirit works; through his 
 operation it is that they have their saving effect. In the economy of 
 our salvation, the applying and effecting part is especially attributed 
 to the Holy Spirit. We are said to be born of the Spirit, to be 
 quickened and sanctified by the Spirit, to be led and guided, 
 strengthened and helped, by the Spirit. Through him we mortify sin, 
 perform duty, walk in God's ways; all the acts and operations of the 
 divine life in us, the works and fruits of righteousness without us, 
 all are through this blessed and Holy Spirit, who is therefore called 
 the Spirit of life, and of grace and holiness; all grace is from him. 
 Earnestly therefore is he to be sought, and greatly to be heeded by us, 
 that we quench not his holy motions, nor resist and oppose him in his 
 workings. <I>Res delicatula est Spiritus--The Spirit is a tender
 thing.</I> As we act towards him, so may we expect he will to us; if we 
 slight, and resist, and oppose his workings, he will slacken them; if 
 we continue to vex him, he will retire. <I>Grieve not therefore the 
 Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of 
 redemption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:30">Eph. iv. 30</A>.

 The Spirit seals by his renewing and sanctifying, his witnessing and 
 assuring work; he distinguishes and marks out for salvation, and fits 
 for it; it is his work: we could not turn to God by any strength of our 
 own, any more than we can be justified by any righteousness of our 
 own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) Here is the manner of God's communicating this Spirit in the gifts
 and graces of it; not with a scanty and niggardly hand, but most freely 
 and plentifully: <I>Which he shed on us abundantly.</I> More of the 
 Spirit in its gifts and graces is poured out under the gospel than was 
 under the law, whence it is eminently styled <I>the ministration of the 
 Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:8">2 Cor. iii. 8</A>.

 A measure of the Spirit the church has had in all ages, but more in
 gospel times, since the coming of Christ, than before. <I>The law came
 by Moses, but grace and truth by Jesus Christ;</I> that is, a more
 plentiful effusion of grace, fulfilling the promises and prophecies of
 old. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>,

 <I>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry 
 ground. I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy 
 offspring:</I> this greatest and best of blessings, an effusion of 
 grace, and of the sanctifying gifts of the Spirit.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joel ii. 28</A>,

 <I>I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh;</I> not on Jews only, but
 Gentiles also. This was to be in gospel times; and accordingly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:17,18,33">Acts ii. 17, 18, 33</A>),

 speaking of Christ risen and ascended, <I>having received of the Father
 the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth</I> (says Peter)
 <I>this that you now see and hear:</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:44,45"><I>ch.</I> x. 44, 45</A>,

 <I>The Holy Ghost fell on all those that heart the word,</I> Gentiles
 as well as Jews. This indeed was, in a great measure, in the miraculous 
 gifts of the Holy Ghost, but not without his sanctifying graces also 
 accompanying many if not all of them. There was then great abundance of 
 common gifts of illumination, outward calling and profession, and 
 general faith, and of more special gifts of sanctification too, such as 
 faith, and hope, and love, and other graces of the Spirit. Let us get a 
 share in these. What will it signify if much be shed forth and we 
 remain dry? Our condemnation will but be aggravated the more if under 
 such a dispensation of grace we remain void of grace. <I>Be filled with 
 the Spirit,</I> says the apostle; it is duty as well as privilege, 
 because of the means which God in the gospel is ready to bless and make 
 effectual; this is the manner of God's communicating grace and all 
 spiritual blessings under the gospel--<I>plentifully;</I> he is not 
 straitened towards us, but we towards him and in ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (9.) Here is the procuring cause of all, namely, Christ: <I>Through 
 Jesus Christ our Saviour.</I> He it is who purchased the Spirit and his 
 saving gifts and graces. All come through him, and through him as a 
 Saviour, whose undertaking and work it is to bring to grace and glory; 
 he is our righteousness and peace, and our head, from whom we have all 
 spiritual life and influences. <I>He is made of God to us wisdom, 
 righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</I> Let us praise God 
 for him above all; let us go to the Father by him, and improve him to 
 all sanctifying and saving purposes. Have we grace? Let us thank him 
 with the Father and Spirit for it: <I>account all things but loss and 
 dung for the excellency of the knowledge of him,</I> and grow and 
 increase therein more and more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (10.) Here are the ends why we are brought into this new spiritual
 condition, namely, justification, and heirship, and hope of eternal 
 life: <I>That, being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs 
 according to the hope of eternal life.</I> Justification in the gospel 
 sense is the free remission of a sinner, and accepting him as righteous 
 through the righteousness of Christ received by faith. In it there is 
 the removing of guilt that bound to punishment, and the accepting and 
 dealing with the person as one that now is righteous in God's sight. 
 This God does freely as to us, yet through the intervention of Christ's 
 sacrifice and righteousness, laid hold on by faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:20">Rom. iii. 20</A>,

 &c.): <I>By the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified;</I> but
 through <I>the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ 
 unto all and upon all those that believe,</I> whence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 we are said to be <I>justified freely by his grace, through the 
 redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a 
 propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness 
 for the remission of sins, that he might be just, and the justifier of 
 him that believeth in Jesus.</I> God, in justifying a sinner in the way 
 of the gospel, is gracious to him, and yet just to himself and his law, 
 forgiveness being through a perfect righteousness, and satisfaction 
 made to justice by Christ, who is the propitiation for sin, and not 
 merited by the sinner himself. So it is here: <I>Not by works of 
 righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved 
 us, that, being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs 
 according to the hope of eternal life.</I> It is by grace, as the 
 spring and rise (as was said), though <I>through the redemption that is 
 in Christ</I> as making the way, God's law and justice being thereby 
 satisfied, and by faith applying that redemption. <I>By him</I> (by 
 Christ) <I>all that believe are justified from all things from which
 they could not be justified by the law of Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:39">Acts xiii. 39</A>.

 Hence the apostle desires <I>to be found in him, not having his own
 righteousness, which was of the law, but that which is through the 
 faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</I> Let us 
 not trust therefore in our own righteousness or merit of good works, 
 but in Christ's righteousness alone, received by faith for 
 justification and acceptance with God. Inherent righteousness we must
 have, and the fruits of it in works of obedience; not however as our 
 justifying righteousness before God, but as fruits of our 
 justification, and evidences of our interest in Christ and 
 qualification for life and happiness, and the very beginning and part 
 of it; but the procuring of all this is by Christ, that, <I>being 
 justified by his grace, we should be made heirs.</I> Observe, Our 
 justification is <I>by the grace of God,</I> and our justification by 
 that grace is necessary in order to our being made <I>heirs of eternal 
 life;</I> without such justification there can be no adoption and 
 sonship, and so no right of inheritance.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12">John i. 12</A>,

 <I>Whoever received him</I> (namely, Christ), <I>to them gave he power
 to become the sons of God, even to those that believed on his name.</I> 
 Eternal life is set before us in the promise, the Spirit works faith in 
 us and hope of that life, and so are we made heirs of it and have a 
 kind of possession of it even now; faith and hope bring it near, and 
 fill with joy in the well-grounded expectation of it. The meanest 
 believer is a great heir. Though he has not his portion in hand, he
 has good hope through grace, and may bear up under all difficulties. 
 There is a better state in view. He is waiting for <I>an inheritance 
 incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven 
 for him.</I> How well may such comfort themselves with these words! And 
 now all this gives good reason why we should <I>show all meekness to 
 all men,</I> because we have experienced so much benefit by the 
 kindness and love of God to us, and may hope that they, in God's time, 
 may be partakers of the like grace as we are. And thus of the reasons 
 of equal and gentle, meek and tender behaviour to wards others, from 
 their own bad condition in time past, and the present more happy state 
 into which they are brought, without any merit or deservings of their 
 own, and whereinto by the same grace others may be brought also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle, having opened the duties of Christians in common, 
 with the reasons respecting themselves, adds another from their 
 goodness and usefulness to men. Observe, When he has opened the grace 
 of God towards us, he immediately presses the necessity of good works; 
 for we must not expect the benefit of God's mercy, unless we make 
 conscience of our duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm 
 constantly</I> (this is a true Christian doctrine of highest 
 importance, and which ministers must most earnestly and constantly 
 press and inculcate), <I>that those who have believed in God</I> do not 
 think that a bare naked faith will save them; but it must be an 
 operative working faith, bringing forth the fruit of righteousness; 
 they must make it their care <I>to maintain good works,</I> not to do 
 them occasionally only, and when opportunities come in their way, but 
 to seek opportunities for doing them. <I>These things are good and 
 profitable unto men:</I> these <I>good works,</I> say some, or <I>the 
 teaching of these things,</I> rather than idle questions, as follows. 
 These things are good in themselves and the teaching of them useful to 
 mankind, making persons a common good in their places. Note, Ministers, 
 in teaching, must see that they deliver what is sound and good in 
 itself, and profitable to those that hear: all must be to the use of 
 edifying both of persons and societies.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the fifth and last thing in the matter of the epistle: what 
 Titus should avoid in teaching; how he should deal with a heretic; with 
 some other directions. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the apostle's meaning might be more clear and full, and 
 especially fitted to the time and state of things in Crete, and the 
 many judaizers among them, he tells Titus what, in teaching, he should 
 shun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 There are needful questions to be discussed and cleared, such as make 
 for improvement in useful knowledge; but idle and foolish enquiries, 
 tending neither to God's glory nor the edification of men, must be 
 shunned. Some may have a show of wisdom, but are vain, as many among 
 the Jewish doctors, as well as of later schoolmen, who abound with 
 questions of no moment or use to faith or practice; avoid 
 these.--<I>And genealogies</I> (of the gods, say some, that the heathen 
 poets made such noise about; or rather those that the Jews were so 
 curious in): some lawful and useful enquiries might be made into these 
 things, to see the fulfilling of the scriptures in some cases, and 
 especially in the descent of Christ the Messiah; but all that served to 
 pomp only, and to feed vanity, in boasting of a long pedigree, and much 
 more such as the Jewish teachers were ready to busy themselves in and 
 trouble their hearers with, even since Christ had come, and that 
 distinction of families and tribes had been taken away, as if they 
 would build again that policy which now is abolished, these Titus must 
 withstand as foolish and vain.--<I>And contentious, and strivings about 
 the law.</I> There were those who were for the Mosaic rites and 
 ceremonies, and would have them continued in the church, though by the 
 gospel and the coming of Christ they were superseded and done away.
 Titus must give no countenance to these, but avoid and oppose them; 
 <I>for they are unprofitable and vain:</I> this is to be referred to 
 all those <I>foolish questions and genealogies,</I> as well as those 
 <I>strivings about the law.</I> They are so far from instructing and 
 building up in godliness, that they are hindrances of it rather: the 
 Christian religion, and good works, which are to be maintained, will 
 hereby be weakened and prejudiced, the peace of the church disturbed, 
 and the progress of the gospel hindered. Observe, Ministers must not 
 only teach things good and useful, but shun and oppose the contrary, 
 what would corrupt the faith, and hinder godliness and good works; nor 
 should people have itching ears, but love and embrace sound doctrine, 
 which tends most to the use of edifying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But because, after all, there will be <I>heresies</I> and 
 <I>heretics</I> in the church, the apostle next directs Titus what to 
 do in such a case, and how to deal with such, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He who forsakes the truth as it is in Christ Jesus, who broaches false 
 doctrines and propagates them to the corrupting of the faith in weighty 
 and momentous points, and breaks the peace of the church about them, 
 after due means used to reclaim him, must be rejected. "Admonish him 
 once and again, that, if possible, he may be brought back, and thou 
 mayest gain thy brother; but, if this will not reduce him, that others 
 be not hurt, cast him out of the communion, and warn all Christians to 
 avoid him."--<I>Knowing that he that is such is subverted</I> (turned 
 off from the foundation) <I>and sinneth</I> grievously, being 
 <I>self-condemned.</I> Those who will not be reclaimed by admonitions, 
 but are obstinate in their sins and errors, <I>are subverted and 
 self-condemned;</I> they inflict that punishment upon themselves which 
 the governors of the church should inflict upon them: they throw 
 themselves out of the church, and throw off its communion, and so are 
 self-condemned. Observe,

 1. How great an evil real heresy is, not lightly therefore to be
 charged upon any, though greatly to be taken heed of by all. Such a one 
 is <I>subverted</I> or perverted--a metaphor from a building so ruined 
 as to render it difficult if not impossible to repair and raise it up 
 again. Real heretics have seldom been recovered to the true faith: not 
 so much defect of judgment, as perverseness of the will, being in the 
 case, through pride, or ambition, or self-willedness, or covetousness, 
 or such like corruption, which therefore must be taken heed of: "Be 
 humble, love the truth and practise it, and damning heresy will be 
 escaped." 

 2. Pains and patience must be used about those that err most
 grievously. They are not easily and soon to be given up and cast off, 
 but competent time and means must be tried for their recovery. 

 3. The church's means even with heretics are persuasive and rational.
 They must be admonished, instructed, and warned; so much 
 <B><I>nouthesia</I></B> imports. 

 4. Upon continued obstinacy and irreclaimableness, the church has
 power, and is obliged, to preserve its own purity, by severing such a 
 corrupt member which discipline may by God's blessing become effectual 
 to reform the offender, or if not it will leave him the more 
 inexcusable in his condemnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle subjoins some further directions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Here are two personal things enjoined:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Titus should hold himself ready to come to Paul at 
 <I>Nicopolis</I> (a city of Thrace, as is reckoned, on the borders of 
 Macedonia), as soon as <I>Artemas</I> or <I>Tychicus</I> should be sent 
 to Crete, to supply his place, and take care of the churches there when 
 he should leave them. The apostle would not have them in their young 
 and weak state be without one or other of chief sufficiency, to guide 
 and help them. Titus, it seems, was not their ordinary fixed bishop or 
 pastor, but an evangelist, otherwise Paul would not have called him so 
 much from his charge. Of Artemas we read little, but Tychicus is 
 mentioned on many occasions with respect. Paul calls him <I>a beloved 
 brother, and faithful minister, and fellow-servant in the Lord:</I> one 
 fit therefore for the service intimated. When Paul says to Titus, <I>Be 
 diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined there to 
 winter,</I> it is plain that the epistle was not written from 
 Nicopolis, as the postscript would have it, for then he would have said, 
 I determined <I>here,</I> not <I>there,</I> to winter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The other personal charge to Titus is that he would bring two of his 
 friends on their journey diligently, and see them furnished, so that 
 nothing should be wanting to them. This was to be done, not as a piece 
 of common civility only, but of Christian piety, out of respect both to 
 them and the work they were sent about, which probably was to preach 
 the gospel, or to be in some way serviceable to the churches. 
 <I>Zenas</I> is styled <I>the lawyer,</I> whether in reference to the 
 Roman or the Mosaic law, as having some time been his profession, is 
 doubtful. <I>Apollos</I> was an eminent and faithful minister. 
 Accompanying such persons part of their way, and accommodating them for 
 their work and journeys, was a pious and needful service; and to 
 further this, and lay in for it, what the apostle had before exhorted 
 Titus to teach 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 he repeats here: <I>Let ours also learn to maintain good works for 
 necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Let Christians, those who have believed in God, learn to <I>maintain 
 good works,</I> especially such as these, supporting ministers in their 
 work of preaching and spreading the gospel, hereby becoming 
 <I>fellow-helpers to the truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:5-8">3 John 5-8</A>.

 <I>That they be not unfruitful.</I> Christianity is not a fruitless
 profession; the professors of it must be <I>filled with the fruits of 
 righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of 
 God.</I> It is not enough that they be harmless, but they must be 
 profitable, doing good, as well as eschewing evil.--"<I>Let ours</I> set
 up and maintain some honest labour and employment, to provide for 
 themselves and their families, that they be not unprofitable burdens on 
 the earth;" so some understand it. Let them not think that Christianity 
 gives them a writ of ease; no, it lays an obligation upon them to seek 
 some honest work and calling, and therein <I>to abide with God.</I> 
 This is of good report, will credit religion and be good to mankind; 
 they will not be unprofitable members of the body, not burdensome and 
 chargeable to others, but enabled to be helpful to those in want. <I>To 
 maintain good works for necessary uses;</I> not living like drones on 
 the labours of others, but themselves fruitful to the common 
 benefit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle concludes with salutations and benedictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Though perhaps not personally known (some of them at least), yet all by 
 Paul testify their love and good wishes to Titus, owning him thereby in 
 his work, and stimulating him to go on therein. Great comfort and 
 encouragement it is to have the heart and prayers of other Christians 
 with and for us. <I>Greet those that love us in the faith,</I> or 
 <I>for the faith,</I> who are our loving fellow-christians. Holiness, 
 or the image of God in any, is the great endearing thing that gives 
 strength to all other bonds, and is itself the best. <I>Grace be with 
 you all. Amen.</I> This is the closing benediction, not to Titus alone, 
 but to all the faithful with him, which shows that though the epistle 
 bears the single name of Titus in the inscription, yet it was for the 
 use of the churches there, and they were in the eye, and upon the 
 heart, of the apostle, in the writing of it. "<I>Grace be with you 
 all,</I> the love and favour of God, with the fruits and effects 
 thereof, according to need, spiritual ones especially, and the increase 
 and feeling of them more and more in your souls." This is the apostle's 
 wish and prayer, showing his affection to them, his desire of their 
 good, and a means of obtaining for them, and bringing down upon them, 
 the thing requested. Observe, Grace is the chief thing to be wished and 
 begged for, with respect to ourselves or others; it is, summarily, all 
 good. <I>Amen</I> shuts up the prayer, expressing desire and hope, that 
 so it may, and so it shall be.</P>
