 He cautions them against judaizing seducers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and proposes his own example: and here he enumerates the privileges of
 his Jewish state which he rejected
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>),

 describes the matter of his own choice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9-16">ver. 9-16</A>),

 and closes with an exhortation to beware of wicked men, and to follow
 his example,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
 things to you, to me indeed <I>is</I> not grievous, but for you <I>it
 is</I> safe.
 &nbsp; 2  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the
 concision.
 &nbsp; 3  For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit,
 and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It seems the church of the Philippians, though a faithful and 
 flourishing church, was disturbed by the judaizing teachers, who 
 endeavoured to keep up the law of Moses, and mix the observances of it 
 with the doctrine of Christ and his institutions. He begins the chapter 
 with warnings against these seducers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He exhorts them to <I>rejoice in the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 to rest satisfied in the interest they had in him and the benefit they 
 hoped for by him. It is the character and temper of sincere Christians 
 to rejoice in Christ Jesus. The more we take of the comfort of our 
 religion the more closely we shall cleave to it: the more we rejoice in 
 Christ the more willing we shall be to do and suffer for him, and the 
 less danger we shalt be in of being drawn away from him. The <I>joy of 
 the Lord is our strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cautions them to take heed of those false teachers: <I>To write 
 the same thing to you to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is 
 safe;</I> that is, the same things which I have already preached to 
 you; as if he had said, "What has been presented to your ears shall be 
 presented to your eyes: what I have spoken formerly shall now be 
 written; to show that I am still of the same mind." <I>To me indeed is 
 not grievous.</I> Observe, 

 1. Ministers must not think any thing grievous to themselves which they
 have reason to believe is safe and edifying to the people. 

 2. It is good for us often to hear the same truths, to revive the
 remembrance and strengthen the impression of things of importance. It 
 is a wanton curiosity to desire always to hear some new thing. It is a 
 needful caution he here gives: <I>Beware of dogs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:10">Isa. lxvi. 10</A>),

 to which the apostle here seems to refer. <I>Dogs,</I> for their malice 
 against the faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at 
 them and biting them. They cried up good works in opposition to the 
 faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil workers: they boasted 
 themselves to be of the circumcision; but he calls them the concision: 
 they rent and tore the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces; or 
 contended for an abolished rite, a mere insignificant cutting of the 
 flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He describes true Christians, who are indeed the circumcision, the 
 spiritual circumcision, the peculiar of people of God, who are in 
 covenant with him, as the Old-Testament Israelites were: <I>We are the 
 circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ 
 Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</I> Here are three 
 characters:--

 1. They worshipped in the spirit, in opposition to the carnal
 ordinances of the Old-Testament, which consist in meats, and drinks, 
 and divers washings, &c. Christianity takes us off from these things,
 and teaches us to be inward with God in all the duties of religious 
 worship. We must <I>worship God in spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:24">John iv. 24</A>.

 The work of religion is to no purpose any further than the heart is
 employed in it. <I>Whatsoever we do, we must do it heartily as unto
 the Lord;</I> and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the 
 Divine Spirit, which is so peculiar to the gospel state, which is the 
 <I>ministration of the spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:8">2 Cor. iii. 8</A>.

 2. They <I>rejoice in Christ Jesus,</I> and not in the peculiar
 privileges of the Jewish church, or what answers to them in the 
 Christian church--mere outward enjoyments and performances. They 
 rejoice in their relation to Christ and interest in him. God made it 
 the duty of the Israelites to rejoice before him in the courts of his 
 house; but now that the substance has come the shadows are done away, 
 and we are to rejoice in Christ Jesus only. 

 3. They have no <I>confidence in the flesh,</I> in those carnal
 ordinances and outward performances. We must be taken off from trusting 
 in our own bottom, that we may build only on Jesus Christ, the 
 everlasting foundation. Our confidence, as well as our joy, is proper 
 to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any
 other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the
 flesh, I more:
 &nbsp; 5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, <I>of</I> the
 tribe of Benjamin, a hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law,
 a Pharisee;
 &nbsp; 6  Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
 righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
 &nbsp; 7  But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 8  Yea doubtless, and I count all things <I>but</I> loss for the
 excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I
 have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them <I>but</I>
 dung, that I may win Christ,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here proposes himself for an example of trusting in Christ 
 only, and not in his privileges as an Israelite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows what he had to boast of as a Jew and a Pharisee. Let none 
 think that the apostle despised these things (as men commonly do) 
 because he had them not himself to glory in. No, if he would have 
 gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause to do so as any 
 man: <I>If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof to trust in the 
 flesh, I more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He had as much to boast of as any Jew of them all. 

 1. His birth-right privileges. He was not a proselyte, but a native 
 Israelite: <I>of the stock of Israel.</I> And he was <I>of the tribe of 
 Benjamin,</I> in which tribe the temple stood, and which adhered to 
 Judah when all the other tribes revolted. Benjamin was the father's 
 darling, and this was a favourite tribe. <I>A Hebrew of the 
 Hebrews,</I> an Israelite on both sides, by father and mother, and from 
 one generation to another; none of his ancestors had matched with 
 Gentiles. 

 2. He could boast of his relations to the church and the covenant, for
 he was <I>circumcised the eighth day;</I> he had the token of God's 
 covenant in his flesh, and was circumcised the very day which God had 
 appointed. 

 3. For learning, he was a Pharisee, brought up at the feet of Gamaliel,
 an eminent doctor of the law: and was a scholar learned in all the 
 learning of the Jews, taught according to the perfect manner of the 
 laws of the fathers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:3">Acts xxii. 3</A>.

 He was a <I>Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6">Acts xxiii. 6</A>),

 and <I>after the most strict sect of his religion lived a Pharisee,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:5">Acts xxvi. 5</A>.

 4. He had a blameless conversation: <I>Toughing the righteousness which 
 is of the law, blameless:</I> as far as the Pharisees' exposition of 
 the law went, and as to the mere letter of the law and outward 
 observance of it, he could acquit himself from the breach of it and 
 could not be accused by any. 

 5. He had been an active man for his religion. As he made a strict
 profession of it, under the title and character of a Pharisee, so he 
 persecuted those whom he looked upon as enemies to it. <I>Concerning
 zeal, persecuting the church.</I> 

 6. He showed that he was in good earnest, though he had a zeal without
 knowledge to direct and govern the exercise of it: <I>I was zealous 
 towards God, as you all are this day, and I persecuted this way unto 
 the death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:3,4">Acts xxii. 3, 4</A>.

 All this was enough to have made a proud Jew confident, and was stock
 sufficient to set up with for his justification. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle tells us here how little account he made of these, in 
 comparison of his interest in Christ and his expectations from him: 
 <I>But what things were gain to me those have I counted loss for 
 Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 that is, those things which he had counted gain while he was a 
 Pharisee, and which he had before reckoned up, <I>these he counted loss 
 for Christ.</I> "I should have reckoned myself an unspeakable loser of, 
 to adhere to them, I had lost my interest in Jesus Christ." He counted 
 them loss; not only insufficient to enrich him, but what would 
 certainly impoverish and ruin him, if he trusted to them, in opposition 
 to Christ. Observe, The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing 
 but what he had himself did, to quit any thing but what he had himself 
 quitted, nor venture on any bottom but what he himself had ventured his 
 immortal soul upon.--<I>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss 
 for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Here the apostle explains himself. 

 1. He tells us what it was that he was ambitious of and reached after: 
 it was the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord, a believing experimental 
 acquaintance with Christ as Lord; not a merely notional and 
 speculative, but a practical and efficacious knowledge of him. So 
 knowledge is sometimes put for faith: <I>By his knowledge,</I> or the 
 knowledge of him, <I>shall my righteous servant justify many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.

 And it is the excellency of knowledge. There is an abundant and
 transcendent excellency in the doctrine of Christ, or the Christian 
 religion above all the knowledge of nature, and improvements of human 
 wisdom; for it is suited to the case of fallen sinners, and furnishes 
 them with all they need and all they can desire and hope for, with all 
 saving wisdom and saving grace.

 2. He shows how he had quitted his privileges as a Jew and a Pharisee:
 <I>Yea doubtless;</I> his expression rises with a holy triumph and 
 elevation, <B><I>alla men oun ge kai.</I></B> There are five particles 
 in the original: <I>But indeed even also do I count all things but 
 loss.</I> He had spoken before of <I>those things,</I> his Jewish 
 privileges: here he speaks of <I>all things,</I> all worldly enjoyments 
 and mere outward privileges whatsoever, things of a like kind or any 
 other kind which could stand in competition with Christ for the throne 
 in his heart, or pretend to merit and desert. There he had said that he 
 did count them but loss; but it might be asked, "Did he continue still 
 in the same mind, did he not repent his renouncing them?" No, now he 
 speaks in the present tense: <I>Yea doubtless, I do count them but 
 loss.</I> But it may be said, "It is easy to say so; but what would he 
 do when he came to the trial?" Why he tells us that he had himself 
 practised according to this estimate of the case: <I>For whom I have 
 suffered the loss of all things.</I> He had quitted all his honours and 
 advantages, as a Jew and a Pharisee, and submitted to all the disgrace 
 and suffering which attended the profession and preaching of the 
 gospel. When he embarked in the bottom of the Christian religion, he 
 ventured all in it, and suffered the loss of all for the privileges of 
 a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but dung, 
 <B><I>skybala</I></B>--<I>offals</I> thrown to dogs; they are not only 
 less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when 
 they come in competition with him. Note, The New Testament never
 speaks of saving grace in any terms of diminution, but on the contrary 
 represents it as the fruits of the divine Spirit and the image of God 
 in the soul of man; as a divine nature, and the seed of God: and faith 
 is called precious faith; and meekness is in the <I>sight of God of 
 great price,</I>

 death;

 dead.
 &nbsp; 12  Not as though I had already attained, either were already

 which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

 one thing <I>I do,</I> forgetting those things which are behind, and

 God in Christ Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We now heard what the apostle renounced; let us now see what he laid 
 hold on, and resolved to cleave to, namely, Christ and heaven. He had 
 his heart on these two great peculiarities of the Christian 
 religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle had his heart upon Christ as his righteousness. This is 
 illustrated in several instances. 

 1. He desired to win Christ; and an unspeakable gainer he would reckon
 himself if he had but an interest in Christ and his righteousness, and 
 if Christ became his Lord and his Saviour: <I>That I may win him;</I> 
 as the runner wins the prize, as the sailor makes the port he is bound 
 for. The expression intimates that we have need to strive for him and 
 after him, and that all is little enough to win him. 

 2. That he <I>might be found in him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as the manslayer was found in the city of refuge, where he was safe 
 from the avenger of blood,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:25">Num. xxxv. 25</A>.

 Or it alludes to a judicial appearance; so we are to be found of our
 Judge in peace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14">2 Pet. iii. 14</A>.

 We are undone without a righteousness wherein to appear before God, for
 we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus 
 Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have 
 interest or benefit by it but those who come off from confidence in 
 themselves, and are brought heartily to believe in him. "<I>Not having 
 my own righteousness, which is of the law;</I> not thinking that my 
 outward observances and good deeds are able to atone for my bad ones, 
 or that by setting the one over against the other I can come to balance 
 accounts with God. No, the righteousness which I depend upon is that 
 <I>which is through the faith of Christ,</I> not a legal, but 
 evangelical righteousness: <I>The righteousness which is of God by
 faith,</I> ordained and appointed of God." The Lord Jesus Christ is the
 Lord our righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:24,Jer+23:6">Isa. xlv. 24; Jer. xxiii. 6</A>.

 Had he not been God, he could not have been our righteousness; the
 transcendent excellence of the divine nature put such a value upon, and 
 such a virtue into, his sufferings, that they became sufficient to 
 satisfy for the sins of the world, and to bring in a righteousness 
 which will be effectual to all that believe. Faith is the ordained 
 means of actual interest and saving benefit in all the purchase of his 
 blood. It is <I>by faith in his blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25">Rom. iii. 25</A>.

 3. That he might know Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
 fellowship of his sufferings.</I> Faith is called knowledge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.

 Knowing him here is believing in him: it is an experimental knowledge
 of the <I>power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his 
 sufferings,</I> or feeling the transforming efficacy and virtue of 
 them. Observe, The apostle was as ambitious of being sanctified as he 
 was of being justified. He was as desirous to know the power of 
 Christ's death and resurrection killing sin in him, and raising him up 
 to newness of life, as he was to receive the benefit of Christ's death 
 and resurrection in his justification. 

 4. That he might be conformable unto him, and this also is meant of
 his sanctification. We are then made conformable to his death when we 
 die to sin, as Christ died for sin, when we are crucified with Christ, 
 the flesh and affections of it mortified, and the <I>world is crucified 
 to us,</I> and <I>we to the world, by virtue of the cross of 
 Christ.</I> This is our conformity to his death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle had his heart upon heaven as his happiness: <I>If by 
 any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The happiness of heaven is here called the resurrection of the dead, 
 because, though the souls of the faithful, when they depart, are 
 immediately with Christ, yet their happiness will not be complete till 
 the general resurrection of the dead at the last day, when soul and 
 body shall be glorified together. <B><I>Anastasis</I></B> sometimes
 signifies the future state. This the apostle had his eye upon; this he 
 would attain. There will be a resurrection of the unjust, who shall 
 arise to <I>shame and everlasting contempt;</I> and our care must be to 
 escape that: but the joyful and glorious resurrection of saints is 
 called <I>the resurrection,</I> <B><I>kat exochen</I></B>--<I>by
 eminence,</I> because it is in virtue of Christ's resurrection, as 
 their head and first-fruits; whereas the wicked shall rise only by the 
 power of Christ, as their judge. To the saints it will be indeed a 
 resurrection, a return to bliss, and life, and glory; while the 
 resurrection of the wicked is a rising from the grave, but a return to 
 a second death. It is called the <I>resurrection of the just,</I> and 
 the <I>resurrection of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:29">John v. 29</A>),

 and they are <I>counted worthy to obtain that world and the
 resurrection from the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:35">Luke xx. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This joyful resurrection the apostle pressed towards. He was willing 
 to do any thing, or suffer any thing, that he might attain that 
 resurrection. The hope and prospect of it carried him with so much 
 courage and constancy through all the difficulties he met with in his 
 work. He speaks as if they were in danger of missing it, and coming 
 short of it. A holy fear of coming short is an excellent means of 
 perseverance. Observe, His care to be found in Christ was in order to 
 his attaining the resurrection of the dead. Paul himself did not hope 
 to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the 
 merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ. "Let me be found in Christ, 
 that I may attain the resurrection of the dead, be found a believer in 
 him, and interested in him by faith," Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He looks upon himself to be in a state of imperfection and trial: 
 <I>Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Observe, The best men in the world will readily own their imperfection 
 in the present state. We have not yet attained, are not already 
 perfect; there is still much wanting in all our duties, and graces, and 
 comforts. If Paul had not attained to perfection (who had reached to so 
 high a pitch of holiness), much less have we. Again, <I>Brethren, I 
 count not myself to have apprehended</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <B><I>ou logizomai.</I></B> "I make this judgment of the case; I thus 
 reason with myself." Observe, Those who think they have grace enough 
 give proof that they have little enough, or rather that they have none 
 at all; because, wherever there is true grace, there is a desire of 
 more grace, and a pressing towards the perfection of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What the apostle's actings were under this conviction. Considering 
 that he had not already attained, and had not apprehended, he pressed 
 forward: "<I>I follow after</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <B><I>dioko</I></B>--<I>I pursue</I> with vigour, as one following 
 after the game. I endeavour to get more grace and do more good, and 
 never think I have done enough: <I>If that I may apprehend that for 
 which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.</I>" Observe, 

 [1.] Whence our grace comes--from our being apprehended of Christ 
 Jesus. It is not our laying hold of Christ first, but his laying hold 
 of us, which is our happiness and salvation. <I>We love him because he 
 first loved us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:19">1 John iv. 19</A>.

 Not our keeping hold of Christ, but his keeping hold of us, is our
 safety. We are <I>kept by his mighty power through faith unto 
 salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [2.] What the happiness of heaven is: it is <I>to apprehend that for
 which we are apprehended of Christ.</I> When Christ laid hold of us, it 
 was to bring us to heaven; and to apprehend that for which he 
 apprehended us is to attain the perfection of our bliss. He adds
 further 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>This one thing I do</I> (this was his great care and concern),
 <I>forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to 
 those things which are before.</I> There is a sinful forgetting of past 
 sins and past mercies, which ought to be remembered for the exercise of 
 constant repentance and thankfulness to God. But Paul forgot the things 
 which were behind so as not to be content with present measures of 
 grace: he was still for having more and more. So he <I>reaches 
 forth,</I> <B><I>epekteinomenos</I></B>--<I>stretched</I> himself 
 forward, bearing towards his point: it is expressive of a vehement 
 concern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The apostle's aim in these actings: <I>I press towards the mark, 
 for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He pressed towards the mark. As he who runs a race never takes up short 
 of the end, but is still making forwards as fast as he can, so those 
 who have heaven in their eye must still be pressing forward to it in 
 holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours and preparations. The 
 fitter we grow for heaven the faster we must press towards it. Heaven 
 is called here the mark, because it is that which every good Christian 
 has in his eye; as the archer has his eye fixed upon the mark he 
 designs to hit. <I>For the prize of the high calling.</I> Observe, A 
 Christian's calling is a high calling: it is from heaven, as its 
 original; and it is to heaven in its tendency. Heaven is the <I>prize 
 of the high calling;</I> <B><I>to brabeion</I></B>--<I>the prize</I> we 
 fight for, and run for, and wrestle for, what we aim at in all we do, 
 and what will reward all our pains. It is of great use in the Christian 
 course to keep our eye upon heaven. This is proper to give us measures 
 in all our service, and to quicken us every step we take; and it is of 
 God, from whom we are to expect it. <I>Eternal life is the gift of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:23">Rom. vi. 23</A>),

 but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it
 is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home 
 but by Christ as our way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and
 if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even
 this unto you.
 &nbsp; 16  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk
 by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having proposed himself as an example, urges the 
 Philippians to follow it. Let the same mind be in us which was in 
 blessed Paul. We see here how he was minded; let us be like-minded, and 
 set our hearts upon Christ and heaven, as he did.

 1. He shows that this was the thing wherein all good Christians were
 agreed, to make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another 
 world. This is that whereto we have all attained. However good 
 Christians may differ in their sentiments about other things, this is 
 what they are agreed in, that Christ is a Christian's all, that to win 
 Christ and to be found in him involve our happiness both here and 
 hereafter. And therefore let us walk by the same rule, and mind the 
 same thing. Having made Christ our all, <I>to us to live must be 
 Christ.</I> Let us agree to press towards the mark, and make heaven our 
 end. 

 2. That this is a good reason why Christians who differ in smaller
 matters should yet bear with one another, because they are agreed in 
 the main matter: "<I>If in any thing you be otherwise minded</I>--if 
 you differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment as to 
 meats and days, and other matters of the Jewish law--yet you must not 
 judge one another, while you all meet now in Christ as your centre, and 
 hope to meet shortly in heaven as your home. As for other matters of 
 difference, lay no great stress upon them, <I>God shall reveal even 
 this unto you.</I> Whatever it is wherein you differ, you must wait 
 till God give you a better understanding, which he will do in his due 
 time. In the mean time, <I>as far as you have attained,</I> you must go 
 together in the ways of God, join together in all the great things in 
 which you are agreed, and wait for further light in the minor things 
 wherein you differ."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which
 walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
 &nbsp; 18  (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell
 you even weeping, <I>that they are</I> the enemies of the cross of
 Christ:
 &nbsp; 19  Whose end <I>is</I> destruction, whose God <I>is their</I> belly, and
 <I>whose</I> glory <I>is</I> in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
 &nbsp; 20  For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look
 for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
 &nbsp; 21  Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned
 like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he
 is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He closes the chapter with warnings and exhortations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He warns them against following the examples of seducers and evil 
 teachers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 <I>Many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, 
 that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There are many called by Christ's name who are enemies to Christ's 
 cross, and the design and intention of it. Their walk is a surer 
 evidence what they are than their profession. By <I>their fruits you 
 shall know them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:20">Matt. vii. 20</A>.
 
 The apostle warns people against such,
 
 (1.) Very frequently: <I>I have told you often.</I> We so little heed
 the warnings given us that we have need to have them repeated. <I>To 
 write the same things is safe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 (2.) Feelingly and affectionately: <I>I now tell you weeping.</I> Paul 
 was upon proper occasions a weeping preacher, as Jeremiah was a weeping 
 prophet. Observe, An old sermon may be preached with new affections;
 what we say often we may say again, if we say it affectionately, and 
 are ourselves under the power of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives us the characters of those who were the enemies of the 
 cross of Christ. 

 (1.) Whose God is their belly. They minded nothing but their sensual 
 appetites. A wretched idol it is, and a scandal for any, but especially 
 for Christians, to sacrifice the favour of God, the peace of their 
 conscience, and their eternal happiness to it. Gluttons and drunkards 
 make a god of their belly, and all their care is to please it and make 
 provision for it. The same observance which good people give to God 
 epicures give to their appetites. Of such he says, <I>They serve not 
 the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>.

 (2.) They glory in their shame. They not only sinned, but boasted of it
 and gloried in that of which they ought to have been ashamed. Sin is 
 the sinner's shame, especially when it is gloried in. "They value
 themselves for what is their blemish and reproach." 

 (3.) They mind earthly things. Christ came by his cross to <I>crucify 
 the world to us and us to the world;</I> and those who mind earthly 
 things act directly contrary to the cross of Christ, and this great 
 design of it. They relish earthly things, and have no relish of the 
 things which are spiritual and heavenly. They set their hearts and 
 affections on earthly things; they love them, and even dote upon them, 
 and have a confidence and complacency in them. He gives them this 
 character, to show how absurd it would be for Christians to follow the 
 example of such or be led away by them; and, to deter us all from so 
 doing, he reads their doom. 

 (4.) Whose end is destruction. Their way seems pleasant, but death and 
 hell are at the end of it. <I>What fruit had you then in those things 
 whereof you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Rom. vi. 21</A>.

 It is dangerous following them, though it is going down the stream;
 for, if we choose their way, we have reason to fear their end. Perhaps 
 he alludes to the total destruction of the Jewish nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proposes himself and his brethren for an example, in opposition 
 to these evil examples: <I>Brethren, be followers together of me, and 
 mark those who walk as you have us for an example,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Mark them out for your pattern. He explains himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 by their regard to Christ and heaven: <I>For our conversation is in 
 heaven.</I> Observe, Good Christians, even while they are here on 
 earth, have their conversation in heaven. Their <I>citizenship</I> is 
 there, <B><I>politeuma.</I></B> As if he had said, We stand related to
 that world, and are citizens of the New Jerusalem. This world is not 
 our home, but that is. There our greatest privileges and concerns lie. 
 And, because our citizenship is there, our conversation is there; being 
 related to that world, we keep up a correspondence with it. The life of 
 a Christian is in heaven, where his head is, and his home is, and where 
 he hopes to be shortly; he <I>sets his affections upon things 
 above;</I> and where his heart is there will his conversation be. The 
 apostle had pressed them to follow him and other ministers of Christ: 
 "Why," might they say, "you are a company of poor, despised, persecuted 
 people, who make no figure, and pretend to no advantages in the world; 
 who will follow you?" "Nay," says he, "but our conversation is in 
 heaven. We have a near relation and a great pretension to the other 
 world, and are not so mean and despicable as we are represented." It is 
 good having fellowship with those who have fellowship with Christ, and 
 conversation with those whose conversation is in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because we look for the Saviour from heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> He 
 is not here, he has ascended, he has entered within the veil for us; 
 and we expect his second coming thence, to gather in all the citizens 
 of that New Jerusalem to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because at the second coming of Christ we expect to be happy and 
 glorified there. There is good reason to have our conversation in 
 heaven, not only because Christ is now there, but because we hope to be 
 there shortly: <I>Who shall change our vile bodies, that they may be 
 fashioned like unto his glorious body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There is a glory reserved for the bodies of the saints, which they will 
 be instated in at the resurrection. The body is now at the best a 
 <I>vile body,</I> <B><I>to soma tes tapeinoseos hemon</I></B>--<I>the 
 body of our humiliation:</I> it has its rise and origin from the earth, 
 it is supported out of the earth, and is subject to many diseases and 
 to death at last. Besides, it is often the occasion and instrument of 
 much sin, which is called the <I>body of this death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:24">Rom. vii. 24</A>.

 Or it may be understood of its vileness when it lies in the grave; at
 the resurrection it will be found a vile body, resolved into rottenness
 and dust; the <I>dust will return to the earth as it was,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>.

 But it will be made a glorious body; and not only raised again to life,
 but raised to great advantage. Observe, 

 (1.) The sample of this change, and that is, the glorious body of 
 Christ; when he was transfigured upon the mount, <I>his face did shine 
 as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:2">Matt. xvii. 2</A>.

 He went to heaven clothed with a body, that he might take possession of 
 the inheritance in our nature, and be not only the <I>first-born from 
 the dead,</I> but the <I>first-born</I> of the <I>children of the 
 resurrection.</I> We shall be <I>conformed to the image of his Son, 
 that he may be the first-born among many brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:29">Rom. viii. 29</A>.

 (2.) The power by which this change will be wrought: <I>According to
 the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto 
 himself.</I> There is an efficacy of power, an <I>exceeding greatness 
 of power,</I> and the <I>working of mighty power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19">Eph. i. 19</A>.

 It is matter of comfort to us that he can subdue all things to himself,
 and sooner or later will bring over all into his interest. And the 
 resurrection will be wrought by this power. <I>I will raise him up at 
 the last day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44">John vi. 44</A>.

 Let this confirm our faith of the resurrection, that we not only have 
 the scriptures, which assure us it shall be, but we <I>know the power 
 of God,</I> which can effect it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:29">Matt. xxii. 29</A>.

 At Christ's resurrection was a glorious instance of the divine power,
 and therefore <I>he is declared to be the Son of God with power, by the 
 resurrection from the dead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>),

 so will our resurrection be: and his resurrection is a standing
 evidence, as well as pattern, of ours. And then all the enemies of the 
 Redeemer's kingdom will be completely conquered. Not only he <I>who had 
 the power of death,</I> that is, <I>the devil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>),

 but the <I>last enemy, shall be destroyed,</I> that is, <I>death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26">1 Cor. xv. 26</A>,

 <I>shall be swallowed up in victory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.</P>
