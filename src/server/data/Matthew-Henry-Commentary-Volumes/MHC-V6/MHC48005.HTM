 In this chapter the apostle comes to make application of his foregoing
 discourse. He begins it with a general caution, or exhortation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1">ver. 1</A>),

 which he afterwards enforces by several considerations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:2-12">ver. 2-12</A>.

 He then presses them to serious practical godliness, which would be the
 best antidote against the snares of their false teachers; particularly,

 I. That they should not strive with one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 II. That they would strive against sin, where he shows, 

 1. That there is in every one a struggle between flesh and spirit, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:17">ver. 17</A>.

 2. That it is our duty and interest, in this struggle, to side with the
 better part, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:16,18">ver. 16, 18</A>.

 3. He specifies the works of the flesh, which must be watched against 
 and mortified, and the fruits of the Spirit, which must be brought 
 forth and cherished, and shows of what importance it is that they be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 And then concludes the chapter with a caution against pride and 
 envy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
 made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of
 bondage.
 &nbsp; 2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised,
 Christ shall profit you nothing.
 &nbsp; 3  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he
 is a debtor to do the whole law.
 &nbsp; 4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
 justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
 &nbsp; 5  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness
 by faith.
 &nbsp; 6  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
 nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
 &nbsp; 7  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey
 the truth?
 &nbsp; 8  This persuasion <I>cometh</I> not of him that calleth you.
 &nbsp; 9  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
 &nbsp; 10  I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be
 none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his

 &nbsp; 11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
 suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
 &nbsp; 12  I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the former part of this chapter the apostle cautions the Galatians 
 to take heed of the judaizing teachers, who endeavoured to bring them 
 back under the bondage of the law. He had been arguing against them 
 before, and had largely shown how contrary the principles and spirit of 
 those teachers were to the spirit of the gospel; and now this is as it 
 were the general inference or application of all that discourse. Since 
 it appeared by what had been said that we can be justified only by 
 faith in Jesus Christ, and not by the righteousness of the law, and 
 that the law of Moses was no longer in force, nor Christians under any 
 obligation to submit to it, therefore he would have them to <I>stand 
 fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and not to be 
 again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</I> Here observe, 

 1. Under the gospel we are enfranchised, we are brought into a state of
 liberty, wherein we are freed from the yoke of the ceremonial law and 
 from the curse of the moral law; so that we are no longer tied to the 
 observance of the one, nor tied up to the rigour of the other, which 
 curses every one that continues not in all things written therein to do 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10"><I>ch.</I> iii. 10</A>.

 2. We owe this liberty to Jesus Christ. It is he who <I>has made us
 free;</I> by his merits he has satisfied the demands of the broken law, 
 and by his authority as a king he has discharged us from the obligation 
 of those carnal ordinances which were imposed on the Jews. And,

 3. It is therefore our duty to <I>stand fast in this liberty,</I>
 constantly and faithfully to adhere to the gospel and to the liberty of 
 it, and not to suffer ourselves, upon any consideration, <I>to be again 
 entangled in the yoke of bondage,</I> nor persuaded to return back to 
 the law of Moses. This is the general caution or exhortation, which in 
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13-26">following verses</A>

 the apostle enforces by several reasons or arguments. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That their submitting to circumcision, and depending on the works of 
 the law for righteousness, were an implicit contradiction of their 
 faith as Christians and a forfeiture of all their advantages by Jesus 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 And here we may observe, 

 1. With what solemnity the apostle asserts and declares this:
 <I>Behold, I Paul say unto you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and he repeats it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>I testify unto you;</I> as it he had said, "I, who have proved 
 myself an apostle of Christ, and to have received my authority and 
 instructions from him, do declare, and am ready to pawn my credit and 
 reputation upon it, <I>that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit 
 you nothing,</I> &c.," wherein he shows that what he was now saying was 
 not only a matter of great importance, but what might be most assuredly 
 depended on. He was so far from being a preacher of circumcision (as 
 some might report him to be) that he looked upon it as a matter of the 
 greatest consequence that they did not submit to it. 

 2. What it is which he so solemnly, and with so much assurance,
 declares; it is that, <I>if they were circumcised, Christ would profit 
 them nothing,</I> &c. We are not to suppose that it is mere
 circumcision which the apostle is here speaking of, or that it was his 
 design to say that none who are circumcised could have any benefit by 
 Christ; for all the Old-Testament saints had been circumcised, and he 
 himself had consented to the circumcising of Timothy. But he is to be 
 understood as speaking of circumcision in the sense in which the 
 judaizing teachers imposed it, who taught <I>that except they were 
 circumcised, and kept the law of Moses, they could not be saved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1">Acts xv. 1</A>.

 That this is his meaning appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 where he expresses the same thing by their being <I>justified by the 
 law,</I> or seeking justification by the works of it. Now in this case, 
 if they submitted to circumcision in this sense, he declares that 
 <I>Christ would profit them nothing, that they were debtors to do the 
 whole law,</I> that <I>Christ had become of no effect to them,</I> and 
 that <I>they were fallen from grace.</I> From all these expressions it 
 appears that thereby they renounced that way of justification which God 
 had established; yea, that they laid themselves under an impossibility 
 of being justified in his sight, for they became debtors to do the 
 whole law, which required such an obedience as they were not capable of 
 performing, and denounced a curse against those who failed in it, and 
 therefore condemned, but could not justify them; and, consequently, 
 that having thus revolted from Christ, and built their hopes upon the 
 law, Christ would profit them nothing, nor be of any effect to them.
 Thus, as by being circumcised they renounced their Christianity, so 
 they cut themselves off from all advantage by Christ; and therefore 
 there was the greatest reason why they should stedfastly adhere to that 
 doctrine which they had embraced, and not suffer themselves to be 
 brought under this yoke of bondage. Note,

 (1.) Though Jesus Christ is able to save to the uttermost, yet there 
 are multitudes whom he will profit nothing. 

 (2.) All those who seek to be justified by the law do thereby render 
 Christ of no effect to them. By building their hopes on the works of
 the law, they forfeit all their hopes from him; for he will not be the 
 Saviour of any who will not own and rely upon him as their only 
 Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To persuade them to stedfastness in the doctrine and liberty of the 
 gospel, he sets before them his own example, and that of other Jews who 
 had embraced the Christian religion, and acquaints them what their 
 hopes were, namely, That <I>through the Spirit they were waiting for 
 the hope of righteousness by faith.</I> Though they were Jews by 
 nature, and had been bred up under the law, yet being, through the 
 Spirit, brought to the knowledge of Christ, they had renounced all 
 dependence on the works of the law, and looked for justification and 
 salvation only by faith in him; and therefore it must needs be the 
 greatest folly in those who had never been under the law to suffer 
 themselves to be brought into subjection to it, and to found their 
 hopes upon the works of it. Here we may observe, 

 1. What it is that Christians are waiting for: it is <I>the hope of 
 righteousness,</I> by which we are chiefly to understand the happiness 
 of the other world. This is called the hope of Christians, as it is
 the great object of their hope, which they are above every thing else 
 desiring and pursuing; and the hope of righteousness, as their hopes of 
 it are founded on righteousness, not their own, but that of our Lord 
 Jesus: for, though a life of righteousness is the way that leads to 
 this happiness, yet it is the righteousness of Christ alone which has 
 procured it for us, and on account of which we can expect to be brought 
 to the possession of it. 

 2. How they hope to obtain this happiness, namely, by faith, that is,
 in our Lord Jesus Christ, not by the works of the law, or any thing 
 they can do to deserve it, but only by faith, receiving and relying 
 upon him as the Lord our righteousness. It is in this way only that 
 they expect either to be entitled to it here or possessed of it 
 hereafter. And, 

 3. Whence it is that they are thus waiting for the hope of
 righteousness: it is <I>through the Spirit.</I> Herein they act under 
 the direction and influence of the Holy Spirit; it is under his 
 conduct, and by his assistance, that they are both persuaded and 
 enabled to believe on Christ, and to look for the hope of righteousness 
 through him. When the apostle thus represents the case of Christians, 
 it is implied that if they expected to be justified and saved in any 
 other way they were likely to meet with a disappointment, and therefore 
 that they were greatly concerned to adhere to the doctrine of the 
 gospel which they had embraced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He argues from the nature and design of the Christian institution, 
 which was to abolish the difference between Jew and Gentile, and to 
 establish faith in Christ as the way of our acceptance with God. He 
 tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that <I>in Christ Jesus,</I> or under the gospel dispensation, 
 <I>neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision.</I> 
 Though, while the legal state lasted, there was a difference put 
 between Jew and Greek, between those who were and those who were not 
 circumcised, the former being admitted to those privileges of the 
 church of God from which the other were excluded, yet it was otherwise 
 in the gospel state: Christ, who is <I>the end of the law,</I> having 
 come, now it was neither here nor there whether a man were circumcised 
 or uncircumcised; he was neither the better for the one nor the worse 
 for the other, nor would either the one or the other recommend him to 
 God; and therefore as their judaizing teachers were very unreasonable 
 in imposing circumcision upon them, and obliging them to observe the 
 law of Moses, so they must needs be very unwise in submitting to them 
 herein. But, though he assures them that neither circumcision nor 
 uncircumcision would avail to their acceptance with God, yet he informs 
 them what would do so, and that is <I>faith, which worketh by love:</I> 
 such a faith in Christ as discovers itself to be true and genuine by a 
 sincere love to God and our neighbour. If they had this, it mattered 
 not whether they were circumcised or uncircumcised, but with out it 
 nothing else would stand them in any stead. Note, 

 1. No external privileges nor profession will avail to our acceptance 
 with God, without a sincere faith in our Lord Jesus. 

 2. Faith, where it is true, is a working grace: it works by love, love
 to God and love to our brethren; and faith, thus working by love, is 
 all in all in our Christianity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To recover them from their backslidings, and engage them to greater 
 stedfastness for the future, he puts them in mind of their good 
 beginnings, and calls upon them to consider whence it was that they 
 were so much altered from what they had been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells them that <I>they did run well;</I> at their first setting 
 out in Christianity they had behaved themselves very commendably, they 
 had readily embraced the Christian religion, and discovered a becoming 
 zeal in the ways and work of it; as in their baptism they were devoted 
 to God, and had declared themselves the disciples of Christ, so their 
 behaviour was agreeable to their character and profession. Note, 

 (1.) The life of a Christian is a race, wherein he must run, and hold 
 on, if he would obtain the prize. 

 (2.) It is not enough that we run in this race, by a profession of 
 Christianity, but we must run well, by living up to that profession. 
 Thus these Christians had done for awhile, but they had been obstructed 
 in their progress, and were either turned out of the way or at least 
 made to flag and falter in it. Therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He asks them, and calls upon them to ask themselves, <I>Who did 
 hinder you?</I> How came it to pass that they did not hold on in the 
 way wherein they had begun to run so well? He very well knew who they 
 were, and what it was that hindered them; but he would have them to put 
 the question to themselves, and seriously consider whether they had any 
 good reason to hearken to those who gave them this disturbance, and 
 whether what they offered was sufficient to justify them in their 
 present conduct. Note, 

 (1.) Many who set out fair in religion, and run well for awhile--run 
 within the bounds appointed for the race, and run with zeal and 
 alacrity too--are yet by some means or other hindered in their 
 progress, or turned out of the way. 

 (2.) It concerns those who have run well, but now begin either to turn
 out of the way or to tire in it, to enquire what it is that hinders 
 them. Young converts must expect that Satan will be laying stumbling 
 blocks in their way, and doing all he can to divert them from the 
 course they are in; but, whenever they find themselves in danger of 
 being turned out of it, they would do well to consider who it is that 
 hinders them. Whoever they were that hindered these Christians, the 
 apostle tells them that by hearkening to them they were kept from 
 <I>obeying the truth,</I> and were thereby in danger of losing the 
 benefit of what they had done in religion. The gospel which he had 
 preached to them, and which they had embraced and professed, he assures 
 them was the truth; it was therein only that the true way of 
 justification and salvation was fully discovered, and, in order to 
 their enjoying the advantage of it, it was necessary that they should 
 obey it, that they should firmly adhere to it, and continue to govern 
 their lives and hopes according to the directions of it. If therefore 
 they should suffer themselves to be drawn away from it they must needs 
 be guilty of the greatest weakness and folly. Note,

 [1.] The truth is not only to be believed, but to be obeyed, to be 
 received not only in the light of it, but in the love and power of it.

 [2.] Those do not rightly obey the truth, who do not stedfastly adhere 
 to it.

 [3.] There is the same reason for our obeying the truth that there was 
 for our embracing it: and therefore those act very unreasonably who, 
 when they have begun to run well in the Christian race, suffer 
 themselves to be hindered, so as not to persevere in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He argues for their stedfastness in the faith and liberty of the 
 gospel from the ill rise of that persuasion whereby they were drawn 
 away from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>This persuasion,</I> says he, <I>cometh not of him that calleth 
 you.</I> The opinion or persuasion of which the apostle here speaks was 
 no doubt that of the necessity of their being circumcised, and keeping 
 the law of Moses, or of their mixing the works of the law with faith in 
 Christ in the business of justification. This was what the judaizing 
 teachers endeavoured to impose upon them, and what they had too easily 
 fallen into. To convince them of their folly herein, he tells them that 
 this persuasion did not come of him that called them, that is, either 
 of God, by whose authority the gospel had been preached to them and 
 they had been called into the fellowship of it, or of the apostle 
 himself, who had been employed as the instrument of calling them 
 hereunto. It could not come from God, for it was contrary to that way 
 of justification and salvation which he had established; nor could they 
 have received it from Paul himself; for, whatever some might pretend, 
 he had all along been an opposer and not a preacher of circumcision, 
 and, if in any instance he had submitted to it for the sake of peace, 
 yet he had never pressed the use of it upon Christians, much less 
 imposed it upon them as necessary to salvation. Since then this
 persuasion did not come of him that had called them, he leaves them to 
 judge whence it must arise, and sufficiently intimates that it could be 
 owing to none but Satan and his instruments, who by this means were 
 endeavouring to overthrow their faith and obstruct the progress of the 
 gospel, and therefore that the Galatians had every reason to reject it, 
 and to continue stedfast in the truth which they had before embraced. 
 Note, 

 1. In order to our judging aright of the different persuasions in 
 religion which there are among Christians, it concerns us to enquire 
 whether they come of him that calleth us, whether or no they are 
 founded upon the authority of Christ and his apostles. 

 2. If, upon enquiry, they appear to have no such foundation, how
 forward soever others may be to impose them upon us, we should by no 
 means submit to them, but reject them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The danger there was of the spreading of this infection, and the 
 ill influence it might have upon others, are a further argument which 
 the apostle urges against their complying with their false teachers in 
 what they would impose on them. It is possible that, to extenuate their 
 fault, they might be ready to say that there were but few of those 
 teachers among them who endeavoured to draw them into this persuasion 
 and practice, or that they were only some smaller matters wherein they 
 complied with them--that though they submitted to be circumcised, and
 to observe some few rites of the Jewish laws, yet they had by no means 
 renounced their Christianity and gone over to Judaism. Or, suppose 
 their complying thus far was as faulty as he could represent it, yet 
 perhaps they might further say that there were but few among them who 
 had done so, and therefore he needed not be so much concerned about it. 
 Now, to obviate such pretences as these, and to convince them that 
 there was more danger in it than they were aware of, he tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that <I>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</I>--that the whole 
 lump of Christianity may be tainted and corrupted by one such erroneous 
 principle, or that the whole lump of the Christian society may be 
 infected by one member of it, and therefore that they were greatly 
 concerned not to yield in this single instance, or, if any had done so, 
 to endeavour by all proper methods to purge out the infection from 
 among them. Note, It is dangerous for Christian churches to encourage 
 those among them who entertain, especially who set themselves to 
 propagate, destructive errors. This was the case here. The doctrine 
 which the false teachers were industrious to spread, and which some in 
 these churches had been drawn into, was subversive of Christianity 
 itself, as the apostle had before shown; and therefore, though the 
 number either of the one or the other of these might be but small, yet, 
 considering the fatal tendency of it and the corruption of human 
 nature, whereby others were too much disposed to be infected with it, 
 he would not have them on that account to be easy and unconcerned, but 
 remember that <I>a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</I> If these 
 were indulged the contagion might soon spread further and wider; and, 
 if they suffered themselves to be imposed upon in this instance, it 
 might soon issue in the utter ruin of the truth and liberty of the 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That he might conciliate the greater regard to what he had said, 
 he expresses the hopes he had concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I have confidence in you,</I> says he, <I>through the Lord, that you 
 will be none otherwise minded.</I> Though he had many fears and doubts 
 about them (which was the occasion of his using so much plainness and 
 freedom with them), yet he hoped that through the blessing of God upon 
 what he had written they might be brought to be of the same mind with 
 him, and to own and abide by that truth and that liberty of the gospel 
 which he had preached to them, and was now endeavouring to confirm them 
 in. Herein he teaches us that we ought to hope the best even of those
 concerning whom we have cause to fear the worst. That they might be the 
 less offended at the reproofs he had given them for their 
 unstedfastness in the faith, he lays the blame of it more upon others 
 than themselves; for he adds, <I>But he that troubleth you shall bear 
 his judgment, whosoever he be.</I> He was sensible that there were 
 <I>some that troubled them, and would pervert the gospel of Christ</I> 
 (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:7"><I>ch.</I> i. 7</A>),

 and possibly he may point to some one particular man who was more busy
 and forward than others, and might be the chief instrument of the 
 disorder that was among them; and to this he imputes their defection or 
 inconstancy more than to any thing in themselves. This may give us
 occasion to observe that, in reproving sin and error, we should always 
 distinguish between the leaders and the led, such as set themselves to 
 draw others thereinto and such as are drawn aside by them. Thus the 
 apostle softens and alleviates the fault of these Christians, even 
 while he is reproving them, that he might the better persuade them to 
 return to, and stand fast in, the liberty wherewith Christ had made 
 them free: but as for him or those that troubled them, whoever he or 
 they were, he declares they <I>should bear their judgment,</I> he did 
 not doubt but God would deal with them according to their deserts, and 
 out of his just indignation against them, as enemies of Christ and his 
 church, he wishes that <I>they were even cut off</I>--not cut off from
 Christ and all hopes of salvation by him, but cut off by the censures 
 of the church, which ought to witness against those teachers who thus 
 corrupted the purity of the gospel. Those, whether ministers or others, 
 who set themselves to overthrow the faith of the gospel, and disturb 
 the peace of Christians, do thereby forfeit the privileges of Christian 
 communion and deserve to be cut off from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. To dissuade these Christians from hearkening to their judaizing 
 teachers, and to recover them from the ill impressions they had made 
 upon them, he represents them as men who had used very base and 
 disingenuous methods to compass their designs, for they had 
 misrepresented him, that they might the more easily gain their ends 
 upon them. That which they were endeavouring was to bring them to 
 submit to circumcision, and to mix Judaism with their Christianity; 
 and, the better to accomplish this design, they had given out among 
 them that Paul himself was a preacher of circumcision: for when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>And I brethren, if I yet preach circumcision,</I> it plainly appears 
 that they had reported him to have done so, and that they had made use 
 of this as an argument to prevail with the Galatians to submit to it. 
 It is probable that they grounded this report upon his having 
 circumcised Timothy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:3">Acts xvi. 3</A>.

 But, though for good reasons he had yielded to circumcision in that
 instance, yet that he was a preacher of it, and especially in that 
 sense wherein they imposed it, he utterly denies. To prove the 
 injustice of that charge upon him, he offers such arguments as, if they 
 would allow themselves to consider, could not fail to convince them of 
 it.

 1. If he would have preached circumcision, he might have avoided
 persecution. If I yet preach circumcision, says he, <I>why do I yet 
 suffer persecution?</I> It was evident, and they could not but be 
 sensible of it, that he was hated and persecuted by the Jews; but what 
 account could be given of this their behaviour towards him, if he had 
 so far symbolized with them as to preach up circumcision, and the 
 observance of the law of Moses, as necessary to salvation? This was the 
 great point they were contending for; and, if he had fallen in with 
 them herein, instead of being exposed to their rage he might have been 
 received into their favour. When therefore he was suffering
 persecution from them, this was a plain evidence that he had not 
 complied with them; yea, that he was so far from preaching the doctrine 
 he was charged with, that, rather than do so, he was willing to expose 
 himself to the greatest hazards. 

 2. If he had yielded to the Jews herein, <I>then would the offence of
 the cross have ceased.</I> They would not have taken so much offence 
 against the doctrine of Christianity as they did, nor would he and 
 others have been exposed to so much suffering on the account of it as 
 they were. He informs us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:23">1 Cor. i. 23</A>)

 that the preaching of the cross of Christ (or the doctrine of
 justification and salvation only by faith in Christ crucified) <I>was 
 to the Jews a stumbling-block.</I> That which they were most offended 
 at in Christianity was, that thereby circumcision, and the whole frame 
 of the legal administration, were set aside, as no longer in force. 
 This raised their greatest outcries against it, and stirred them up to 
 oppose and persecute the professors of it. Now if Paul and others could 
 have given into this opinion, that circumcision was still to be 
 retained, and the observance of the law of Moses joined with faith in 
 Christ as necessary to salvation, then their offence against it would 
 have been in a great measure removed, and they might have avoided the 
 sufferings they underwent for the sake of it. But though others, and 
 particularly those who were so forward to asperse him as a preacher of 
 this doctrine, could easily come into it, yet so could not he. He 
 rather chose to hazard his ease and credit, yea his very life itself, 
 than thus to corrupt the truth and give up the liberty of the gospel. 
 Hence it was that the Jews continued to be so much offended against 
 Christianity, and against him as the preacher of it. Thus the apostle 
 clears himself from the unjust reproach which his enemies had cast upon 
 him, and at the same time shows how little regard was due to those men 
 who could treat him in such an injurious manner, and how much reason he 
 had to wish that they were even cut off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <I>use</I>
 not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
 another.
 &nbsp; 14  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <I>even</I> in this;
 Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
 &nbsp; 15  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be
 not consumed one of another.
 &nbsp; 16  <I>This</I> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
 fulfil the lust of the flesh.
 &nbsp; 17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
 against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other:
 so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
 &nbsp; 18  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
 &nbsp; 19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <I>these;</I>
 Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
 &nbsp; 20  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath,
 strife, seditions, heresies,
 &nbsp; 21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like:
 of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <I>you</I> in time
 past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
 kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
 longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
 &nbsp; 23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
 &nbsp; 24  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
 affections and lusts.
 &nbsp; 25  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
 &nbsp; 26  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
 envying one another.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the latter part of this chapter the apostle comes to exhort these 
 Christians to serious practical godliness, as the best antidote against 
 the snares of the false teachers. Two things especially he presses upon 
 them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they should not strive with one another, but love one another. 
 He tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that <I>they had been called unto liberty,</I> and he would have them 
 to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ had made them free; but 
 yet he would have them be very careful that they did not <I>use this 
 liberty as an occasion to the flesh</I>--that they did not thence take 
 occasion to indulge themselves in any corrupt affections and practices, 
 and particularly such as might create distance and disaffection, and be 
 the ground of quarrels and contentions among them: but, on the 
 contrary, he would have them <I>by love to serve one another,</I> to 
 maintain that mutual love and affection which, notwithstanding any 
 minor differences there might be among them, would dispose them to all 
 those offices of respect and kindness to each other which the Christian 
 religion obliged them to. Note,

 1. The liberty we enjoy as Christians is not a licentious liberty:
 though Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, yet he has not 
 freed us from the obligation of it; the gospel is a <I>doctrine 
 according to godliness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:3">1 Tim. vi. 3</A>),
 
 and is so far from giving the least countenance to sin that it lays us 
 under the strongest obligations to avoid and subdue it. 

 2. Though we ought to stand fast in our Christian liberty, yet we
 should not insist upon it to the breach of Christian charity; we should 
 not use it as an occasion of strife and contention with our fellow 
 Christians, who may be differently minded from us, but should always 
 maintain such a temper towards each other as may dispose us by love to 
 serve one another. To this the apostle endeavours to persuade these 
 Christians, and there are two considerations which he sets before them 
 for this purpose:--

 (1.) <I>That all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou
 shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Love is the sum of the whole law; as love to God comprises the duties 
 of the first table, so love to our neighbour those of the second. The 
 apostle takes notice of the latter here, because he is speaking of 
 their behaviour towards one another; and, when he makes use of this as 
 an argument to persuade them to mutual love, he intimates both that 
 this would be a good evidence of their sincerity in religion and also 
 the most likely means of rooting out those dissensions and divisions 
 that were among them. It will appear that we are the disciples of 
 Christ indeed when we have love one to another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:35">John xiii. 35</A>);

 and, where this temper is kept up, if it do not wholly extinguish those
 unhappy discords that are among Christians, yet at least it will so far 
 accommodate them that the fatal consequences of them will be prevented. 
 
 (2.) The sad and dangerous tendency of a contrary behaviour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>But,</I> says he, if instead of serving one another in love, and 
 therein fulfilling the law of God, <I>you bite and devour one another, 
 take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</I> If, instead of 
 acting like men and Christians, they would behave themselves more like 
 brute beasts, in tearing and rending one another, they could expect 
 nothing as the consequence of it, but that they would be consumed one 
 of another; and therefore they had the greatest reason not to indulge 
 themselves in such quarrels and animosities. Note, Mutual strifes
 among brethren, if persisted in, are likely to prove a common ruin; 
 those that devour one another are in a fair way to be consumed one of 
 another. Christian churches cannot be ruined but by their own hands; 
 but if Christians, who should be helps to one another and a joy one to 
 another, be as brute beasts, biting and devouring each other, what can 
 be expected but that the God of love should deny his grace to them, and 
 the Spirit of love should depart from them, and that the evil spirit, 
 who seeks the destruction of them all, should prevail?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they should all strive against sin; and happy would it be for 
 the church if Christians would let all their quarrels be swallowed up 
 of this, even a quarrel against sin--if, instead of biting and devouring
 one another on account of their different opinions, they would all set 
 themselves against sin in themselves and the places where they live. 
 This is what we are chiefly concerned to fight against, and that which 
 above every thing else we should make it our business to oppose and 
 suppress. To excite Christians hereunto, and to assist them herein, the 
 apostle shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That there is in every one a struggle between the flesh and the 
 spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The flesh</I> (the corrupt and carnal part of us) <I>lusts</I>
 (strives and struggles with strength and vigour) <I>against the 
 spirit:</I> it opposes all the motions of the Spirit, and resists every 
 thing that is spiritual. On the other hand, <I>the spirit</I> (the 
 renewed part of us) strives <I>against the flesh,</I> and opposes the 
 will and desire of it: and hence it comes to pass <I>that we cannot do 
 the things that we would.</I> As the principle of grace in us will not 
 suffer us to do all the evil which our corrupt nature would prompt us 
 to, so neither can we do all the good that we would, by reason of the 
 oppositions we meet with from that corrupt and carnal principle. Even 
 as in a natural man there is something of this struggle (the 
 convictions of his conscience and the corruption of his own heart 
 strive with one another; his convictions would suppress his 
 corruptions, and his corruptions silence his convictions), so in a 
 renewed man, where there is something of a good principle, there is a 
 struggle between the old nature and the new nature, the remainders of 
 sin and the beginnings of grace; and this Christians must expect will 
 be their exercise as long as they continue in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it is our duty and interest in this struggle to side with the 
 better part, to side with our convictions against our corruptions and 
 with our graces against our lusts. This the apostle represents as our 
 duty, and directs us to the most effectual means of success in it. If 
 it should be asked, What course must we take that the better interest 
 may get the better? he gives us this one general rule, which, if duly 
 observed, would be the most sovereign remedy against the prevalence of 
 corruption; and that is to walk in the Spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>This I say, then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the 
 lust of the flesh.</I> By the <I>Spirit</I> here may be meant either 
 the Holy Spirit himself, who condescends to dwell in the hearts of 
 those whom he has renewed and sanctified, to guide and assist them in 
 the way of their duty, or that gracious principle which he implants in 
 the souls of his people and which lusts against the flesh, as that 
 corrupt principle which still remains in them does against it. 
 Accordingly the duty here recommended to us is that we set ourselves to 
 act under the guidance and influence of the blessed Spirit, and 
 agreeably to the motions and tendency of the new nature in us; and, if 
 this be our care in the ordinary course and tenour of our lives, we may 
 depend upon it that, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and 
 oppositions of our corrupt nature, we shall be kept from fulfilling it 
 in the lusts thereof; so that though it remain in us, yet it shall not 
 obtain a dominion over us. Note, The best antidote against the poison 
 of sin is to walk in the Spirit, to be much in conversing with 
 spiritual things, to mind the things of the soul, which is the 
 spiritual part of man, more than those of the body, which is his carnal 
 part, to commit ourselves to the guidance of the word, wherein the Holy 
 Spirit makes known the will of God concerning us, and in the way of our 
 duty to act in a dependence on his aids and influences. And, as this 
 would be the best means of preserving them from fulfilling the lusts of 
 the flesh, so it would be a good evidence that they were Christians 
 indeed; for, says the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>If you be led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</I> As if he 
 had said, "You must expect a struggle between flesh and spirit as long 
 as you are in the world, that the flesh will be lusting against the 
 spirit as well as the spirit against the flesh; but if, in the 
 prevailing bent and tenour of your lives, you be <I>led by the 
 Spirit,</I>--if you act under the guidance and government of the Holy 
 Spirit and of that spiritual nature and disposition he has wrought in 
 you,--if you make the word of God your rule and the grace of God your 
 principle,--it will hence appear that you are not under the law, not 
 under the condemning, though you are still under the commanding, power 
 of it; for <I>there is now no condemnation to those that are in Christ 
 Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;</I> and 
 <I>as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of 
 God,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1-14">Rom. viii. 1-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The apostle specifies the works of the flesh, which must be watched 
 against and mortified, and the fruits of the Spirit, which must be 
 cherished and brought forth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 &c.); and by specifying particulars he further illustrates what he is
 here upon. 

 (1.) He begins with <I>the works of the flesh,</I> which, as they are 
 many, so they are manifest. It is past dispute that the things he here
 speaks of are the works of the flesh, or the product of corrupt and 
 depraved nature; most of them are condemned by the light of nature 
 itself, and all of them by the light of scripture. The particulars he 
 specifies are of various sorts; some are sins against the seventh 
 commandment, such as <I>adultery, fornication, uncleanness, 
 lasciviousness,</I> by which are meant not only the gross acts of these 
 sins, but all such thoughts, and words, and actions, as have a tendency 
 towards the great transgression. Some are sins against the first and 
 second commandments, as <I>idolatry</I> and <I>witchcraft.</I> Others 
 are sins against our neighbour, and contrary to the royal law of 
 brotherly love, such as <I>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, 
 strife,</I> which too often occasion <I>seditions, heresies, 
 envyings,</I> and sometimes break out into <I>murders,</I> not only of 
 the names and reputation, but even of the very lives, of our 
 fellow-creatures. Others are sins against ourselves, such as 
 <I>drunkenness and revellings;</I> and he concludes the catalogue with 
 an <I>et cetera,</I> and gives fair warning to all to take care of 
 them, as they hope to see the face of God with comfort. Of these and 
 <I>such like,</I> says he, <I>I tell you before, as I have also told 
 you in times past,</I> that <I>those who do such things,</I> how much 
 soever they may flatter themselves with vain hopes, <I>shall not 
 inherit the kingdom of God.</I> These are sins which will undoubtedly 
 shut men out of heaven. The world of spirits can never be comfortable 
 to those who plunge themselves in the filth of the flesh; nor will the 
 righteous and holy God ever admit such into his favour and presence, 
 unless they be first <I>washed and sanctified, and justified in the 
 name of our Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 (2.) He specifies the fruits of the Spirit, or the renewed nature,
 which as Christians we are concerned to bring forth,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 And here we may observe that as sin is called <I>the work of the 
 flesh,</I> because the flesh, or corrupt nature, is the principle that 
 moves and excites men to it, so grace is said to be <I>the fruit of the 
 Spirit,</I> because it wholly proceeds from the Spirit, as the fruit 
 does from the root: and whereas before the apostle had chiefly 
 specified those works of the flesh which were not only hurtful to men 
 themselves but tended to make them so to one another, so here he 
 chiefly takes notice of those fruits of the Spirit which had a tendency 
 to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as easy to 
 themselves; and this was very suitable to the caution or exhortation he 
 had before given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that they should <I>not use their liberty as an occasion to the flesh, 
 but by love serve one another.</I> He particularly recommends to us, 
 <I>love,</I> to God especially, and to one another for his 
 sake,--<I>joy,</I> by which may be understood cheerfulness in 
 conversation with our friends, or rather a constant delight in 
 God,--<I>peace,</I> with God and conscience, or a peaceableness of 
 temper and behaviour towards others,--<I>long-suffering,</I> patience 
 to defer anger, and a contentedness to bear 
 injuries,--<I>gentleness,</I> such a sweetness of temper, and 
 especially towards our inferiors, as disposes us to be affable and 
 courteous, and easy to be entreated when any have wronged 
 us,--<I>goodness</I> (kindness, beneficence), which shows itself in a 
 readiness to do good to all as we have opportunity,--<I>faith,</I> 
 fidelity, justice, and honesty, in what we profess and promise to 
 others,--<I>meekness,</I> wherewith to govern our passions and 
 resentments, so as not to be easily provoked, and, when we are so, to 
 be soon pacified,--and <I>temperance,</I> in meat and drink, and other 
 enjoyments of life, so as not to be excessive and immoderate in the use 
 of them. Concerning these things, or those in whom these fruits of the 
 Spirit are found, the apostle says, <I>There is no law against 
 them,</I> to condemn and punish them. Yea, hence it appears that they 
 are not under the law, but under grace; for these fruits of the Spirit, 
 in whomsoever they are found, plainly show that such are <I>led by the 
 Spirit,</I> and consequently that they are not <I>under the law,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 And as, by specifying these works of the flesh and fruits of the 
 Spirit, the apostle directs us both what we are to avoid and oppose and 
 what we are to cherish and cultivate, so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 he informs us that this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real 
 Christians: <I>And those that are Christ's,</I> says he (those who are 
 Christians indeed, not only in show and profession, but in sincerity 
 and truth), <I>have crucified the flesh with the affections and 
 lusts.</I> As in their baptism they were obliged hereunto (for, being
 baptized into Christ, they were baptized into his death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:3">Rom. vi. 3</A>),

 so they are now sincerely employing themselves herein, and, in 
 conformity to their Lord and head, are endeavouring to die unto sin, as 
 he had died for it. They have not yet obtained a complete victory over 
 it; they have still flesh as well as Spirit in them, and that has its 
 affections and lusts, which continue to give them no little 
 disturbance, but as it does not now <I>reign in their mortal bodies, so 
 as that they obey it in the lusts thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:12">Rom. vi. 12</A>),

 so they are seeking the utter ruin and destruction of it, and to put it 
 to the same shameful and ignominious, though lingering death, which our 
 Lord Jesus underwent for our sakes. Note, If we should approve
 ourselves to be Christ's, such as are united to him and interested in 
 him, we must make it our constant care and business to crucify the 
 flesh with its corrupt affections and lusts. Christ will never own
 those as his who yield themselves the servants of sin. But though the 
 apostle here only mentions the crucifying of the flesh with the 
 affections and lusts, as the care and character of real Christians, 
 yet, no doubt, it is also implied that, on the other hand, we should 
 show forth those fruits of the Spirit which he had just before been 
 specifying; this is no less our duty than that, nor is it less 
 necessary to evidence our sincerity in religion. It is not enough that 
 we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our Christianity 
 obliges us not only to die unto sin, but to live unto righteousness; 
 not only to oppose the works of the flesh, but to bring forth the 
 fruits of the Spirit too. If therefore we would make it appear that we 
 do indeed belong to Christ, this must be our sincere care and endeavour 
 as well as the other; and that it was the design of the apostle to 
 represent both the one and the other of these as our duty, and as 
 necessary to support our character as Christians, may be gathered from 
 what follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 where he adds, <I>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the 
 Spirit;</I> that is, "If we profess to have received the Spirit of 
 Christ, or that we are renewed in the Spirit of Christ, or that we are 
 renewed in the spirit of our minds, and endued with a principle of 
 spiritual life, let us make it appear by the proper fruits of the 
 Spirit in our lives." He had before told us that the Spirit of Christ 
 is a privilege bestowed on all the children of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 6</A>.

 "Now," says he, "if we profess to be of this number, and as such to
 have obtained this privilege, let us show it by a temper and behaviour 
 agreeable hereunto; let us evidence our good principles by good 
 practices." Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle 
 which we are under the guidance and government of: as <I>those that are 
 after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh,</I> so <I>those that 
 are after the Spirit do mind the things of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:5">Rom. viii. 5</A>.

 If therefore we would have it appear that we are Christ's, and that we
 are partakers of his Spirit, it must be by our <I>walking not after the 
 flesh, but after the spirit.</I> We must set ourselves in good earnest 
 both to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostle concludes this chapter with a caution against pride and 
 envy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He had before been exhorting these Christians <I>by love to serve one 
 another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and had put them in mind of what would be the consequence if, instead 
 of that, they did <I>bite and devour one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Now, as a means of engaging them to the one and preserving them from 
 the other of these, he here cautions them against being desirous of 
 vain-glory, or giving way to an undue affectation of the esteem and 
 applause of men, because this, if it were indulged, would certainly 
 lead them to provoke one another and to envy one another. As far as 
 this temper prevails among Christians, they will be ready to slight and 
 despise those whom they look upon as inferior to them, and to be put 
 out of humour if they are denied that respect which they think is their 
 due from them, and they will also be apt to envy those by whom their 
 reputation is in any danger of being lessened: and thus a foundation is 
 laid for those quarrels and contentions which, as they are inconsistent 
 with that love which Christians ought to maintain towards each other, 
 so they are greatly prejudicial to the honour and interest of religion 
 itself. This therefore the apostle would have us by all means to watch 
 against. Note,

 (1.) The glory which comes from men is vain-glory, which, instead of 
 being desirous of, we should be dead to. 

 (2.) An undue regard to the approbation and applause of men is one
 great ground of the unhappy strifes and contentions that exist among 
 Christians.</P>
