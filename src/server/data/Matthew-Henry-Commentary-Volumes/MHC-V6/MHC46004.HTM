 In this chapter the apostle, 

 I. Directs them how to account of him and his fellow-ministers, and
 therein, tacitly at least, reproves them for their unworthy carriage 
 towards him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He cautions them against pride and self-elation, and hints at the
 many temptations they had to conceive too highly of themselves, and
 despise him and other apostles, because of the great diversity in their
 circumstances and condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 III. He challenges their regard to him as their father in Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 IV. He tells them of his having sent Timothy to them, and of his own
 purpose to come to them shortly, however some among them had pleased
 themselves, and grown vain, upon the quite contrary expectation,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
 and stewards of the mysteries of God.
 &nbsp; 2  Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
 faithful.
 &nbsp; 3  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged
 of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
 &nbsp; 4  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified:
 but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
 who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and
 will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall
 every man have praise of God.
 &nbsp; 6  And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
 myself and <I>to</I> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us
 not to think <I>of men</I> above that which is written, that no one of
 you be puffed up for one against another.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The apostle challenges the respect due to him on account of his 
 character and office, in which many among them had at least very much 
 failed: <I>Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, 
 and stewards of the mysteries of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 though possibly others might have valued them too highly, by setting 
 him up as the head of a party, and professing to be his disciples. In 
 our opinion of ministers, as well as all other things, we should be 
 careful to avoid extremes. Apostles themselves were,

 1. Not to be overvalued, for they were ministers, not masters;
 stewards, not lords. They were servants of Christ, and no more, though
 they were servants of the highest rank, that had the care of his 
 household, that were to provide food for the rest, and appoint and 
 direct their work. Note, It is a very great abuse of their power, and 
 highly criminal in common ministers, to lord it over their 
 fellow-servants, and challenge authority over their faith or practice. 
 For even apostles were but servants of Christ, employed in his work, 
 and sent on his errand, and dispensers of the mysteries of God, or 
 those truths which had been hidden from the world in ages and 
 generations past. They had no authority to propagate their own fancies, 
 but to spread Christian faith. 

 2. Apostles were not to be undervalued; for, though they were
 ministers, they were ministers of Christ. The character and dignity of 
 their master put an honour on them. Though they are but stewards, they 
 are not stewards of the common things of the world, but of divine 
 mysteries. They had a great trust, and for that reason had an 
 honourable office. They were stewards of God's household, high-stewards 
 in his kingdom of grace. They did not set up for masters, but they 
 deserved respect and esteem in this honourable service.
 Especially,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When they did their duty in it, and approved themselves faithful: 
 <I>It is required in stewards that a man be found faithful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 trustworthy. The stewards in Christ's family must appoint what he hath 
 appointed. They must not set their fellow-servants to work for 
 themselves. They must not require any thing from them without their 
 Master's warrant. They must not feed them with the chaff of their own 
 inventions, instead of the wholesome food of Christian doctrine and 
 truth. They must teach what he hath commanded, and not the doctrines 
 and commandments of men. They must be true to the interest of their 
 Lord, and consult his honour. Note, The ministers of Christ should make 
 it their hearty and continual endeavour to approve themselves 
 trustworthy; and when they have the testimony of a good conscience, and 
 the approbation of their Master, they must slight the opinions and 
 censures of their fellow-servants: <I>But with me,</I> saith the 
 apostle, <I>it is a small thing that I should be judged of you, or of 
 man's judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Indeed, reputation and esteem among men are a good step towards
 usefulness in the ministry; and Paul's whole argument upon this head 
 shows he had a just concern for his own reputation. But he that would 
 make it his chief endeavour to please men would hardly approve himself 
 a faithful servant of Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Gal. i. 10</A>.

 He that would be faithful to Christ must despise the censures of men 
 for his sake. He must look upon it as a very little thing (if his Lord 
 approves him) what judgment men form of him. They may think very meanly 
 or very hardly of him, while he is doing his duty; but it is not by 
 their judgment that he must stand or fall. And happy is it for faithful 
 ministers that they have a more just and candid judge than their 
 fellow-servants; one who knows and pities their imperfections, though 
 he has none of his own. It is better to <I>fall into the hands of God 
 than into the hands of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:14">2 Sam. xxiv. 14</A>.

 The best of men are too apt to judge rashly, and harshly, and unjustly;
 but his judgment is always according to truth. It is a comfort that men 
 are not to be our final judges. Nay, we are not thus to judge 
 ourselves: "<I>Yea, I judge not myself. For though I know nothing by 
 myself,</I> cannot charge myself with unfaithfulness, <I>yet I am not 
 thereby justified,</I> this will not clear me of the charge; <I>but he 
 that judgeth me is the Lord.</I> It is his judgment that must determine 
 me. By his sentence I must abide. Such I am as he shall find and judge 
 me to be." Note, It is not judging well of ourselves, justifying 
 ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Nothing will do this but 
 the acceptance and approbation of our sovereign Judge. <I>Not he that 
 commendeth himself is approved, but he whom the Lord commendeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:18">2 Cor. x. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle takes occasion hence to caution the Corinthians 
 against censoriousness--the forward and severe judging of others:
 <I>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is judging out of season, and judging at an adventure. He is not to
 be understood of judging by persons in authority, within the verge of 
 their office, nor of private judging concerning facts that are 
 notorious; but of judging persons' future state, or the secret springs 
 and principles of their actions, or about facts doubtful in themselves.
 To judge in these cases, and give decisive sentence, is to assume the 
 seat of God and challenge his prerogative. Note, How bold a sinner is 
 the forward and severe censurer! How ill-timed and arrogant are his 
 censures! But there is one who will judge the censurer, and those he 
 censures, without prejudice, passion, or partiality. And there is a 
 time coming when men cannot fail judging aright concerning themselves 
 and others, by following his judgment. This should make them now 
 cautious of judging others, and careful in judging themselves. There is 
 a time coming when <I>the Lord will bring to light the hidden things of 
 darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts</I>--deeds of 
 darkness that are now done in secret, and all the secret inclinations, 
 purposes, and intentions, of the hidden man of the heart. Note, There 
 is a day coming that will dispel the darkness and lay open the face of 
 the deep, will fetch men's secret sins into open day and discover the 
 secrets of their hearts: <I>The day shall declare it.</I> The judge 
 will bring these things to light. The Lord Jesus Christ will manifest 
 the counsels of the heart, of all hearts. Note, The Lord Jesus Christ 
 must have the knowledge of the counsels of the heart, else he could not 
 make them manifest. This is a divine prerogative

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:10">Jer. xvii. 10</A>),

 and yet it is what our Saviour challenges to himself in a very peculiar 
 manner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>):

 <I>All the churches shall know that I am HE who searcheth the reins and 
 hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your 
 works.</I> Note, We should be very careful how we censure others, when 
 we have to do with a Judge from whom we cannot conceal ourselves.
 Others do not lie open to our notice, but we lie all open to his: and, 
 when he shall come to judge, <I>every man shall have praise of God.
 Every man,</I> that is, every one qualified for it, every one who has 
 done well. Though none of God's servants can deserve any thing from 
 him, though there be much that is blamable even in their best services, 
 yet shall their fidelity be commended and crowned by him; and should 
 they be condemned, reproached, or vilified, by their fellow-servants, 
 he will roll away all such unjust censures and reproaches, and show 
 them in their own amiable light. Note, Christians may well be patient 
 under unjust censures, when they know such a day as this is coming, 
 especially when they have their consciences testifying to their 
 integrity. But how fearful should they be of loading any with 
 reproaches now whom their common Judge shall hereafter commend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle here lets us into the reason why he had used his own 
 name and that of Apollos in this discourse of his. He had done <I>it in 
 a figure,</I> and <I>he had done it for their sakes.</I> He chose 
 rather to mention his own name, and the name of a faithful 
 fellow-labourer, than the names of any heads of factions among them, 
 that hereby he might avoid what would provoke, and so procure for his 
 advice the greater regard. Note, Ministers should use prudence in their 
 advices and admonitions, but especially in their reproofs, lest they 
 lose their end. The advice the apostle would by this means inculcate 
 was <I>that they might learn not to think of men above what is 
 written</I> (above what he had been writing), <I>nor be puffed up for 
 one against another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>).

 Apostles were not to be esteemed other than planters or waterers in 
 God's husbandry, master-builders in his building, stewards of his 
 mysteries, and servants of Christ. And common ministers cannot bear 
 these characters in the same sense that apostles did. Note, We must be 
 very careful not to transfer the honour and authority of the Master to 
 his servant. <I>We must call no man Master on earth; one is our Master, 
 even Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8,10">Matt. xxiii. 8, 10</A>.

 We must not think of them above what is written. Note, The word of God
 is the best rule by which to judge concerning men. And again, judging 
 rightly concerning men, and not judging more highly of them than is 
 fit, is one way to prevent quarrels and contentions in the churches. 
 Pride commonly lies at the bottom of these quarrels. Self-conceit 
 contributes very much to our immoderate esteem of our teachers, as well 
 as ourselves. Our commendation of our own taste and judgment commonly
 goes along with our unreasonable applause, and always with a factious 
 adherence to one teacher, in opposition to others that may be equally 
 faithful and well qualified. But to think modestly of ourselves, and
 not above what is written of our teachers, is the most effectual means 
 to prevent quarrels and contests, sidings and parties, in the church. 
 We shall not be puffed up for one against another if we remember that 
 they are all instruments employed by God in his husbandry and building, 
 and endowed by him with their various talents and qualifications.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  For who maketh thee to differ <I>from another?</I> and what hast

 why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <I>it?</I>

 world, <I>and are</I> the offscouring of all things unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle improves the foregoing hint to a caution against pride 
 and self-conceit, and sets forth the temptations the Corinthians had to 
 despise him, from the difference of their circumstances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He cautions them against pride and self-conceit by this 
 consideration, that all the distinction made among them was owing to 
 God: <I>Who maketh thee to differ? And what hast thou that thou didst 
 not receive?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Here the apostle turns his discourse to the ministers who set
 themselves at the head of these factions, and did but too much 
 encourage and abet the people in those feuds. What had they to glory 
 in, when all their peculiar gifts were from God? They had received 
 them, and could not glory in them as their own, without wronging God. 
 At the time when they reflected on them to feed their vanity, they 
 should have considered them as so many debts and obligations to divine 
 bounty and grace. But it may be taken as a general maxim: We have no 
 reason to be proud of our attainments, enjoyments, or performances; all 
 that we have, or are, or do, that is good, is owing to the free and 
 rich grace of God. Boasting is for ever excluded. There is nothing we 
 have that we can properly call our own: all is received from God. It is 
 foolish in us therefore, and injurious to him, to boast of it; those 
 who receive all should be proud of nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1">Ps. cxv. 1</A>.

 Beggars and dependents may glory in their supports; but to glory in
 themselves is to be proud at once of meanness, impotence, and want. 
 Note, Due attention to our obligations to divine grace would cure us of 
 arrogance and self-conceit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He presses the duty of humility upon them by a very smart irony, or 
 at least reproves them for their pride and self-conceit: "<I>You are 
 full, you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us.</I> You have 
 not only a sufficiency, but an affluence, of spiritual gifts; nay, you 
 can make them the matter of your glory <I>without us,</I> that is, in 
 my absence, and without having any need of me." There is a very elegant 
 gradation from sufficiency to wealth, and thence to royalty, to 
 intimate how much the Corinthians were elated by the abundance of their 
 wisdom and spiritual gifts, which was a humour that prevailed among 
 them while the apostle was away from them, and made them forget what an 
 interest he had in all. See how apt pride is to overrate benefits and 
 overlook the benefactor, to swell upon its possessions and forget from 
 whom they come; nay, it is apt to behold them in a magnifying-glass: 
 "<I>You have reigned as kings,</I>" says the apostle, "that is, in your 
 own conceit; and <I>I would to God you did reign, that we also might 
 reign with you.</I> I wish you had as much of the true glory of a 
 Christian church upon you as you arrogate to yourselves. I should come 
 in then for a share of the honour: <I>I should reign with you:</I> I
 should not be overlooked by you as now I am, but valued and regarded as 
 a minister of Christ, and a very useful instrument among you." Note, 
 Those do not commonly know themselves best who think best of 
 themselves, who have the highest opinion of themselves. The Corinthians 
 might have reigned, and the apostle with them, if they had not been 
 blown up with an imaginary royalty. Note, Pride is a great prejudice to 
 our improvement. He is stopped from growing wiser or better who thinks 
 himself at the height; not only full, but rich, nay, a king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He comes to set forth his own circumstances and those of the other 
 apostles, and compares them with theirs. 

 1. To set forth the case of the apostles: <I>For I think it hath
 pleased God to set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to 
 death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to 
 men.</I> Paul and his fellow-apostles were exposed to great hardships. 
 Never were any men in this world so hunted and worried. They carried 
 their lives in their hands: <I>God hath set forth us the apostles 
 last, as it were appointed to death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 An allusion is made to some of the bloody spectacles in the Roman
 amphitheatres, where men were exposed to fight with wild beasts, or to 
 cut one another to pieces, to make diversion for the populace, where 
 the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his 
 adversary, but was only reserved for another combat, and must be 
 devoured or cut in pieces at last; so that such wretched criminals (for 
 they were ordinarily condemned persons that were thus exposed) might 
 very properly be called <B><I>epithanatioi</I></B>--<I>persons devoted 
 or appointed to death.</I> They are said to be set forth last, because 
 the meridian gladiators, those who combated one another in the 
 after-part of the day, were most exposed, being obliged to fight naked; 
 so that (as Seneca says, <I>epist.</I> 7) this was perfect butchery, 
 and those exposed to beasts in the morning were treated mercifully in 
 comparison with these. The general meaning is that the apostles were 
 exposed to continual danger of death, and that of the worst kinds, in 
 the faithful discharge of their office. God had set them forth, brought 
 them into view, as the Roman emperors brought their combatants into the 
 arena, the place of show, though not for the same purposes. They did it 
 to please the populace, and humour their own vanity, and sometimes a 
 much worse principle. The apostles were shown to manifest the power of 
 divine grace, to confirm the truth of their mission and doctrine, and 
 to propagate religion in the world. These were ends worthy of 
 God--noble views, fit to animate them to the combat. But they had like 
 difficulties to encounter, and were in a manner as much exposed as 
 these miserable Roman criminals. Note, The office of an apostle was,
 as an honourable, so a hard and hazardous one: "<I>For we are made a 
 spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 A <I>show.</I> We are brought into the theatre, brought out to the
 public view of the world. Angels and men are witnesses to our 
 persecutions, sufferings, patience, and magnanimity. They all see that 
 we suffer for our fidelity to Christ, and how we suffer; how great and 
 imminent are our dangers, and how bravely we encounter them; how sharp 
 our sufferings, and how patiently we endure them, by the power of 
 divine grace and our Christian principles. Ours is hard work, but 
 honourable; it is hazardous, but glorious. God will have honour from 
 us, religion will be credited by us. The world cannot but see and 
 wonder at our undaunted resolution, our invincible patience and 
 constancy." And how contentedly could they be exposed, both to 
 sufferings and scorn, for the honour of their Master! Note, The 
 faithful ministers and disciples of Christ should contentedly undergo 
 any thing for his sake and honour.

 2. He compares his own case with that of the Corinthians: "<I>We are
 fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but 
 you are strong; you are honourable, but we are despised,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 <I>We are fools for Christ's sake;</I> such in common account, and we
 are well content to be so accounted. We can pass for fools in the 
 world, and be despised as such, so that the wisdom of God and the 
 honour of the gospel may by this means be secured and displayed." Note, 
 Faithful ministers can bear being despised, so that the wisdom of God 
 and the power of his grace be thereby displayed. "<I>But you are wise 
 in Christ.</I> You have the fame of being wise and learned Christians, 
 and you do not a little value yourselves upon it. We are under disgrace 
 for delivering the plain truths of the gospel, and in as plain a 
 manner: you are in reputation for your eloquence and human wisdom, 
 which among many make you pass for wise men in Christ. <I>We are weak, 
 but you are strong.</I> We are suffering for Christ's sake" (so being 
 weak plainly signifies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:10">2 Cor. xii. 10</A>),

 "when you are in easy and flourishing circumstances." Note, All 
 Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than
 others who are yet engaged in the same warfare. The standard-bearers in 
 an army are most struck at. So ministers in a time of persecution are 
 commonly the first and greatest sufferers. Or else, "We pass upon the 
 world for persons of but mean endowments, mere striplings in 
 Christianity; but you look upon yourselves, and are looked upon by 
 others, as men, as those of a much more advanced growth and confirmed 
 strength." Note, Those are not always the greatest proficients in 
 Christianity who think thus of themselves, or pass for such upon 
 others. It is but too easy and common for self-love to commit such a 
 mistake. The Corinthians may think themselves, and be esteemed by 
 others, as wiser and stronger men in Christ than the apostles 
 themselves. But O! how gross is the mistake!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He enters into some particularities of their sufferings: <I>Even to 
 this present hour;</I> that is, after all the service we have been 
 doing among you and other churches, <I>we hunger and thirst, and are 
 naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place, and 
 labour, working with our own hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Nay, they were <I>made as the filth of the world, and the off-scouring
 of all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They were forced to labour with their own hands to get subsistence, and
 had so much, and so much greater, business to mind, that they could not
 attend enough to this, to get a comfortable livelihood, but were
 exposed to hunger, thirst, and nakedness--many times wanted meat, and
 drink, and clothes. They were driven about the world, without having
 any fixed abode, any stated habitation. Poor circumstances indeed, for
 the prime ministers of our Saviour's kingdom to have no house nor home,
 and to be destitute of food and raiment! But yet no poorer than his who
 had not <I>where to lay his head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:58">Luke ix. 58</A>.

 But O glorious charity and devotion, that would carry them through all
 these hardships! How ardently did they love God, how vehemently did 
 they thirst for the salvation of souls! Theirs was voluntary, it was 
 pleasing poverty. They thought they had a rich amends for all the 
 outward good things they wanted, if they might but serve Christ and 
 save souls. Nay, though they <I>were made the filth of the world, and 
 the off-scouring of all things.</I> They were treated as men not fit to 
 live, <B><I>perikatharmata.</I></B> It is reasonably thought by the
 critics that an allusion is here made to a common custom of many 
 heathen nations, to offer men in sacrifice in a time of pestilence, or 
 other like grievous calamity. These were ordinarily the vilest of men, 
 persons of the lowest rank and worst character. Thus, in the first 
 ages, Christians were counted the source of all public calamities, and 
 were sacrificed to the people's rage, if not to appease their angry 
 deities. And apostles could not meet with better usage. They suffered
 in their persons and characters as the very worst and vilest men, as 
 the most proper to make such a sacrifice: or else as the very dirt of 
 the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the <I>off-scouring of 
 all things,</I> the dross, the filings of all things. They were the 
 common-sewer into which all the reproaches of the world were to be 
 poured. To be the off-scouring of any thing is bad, but what is it to 
 be the off-scouring of all things! How much did the apostles resemble 
 their Master, <I>and fill up that which was behind of his afflictions, 
 for his body's sake, which is the church!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:24">Col. i. 24</A>.

 They suffered for him, and they suffered after his example. Thus poor
 and despised was he in his life and ministry. And every one who would 
 be faithful in Christ Jesus must prepare for the same poverty and 
 contempt. Note, Those may be very dear to God, and honourable in his 
 esteem, whom men may think unworthy to live, and use and scorn as the 
 very dirt and refuse of the world. <I>God seeth not as man seeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:7">1 Sam. xvi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We have here the apostles' behaviour under all; and the return they 
 made for this mal-treatment: <I>Being reviled, we bless; being 
 persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 They returned blessings for reproaches, and entreaties and kind
 exhortations for the rudest slanders and defamation, and were patient 
 under the sharpest persecutions. Note, The disciples of Christ, and 
 especially his ministers, should hold fast their integrity, and keep a 
 good conscience, whatever opposition of hardships they meet with from 
 the world. Whatever they suffer from men, they must follow the example, 
 and fulfil the will and precepts, of their Lord. They must be content, 
 with him and for him, to be despised and abused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved
 sons I warn <I>you.</I>
 &nbsp; 15  For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet
 <I>have ye</I> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten
 you through the gospel.
 &nbsp; 16  Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Paul challenges their regard to him as their father. He tells 
 them, 

 1. That what he had written was not for their reproach, but admonition;
 not with the gall of an enemy, but the bowels of a father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I write not to shame you, but as my beloved children I warn you.</I> 
 Note, In reproving for sin, we should have a tender regard to the 
 reputation, as well as the reformation, of the sinner. We should aim to 
 distinguish between them and their sins, and take care not to discover 
 any spite against them ourselves, nor expose them to contempt and 
 reproach in the world. Reproofs that expose commonly do but exasperate, 
 when those that kindly and affectionately warn are likely to reform. 
 When the affections of a father mingle with the admonitions of a 
 minister, it is to be hoped that they may at once melt and mend; but to 
 lash like an enemy or executioner will provoke and render obstinate. To 
 expose to open shame is but the way to render shameless.

 2. He shows them upon what foundation he claimed paternal relation to
 them, and called them his sons. They might have other pedagogues or 
 instructors, but he was their father; <I>for in Christ Jesus he had 
 begotten them by the gospel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They were made Christians by his ministry. He had laid the foundation
 of a church among them. Others could only build upon it. Whatever other 
 teachers they had, he was their spiritual father. He first brought them 
 off from pagan idolatry to the faith of the gospel and the worship of 
 the true and living God. He was the instrument of their new birth, and
 therefore claimed the relation of a father to them, and felt the bowels 
 of a father towards them. Note, There commonly is, and always ought to 
 be, an endeared affection between faithful ministers and those they 
 beget in Christ Jesus through the gospel. They should love like parents 
 and children.

 3. We have here the special advice he urges on them: <I>Wherefore I
 beseech you be you followers of me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 This he elsewhere explains and limits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:1"><I>ch.</I> xi. 1</A>):

 "<I>Be you followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</I> Follow me as
 far as I follow Christ. Come up as close as you can to my example in 
 those instances wherein I endeavour to copy after his pattern. Be my 
 disciples, as far as I manifest myself to be a faithful minister and 
 disciple of Christ, and no further. I would not have you be my 
 disciples, but his. But I hope I have approved myself a faithful 
 steward of the mysteries of Christ, and a faithful servant of my master 
 Christ; so far follow me, and tread in my steps." Note, Ministers 
 should so live that their people may take pattern from them, and live 
 after their copy. They should guide them by their lives as well as 
 their lips, go before them in the way to heaven, and not content 
 themselves with pointing it out. Note, As ministers are to set a 
 pattern, others must take it. They should follow them as far as they 
 are satisfied that they follow Christ in faith and practice.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my
 beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into
 remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where
 in every church.
 &nbsp; 18  Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
 &nbsp; 19  But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will
 know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
 &nbsp; 20  For the kingdom of God <I>is</I> not in word, but in power.
 &nbsp; 21  What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love,
 and <I>in</I> the spirit of meekness?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. He tells them of his having sent Timothy to them, <I>to bring them 
 into remembrance of his ways in Christ, as he taught every where in 
 every church</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)--

 to remind them of his ways in Christ, to refresh their memory as to his 
 preaching and practice, what he taught, and how he lived among them. 
 Note, Those who have had ever so good teaching are apt to forget, and 
 need to have their memories refreshed. The same truth, taught over
 again, if it give no new light, may make new and quicker impression. He 
 also lets them know that <I>his teaching was the same every where, and 
 in every church.</I> He had not one doctrine for one place and people, 
 and another for another. He kept close to his instructions. What <I>he 
 received of the Lord, that he delivered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23"><I>ch.</I> xi. 23</A>.

 This was the gospel revelation, which was the equal concern of all men,
 and did not very from itself. He therefore taught the same things in 
 every church, and lived after the same manner in all times and places. 
 Note, The truth of Christ is one and invariable. What one apostle 
 taught every one taught. What one apostle taught at one time and in one 
 place, he taught at all times and in all places. Christians may mistake 
 and differ in their apprehensions, but Christ and Christian truth 
 <I>are the same yesterday, today, and for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8">Heb. xiii. 8</A>.

 To render their regard to Timothy the greater, he gives them his
 character. He was <I>his beloved son,</I> a spiritual child of his, as 
 well as themselves. Note, Spiritual brotherhood should engage affection 
 as well as what is common and natural. The children of one father 
 should have one heart. But he adds, "<I>He is faithful in the 
 Lord</I>--trustworthy, as one that feared the Lord. He will be faithful 
 in the particular office he has now received of the Lord, the 
 particular errand on which he comes; not only from me, but from Christ.
 He knows what I have taught, and what my conversation has been in all 
 places, and, you may depend upon it, he will make a faithful report." 
 Note, It is a great commendation of any minister that he is faithful in 
 the Lord, faithful to his soul, to his light, to his trust from God; 
 this must go a great way in procuring regard to his message with those 
 that fear God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He rebukes the vanity of those who imagined he would not come to 
 them, by letting them know this was his purpose, though he had sent 
 Timothy: "<I>I will come to you shortly,</I> though some of you are so 
 vain as to think I will not." But he adds, <I>if the Lord will.</I> It 
 seems, as to the common events of life, apostles knew no more than 
 other men, nor were they in these points under inspiration. For, had 
 the apostle certainly known the mind of God in this matter, he would 
 not have expressed himself with this certainty. But he sets a good 
 example to us in it. Note, All our purposes must be formed with a 
 dependence on Providence, and a reserve for the overruling purposes of 
 God. <I>If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this and that,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:15">Jam. iv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He lets them know what would follow upon his coming to them: <I>I 
 will know, not the speech of those that are puffed up, but the 
 power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He would bring the great pretenders among them to a trial, would know
 what they were, not by their rhetoric or philosophy, but by the 
 authority and efficacy of what they taught, whether they could confirm 
 it by miraculous operations, and whether it was accompanied with divine 
 influences and saving effects on the minds of men. For, adds he, <I>the 
 kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</I> It is not set up, nor 
 propagated, nor established, in the hearts of men, by plausible 
 reasonings nor florid discourses, but by the external power of the Holy 
 Spirit in miraculous operations at first, and the powerful influence of 
 divine truth on the minds and manners of men. Note, It is a good way in 
 the general to judge of a preacher's doctrine, to see whether the 
 effects of it upon men's hearts to be truly divine. That is most likely 
 to come from God which in its own nature is most fit, and in event is 
 found to produce most likeness to God, to spread piety and virtue, to 
 change men's hearts and mend their manners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He puts it to their choice how he should come among them, 
 <I>whether with a rod or in love and the spirit of meekness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 that is, according as they were they would find him. If they continued 
 perverse among themselves and with him, it would be necessary to come 
 with a rod; that is, to exert his apostolical power in chastising them, 
 by making some examples, and inflicting some diseases and corporal 
 punishments, or by other censures for their faults. Note, Stubborn 
 offenders must be used with severity. In families, in Christian 
 communities, paternal pity and tenderness, Christian love and 
 compassion, will sometimes force the use of the rod. But this is far 
 from being desirable, if it may be prevented. And therefore the apostle 
 adds that it was in their own option whether he should come with a rod 
 or in a quite different disposition and manner: <I>Or in love and the 
 spirit of meekness.</I> As much as if he had said, "Take warning, cease 
 your unchristian feuds, rectify the abuses among you, and return to 
 your duty, and you shall find me as gentle and benign as you can with.
 It will be a force upon my inclination to proceed with severity. I had 
 rather come and display the tenderness of a father among you than 
 assert his authority. Do but your duty, and you have no reason to avoid 
 my presence." Note, It is a happy temper in a minister to have the 
 spirit of love and meekness predominant, and yet to maintain his just 
 authority.</P>
