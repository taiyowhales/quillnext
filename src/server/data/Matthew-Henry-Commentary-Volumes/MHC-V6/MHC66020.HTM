 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is thought by some to be the darkest part of all this 
 prophecy: it is very probable that the things contained in it are not
 yet accomplished; and therefore it is the wiser way to content
 ourselves with general observations, rather than to be positive and 
 particular in our explications of it. Here we have an account, 

 I. Of the binding of Satan for a thousand years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The reign of the saints with Christ for the same time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 III. Of the loosing of Satan, and the conflict of the church with Gog
 and Magog, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.
 
 IV. Of the day of judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:11-15">ver. 11</A>,
 
 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of
 the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
 &nbsp; 2  And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is
 the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
 &nbsp; 3  And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and
 set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,
 till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he
 must be loosed a little season.
 &nbsp; 4  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
 given unto them: and <I>I saw</I> the souls of them that were beheaded
 for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had
 not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received
 <I>his</I> mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they
 lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
 &nbsp; 5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
 years were finished. This <I>is</I> the first resurrection.
 &nbsp; 6  Blessed and holy <I>is</I> he that hath part in the first
 resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
 shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a
 thousand years.
 &nbsp; 7  And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be
 loosed out of his prison,
 &nbsp; 8  And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
 quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
 battle: the number of whom <I>is</I> as the sand of the sea.
 &nbsp; 9  And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
 the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came
 down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
 &nbsp; 10  And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
 fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet <I>are,</I>
 and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, I. A prophecy of <I>the binding of Satan</I> for a 
 certain term of time, in which he should have much less power and the 
 church much more peace than before. The power of Satan was broken in 
 part by the setting up of the gospel kingdom in the world; it was 
 further reduced by the empire's becoming Christian; it was yet further 
 broken by the downfall of the mystical Babylon; but still this serpent 
 had many heads, and, when one is wounded, another has life remaining in 
 it. Here we have a further limitation and diminution of his power. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. To whom this work of binding Satan is committed--to <I>an angel from
 heaven.</I> It is very probable that this angel is no other than the 
 Lord Jesus Christ; the description of him will hardly agree with any 
 other. He is one who has power to <I>bind the strong man armed, to cast 
 him out, and to spoil his goods;</I> and therefore must be stronger 
 than he. 

 2. The means he makes use of in this work: he has a <I>chain</I> and a 
 <I>key, a great chain</I> to bind Satan, and <I>the key of the</I> 
 prison in which he was to be confined. Christ never wants proper powers 
 and instruments to break the power of Satan, for he has the powers of 
 heaven and the keys of hell. 
 
 3. The execution of this work,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 (1.) <I>He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the 
 devil, and Satan.</I> Neither the strength of the dragon, nor the 
 subtlety of the serpent, was sufficient to rescue him out of the hands 
 of Christ; he caught hold, and kept his hold. And, 

 (2.) He <I>cast him into the bottomless pit,</I> cast him down with 
 force, and with a just vengeance, to his own place and prison, from 
 which he had been permitted to break out, and disturb the churches, and 
 deceive the nations; now he is brought back to that prison, and there 
 laid in chains. 

 (3.) He is <I>shut up, and a seal set upon him.</I> Christ shuts, and 
 none can open; he shuts by his power, seals by his authority; and his 
 lock and seal even the devils themselves cannot break open. 

 (4.) We have the term of this confinement of Satan--<I>a thousand 
 years,</I> after which he was to <I>be loosed</I> again for <I>a little 
 season.</I> The church should have a considerable time of peace and 
 prosperity, but all her trials were not yet over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the reign of the saints for the same space of time in 
 which Satan continued bound 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>),
 
 and here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who those were that received such honour--those who had suffered for
 Christ, and all who had faithfully adhered to him, not receiving the 
 mark of the beast, nor worshipping his image; all who had kept 
 themselves clear of pagan and papal idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The honour bestowed upon them. 

 (1.) They were raised from the dead, and restored to life. This may be 
 taken either literally or figuratively; they were in a civil and 
 political sense dead, and had a political resurrection; their liberties 
 and privileges were revived and restored. 

 (2.) <I>Thrones,</I> and power of <I>judgment, were given to them;</I> 
 they were possessed of great honour, and interest, and authority, I 
 suppose rather of a spiritual than of a secular nature.

 (3.) <I>They reigned with Christ a thousand years.</I> Those who suffer 
 with Christ shall reign with Christ; they shall reign with him in his 
 spiritual and heavenly kingdom, in a glorious conformity to him in 
 wisdom, righteousness, and holiness, beyond what had been known before 
 in the world. This is called <I>the first resurrection,</I> which none 
 but those who have served Christ and suffered for him shall be favoured 
 with. As for the wicked, they shall not be raised up and restored to 
 their power again, till Satan be let loose; this may be called a 
 resurrection, as the conversion of the Jews is said to be <I>life from 
 the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The happiness of these servants of God is declared. 

 (1.) They are <I>blessed and holy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 None can be blessed but those that are holy; and all that are holy 
 shall be blessed. These were holy as a sort of first-fruits to God in 
 this spiritual resurrection, and as such blessed by him.

 (2.) They are secured from the power of the second death. We know 
 something of what the first death is, and it is awful; but we know not 
 what this second death is. It must be much more dreadful; it is the 
 death of the soul, eternal separation from God. The Lord grant we may 
 never know what it is by experience. Those who have had experience of a 
 spiritual resurrection are saved from the power of the second 
 death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An account of the return of the church's troubles, and another 
 mighty conflict, very sharp, but short and decisive. Observe, 

 1. The restraints laid for a long time on Satan are at length taken 
 off. While this world lasts, Satan's power in it will not be wholly 
 destroyed; it may be limited and lessened, but he will have something 
 still to do for the disturbance of the people of God. 

 2. No sooner is Satan let loose than he falls to his old work, 
 <I>deceiving the nations,</I> and so stirring them up to make a war 
 with the saints and servants of God, which they would never do if he 
 had not first deceived them. They are deceived both as to the cause 
 they engage in (they believe it to be a good cause when it is indeed a 
 very bad one), and as to the issue: they expect to be successful, but 
 are sure to lose the day. 

 3. His last efforts seem to be the greatest. The power now permitted
 to him seems to be more unlimited than before. He had now liberty to
 beat up for his volunteers in all <I>the four quarters of the 
 earth,</I> and he raised a mighty army, the number of which was <I>as 
 the sand of the sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 4. We have the names of the principal commanders in this army under the 
 dragon--<I>Gog and Magog.</I> We need not be too inquisitive as to what 
 particular powers are meant by these names, since the army was gathered 
 from all parts of the world. These names are found in other parts of 
 scripture. <I>Magog</I> we read of in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:2">Gen. x. 2</A>.

 He was one of the sons of Japheth, and peopled the country called 
 <I>Syria,</I> from which his descendants spread into many other parts.
 Of <I>Gog and Magog</I> together we only read in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:2">Ezek. xxxviii. 2</A>,

 a prophecy whence this in Revelation borrows many of its images. 

 5. We have the march and military disposition of this formidable army
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of 
 the saints about, and the beloved city,</I> that is, the spiritual 
 Jerusalem, in which the most precious interests of the people of God 
 are lodged, and therefore to them a beloved city. The army of the 
 saints is described as drawn forth out of the city, and lying under the 
 walls of it, to defend it; they were encamped about Jerusalem: but the 
 army of the enemy was so much superior to that of the church that they 
 compassed them and their city about. 

 6. You have an account of the battle, and the issue of this war:
 <I>Fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured the enemy.</I> 
 Thus the ruin of <I>Gog and Magog</I> is foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:22">Ezek. xxxviii. 22</A>),

 <I>I will rain upon him and upon his bands an overflowing rain, and
 great hailstones, and fire and brimstone.</I> God would, in an 
 extraordinary and more immediate manner, fight this last and decisive 
 battle for his people, that the victory might be complete and the glory 
 redound to himself. 

 7. The doom and punishment of the grand enemy, <I>the devil:</I> he is
 now cast into hell, with his two great officers, <I>the beast and the 
 false prophet,</I> tyranny and idolatry, and that not for any term of 
 time, but to be there <I>tormented night and day, for ever and 
 ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
 whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
 found no place for them.
 &nbsp; 12  And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and
 the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is <I>the
 book</I> of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which
 were written in the books, according to their works.
 &nbsp; 13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
 hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
 judged every man according to their works.
 &nbsp; 14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is
 the second death.
 &nbsp; 15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
 cast into the lake of fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The utter destruction of the devil's kingdom very properly leads to an 
 account of the day of judgment, which will determine every man's 
 everlasting state; and we may be assured there will be a judgment when 
 we see <I>the prince of this world is judged,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:11">John xvi. 11</A>.

 This will be a great day, <I>the great day, when all shall appear
 before the judgment-seat of Christ.</I> The Lord help us firmly to 
 believe this doctrine of the judgment to come. It is a doctrine that 
 made Felix tremble. Here we have a description of it, where observe, 

 1. We behold <I>the throne,</I> and tribunal of judgment, <I>great</I>
 and <I>white,</I> very glorious and perfectly just and righteous. 
 <I>The throne of iniquity, that establishes wickedness by a law,</I> 
 has no fellowship with this righteous throne and tribunal. 

 2. The appearance of the Judge, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ, who 
 then puts on such majesty and terror that <I>the earth and the heaven 
 flee from his face, and there is no place found for them;</I> there is 
 a dissolution of the whole frame of nature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10">2 Pet. iii. 10</A>.

 3. The persons to be judged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The dead, small and great;</I> that is, young and old, low and high, 
 poor and rich. None are so mean but they have some talents to account 
 for, and none so great as to avoid the jurisdiction of this court; not 
 only those that are found alive at the coming of Christ, but all who 
 have died before; the grave shall surrender the bodies of men, hell 
 shall surrender the souls of the wicked, the sea shall surrender the 
 many who seemed to have been lost in it. 

 4. The rule of judgment settled: <I>The books were opened.</I> What
 books? The books of God's omniscience, who is greater than our 
 consciences, and knows all things (there is a book of remembrance with 
 him both for good and bad); and the book of the sinner's conscience, 
 which, though formerly secret, will now be opened. <I>And another
 book</I> shall be <I>opened</I>--the book of the scriptures, the 
 statute-book of heaven, the rule of life. This book is opened as
 containing the law, the touchstone by which the hearts and lives of men 
 are to be tried. This book determines matter of right; the other books 
 give evidence of matters of fact. Some, by <I>the other book,</I> 
 called <I>the book of life,</I> understand the book of God's eternal 
 counsels; but that does not seem to belong to the affair of judgment: 
 in eternal election God does not act judicially, but with absolute 
 sovereign freedom. 

 5. The cause to be tried; and that is, <I>the works of men,</I> what
 they have done and whether it be good or evil. <I>By their works men 
 shall be justified or condemned;</I> for though God knows their state 
 and their principles, and looks chiefly at these, yet, being to approve 
 himself to angels and men as a righteous God, he will try their 
 principles by their practices, and so will <I>be justified when he 
 speaks and clear when he judges.</I> 

 6. The issue of the trial and judgment; and this will be according to
 the evidence of fact, and rule of judgment. All those who have <I>made 
 a covenant with death,</I> and an <I>agreement with hell,</I> shall 
 then be condemned with their infernal confederates, cast with them into 
 the lake of fire, as not being entitled to eternal life, according to 
 the rules of life laid down in the scripture; but those whose names are 
 written in that book (that is, those that are justified and acquitted 
 by the gospel) shall then be justified and acquitted by the Judge, and 
 shall enter into eternal life, having nothing more to fear from death, 
 or hell, or wicked men; for these are all destroyed together. Let it be 
 our great concern to see on what terms we stand with our Bibles, 
 whether they justify us or condemn us now; for the Judge of all will 
 proceed by that rule. <I>Christ shall judge the secrets of all men
 according to the gospel.</I> Happy are those who have so ordered and 
 stated their cause according to the gospel as to know beforehand that 
 they shall be justified in the great day of the Lord!</P>
