 In this chapter the apostle gives earnest exhortations to abound in 
 holiness, with a caution against uncleanness, enforced with several 
 arguments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 He then mentions the great duties of brotherly love, and quietness with
 industry in our callings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 And concludes with comforting those who mourned for their relations and
 friends that died in the Lord,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <I>you</I>
 by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to
 walk and to please God, <I>so</I> ye would abound more and more.
 &nbsp; 2  For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 3  For this is the will of God, <I>even</I> your sanctification, that
 ye should abstain from fornication:
 &nbsp; 4  That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel
 in sanctification and honour;
 &nbsp; 5  Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which
 know not God:
 &nbsp; 6  That no <I>man</I> go beyond and defraud his brother in <I>any</I>
 matter: because that the Lord <I>is</I> the avenger of all such, as we
 also have forewarned you and testified.
 &nbsp; 7  For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
 holiness.
 &nbsp; 8  He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
 hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An exhortation to abound in holiness, to <I>abound more and more</I> 
 in that which is good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 We may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The manner in which the exhortation is given--very affectionately.
 The apostle entreats them as brethren; he calls them so, and loved them 
 as such. Because his love to them was very great, he exhorts them very 
 earnestly: <I>We beseech and exhort you.</I> The apostle was unwilling 
 to take any denial, and therefore repeats his exhortation again and 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The matter of his exhortation--that they would abound more and more
 in holy walking, or excel in those things that are good, in good works. 
 Their faith was justly famed abroad, and they were already examples to 
 other churches: yet the apostle would have them yet further to excel 
 others, and to make further progress in holiness. Note, 

 (1.) Those who most excel others fall short of perfection. The very 
 best of us should <I>forget those things which are behind, and reach 
 forth unto those things which are before.</I> 

 (2.) It is not enough that we abide in the faith of the gospel, but we 
 must abound in the work of faith. We must not only persevere to the 
 end, but we should grow better, and walk more evenly and closely with 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The arguments with which the apostle enforces his exhortation. 

 (1.) They had been informed of their duty. They knew their Master's 
 will, and could not plead ignorance as an excuse. Now as faith, so 
 knowledge, is dead without practice. They had received of those who had 
 converted them to Christianity, or been taught of them, <I>how they 
 ought to walk.</I> Observe, The design of the gospel is to teach men 
 not only what they should believe, but also how they ought to live; not 
 so much to fill men's minds with notions as to regulate their temper 
 and behaviour. The apostle taught them how to walk, not how to talk. To 
 talk well without living well will never bring us to heaven: for the 
 character of those who are in Christ Jesus is this: <I>They walk not 
 after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</I> 

 (2.) Another argument is that the apostle taught and exhorted them in 
 the name, or by the authority, of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was 
 Christ's minister and ambassador, declaring to them what was the will 
 and command of the Lord Jesus. 

 (3.) Another argument is this. Herein they would please God. Holy
 walking is most pleasing to the holy God, <I>who is glorious in 
 holiness.</I> This ought to be the aim and ambition of every Christian, 
 to please God and to be accepted of him. We should not be
 men-pleasers, nor flesh-pleasers, but should walk so as to please God. 
 
 (4.) The rule according to which they ought to walk and act--<I>the 
 commandments they had given them by the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> which 
 were the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, because given 
 by authority and direction from him and such as were agreeable to his 
 will. The apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ were only commissioned by 
 him to teach men to observe all things <I>whatsoever he had commanded 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 Though they had great authority from Christ, yet that was to teach men
 what Christ had commanded, not to give forth commandments of their own.
 They did not act as lords over God's heritage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:3">1 Pet. v. 3</A>),

 nor should any do so that pretend to be their successors. The apostle 
 could appeal to the Thessalonians, who knew what commandments he gave 
 them, that they were no other than what he had received from the Lord 
 Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A caution against uncleanness, this being a sin directly contrary 
 to sanctification, or that holy walking to which he so earnestly 
 exhorts them. This caution is expressed, and also enforced by many 
 arguments,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is expressed in these words: <I>That you should abstain from 
 fornication</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 by which we are to understand all uncleanness whatsoever, either in a 
 married or unmarried state. Adultery is of course included, though 
 fornication is particularly mentioned. And other sorts of uncleanness 
 are also forbidden, of which it is a shame even to speak, though they 
 are done by too many in secret. All that is contrary to chastity in 
 heart, speech, and behaviour, is contrary to the command of God in the 
 decalogue, and contrary to that holiness which the gospel requires.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There are several arguments to enforce this caution. As, 

 (1.) This branch of sanctification in particular is the will of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is the will of God in general that we should be holy, because <I>he 
 that called us is holy,</I> and because we are <I>chosen unto salvation 
 through the sanctification of the Spirit;</I> and not only does God 
 require holiness in the heart, but also purity in our bodies, and that 
 we should cleanse ourselves from all <I>filthiness both of flesh and 
 spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1">2 Cor. vii. 1</A>.

 Whenever the body is, as it ought to be, devoted to God, and dedicated 
 and set apart for him, it should be kept clean and pure for his 
 service; and, as chastity is one branch of our sanctification, so this 
 is one thing which God commands in his law, and what his grace effects 
 in all true believers.

 (2.) This will be greatly for our honour: so much is plainly implied,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Whereas the contrary will be a great dishonour. <I>And his reproach 
 shall not be wiped away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:33">Prov. vi. 33</A>.

 The body is here called the vessel of the soul, which dwells therein 
 (so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:5">1 Sam. xxi. 5</A>),

 and it must be kept pure from defiling lusts. Every one should be 
 careful in this matter, as he values his own honour and will not be 
 contemptible on this account, that his inferior appetites and passions 
 gain not the ascendant, tyrannizing over his reason and conscience, and 
 enslaving the superior faculties of his soul. What can be more 
 dishonourable than for a rational soul to be enslaved by bodily 
 affections and brutal appetites?

 (3.) To indulge the lust of concupiscence is to live and act like 
 heathens? <I>Even as the Gentiles who know not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Gentiles, and especially the Grecians, were commonly guilty of some 
 sins of uncleanness which were not so evidently forbidden by the light 
 of nature. But they did not know God, nor his mind and will, so well as 
 Christians know, and should know, this his will, namely <I>our 
 sanctification</I> in this branch of it. It is not so much to be
 wondered at, therefore, if the Gentiles indulge their fleshly appetites 
 and lusts; but Christians should not walk as unconverted Gentiles, 
 <I>in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, 
 banquetings,</I> &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">1 Pet. iv. 3</A>),

 because those who are in Christ <I>have crucified the flesh with its 
 affections and lusts.</I> 

 (4.) The sin of uncleanness, especially adultery, is a great piece of 
 injustice that God will be the avenger of; so we may understand those 
 words, <I>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>in any matter</I>--<B><I>en to pragmati,</I></B> in <I>this</I> 
 matter of which the apostle is speaking in the preceding and following 
 verses, namely, the sin of uncleanness. Some understand these words as 
 a further warning and caution against injustice and oppression, all 
 fraud and deceit in our dealings with men, which are certainly 
 criminal, and contrary to the gospel. And Christians should not impose 
 upon the ignorance and necessity of those they deal with, and so go 
 beyond them, nor should they by equivocations or lying arts defraud 
 them; and although this may be practised by some and lie long 
 undiscovered, and so go unpunished among men, yet the righteous God 
 will render a recompence. But the meaning may rather be to show the 
 injustice and wrong that in many cases are done by the sin of 
 uncleanness. Not only are fornication and other acts of uncleanness 
 sins against his own body who commits them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:18">1 Cor. vi. 18</A>),

 not only are they very injurious to the sinner himself both in soul and 
 body, but sometimes they are very injurious, and no less than 
 defrauding, acts of injustice to others, particularly to those who are 
 joined together in the marriage covenant and to their posterity. And,
 as this sin is of such a heinous nature, so it follows that God will be 
 the avenger of it. <I>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:4">Heb. xiii. 4</A>.

 This the apostle had forewarned and testified by his gospel, which, as 
 it contained exceedingly great and precious promises, so also it 
 <I>revealed from heaven the wrath of God against all ungodliness and 
 unrighteousness among men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>.

 (5.) The sin of uncleanness is contrary to the nature and design of our
 Christian calling: <I>For God hath called us not unto uncleanness, but 
 unto holiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The law of God forbids all impurity, and the gospel requires the 
 greatest purity; it calls us from uncleanness unto holiness.

 (6.) The contempt therefore of God's law and gospel is the contempt of 
 God himself: <I>He that despises despises God, not man</I> only. Some
 might possibly make light of the precepts of purity and holiness, 
 because they heard them from men like themselves; but the apostle lets 
 them know that they were God's commands, and to violate them was no 
 less than to despise God. He adds, <I>God hath given Christians his 
 Spirit,</I> intimating that all sorts of uncleanness do in an especial 
 manner grieve the Holy Spirit, and will provoke him to withdraw from 
 us; and also the Holy Spirit is given unto us to arm us against these 
 sins, and to help us to mortify these deeds of the body, that we may 
 live,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto
 you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
 &nbsp; 10  And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
 Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more
 and more;
 &nbsp; 11  And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business,
 and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
 &nbsp; 12  That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and
 <I>that</I> ye may have lack of nothing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle mentions the great duties,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of brotherly love. This he exhorts them to increase in yet more and 
 more. The exhortation is introduced, not with a compliment, but with a 
 commendation, because they were remarkable in the exercise of it, which 
 made it less needful that he should write to them about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus by his good opinion of them he insinuated himself into their 
 affections, and so made way for his exhortation to them. Note, We 
 should take notice of that in others which is good, to their praise, 
 that by so doing we may lay engagements upon them to abound therein 
 more and more. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is that the apostle commends in them. It was not so much 
 their own virtue as God's grace; yet he takes notice of the evidence 
 they gave of the grace of God in them. 

 (1.) It was God's grace that he took special notice of: that God had
 taught them this good lesson: <I>You yourselves are taught of God to 
 love one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Whoever does that which is good is taught of God to do it, and God must 
 have the glory. All who are savingly taught of God are taught this 
 lesson, to love one another. This is the livery of Christ's family.
 Note also, The teaching of the Spirit exceeds the teaching of men; and, 
 as no man should teach contrary to what God teaches, so none can teach 
 so effectually as he teaches; and men's teaching is fain and useless 
 unless God teach also.

 (2.) The Thessalonians gave good evidence of their being taught of God
 by <I>their love to the brethren in all Macedonia,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They not only loved those of their own city and society, or such as 
 were near them and just of their own sentiments, but their love was 
 extensive. And a true Christian's is so to all the saints, though
 distant from him in place, and differing from him in some opinions or 
 practices of less moment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The exhortation itself is to increase more and more in this great 
 grace and duty of brotherly love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Though these Thessalonians had in some sense no need of an exhortation 
 to brotherly love, as if it were wholly wanting, yet they must be 
 exhorted to pray for more, and labour for more. There are none on this 
 side heaven who love in perfection. Those who are eminent in this or 
 any other grace have need of increase therein as well as of 
 perseverance unto the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of quietness and industry in their callings. Observe, 

 1. The apostle exhorts to these duties: that they should <I>study to be
 quiet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is the most desirable thing to have a calm and quiet temper, and to 
 be of a peaceable and quiet behaviour. This tends much to our own and 
 others' happiness; and Christians should study how to be quiet. We 
 should be ambitious and industrious how to be calm and quiet in our 
 minds, in patience to possess our own souls, and to be quiet towards 
 others; or of a meek and mild, a gentle and peaceable disposition, not 
 given to strife, contention, or division. Satan is very busy to 
 disquiet us; and we have that in our own hearts that disposes us to be 
 disquiet; therefore let us study to be quiet. It follows, <I>Do your 
 own business.</I> When we go beyond this, we expose ourselves to a 
 great deal of inquietude. Those who are busy-bodies, meddling in other 
 men's matters, generally have but little quiet in their own minds and 
 cause great disturbances among their neighbours; at least they seldom 
 mind the other exhortation, to be diligent in their own calling, <I>to 
 work with their own hands;</I> and yet this was what the apostle 
 commanded them, and what is required of us also. Christianity does not
 discharge us from the work and duty of our particular callings, but 
 teaches us to be diligent therein.

 2. The exhortation is enforced with a double argument; namely,

 (1.) So we shall live creditably. Thus we shall walk honestly, or
 decently and creditably, towards those that are without, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This will be to act as becomes the gospel, and will gain a good report 
 from those that are strangers, yea, enemies to it. Note, It is a great 
 ornament to religion when the professors of it are of meek and quiet 
 spirits, diligent to do their own business, and not busy-bodies in 
 other men's matters.

 (2.) We shall live comfortably, and have lack of nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 People often by their slothfulness bring themselves into narrow 
 circumstances, and reduce themselves to great straits, and are liable 
 to many wants, when such as are diligent in their own business live 
 comfortably and have lack of nothing. They are not burdensome to their 
 friends, nor scandalous to strangers. They earn their own bread, and 
 have the greatest pleasure in so doing.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,
 concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
 others which have no hope.
 &nbsp; 14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
 them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
 &nbsp; 15  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
 which are alive <I>and</I> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
 not prevent them which are asleep.
 &nbsp; 16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
 with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
 the dead in Christ shall rise first:
 &nbsp; 17  Then we which are alive <I>and</I> remain shall be caught up
 together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
 and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
 &nbsp; 18  Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle comforts the Thessalonians who mourned for 
 the death of their relations and friends that died in the Lord. His 
 design is to dissuade them from excessive grief, or inordinate sorrow, 
 on that account. <I>All grief</I> for the death of friends is far from 
 being unlawful; we may weep at least for ourselves if we do not weep 
 for them, weep for own loss, though it may be their fain. Yet we must 
 not be immoderate in our sorrows, because,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This looks as if we had no hope, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is to act too much like the Gentiles, who had no hope of a better 
 life after this; whereas we Christians, who have a most sure hope, the 
 hope of eternal life after this, <I>which God who cannot lie hath 
 promised us,</I> should moderate all our joys and our sorrows on 
 account of any worldly thing. This hope is more than enough to balance 
 all our griefs upon account of any of the crosses of the present 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This is an effect of ignorance concerning those who are dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 There are some things which we cannot be ignorant of concerning those 
 that are asleep; for the land they are removed to is a land of 
 darkness, which we know but little of and have no correspondence with.
 To go among the dead is to go among we know not whom, and to live we 
 know not how. Death is an unknown thing, and the state of the dead, or 
 the state after death, we are much in the dark about; yet there are 
 some things concerning those especially who die in the Lord that we 
 need not, and ought not, to be ignorant of; and, if these things be 
 really understood and duly considered, they will be sufficient to allay 
 our sorrow concerning them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They sleep in Jesus. They are asleep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They have <I>fallen asleep in Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:18">1 Cor. xv. 18</A>.

 Death does not annihilate them. It is but a sleep to them. It is their 
 rest, and undisturbed rest. They have retired out of this troublesome 
 world, to rest from all their labours and sorrows, and they sleep in 
 Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Being still in union with him, they sleep in his arms and are under his 
 special care and protection. Their souls are in his presence, and their 
 dust is under his care and power; so that they are not lost, nor are 
 they losers, but great gainers by death, and their removal out of this 
 world is into a better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall be raised up from the dead, and awakened out of their 
 sleep, for <I>God will bring them with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They then are with God, and are better where they are than when they 
 were here; and when God comes he will bring them with him. The
 doctrine of the resurrection and the second coming of Christ is a great 
 antidote against the fear of death and inordinate sorrow for the death 
 of our Christian friends; and this doctrine we have a full assurance 
 of, because we <I>believe that Jesus died and rose again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is taken for granted that as Christians they knew and believed this.
 The death and resurrection of Christ are fundamental articles of the 
 Christian religion, and give us hope of a joyful resurrection; for 
 <I>Christ, having risen from the dead, has become the first fruits of 
 those that slept;</I> and therefore <I>those who have fallen asleep in 
 him have not perished nor are lost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:18,20">1 Cor. xv. 18, 20</A>.

 His resurrection is a full confirmation of all that is said in the
 gospel, or by the word of the Lord, which has <I>brought life and 
 immortality to light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their state and condition shall be glorious and happy at the second 
 coming of Christ. This the apostle informs the Thessalonians of <I>by 
 the word of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 by divine revelation from the Lord Jesus; for though the resurrection 
 of the dead, and a future state of blessedness, were part of the creed 
 of the Old-Testament saints, yet they are much more clearly revealed in 
 and by the gospel. By this word of the Lord we know, 

 (1.) That the Lord Jesus will come down from heaven in all the pomp and 
 power of the upper world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout.</I> He 
 ascended into heaven after his resurrection, and passed through these 
 material heavens into the third heaven, which must retain him till the 
 restitution of all things; and then he will come again, and appear in 
 his glory. He will descend from heaven into this our air, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The appearance will be with pomp and power, <I>with a shout</I>--the 
 shout of a king, and the power and authority of a mighty king and 
 conqueror, with <I>the voice of the archangel;</I> an innumerable 
 company of angels will attend him. Perhaps <I>one,</I> as general of
 those hosts of the Lord, will give notice of his approach, and the 
 glorious appearance of this great Redeemer and Judge will be proclaimed 
 and ushered in by the <I>trump of God. For the trumpet shall sound,</I> 
 and this will awaken those that sleep in the dust of the earth, and 
 will summon all the world to appear. For,

 (2.) The dead shall be raised: <I>The dead in Christ shall rise 
 first</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 before those who are <I>found alive at Christ's coming shall be 
 changed;</I> and so it appears that those who shall then <I>be found 
 alive shall not prevent those that are asleep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The first care of the Redeemer in that day will be about his dead 
 saints; he will raise them before the great change passes on those that 
 shall be found alive: so that those who did not sleep in death will 
 have no greater privilege or joy at that day than those who fell asleep 
 in Jesus.

 (3.) Those that shall be found alive will then be changed. They shall
 <I>be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in 
 the air,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 At, or immediately before, this rapture into the clouds, those who are 
 alive will undergo a mighty change, which will be equivalent to dying. 
 This change is so mysterious that we cannot comprehend it: we know 
 little or nothing of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:51">1 Cor. xv. 51</A>.

 Only, in the general, <I>this mortal must put on immortality,</I> and 
 these bodies will be made fit to inherit the kingdom of God, which 
 flesh and blood in its present state are not capable of. This change 
 will be <I>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52">1 Cor. xv. 52</A>),
 
 in the very instant, or not long after the raising up of those that 
 sleep in Jesus. And those who are raised, and thus changed, shall meet 
 together in the clouds, and there meet with their Lord, to congratulate 
 him on his coming, to receive the crown of glory he will then bestow 
 upon them, and to be assessors with him in judgment, approving and 
 applauding the sentence he will then pass upon the prince of the power 
 of the air, and all the wicked, who shall be doomed to destruction with 
 the devil and his angels. 

 (4.) Here is the bliss of the saints at that day: they shall <I>be ever 
 with the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It will be some part of their felicity that all the saints shall meet 
 together, and remain together for ever; but the principal happiness of 
 heaven is this, <I>to be with the Lord,</I> to see him, live with him, 
 and enjoy him, for ever. This should comfort the saints upon the death 
 of their friends, that, although death has made a separation, yet their 
 souls and bodies will meet again; we and they shall meet together 
 again: we and they shall meet together again: we and they with all the
 saints shall meet our Lord, and be with him for ever, no more to be 
 separated wither from him or from one another for ever. And the apostle 
 would have us <I>comfort one another with these words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 We should endeavour to support one another in times of sorrow, not 
 deaden one another's spirits, nor weaken one another's hands, but 
 should comfort one another; and this may be done by serious 
 consideration and discourse on the many good lessons to be learned from 
 the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, the second coming of 
 Christ, and the glory of the saints in that day.</P>
