 In this chapter the apostle, 

 I. Blames them for their indulgence in the case of the incestuous
 person, and orders him to be excommunicated, and delivered to Satan,

 II. He exhorts them to Christian purity, by purging out the old leaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 And, 

 III. Directs them to shun even the common conversation of Christians
 who were guilty of any notorious and flagitious wickedness,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  It is reported commonly <I>that there is</I> fornication among
 you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the
 Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
 &nbsp; 2  And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he
 that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
 &nbsp; 3  For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
 judged already, as though I were present, <I>concerning</I> him that
 hath so done this deed,
 &nbsp; 4  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
 together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 &nbsp; 5  To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the
 flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 6  Your glorying <I>is</I> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
 leaveneth the whole lump?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle states the case; and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Lets them know what was the common or general report concerning 
 them, that one of their community was guilty of fornication, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was told in all places, to their dishonour, and the reproach of 
 Christians. And it was the more reproachful because it could not be 
 denied. Note, The heinous sins of professed Christians are quickly 
 noted and noised abroad. We should walk circumspectly, for many eyes 
 are upon us, and many mouths will be opened against us if we fall into 
 any scandalous practice. This was not a common instance of fornication, 
 but <I>such as was not so much as named among the Gentiles, that a man 
 should have his father's wife</I>--either marry her while his father 
 was alive, or keep her as his concubine, either when he was dead or 
 while he was alive. In either of these cases, his criminal conversation 
 with her might be called <I>fornication;</I> but had his father been 
 dead, and he, after his decease, married to her, it had been incest 
 still, but neither fornication nor adultery in the strictest sense. But 
 to marry her, or keep her as a concubine, while his father was alive, 
 though he had repudiated her, or she had deserted him, whether she were 
 his own mother or not, was incestuous fornication: <I>Scelus 
 incredibile</I> (as Cicero calls it), <I>et prater unum in omni 
 vit&acirc; inauditum</I> (Orat. pro Cluent.), when a woman had caused 
 her daughter to be put away, and was married to her husband.
 <I>Incredible wickedness!</I> says the orator; <I>such I never heard of 
 in all my life besides.</I> Not that there were no such instances of 
 incestuous marriages among the heathens; but, whenever they happened, 
 they gave a shock to every man of virtue and probity among them. They 
 could not think of them without horror, nor mention them without 
 dislike and detestation. Yet such a horrible wickedness was committed 
 by one in the church of Corinth, and, as is probable, a leader of one 
 of the factions among them, a principal man. Note, The best churches 
 are, in this state of imperfection, liable to very great corruptions.
 Is it any wonder when so horrible a practice was tolerated in an 
 apostolical church, a church planted by the great apostle of the 
 Gentiles?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He greatly blames them for their own conduct hereupon: <I>They were 
 puffed up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 <I>they gloried,</I> 

 1. Perhaps on account of this very scandalous person. He might be a man 
 of great eloquence, of deep science, and for this reason very greatly 
 esteemed, and followed, and cried up, by many among them. They were 
 proud that they had such a leader. Instead of mourning for his fall, 
 and their own reproach upon his account, and renouncing him and 
 removing him from the society, they continued to applaud him and pride 
 themselves in him. Note, Pride or self-esteem often lies at the bottom 
 of our immoderate esteem of others, and this makes us as blind to their 
 faults as to our own. It is true humility that will bring a man to a 
 sight and acknowledgement of his errors. The proud man either wholly 
 overlooks or artfully disguises his faults, or endeavours to transform 
 his blemishes into beauties. Those of the Corinthians that were
 admirers of the incestuous person's gifts could overlook or extenuate 
 his horrid practices. Or else, 

 2. It may intimate to us that some of the opposite party were puffed
 up. They were proud of their own standing, and trampled upon him that 
 fell. Note, It is a very wicked thing to glory over the miscarriages
 and sins of others. We should lay them to heart, and mourn for them, 
 not be puffed up with them. Probably this was one effect of the 
 divisions among them. The opposite party made their advantage of this 
 scandalous lapse, and were glad of the opportunity. Note, It is a sad 
 consequence of divisions among Christians that it makes them apt to 
 rejoice in iniquity. The sins of others should be our sorrow. Nay, 
 churches should mourn for the scandalous behaviour of particular 
 members, and, if they be incorrigible, should remove them. He that had 
 done this wicked deed should have been taken away from among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the apostle's direction to them how they should now 
 proceed with this scandalous sinner. He would have him excommunicated 
 and delivered to Satan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>);

 <I>as absent in body, yet present in spirit, he had judged already as 
 if he had been present;</I> that is, he had, by revelation and the 
 miraculous gift of discerning vouchsafed him by the Spirit, as perfect 
 a knowledge of the case, and had hereupon come to the following 
 determination, not without special authority from the Holy Spirit. He
 says this to let them know that, though he was at a distance, he did 
 not pass an unrighteous sentence, nor judge without having as full 
 cognizance of the case as if he had been on the spot. Note, Those who
 would appear righteous judges to the world will take care to inform 
 them that they do not pass sentence without full proof and evidence. 
 The apostle adds, <I>him who hath so done this deed.</I> The fact was 
 not only heinously evil in itself, and horrible to the heathens, but 
 there were some particular circumstances that greatly aggravated the 
 offence. He had so committed the evil as to heighten the guilt by the 
 manner of doing it. Perhaps he was a minister, a teacher, or a 
 principal man among them. By this means the church and their profession 
 were more reproached. Note, In dealing with scandalous sinners, not 
 only are they to be charged with the fact, but the aggravating 
 circumstances of it. Paul had judged that <I>he should be delivered to 
 Satan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and this was to be done <I>in the name of Christ,</I> with the power of 
 Christ, and in a full assembly, where the apostle would be also present 
 in spirit, or by his spiritual gift of discerning at a distance. Some 
 think that this is to be understood of a mere ordinary excommunication, 
 and that delivering him to Satan for the destruction of the flesh is 
 only meant of disowning him, and casting him out of the church, that by 
 this means he might be brought to repentance, and his flesh might be 
 mortified. Christ and Satan divide the world: and those that live in 
 sin, when they profess relation to Christ, belong to another master, 
 and by excommunication should be delivered up to him; and this in the 
 name of Christ. Note, Church-censures are Christ's ordinances, and 
 should be dispensed in his name. It was to be done also <I>when they
 were gathered together,</I> in full assembly. The more public the more 
 solemn, and the more solemn the more likely to have a good effect on 
 the offender. Note, Church-censures on notorious and incorrigible 
 sinners should be passed with great solemnity. Those who sin in this 
 manner <I>are to be rebuked before all, that all may fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:20">1 Tim. v. 20</A>.

 Others think the apostle is not to be understood of mere
 excommunication, but of a miraculous power or authority they had of 
 delivering a scandalous sinner into the power of Satan, to have bodily 
 diseases inflicted, and to be tormented by him with bodily pains, which 
 is the meaning of the <I>destruction of the flesh.</I> In this sense 
 the destruction of the flesh has been a happy occasion of the salvation 
 of the spirit. It is probable that this was a mixed case. It was an 
 extraordinary instance: and the church was to proceed against him by 
 just censure; the apostle, when they did so, put forth an act of 
 extraordinary power, and gave him up to Satan, nor for his destruction, 
 but for his deliverance, at least for the destruction of the flesh, 
 that the soul might be saved. Note, The great end of church-censures is 
 the good of those who fall under them, their spiritual and eternal 
 good. It is that their spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord 
 Jesus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Yet it is not merely a regard to their benefit that is to be had in 
 proceeding against them. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He hints the danger of contagion from this example: <I>Your 
 glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the 
 whole lump?</I> The bad example of a man in rank and reputation is very 
 mischievous, spreads the contagion far and wide. It did so, probably, 
 in this very church and case: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:21">2 Cor. xii. 21</A>.

 They could not be ignorant of this. The experience of the whole world
 was for it; <I>one scabbed sheep infects a whole flock.</I> A little 
 heaven will quickly spread the ferment through a great lump. Note, 
 Concern for their purity and preservation should engage Christian 
 churches to remove gross and scandalous sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new
 lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is
 sacrificed for us:
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
 with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened
 <I>bread</I> of sincerity and truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle exhorts them to purity, by purging out the old leaven. 
 In this observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The advice itself, addressed either, 

 1. To the church in general; and so purging out the old leaven, that 
 they might be a new lump, refers to the <I>putting away from themselves 
 that wicked person,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, Christian churches should be pure and holy, and not bear such 
 corrupt and scandalous members. They are to be unleavened, and should 
 endure no such heterogeneous mixture to sour and corrupt them. Or,

 2. To each particular member of the church. And so it implies that
 they should purge themselves from all impurity of heart and life, 
 especially from this kind of wickedness, to which the Corinthians were 
 addicted to a proverb. See the <I>argument</I> at the beginning. This 
 old leaven was in a particular manner to be purged out, that they might 
 become a new lump. Note, Christians should be careful to keep 
 themselves clean, as well as purge polluted members out of their 
 society. And they should especially avoid the sins to which they 
 themselves were once most addicted, and the reigning vices of the 
 places and the people where they live. They were also to purge 
 themselves from malice and wickedness--all ill-will and mischievous 
 subtlety. This is leaven that sours the mind to a great degree. It is 
 not improbable that this was intended as a check to some who gloried in 
 the scandalous behaviour of the offender, both out of pride and pique.
 Note, Christians should be careful to keep free from malice and 
 mischief. Love is the very essence and life of the Christian religion.
 It is the fairest image of God, <I>for God is love</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:16">1 John iv. 16</A>),
 
 and therefore it is no wonder if it be the greatest beauty and ornament
 of a Christian. But malice is murder in its principles: He that hates 
 his brother is a murderer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15">1 John iii. 15</A>),

 he bears the image and proclaims him the offspring of him <I>who was a
 murderer from the beginning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>.

 How hateful should every thing be to a Christian that looks like malice
 and mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reason with which this advice is enforced: <I>For Christ our 
 passover is sacrificed for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This is the great doctrine of the gospel. The Jews, after they had 
 killed the passover, kept the feast of unleavened bread. So must we; 
 not for seven days only, but all our days. We should die with our 
 Saviour to sin, be planted into the likeness of his death by mortifying 
 sin, and into the likeness of his resurrection by rising again to 
 newness of life, and that internal and external. We must have new 
 hearts and new lives. Note, The whole life of a Christian must be a 
 feast of unleavened bread. His common conversation and his religious 
 performances must be holy. <I>He must purge out the old leaven, and 
 keep the feast of unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</I> He must 
 be without guilt in his conduct towards God and man. And the more there 
 is of sincerity in our own profession, the less shall we censure that 
 of others. Note, On the whole, The sacrifice of our Redeemer is the 
 strongest argument with a gracious heart for purity and sincerity. How 
 sincere a regard did he show to our welfare, in dying for us! and how 
 terrible a proof was his death of the detestable nature of sin, and 
 God's displeasure against it! Heinous evil, that could not be expiated 
 but with the blood of the Son of God! And shall a Christian love the 
 murderer of his Lord? God forbid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with
 fornicators:
 &nbsp; 10  Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or
 with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then
 must ye needs go out of the world.
 &nbsp; 11  But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any
 man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an
 idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with
 such an one no not to eat.
 &nbsp; 12  For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?
 do not ye judge them that are within?
 &nbsp; 13  But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away
 from among yourselves that wicked person.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle advises them to shun the company and converse of 
 scandalous professors. Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The advice itself: <I>I wrote to you in a letter not to company with 
 fornicators,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Some think this was an epistle written to them before, which is lost. 
 Yet we have lost nothing by it, the Christian revelation being entire 
 in those books of scripture which have come down to us, which are all 
 that were intended by God for the general use of Christians, or he 
 could and would in his providence have preserved more of the writings 
 of inspired men. Some think it is to be understood of this very 
 epistle, that he had written this advice before he had full information 
 of their whole case, but thought it needful now to be more particular. 
 And therefore on this occasion he tells them that if any man called a 
 brother, any one professing Christianity, and being a member of a 
 Christian church, were <I>a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or 
 a railer,</I> that they should not <I>keep company with him, nor so 
 much as eat with such a one.</I> They were to avoid all familiarity 
 with him; they were to have no commerce with him; they were to have no 
 commerce with him: but, that they might shame him, and bring him to 
 repentance, must disclaim and shun him. Note, Christians are to avoid 
 the familiar conversation of fellow-christians that are notoriously 
 wicked, and under just censure for their flagitious practices. Such 
 disgrace the Christian name. They may call themselves <I>brethren in 
 Christ,</I> but they are not Christian brethren. They are only fit 
 companions for the brethren in iniquity; and to such company they 
 should be left, till they <I>mend their ways and doings.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he limits this advice. He does not forbid the Christians the 
 like commerce with scandalously wicked heathens. He does not forbid 
 their eating nor conversing with the <I>fornicators of this world,</I> 
 &c. They know no better. They profess no better. The gods they serve, 
 and the worship they render to many of them, countenance such 
 wickedness. "<I>You must needs go out of the world</I> if you will have 
 no conversation with such men. Your Gentile neighbours are generally 
 vicious and profane; and it is impossible, as long as you are in the 
 world, and have any worldly business to do, but you must fall into 
 their company. This cannot be wholly avoided." Note, Christians may and 
 ought to testify more respect to loose worldlings than to loose 
 Christians. This seems a paradox. Why should we shun the company of a 
 profane or loose Christian, rather than that of a profane or loose 
 heathen?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reason of this limitation is here assigned. It is impossible 
 the one should be avoided. Christians must have gone out of the world 
 to avoid the company of loose heathens. But this was impossible, as 
 long as they had business in the world. While they are minding their
 duty, and doing their proper business, God can and will preserve them 
 from contagion. Besides, they carry an antidote against the infection 
 of their bad example, and are naturally upon their guard. They are apt 
 to have a horror at their wicked practices. But the dread of sin wears 
 off by familiar converse with wicked Christians. Our own safety and 
 preservation are a reason of this difference. But, besides, heathens 
 were such as Christians had nothing to do to judge and censure, and 
 avoid upon a censure passed; for <I>they are without</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and must be left to <I>God's judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 But, as to members of the church, they are within, are professedly 
 bound by the laws and rules of Christianity, and not only liable to the 
 judgment of God, but to the censures of those who are set over them, 
 and the fellow-members of the same body, when they transgress those 
 rules. Every Christian is bound to judge them unfit for communion and 
 familiar converse. They are to be punished, by having this mark of 
 disgrace put upon them, that they may be shamed, and, if possible, 
 reclaimed thereby: and the more because the sins of such much more 
 dishonour God than the sins of the openly wicked and profane can do. 
 The church therefore is obliged to clear herself from all confederacy 
 with them, or connivance at them, and to bear testimony against their 
 wicked practices. Note, Though the church has nothing to do with those 
 without, it must endeavour to keep clear of the guilt and reproach of 
 those within.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How he applies the argument to the case before him: "<I>Therefore 
 put away from among yourselves that wicked person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Cast him out of your fellowship, and avoid his conversation."</P>
