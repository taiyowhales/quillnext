 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some think that Felix was turned out, and Festus succeeded him, quickly
 after Paul's imprisonment, and that the two years mentioned in the
 close of the foregoing chapter are to be reckoned from the beginning of
 Nero's reign; but it seems more natural to compute them from Paul's
 being delivered into the hands of Felix. However, we have here much the
 same management of Paul's case as we had in the foregoing chapter;
 cognizance is here taken of it,

 I. By Festus the governor; it is brought before him by the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 The hearing of it is appointed to be, not at Jerusalem, as the Jews
 desired, out at C&aelig;sarea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 The Jews appear against Paul and accuse him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:7">ver. 7</A>),

 but he stands upon his own innocency 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:8">ver. 8</A>);

 and to avoid the removing of the cause to Jerusalem, to which he was
 pressed to consent, he at length appeals to C&aelig;sar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 II. By king Agrippa, to whom Festus relates his case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>),

 and Agrippa desires he might have the hearing of it himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:22">ver. 22</A>.
 
 The court is accordingly set, and Paul brought to the bar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:23">ver. 23</A>),

 and Festus opens the cause 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>),

 to introduce Paul's defence in the next chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days
 he ascended from C&aelig;sarea to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
 against Paul, and besought him,
 &nbsp; 3 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
 Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.
 &nbsp; 4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at C&aelig;sarea,
 and that he himself would depart shortly <I>thither.</I>
 &nbsp; 5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go
 down with <I>me,</I> and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness
 in him.
 &nbsp; 6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he
 went down unto C&aelig;sarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment
 seat commanded Paul to be brought.
 &nbsp; 7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
 stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against
 Paul, which they could not prove.
 &nbsp; 8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
 Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against C&aelig;sar, have I
 offended any thing at all.
 &nbsp; 9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul,
 and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
 these things before me?
 &nbsp; 10 Then said Paul, I stand at C&aelig;sar's judgment seat, where I
 ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou
 very well knowest.
 &nbsp; 11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy
 of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these
 things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them.
 I appeal unto C&aelig;sar.
 &nbsp; 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council,
 answered, Hast thou appealed unto C&aelig;sar? unto C&aelig;sar shalt thou
 go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We commonly say, "New lords, new laws, new customs;" but here was a new 
 governor, and yet Paul had the same treatment from him that he had from 
 the former, and no better. Festus, like Felix, is not so just to him as 
 he should have been, for he does not release him; and yet not so unjust 
 to him as the Jews would have had him to be, for he will not condemn 
 him to die, nor expose him to their rage. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The pressing application which the high priest and other Jews used 
 with the governor to persuade him to abandon Paul; for to send him to 
 Jerusalem was in effect to abandon him. 

 1. See how speedy they were in their applications to Festus concerning
 Paul. As soon as ever he <I>had come into the province,</I> and had 
 taken possession of the government, into which, probably, he was 
 installed at C&aelig;sarea, within <I>three days he went up to 
 Jerusalem,</I> to show himself there, and presently the priests were 
 upon him to proceed against Paul. He staid <I>three days at 
 C&aelig;sarea,</I> where Paul was a prisoner, and we do not find that 
 in that time Paul made any application to him to release him, though, 
 no doubt, he could have made good friends, that he might hope to have 
 prevailed by; but as soon as ever he comes up to Jerusalem the priests 
 are in all haste to make an interest with him against Paul. See how 
 restless a thing malice is. Paul more patiently bears the lengthening 
 out of his imprisonment than his enemies do the delay of his 
 prosecution even to the death. 

 2. See how spiteful they were in their application. They <I>informed
 the governor against Paul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 before he was brought upon a fair trial, that so they might, if 
 possible, prejudge the cause with the governor, and make him a party 
 who was to be the judge. But this artifice, though base enough, they 
 could not confide in; for the governor would be sure to hear him 
 himself, and then all their informations against him would fall to the 
 ground; and therefore they form another project much more base, and 
 that is to assassinate Paul before he came upon his trial. These 
 inhuman hellish methods, which all the world profess at least to abhor, 
 have these persecutors recourse to, to gratify their malice against the 
 gospel of Christ, and this too under colour of zeal for Moses.
 <I>Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum--Such was their dire religious 
 zeal.</I> 

 3. See how specious the pretence was. Now that <I>the governor was
 himself at Jerusalem they desired he would send for Paul thither,</I> 
 and try him there, which would save the prosecutors a great deal of 
 labour, and looked most reasonable, because he was charged with having 
 profaned the temple at Jerusalem, and it is usual for criminals to be 
 tried in the court where the fact was committed; but that which they 
 designed was to way-lay him as he was brought up, and to murder him 
 upon the road, supposing that he would not be brought up under so 
 strong a guard as he was sent down with, or that the officers that were 
 to bring him up might be bribed to give them an opportunity for their 
 wickedness. It is said, <I>They desired favour against Paul.</I> The 
 business of prosecutors is to demand justice against one that they 
 suppose to be a criminal, and, if he be not proved so, it is as much 
 justice to acquit him as it is to condemn him if he be. But to desire 
 favour against a prisoner, and from the judge too, who ought to be of 
 counsel for him, is a very impudent thing. The favour ought to be for 
 the prisoner, <I>in favorem vit&aelig;--to favour his life,</I> but 
 here they desire it against him. They will take it as a favour if the 
 governor will but condemn Paul, though they can prove no crime upon 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The governor's resolution that Paul shall take his trial at 
 C&aelig;sarea, where he now is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 See how he manages the prosecutors.
 
 1. He will not do them the kindness to send for him to Jerusalem; no, 
 he gave orders <I>that Paul should be kept at C&aelig;sarea.</I> It does not
 appear that he had any suspicion, much less any certain information, of 
 their bloody design to murder him by the way, as the chief priests had 
 when he sent him to C&aelig;sarea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:30"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 30</A>);

 but perhaps he was not willing so far to oblige the high priest and his
 party, or he would maintain the honour of his court at C&aelig;sarea 
 and require their attendance there, or he was not willing to be at the 
 trouble or charge of bringing Paul up; whatever was his reason for 
 refusing it, God made use of it as a means of preserving Paul out of 
 the hands of his enemies. Perhaps now they were more careful to keep 
 their conspiracy secret than they had been before, that the discovery 
 of it might not be now, as it was then, the defeat of it. But though 
 God does not, as then, bring it to light, yet he finds another way, as 
 effectual, to bring it to nought, by inclining the heart of the 
 governor, for some other reasons, not to remove Paul to Jerusalem. God 
 is not tied to one method, in working out salvation for his people. He 
 can suffer the designs against them to be concealed, and yet not suffer 
 them to be accomplished; and can make even the carnal policies of great 
 men to serve his gracious purposes. 

 2. Yet he will do them the justice to hear what they have to say
 against Paul, if they will go down to C&aelig;sarea, and appear against 
 him there: "<I>Let those among you who are able,</I> able in body and 
 purse for such a journey, or able in mind and tongue to manage the 
 prosecution--<I>let those among you</I> who are fit to be managers, 
 <I>go down with me, and accuse this man;</I> or, those who are 
 competent witnesses, who are able to prove any thing criminal upon him, 
 let them go and give in their evidence, if there be any such wickedness 
 in him as you charge upon him." Festus will not take it for granted, as 
 they desire he should, that there is wickedness in him, till it is 
 proved upon him, and he has been heard in his own defence; but, if he 
 be guilty, it lies upon them to prove him so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Paul's trial before Festus. Festus staid <I>at Jerusalem about ten 
 days,</I> and then <I>went down to C&aelig;sarea,</I> and the prosecutors,
 it is likely, in his retinue; for he said they should <I>go down with 
 him;</I> and, since they are so eager in the prosecution, he is willing 
 this cause should be first called; and, that they may hasten home, he 
 will despatch it <I>the next day.</I> Expedition in administering 
 justice is very commendable, provided more haste be not made than good 
 speed. Now here we have, 

 1. The court set, and the prisoner called to the bar. Festus <I>sat in
 the judgment-seat,</I> as he used to do when any cause was brought 
 before him that was of consequence, and he <I>commanded Paul to be 
 brought,</I> and to make his appearance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Christ, to encourage his disciples and keep up their spirits under such 
 awful trials of their courage as this was to Paul, promised them that 
 the day should come when they <I>should sit on thrones, judging the 
 tribes of Israel.</I> 

 2. The prosecutors exhibiting their charges against the prisoner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The Jews stood round about,</I> which intimates that they were many.
 <I>Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!</I> It intimates also 
 that they were unanimous, they stood by one another, and resolved to 
 hold together; and that they were intent upon the prosecution, and 
 eager in clamouring against Paul. They <I>stood round about,</I> if 
 possible, to frighten the judge into a compliance with their malicious 
 design, or, at least, to frighten the prisoner, and to put him out of 
 countenance; but in vain: he had too just and strong an assurance to be 
 frightened by them. <I>They compassed me about like bees, but they are 
 quenched as the fire of thorns,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:12">Ps. cxviii. 12</A>.

 <I>When they stood round about him, they brought many and grievous
 accusations against Paul,</I> so it should be read. They charged him 
 with high crimes and misdemeanors. The articles of impeachment were 
 many, and contained things of a very heinous nature. They represented 
 him to the court as black and odious as their wit and malice could 
 contrive; but when they had opened the cause as they thought fit, and 
 came to the evidence, there they failed: <I>they could not prove</I> 
 what they alleged against him, for it was all false, and the complaints 
 were groundless and unjust. Either the fact was not as they opened it, 
 or there was no fault in it; <I>they laid to his charge things that he 
 knew not,</I> nor they neither. It is no new thing for the most 
 excellent ones of the earth to have all manner of evil said against 
 them falsely, not only <I>in the song of the drunkards,</I> and upon 
 <I>the seat of the scornful,</I> but even <I>before the 
 judgment-seat.</I> 

 3. The prisoner's insisting upon his own vindication,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Whoever reproaches him, his own heart does not, and therefore his own 
 tongue shall not; <I>though he die, he will not remove his integrity 
 from him.</I> When it came to his turn to speak <I>for himself,</I> he 
 insisted upon his general plea, Not guilty: <I>Neither against the law 
 of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor yet against C&aelig;sar, have 
 I offended any thing at all.</I>

 (1.) He had not violated the law of the Jews, nor taught any doctrine 
 destructive of it. <I>Did he make void the law by faith? No, he 
 established the law.</I> Preaching Christ, <I>the end of the law,</I> 
 was no offence against the law. 

 (2.) He had not profaned the temple, nor put any contempt at all upon 
 the temple-service; his helping to set up the gospel temple did not at 
 all offend against that temple which was a type of it. 

 (3.) He had not offended against C&aelig;sar, nor his government. By 
 this it appears that now his cause being brought before the government, 
 to curry favour with the governor and that they might seem friends to 
 C&aelig;sar, they had charged him with some instances of disaffection 
 to the present higher powers, which obliged him to purge himself as to 
 that matter, and to protest that he was no enemy to C&aelig;sar, not so 
 much as those were who charged him with being so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Paul's appeal to the emperor, and the occasion of it. This gave the 
 cause a new turn. Whether he had before designed it, or whether it was 
 a sudden resolve upon the present provocation, does not appear; but God 
 puts it into his heart to do it, for the bringing about of that which 
 he had said to him, <I>that he must bear witness to Christ at 
 Rome,</I> for there the emperor's court was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:11"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 11</A>.

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The proposal which Festus made to Paul to go and take his trial at 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>Festus</I> was <I>willing to do the Jews a pleasure,</I> inclined to 
 gratify the prosecutors rather than the prisoner, as far as he could go 
 with safety against one that was a citizen of Rome, and therefore asked 
 him whether he would be willing to go up to Jerusalem, and clear 
 himself there, where he had been accused, and where he might have his 
 witnesses ready to vouch for him and confirm what he said. He would not 
 offer to turn him over to the high priest and the sanhedrim, as the 
 Jews would have had him; but, <I>Wilt thou go thither, and be judged of 
 these things before me?</I> The president, if he had pleased, might 
 have ordered him thither, but he would not do it without his own 
 consent, which, if he could have wheedled him to give it, would have 
 taken off the odium of it. In suffering times, the prudence of the 
 Lord's people is tried as well as their patience; being sent forth 
 therefore as sheep in the midst of wolves, they have need to be wise as 
 serpents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Paul's refusal to consent to it, and his reasons for it. He knew, if 
 he were removed to Jerusalem, notwithstanding the utmost vigilance of 
 the president, the Jews would find some means or other to be the death 
 of him; and therefore desires to be excused, and pleads, 

 (1.) That, as a citizen of Rome, it was most proper for him to be 
 tried, not only by the president, but in that which was properly his 
 court, which sat at C&aelig;sarea: <I>I stand at C&aelig;sar's 
 judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged,</I> in the city which is the 
 metropolis of the province. The court being held in C&aelig;sar's name, 
 and by his authority and commission, before one that was delegated by 
 him, it might well be said to be his judgment seat, as, with us, all 
 writs run in the name of the sovereign, in whose name all courts are 
 held. Paul's owning that he ought to be judged at C&aelig;sar's 
 judgment-seat plainly proves that Christ's ministers are not exempted 
 from the jurisdiction of the civil powers, but ought to be subject to 
 them, as far as they can with a good conscience; and, if they be guilty 
 of a real crime, to submit to their censure; if innocent, yet to submit 
 to their enquiry, and to clear themselves before them. 

 (2.) That, as a member of the Jewish nation, he had done nothing to 
 make himself obnoxious to them: <I>To the Jews have I done no wrong, as 
 thou very well knowest.</I> It very well becomes those that are 
 innocent to plead their innocency, and to insist upon it; it is a debt 
 we owe to our own good name, not only not to bear false witness against 
 ourselves, but to maintain our own integrity against those who bear 
 false witness against us. 

 (3.) That he was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let 
 that take its course, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If he be guilty of any capital crime that deserves death, he will not 
 offer either to make resistance or to make his escape, will neither 
 flee from justice nor fight with it: "I refuse not to die, but will 
 accept of the punishment of my iniquity." Not that all who have 
 committed any thing worthy of death are obliged to accuse themselves, 
 and offer themselves to justice; but, when they are accused and brought 
 to justice, they ought to submit, and to say both God and the 
 government are righteous; as it is necessary that some should be made 
 examples. But, if he be innocent, as he protests he is, "<I>If there be 
 none of these things whereof these accuse me,</I>--if the prosecution 
 be malicious and they are resolved to have my blood right or 
 wrong,--<I>no man may deliver me unto them,</I> no, not the governor 
 himself, without palpable injustice; for it is his business as much to 
 protect the innocent as to punish the guilty;" and he claims his 
 protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His appealing to court. Since he is continually in danger of the 
 Jews, and one attempt made after another to get him into their hands, 
 <I>whose tender mercies were cruel,</I> he flies to the <I>dernier 
 resort--the last refuge</I> of oppressed innocency, and takes sanctuary 
 there, since he cannot have justice done him in any other way: "<I>I 
 appeal unto C&aelig;sar.</I> Rather than be delivered to the Jews" 
 (which Festus seems inclined to consent to) "let me be delivered to 
 Nero." When David had divers times narrowly escaped the rage of Saul, 
 and concluded he was such a restless enemy that he should <I>one day 
 perish by his hands,</I> he came to this resolution, being in a manner 
 compelled to it, <I>There is nothing better for me than to take shelter 
 in the land of the Philistines,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:1">1 Sam. xxvii. 1</A>.

 So Paul here. But it is a hard case that a son of Abraham must be
 forced to appeal to a Philistine, to a Nero, from those who call 
 themselves the seed of Abraham, and shall be safer in Gath or Rome than 
 in Jerusalem. <I>How is the faithful city become a harlot!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The judgment given upon the whole matter. Paul is neither released 
 nor condemned. His enemies hoped the cause would be ended in his death; 
 his friends hoped it would be ended in his deliverance; but it proved 
 neither so nor so, they are both disappointed, the thing is left as it 
 was. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence sometimes 
 takes, not bringing things to an issue so soon as we expect, by which 
 we are often made ashamed both of our hopes and of our fears, and are 
 kept still waiting on God. The cause had before been adjourned to 
 another time, now to another place, to another court, that Paul's 
 <I>tribulation might work patience.</I> 

 1. The president takes advice upon the matter: <I>He conferred with the
 council</I>--<B><I>meta tou symbouliou,</I></B> not with the council of 
 the Jews (that is called <B><I>synedrion</I></B>), but with his own 
 counsellors, who were always ready to assist the governor with their 
 advice. <I>In multitude of counsellors there is safety;</I> and judges 
 should consult both with themselves and others before they pass 
 sentence. 

 2. He determines to send him to Rome. Some think Paul meant not an
 appeal to C&aelig;sar's person, but only to his court, the sentence of 
 which he would abide by, rather than be remitted to the Jew's council, 
 and that Festus might have chosen whether he would have sent him to 
 Rome, or, at least, whether he would have joined issue with him upon 
 the appeal. But it should seem, by what Agrippa said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:32"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 32</A>),

 that <I>he might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed to
 C&aelig;sar</I>--that, by the course of the Roman law, a Roman citizen 
 might appeal at any time to a superior court, even to the supreme, as 
 causes with us are removed by <I>certiorari,</I> and criminals by 
 <I>habeas corpus,</I> and as appeals are often made to the house of 
 peers. Festus, therefore, either of choice or of course, comes to this 
 resolution: <I>Hast thou appealed unto C&aelig;sar? Unto C&aelig;sar 
 thou shalt go.</I> He found there was something very extraordinary in 
 the case, which he was therefore afraid of giving judgment upon, either 
 one way or other, and the knowledge of which he thought would be an 
 entertainment to the emperor, and therefore he transmitted it to his 
 cognizance. In our judgment before God those that by justifying 
 themselves appeal to the law, to the law they shall go, and it will 
 condemn them; but those that by repentance and faith appeal to the 
 gospel, to the gospel they shall go, and it will save them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
 C&aelig;sarea to salute Festus.
 &nbsp; 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared
 Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left
 in bonds by Felix:
 &nbsp; 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and
 the elders of the Jews informed <I>me,</I> desiring <I>to have</I> judgment
 against him.
 &nbsp; 16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
 deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the
 accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself
 concerning the crime laid against him.
 &nbsp; 17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on
 the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to
 be brought forth.
 &nbsp; 18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
 accusation of such things as I supposed:
 &nbsp; 19 But had certain questions against him of their own
 superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul
 affirmed to be alive.
 &nbsp; 20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked
 <I>him</I> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
 these matters.
 &nbsp; 21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing
 of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to
 C&aelig;sar.
 &nbsp; 22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man
 myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
 &nbsp; 23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
 great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the
 chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus'
 commandment Paul was brought forth.
 &nbsp; 24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
 present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of
 the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and <I>also</I> here,
 crying that he ought not to live any longer.
 &nbsp; 25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of
 death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have
 determined to send him.
 &nbsp; 26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord.
 Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially
 before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might
 have somewhat to write.
 &nbsp; 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and
 not withal to signify the crimes <I>laid</I> against him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the preparation that was made for another hearing of Paul 
 before King Agrippa, not in order to his giving judgment upon him, but 
 in order to his giving advice concerning him, or rather only to gratify 
 his curiosity. Christ had said, concerning his followers, <I>that they 
 should be brought before governors and kings.</I> In the former part of 
 this chapter Paul was brought before Festus the governor, here before 
 Agrippa the king, for a testimony to both. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The kind and friendly visit which king Agrippa made to Festus, now 
 upon his coming into the government in that province 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>After certain days, king Agrippa came to C&aelig;sarea.</I> Here is 
 royal visit. Kings usually think it enough to send their ambassadors
 to congratulate their friends, but here was a king that came himself, 
 that made the majesty of a prince yield to the satisfaction of a 
 friend; for personal converse is the most pleasant among friends. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who the visitants were. 

 (1.) King Agrippa, the son of that Herod (surnamed <I>Agrippa</I>) who
 killed James the apostle, and was himself eaten of worms, and great 
 grandson of Herod the Great, under whom Christ was born. Josephus calls 
 this <I>Agrippa the younger;</I> Claudius the emperor made him king of 
 Chalcis, and <I>tetrarch of Trachonitis and Abylene,</I> mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:1">Luke iii. 1</A>.

 The Jewish writers speak of him, and (as Dr. Lightfoot tells us) among
 other things relate this story of him, "That reading the law publicly, 
 in the latter end of the year of release, as was enjoined, the king, 
 when he came to those words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt not set a stranger king over thee, who is not of thy 
 brethren,</I> the tears ran down his cheeks, for he was not of the seed 
 of Israel, which the congregation observing, cried out, Be of good 
 comfort, king Agrippa, thou art our brother; for he was of their 
 religion, though not of their blood." 

 (2.) Bernice came with him. She was his own sister, now a widow, the 
 widow of his uncle Herod, king of Chalcis, after whose death she lived 
 with this brother of hers, who was suspected to be too familiar with 
 her, and, after she was a second time married to Polemon king of 
 Cilicia, she got to be divorced from him, and returned to her brother 
 king Agrippa. Juvenal (<I>Sat.</I> 6) speaks of a diamond ring which 
 Agrippa gave to Bernice, his incestuous sister:--</P>

 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And both Tacitus and Suetonius speak of a criminal intimacy afterwards 
 between her and Titus Vespasian. Drusilla, the wife of Felix, was 
 another sister. Such lewd people were the great people generally in 
 those times! <I>Say not that the former days were better.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the design of this visit was: they <I>came to salute 
 Festus,</I> to give him joy of his new promotion, and to wish him joy 
 in it; they came to compliment him upon his accession to the 
 government, and to keep up a good correspondence with him, that 
 Agrippa, who had the government of Galilee, might act in concert with 
 Festus, who had the government of Judea; but it is probable they came 
 as much to divert themselves as to show respect to him, and to share in 
 the entertainments of his court, and to show their fine clothes, which 
 would do vain people no good if they did not go abroad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The account which Festus gave to king Agrippa of Paul and his case, 
 which he gave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To entertain him, and give him some diversion. It was a very 
 remarkable story, and worth any man's hearing, not only as it was 
 surprising and entertaining, but, if it were truly and fully told, very 
 instructive and edifying; and it would be particularly acceptable to 
 Agrippa, not only because he was a judge, and there were some points of 
 law and practice in it well worth his notice, but much more as he was a 
 Jew, and there were some points of religion in it much more deserving 
 his cognizance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To have his advice. <I>Festus</I> was but newly come to be a judge, 
 at least to be a judge in these parts, and therefore was diffident of 
 himself and of his own ability, and willing to have the counsel of 
 those that were older and more experienced, especially in a matter that 
 had so much difficulty in it as Paul's case seemed to have, and 
 therefore he declared it to the king. Let us now see the particular 
 account he gives to king Agrippa concerning Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:14-21"><I>v.</I> 14-21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He found him a prisoner when he came into the government of this 
 province; and therefore could not of his own knowledge give an account 
 of his cause from the beginning: <I>There is a certain man left in 
 bonds by Felix;</I> and therefore, if there were any thing amiss in the 
 first taking of him into custody, Festus is not to answer for that, for 
 he found him in bonds. When <I>Felix, to do the Jews a pleasure, left 
 Paul bound,</I> though he knew him to be innocent, he knew not what he 
 did, knew not but he might fall into worse hands than he did fall into, 
 though they were none of the best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the Jewish sanhedrim were extremely set against him: "The 
 <I>chief priests and the elders informed me</I> against him as a 
 dangerous man, and not fit to live, and desired he might therefore be 
 condemned to die." These being great pretenders to religion, and 
 therefore to be supposed men of honour and honesty, Festus thinks he 
 ought to give credit to them; but Agrippa knows them better than he 
 does, and therefore Festus desires his advice in this matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he had insisted upon the Roman law in favour of the prisoner, 
 and would not condemn him unheard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>It is not the manner of the Romans,</I> who herein govern 
 themselves by the law of nature and the fundamental rules of justice, 
 to <I>deliver any man to die,</I> to grant him to destruction" (so the 
 word is), "to gratify his enemies with his destruction, <I>before the 
 accused has the accusers face to face,</I> to confront their testimony, 
 and have both licence and time given him to answer for himself." He 
 seems to upbraid them as if they reflected upon the Romans and their 
 government in asking such a thing, or expecting that they would condemn 
 a man without trying him: "No," says he, "I would have you to know, 
 whatever you may allow of among yourselves, the Romans allow not of 
 such a piece of injustice among them." <I>Audi et alteram partem--Hear 
 the other side,</I> had become a proverb among them. This rule we ought 
 to be governed by in our private censures in common conversation; we 
 must not give men bad characters, nor condemn their words and actions, 
 till we have heard what is to be said in their vindication. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:51">John vii. 51</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That he had brought him upon his trial, according to the duty of 
 his place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 That he had been expeditious in it, and the prosecutors had not reason 
 to complain of his being dilatory, for <I>as soon as ever they had 
 come</I> (and we are sure they lost no time) <I>without any delay, on 
 the morrow,</I> he had brought on the cause. He had likewise tried him
 in the most solemn manner: He <I>sat on the judgment-seat,</I> as they 
 used to do in weightier causes, while those that were of small moment 
 they judged <I>de plano--upon even ground.</I> He called a great court 
 on purpose for the trial of Paul, that the sentence might be 
 definitive, and the cause ended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That he was extremely <I>disappointed</I> in the charge they 
 brought against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 <I>When the accusers stood up against him,</I> and opened their 
 indictment, <I>they brought no accusations of such things as I 
 supposed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He supposed by the eagerness of their prosecution, and their 
 urging it thus upon the Roman governors one after another, 
 <I>First,</I> That they had something to accuse him of that was 
 dangerous either to private property or the public peace,--that they
 would undertake to prove him a robber, or a murderer, or a rebel 
 against the Roman power,--that he had been in arms to head a
 sedition,--that if he were not that Egyptian who lately made an uproar,
 and commanded a party of cut-throats, as the chief captain supposed him 
 to be, yet he was one of the same kidney. Such were the outcries 
 against the primitive Christians, so loud, so fierce, that the 
 standers-by, who judged of them by those outcries, could not but 
 conclude them the worst of men; and to represent them so was the design 
 of that clamour, as it was against our Saviour. <I>Secondly,</I> That 
 they had something to accuse him of that was cognizable in the Roman 
 courts, and which the governor was properly the judge of, as Gallio 
 expected 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:14"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 14</A>);

 otherwise it was absurd and ridiculous to trouble him with it, and
 really an affront to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But to his great surprise he finds the matter is neither so nor 
 so; they had <I>certain questions against him,</I> instead of proofs 
 and evidences against him. The worst they had to say against him was 
 disputable whether it was a crime or no-moot-points, that would bear an 
 endless debate, but had no tendency to fasten any guilt upon him, 
 questions fitter for the schools than for the judgment-seat. And they 
 were questions <I>of their own superstition,</I> so he calls their 
 religion; or, rather, so he calls that part of their religion which 
 Paul was charged with doing damage to. The Romans protected their 
 religion according to their law, but not their superstition, nor the 
 tradition of their elders. But the great question, it seems, was 
 <I>concerning one Jesus that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be 
 alive.</I> Some think the superstition he speaks of was the Christian 
 religion, which Paul preached, and that he had the same notion of it 
 that the Athenians had, that it was the introducing of a new demon, 
 even Jesus. See how slightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of his 
 death and resurrection, and of the great controversy between the Jews 
 and the Christians whether he were the Messiah promised or no, and the 
 great proof of his being the Messiah, his resurrection from the dead, 
 as if it were no more than this, There was one Jesus that was dead, and 
 Paul affirmed he was alive. In many causes issue is joined upon this 
 question, whether such a person that has been long absent be living or 
 dead, and proofs are brought on both sides; and Festus will have it 
 thought that this is a matter of no more moment. Whereas this Jesus, 
 whom he prides himself in being thus ignorant of, as if he were below 
 his notice, is he that <I>was dead, and is alive, and lives for 
 evermore, and has the keys of hell and of death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>.

 What Paul affirmed concerning Jesus, that he is alive, is a matter of 
 such vast importance that if it be not true we are all undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) That therefore he had proposed to Paul that the cause might be 
 adjourned to the Jewish courts, as best able to take cognizance of an 
 affair of this nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Because I doubted of such manner of questions,</I> and thought 
 myself unfit to judge of things I did not understand, <I>I asked him 
 whether he would go to Jerusalem,</I> appear before the great 
 sanhedrim, <I>and there be judged of these matters.</I>" He would not 
 force him to it, but would be glad if Paul would consent to it, that he 
 might not have his conscience burdened with a cause of this nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) That Paul had chosen rather to remove his cause to Rome than to 
 Jerusalem, as expecting fairer play from the emperor than from the 
 priests: "He <I>appealed to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 having no other way to stop proceedings here in this inferior court; 
 and therefore I <I>commanded him to be kept</I> a close prisoner 
 <I>till I might send him to C&aelig;sar,</I> for I did not see cause to 
 refuse his appeal, but rather was pleased with it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The bringing of him before Agrippa, that he might have the hearing 
 of his cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The king desired it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "I thank you for your account of him, but <I>I would also hear the man 
 myself.</I>" Agrippa knows more of this matter, of the cause and of the 
 person, than Festus does; he has heard of Paul, and knows of what vast 
 concern this question is, which Festus makes such a jest of, whether 
 Jesus be alive or no. And nothing would oblige him more than to hear 
 Paul. Many great men think it below them to take cognizance of the 
 matters of religion, except they can hear them like themselves in the 
 judgment-seat. Agrippa would not for all the world have gone to a 
 meeting to hear Paul preach, any more than Herod to hear Jesus; and yet 
 they are both glad to have them brought before them, only to satisfy 
 their curiosity. Perhaps Agrippa desired to hear him himself, that he 
 might be in a capacity to do him a kindness, and yet did him none, only 
 put some credit upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Festus granted it: <I>To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</I> There was a 
 good providence in this, for the encouragement of Paul, who seemed 
 buried alive in his imprisonment, and deprived of all opportunities of 
 doing good. We know not of any of his epistles that bore date from his 
 prison at C&aelig;sarea. What opportunity he had of doing good to his
 friends that visited him, and perhaps to a little congregation of them 
 that visited him every Lord's-day, was but a low and narrow sphere of 
 usefulness, so that he seemed to be thrown by as a <I>despised broken 
 vessel, in which there was no pleasure;</I> but this gives him an 
 opportunity of preaching Christ to a great congregation, and (which is 
 more) to a congregation of great ones. Felix heard him in private 
 concerning the faith of Christ. But Agrippa and Festus agree he shall 
 be heard in public. And we have reason to think that his sermon in the 
 next chapter, though it might not be so instrumental as some other of 
 his sermons for the conversion of souls, redounded as much to the 
 honour of Christ and Christianity as any sermon he ever preached in his 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Great preparation was made for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The next day</I> there was a great appearance <I>in the place of 
 hearing,</I> Paul and his cause being much talked of, and the more for 
 their being much talked against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Agrippa and Bernice took this opportunity to show themselves in 
 state, and to make a figure, and perhaps for that end desired the 
 occasion, that they might see and be seen; for <I>they came with great 
 pomp,</I> richly dressed, with gold and pearls, and costly array; with 
 a great retinue of footmen in rich liveries, which made a splendid 
 show, and dazzled the eyes of the gazing crowd. They came <B><I>meta 
 polles phantasias</I></B>--<I>with great fancy,</I> so the word is.
 Note, Great pomp is but great fancy. It neither adds any read 
 excellency, nor gains any real respect, but feeds a vain humour, which 
 wise men would rather mortify than gratify. It is but a show, a dream, 
 a fantastical thing (so the word signifies), superficial, and <I>it 
 passeth away.</I> And the pomp of this appearance would put one for 
 ever out of conceit with pomp, when the pomp which Agrippa and Bernice 
 appeared in was, 

 [1.] Stained by their lewd characters, and all the beauty of it 
 sullied, and all virtuous people that knew them could not but contemn 
 them in the midst of all this pomp as vile persons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 [2.] Outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What
 was the honour of their fine clothes, compared with that of his wisdom, 
 and grace, and holiness, his courage and constancy in suffering for 
 Christ! His bonds in so good a cause were more glorious than their
 chains of gold, and his guards than their equipage. Who would be fond 
 of worldly pomp that here sees so bad a woman loaded with it and so 
 good a man loaded with the reverse of it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The chief captains and principal men of the city took this 
 opportunity to pay their respects to Festus and to his guests. It 
 answered the end of a ball at court, it brought the fine folks together 
 in their fine clothes, and served for an entertainment. It is probable 
 that Festus sent Paul notice of it overnight, to be ready for a hearing 
 the next morning before Agrippa. And such confidence had Paul in the 
 promise of Christ, that it should be <I>given him in that same hour 
 what he should speak,</I> that he complained not of the short warning, 
 nor was put into confusion by it. I am apt to think that those who were 
 to appear in pomp perplexed themselves more with care about their 
 clothes than Paul, who was to appear as a prisoner, did with care about 
 his cause; for he knew whom he had believed, and who stood by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The speech with which Festus introduced the cause, when the court, 
 or rather the audience, was set, which is much to the same purport with 
 the account he had just now given to Agrippa. 

 1. He addressed himself respectfully to the company: "<I>King Agrippa,
 and all men who are here present with us.</I>" He speaks <I>to all the 
 men</I>--<B><I>pantes andres,</I></B> as if he intended a tacit 
 reflection upon Bernice, a woman, for appearing in a meeting of this 
 nature; he does not refer any thing to her judgment nor desire her 
 counsel; but, "<I>All you that are present that are men</I> (so the 
 words are placed), I desire you to take cognizance of this matter." The 
 word used is that which signifies men in distinction from women; what 
 had Bernice to do here? 

 2. He represents the prisoner as one that the Jews had a very great
 spite against; not only the rulers, but <I>the multitude of them, both 
 at Jerusalem and here at C&aelig;sarea,</I> cry out <I>that he ought 
 not to live any longer,</I> for they think he has lived too long 
 already, and if he live any longer it will be to do more mischief. They 
 could not charge him with any capital crime, but they wanted to have 
 him out of the way. 

 3. He confesses the prisoner's innocency; and it was much for the
 honour of Paul and his bonds that he had such a public acknowledgement 
 as this from the mouth of his judge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death.</I> Upon a 
 full hearing of the case, it appeared there was no evidence at all to 
 support the indictment: and therefore, though he was inclinable enough 
 to favour the prosecutors, yet his own conscience brought in Paul 
 <I>not guilty.</I> And why did he not discharge him then, for he stood 
 upon his deliverance? Why, truly, because he was so much clamoured 
 against, and he feared the clamour would turn upon himself if he should 
 release him. It is a pity but every man that has a conscience should 
 have courage to act according to it. Or perhaps because there was so 
 much smoke that he concluded there could not but be some fire, which 
 would appear at last, and he would detain him a prisoner in expectation 
 of it. 

 4. He acquaints them with the present state of the case, that the
 prisoner had appealed to the emperor himself (where by he put ann 
 honour upon his own cause, as knowing it not unworthy the cognizance of 
 the greatest of men), and that he had admitted his appeal: <I>I have 
 determined to send him.</I> And thus the cause now stood. 

 5. He desires their assistance in examining the matter calmly and
 impartially, now that there was no danger of their being interrupted, 
 as he had been with the noisiness and outrage of the prosecutors-that
 he might have at least such an insight into the cause as was necessary 
 to his stating it to the emperor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 (1.) He thought it <I>unreasonable to send a prisoner,</I> especially
 so far as Rome, <I>and not withal to signify the crimes laid against 
 him,</I> that the matter might be prepared as much as possible, and put 
 in a readiness for the emperor's determination; for he is supposed to 
 be a man of great business, and therefore every affair must be laid 
 before him in as little compass as possible. 

 (2.) He could not as yet write <I>any thing certain</I> concerning 
 Paul; so confused were the informations that were given in against him, 
 and so inconsistent, that Festus could make nothing at all of them. He 
 therefore desired Paul might thus be publicly examined, that he might 
 be advised by them what to write. See what a great deal of trouble and 
 vexation those were put to, and to what delay, nay, and to what hazard, 
 in the administration of public justice, who live at such a distance 
 from Rome, and yet were subject to the emperor of Rome. The same was
 this nation of ours put to (which is about as far distant from Rome the 
 other way) when it was in ecclesiastical affairs subject to the pope of 
 Rome, and appeals were upon all occasions made to his court; and the 
 same mischiefs, and a thousand worse, would those bring upon us who 
 would again entangle us in that yoke of bondage.</P>
