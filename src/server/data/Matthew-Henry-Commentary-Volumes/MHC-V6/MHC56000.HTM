 Epistle of Paul to Titus is much of the same nature with those to 
 Timothy; both were converts of Paul, and his companions in labours and 
 sufferings; both were in the office of evangelists, whose work was to 
 water the churches planted by the apostles, and to set in order the 
 things that were wanting in them: they were vice-apostles, as it were, 
 <I>working the work of the Lord, as they did,</I> and mostly under 
 their direction, though not despotic and arbitrary, but with the 
 concurring exercise of their own prudence and judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:10,12">1 Cor. xvi. 10, 12</A>.

 We read much of this Titus, his titles, character, and active
 usefulness, in many places--he was a Greek,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:3">Gal. ii. 3</A>.

 Paul called him <I>his son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:4">Tit. i. 4</A>),
 
 <I>his brother</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:13">2 Cor. ii. 13</A>),
 
 <I>his partner and fellow-helper</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:23">2 Cor. viii. 23</A>),

 <I>one that walked in the same spirit and in the same steps with
 himself.</I> He went up with the apostles to the church at Jerusalem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1">Gal. ii. 1</A>),

 was much conversant at Corinth, for which church he had <I>an earnest
 care,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:16">2 Cor. viii. 16</A>.
 
 Paul's second epistle to them, and probably his first also, was sent by
 his hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:16-18,23,9:2-4,12:18">2 Cor. viii. 16-18, 23; ix. 2-4; xii. 18</A>.

 He was with the apostle at Rome, and thence went into Dalmatia 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2 Tim. iv. 10</A>),

 after which no more occurs of him in the scriptures. So that by them he 
 appears not to have been a fixed bishop; if such he were, and in those 
 times, the church of Corinth, where he most laboured, had the best 
 title to him. In Crete (now called <I>Candia,</I> formerly 
 <I>Hecatompolis,</I> from the hundred cities that were in it), a large 
 island at the mouth of the &AElig;gean Sea, the gospel had got some 
 footing; and here were Paul and Titus in one of their travels, 
 cultivating this plantation; but the apostle of the Gentiles, having on 
 him the care of all the churches, could not himself tarry long at this 
 place. He therefore left Titus some time there, to carry on the work 
 which had been begun, wherein, probably, meeting with more difficulty 
 than ordinary, Paul wrote this epistle to him; and yet perhaps not so 
 much for his own sake as for the people's, that the endeavours of 
 Titus, strengthened with apostolic advice and authority, might be more 
 significant and effectual among them. He was to see all the cities 
 furnished with good pastors, to reject and keep out the unmeet and 
 unworthy, to teach sound doctrine, and instruct all sorts in their 
 duties, to set forth the free grace of God in man's salvation by 
 Christ, and withal to show the necessity of maintaining good works by 
 those who have believed in God and hope for eternal life from him.</P>
