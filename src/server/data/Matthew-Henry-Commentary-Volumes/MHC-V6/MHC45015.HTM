 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, in this chapter, continues the discourse of the former, 
 concerning mutual forbearance in indifferent things; and so draws 
 towards a conclusion of the epistle. Where such differences of 
 apprehension, and consequently distances of affection, are among 
 Christians, there is need of precept upon precept, line upon line, to 
 allay the heat, and to beget a better temper. The apostle, being 
 desirous to drive the nail home, as a nail in a sure place, follows his 
 blow, unwilling to leave the subject till he has some hopes of 
 prevailing, to which end he orders the cause before them and fills his 
 mouth with the most pressing arguments. We may observe, in this 
 chapter, 

 I. His precepts to them. 
 
 II. His prayers for them. 

 III. His apology for writing to them. 

 IV. His account of himself and his own affairs. 

 V. His declaration of his purpose to come and see them. 

 VI. His desire of a share in their prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
 weak, and not to please ourselves.
 &nbsp; 2  Let every one of us please <I>his</I> neighbour for <I>his</I> good to
 edification.
 &nbsp; 3  For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,
 The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here lays down two precepts, with reasons to enforce them, 
 showing the duty of the strong Christian to consider and condescend to 
 the weakest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must <I>bear the infirmities of the weak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We all have our infirmities; but the weak are more subject to them than 
 others--the weak in knowledge or grace, the bruised reed and the 
 smoking flax. We must consider these; not trample upon them, but 
 encourage them, and bear with their infirmities. If through weakness 
 they judge and censure us, and speak evil of us, we must bear with 
 them, pity them, and not have our affections alienated from them. Alas! 
 it is their weakness, they cannot help it. Thus Christ bore with his 
 weak disciples, and apologised for them. But there is more in it; we 
 must also bear their infirmities by sympathizing with them, concerning 
 ourselves for them, ministering strength to them, as there is occasion. 
 This is bearing one another's burdens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must not please ourselves, but our neighbour, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 We must deny our own humour, in consideration of our brethren's 
 weakness and infirmity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christians must not please themselves. We must not make it our 
 business to gratify all the little appetites and desires of our own 
 heart; it is good for us to cross ourselves sometimes, and then we 
 shall the better bear others crossing of us. We shall be spoiled (as 
 Adonijah was) if we be always humoured. The first lesson we have to 
 learn is to deny ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:24">Matt. xvi. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christians must please their brethren. The design of Christianity is 
 to soften and meeken the spirit, to teach us the art of obliging and 
 true complaisance; not to be servants to the lust of any, but to the 
 necessities and infirmities of our brethren--to comply with all that we
 have to do with as fare as we can with a good conscience. Christians 
 should study to be pleasing. As we must not please ourselves in the use 
 of our Christian liberty (which was allowed us, not for our own
 pleasure, but for the glory of God and the profit and edification of 
 others), so we must please our neighbour. How amiable and comfortable a 
 society would the church of Christ be if Christians would study to 
 please one another, as now we see them commonly industrious to cross, 
 and thwart, and contradict one another!--<I>Please his neighbour,</I>
 not in every thing, it is not an unlimited rule; but <I>for his 
 good,</I> especially for the good of his soul: not please him by 
 serving his wicked wills, and humouring him in a sinful way, or 
 consenting to his enticements, or suffering sin upon him; this is a 
 base way of pleasing our neighbour to the ruin of his soul: if we thus 
 please men, we are not the servants of Christ; but please him for his 
 good; not for our own secular good, or to make a prey of him, but for 
 his spiritual good.--<I>To edification,</I> that is, not only for his
 profit, but for the profit of others, to edify the body of Christ, by 
 studying to oblige one another. The closer the stones lie, and the 
 better they are squared to fit one another, the stronger is the 
 building. Now observe the reason why Christians must please one 
 another: <I>For even Christ pleased not himself.</I> The self-denial of 
 our Lord Jesus is the best argument against the selfishness of 
 Christians. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Christ pleased not himself. He did not consult his own 
 worldly credit, ease, safety, nor pleasure; he had not where to lay his 
 head, lived upon alms, would not be made a king, detested no proposal 
 with greater abhorrence than that, <I>Master, spare thyself,</I> did 
 not <I>seek his own will</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:30">John v. 30</A>),

 washed his disciples' feet, endured the contradiction of sinners
 against himself, troubled himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:33">John xi. 33</A>),

 did not consult his own honour, and, in a word, emptied himself, and
 made himself of no reputation: and all this for our sakes, to bring in 
 a righteousness for us, and to set us an example. His whole life was a 
 self-denying self-displeasing life. He bore the <I>infirmities of the 
 weak,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:15">Heb. iv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That herein the scripture was fulfilled: <I>As it is written, The
 reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.</I> This is quoted
 out of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">Ps. lxix. 9</A>,

 the former part of which verse is applied to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:17">John ii. 17</A>),

 <I>The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up;</I> and the latter part
 here; for David was a type of Christ, and his sufferings of Christ's 
 sufferings. It is quoted to show that Christ was so far from pleasing 
 himself that he did in the highest degree displease himself. Not as if
 his undertaking, considered on the whole, were a task and grievance to 
 him, for he was very willing to it and very cheerful in it; but in his 
 humiliation the content and satisfaction of natural inclination were 
 altogether crossed and denied. He preferred our benefit before his own 
 ease and pleasure. This the apostle chooses to express in scripture 
 language; for how can the things of the Spirit of God be better spoken 
 of than in the Spirit's own words? And this scripture he alleges, 
 <I>The reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.</I> 

 [1.] The shame of those reproaches, which Christ underwent. Whatever 
 dishonour was done to God was a trouble to the Lord Jesus. He was 
 grieved for the hardness of people's hearts, beheld a sinful place with 
 sorrow and tears. When the saints were persecuted, Christ so far 
 displeased himself as to take what was done to them as done against 
 himself: <I>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</I> Christ also did 
 himself endure the greatest indignities; there was much of reproach in 
 his sufferings. 

 [2.] The sin of those reproaches, for which Christ undertook to 
 satisfy; so many understand it. Every sin is a kind of reproach to God, 
 especially presumptuous sins; now the guilt of these fell upon Christ, 
 when he was made sin, that is, a sacrifice, a sin-offering for us. When 
 the Lord laid upon him the iniquities of us all, and he bore our sins 
 in his own body upon the tree, they fell upon him as upon our surety. 
 <I>Upon me be the curse.</I> This was the greatest piece of 
 self-displacency that could be: considering his infinite spotless 
 purity and holiness, the infinite love of the Father to him, and his 
 eternal concern for his Father's glory, nothing could be more contrary 
 to him, nor more against him, than to be made sin and a curse for us, 
 and to have the reproaches of God fall upon him, especially considering 
 for whom he thus displeased himself, for strangers, enemies, and 
 traitors, the <I>just for the unjust,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 This seems to come in as a reason why we should bear the infirmities of
 the weak. We must not please ourselves, for Christ pleased not himself; 
 we must bear the infirmities of the weak, for Christ bore the 
 reproaches of those that reproached God. He bore the guilt of sin and 
 the curse for it; we are only called to bear a little of the trouble of 
 it. He bore the presumptuous sins of the wicked; we are called only to
 bear the infirmities of the weak.--<I>Even Christ;</I> <B><I>kai gar ho 
 Christos.</I></B> Even he who was infinitely happy in the enjoyment of 
 himself, who needed not us nor our services,--even he who thought it no 
 robbery to be equal with God, who had reason enough to pleas himself, 
 and no reason to be concerned, much less to be crossed, for us,--even 
 he pleased not himself, even he bore our sins. And should not we be 
 humble, and self-denying, and ready to consider one another, who are 
 members one of another?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That therefore we must go and do likewise: <I>For whatsoever 
 things were written aforetime were written for our learning.</I> 

 [1.] That which is written of Christ, concerning his self-denial and 
 sufferings, is <I>written for our learning;</I> he hath left us an 
 example. If Christ denied himself, surely we should deny ourselves, 
 from a principle of ingenuousness and of gratitude, and especially of 
 conformity to his image. The example of Christ, in what he did and 
 said, is recorded for our imitation. 

 [2.] That which is written in the scriptures of the Old Testament in 
 the general is written for our learning. What David had said in his own 
 person Paul had just now applied to Christ. Now lest this should look 
 like a straining of the scripture, he gives us this excellent rule in 
 general, that all the scriptures of the Old Testament (much more those 
 of the New) were written for our learning, and are not to be looked 
 upon as of private interpretation. What happened to the Old-Testament 
 saint happened to them for ensample; and the scriptures of the Old 
 Testament have many fulfillings. The scriptures are left for a standing 
 rule to us: they are <I>written,</I> that they might remain for our use 
 and benefit. <I>First,</I> For our learning. There are many things to
 be learned out of the scriptures; and that is the best learning which 
 is drawn from these fountains. Those are the most learned that are most 
 mighty in the scriptures. We must therefore labour, not only to 
 understand the literal meaning of the scripture, but to learn out of it 
 that which will do us good; and we have need of help therefore not only 
 to roll away the stone, but to draw out the water, for in many places 
 the well is deep. Practical observations are more necessary than 
 critical expositions. <I>Secondly, That we through patience and comfort 
 of the scriptures might have hope.</I> That hope which hath eternal 
 life for its object is here proposed as the end of scripture-learning. 
 The scripture was written that we might know what to hope for from God, 
 and upon what grounds, and in what way. This should recommend the 
 scripture to us that it is a special friend to Christian hope. Now the 
 way of attaining this hope is <I>through patience and comfort of the 
 scripture.</I> Patience and comfort suppose trouble and sorrow; such is 
 the lot of the saints in this world; and, were it not so, we should 
 have no occasion for patience and comfort. But both these befriend that 
 hope which is the life of our souls. Patience works experience, and 
 experience hope, which maketh not ashamed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3-5"><I>ch.</I> v. 3-5</A>.

 The more patience we exercise under troubles the more hopefully we may
 look through our troubles; nothing more destructive to hope than 
 impatience. And the <I>comfort of the scriptures,</I> that comfort 
 which springs from the word of God (that is the surest and sweetest 
 comfort) is likewise a great stay to hope, as it is an earnest in hand 
 of the good hoped for. The Spirit, as a comforter, is the earnest of
 our inheritance.</P>

 &nbsp; 6  That ye may with one mind <I>and</I> one mouth glorify God, even
 the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having delivered two exhortations, before he proceeds to 
 more, intermixes here a prayer for the success of what he had said. 
 Faithful ministers water their preaching with their prayers, because, 
 whoever sows the seed, it is God that gives the increase. We can but 
 speak to the ear; it is God's prerogative to speak to the heart.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The title he gives to God: <I>The God of patience and 
 consolation,</I> who is both the author and the foundation of all the 
 patience and consolation of the saints, from whom it springs and on 
 whom it is built. He gives the grace of patience; he confirms and keeps 
 it up as the God of consolation; for the comforts of the Holy Ghost 
 help to support believers, and to bear them up with courage and 
 cheerfulness under all their afflictions. When he comes to beg the 
 pouring out of the spirit of love and unity he addresses himself to God 
 as the God of patience and consolation; that is, 

 1. As a God that bears with us and comforts us, is not extreme to mark
 what we do amiss, but is ready to comfort those that are cast down--to 
 teach us so to testify our love to our brethren, and by these means to 
 preserve and maintain unity, by being patient one with another and 
 comfortable one to another. Or, 

 2. As a God that gives us patience and comfort. He had spoken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 of patience and comfort of the scriptures; but here he looks up to God
 as the God of patience and consolation: it comes through the scripture
 as the conduit-pipe, but from God as the fountain-head. The more 
 patience and comfort we receive from God, the better disposed we are to 
 love one another. Nothing breaks the peace more than an impatient, and 
 peevish, and fretful melancholy temper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The mercy he begs of God: <I>Grant you to be like-minded one
 towards another, according to Christ Jesus.</I> 

 1. The foundation of Christian love and peace is laid in
 like-mindedness, a consent in judgment as far as you have attained, or 
 at least a concord and agreement in affection. <B><I>To auto 
 phronein</I></B>--<I>to mind the same thing,</I> all occasions of 
 difference removed, and all quarrels laid aside. 

 2. This like-mindedness must be <I>according to Christ Jesus,</I>
 according to the precept of Christ, the royal law of love, according to 
 the pattern and example of Christ, which he had propounded to them for 
 their imitation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Or, "Let Christ Jesus be the centre of your unity. Agree in the truth, 
 not in any error." It was a cursed concord and harmony of those who 
 were of one mind to give their power and strength to the beast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:13">Rev. xvii. 13</A>);

 this was not a like-mindedness according to Christ, but against Christ;
 like the Babel-builders, who were one in their rebellion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:6">Gen. xi. 6</A>.
 
 The method of our prayer must be first for truth, and then for peace;
 for such is the method of the wisdom that is from above: <I>it is first 
 pure, then peaceable.</I> This is to be like-minded according to Christ 
 Jesus. 

 3. Like-mindedness among Christians, according to Christ Jesus, is the
 gift of God; and a precious gift it is, for which we must earnestly 
 seek unto him. He is the <I>Father of spirits,</I> and fashions the 
 hearts of men alike

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:15">Ps. xxxiii. 15</A>),

 opens the understanding, softens the heart, sweetens the affections, 
 and gives the grace of love, and the Spirit as a Spirit of love, to 
 those that ask him. We are taught to pray that the will of God may be 
 done on earth as it is done in heaven--now there it is done 
 unanimously, among the angels, who are one in their praises and 
 services; and our desire must be that the saints on earth may be so 
 too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The end of his desire: that God may be glorified, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This is his plea with God in prayer, and is likewise an argument with 
 them to seek it. We should have the glory of God in our eye in every 
 prayer; therefore our first petition, as the foundation of all the 
 rest, must be, <I>Hallowed be thy name.</I> Like-mindedness among 
 Christians is in order to our glorifying God, 

 1. <I>With one mind and one mouth.</I> It is desirable that Christians
 should agree in every thing, that so they may agree in this, to praise 
 God together. It tends very much to the glory of God, who is one, and 
 his name one, when it is so. It will not suffice that there be one 
 mouth, but there must be one mind, for God looks at the heart; nay, 
 there will hardly be one mouth where there is not one mind, and God 
 will scarcely be glorified where there is not a sweet conjunction of 
 both. One mouth in confessing the truths of God, in praising the name 
 of God--one mouth in common converse, not jarring, biting, and 
 devouring one another--one mouth in the solemn assembly, one speaking, 
 but all joining. 

 2. As <I>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> This is his
 New-Testament style. God must be glorified as he has now revealed 
 himself in the face of Jesus Christ, according to the rules of the 
 gospel, and with an eye to Christ, in whom he is our Father. The unity 
 of Christians glorifies <I>God as the Father of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> because it is a kind of counter-part or representation of 
 the oneness that is between the Father and the Son. We are warranted
 so to speak of it, and, with that in our eye, to desire it, and pray 
 for it, from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21">John xvii. 21</A>,

 <I>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
 thee:</I> a high expression of the honour and sweetness of the saints' 
 unity. And it follows, <I>The the world may believe that thou hast sent 
 me;</I> and so God may be glorified as the Father of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us
 to the glory of God.
 &nbsp; 8  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the
 circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises <I>made</I>
 unto the fathers:
 &nbsp; 9  And that the Gentiles might glorify God for <I>his</I> mercy; as
 it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
 Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
 &nbsp; 10  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
 &nbsp; 11  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him,
 all ye people.
 &nbsp; 12  And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
 he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the
 Gentiles trust.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here returns to his exhortation to Christians. What he says 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 is to the same purport with the former; but the repetition shows how 
 much the apostle's heart was upon it. "Receive one another into your 
 affection, into your communion, and into your common conversation, as 
 there is occasion." He had exhorted the strong to receive the weak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>),

 here, <I>Receive one another;</I> for sometimes the prejudices of the
 weak Christian make him shy of the strong, as much as the pride of the 
 strong Christian makes him shy of the weak, neither of which ought to 
 be. Let there be a mutual embracing among Christians. Those that have 
 received Christ by faith must receive all Christians by brotherly love; 
 though poor in the world, though persecuted and despised, though it may 
 be matter of reproach and danger to you to receive them, though in the 
 less weighty matters of the law they are of different apprehensions, 
 though there may have been occasion for private piques, yet, laying 
 aside these and the like considerations, <I>receive you one 
 another.</I> Now the reason why Christians must receive one another is 
 taken, as before, from the condescending love of Christ to us: <I>As 
 Christ also received us, to the glory of God.</I> Can there be a more 
 cogent argument? Has Christ been so kind to us, and shall we be so 
 unkind to those that are his? Was he so forward to entertain us, and
 shall we be backward to entertain our brethren? Christ has received us 
 into the nearest and dearest relations to himself: has received us into 
 his fold, into his family, into the adoption of sons, into a covenant 
 of friendship, yea, into a marriage-covenant with himself; he has 
 received us (though we were strangers and enemies, and had played the 
 prodigal) into fellowship and communion with himself. Those words, 
 <I>to the glory of God,</I> may refer both to Christ's receiving us, 
 which is our pattern, and to our receiving one another, which is our 
 practice according to that pattern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ hath received us to the glory of God. The end of our 
 reception by Christ is that we might glorify God in this world, and be 
 glorified with him in that to come. It was the glory of God, and our 
 glory in the enjoyment of God, that Christ had in his eye when he 
 condescended to receive us. We are called to an eternal glory by Christ 
 Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 See to what he received us-to a happiness transcending all
 comprehension; see for what he received us--for his Father's glory; he 
 had this in his eye in all the instances of his favour to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must receive one another to the glory of God. This must be our 
 great end in all our actions, that God may be glorified; and nothing 
 more conduces to this than the mutual love and kindness of those that 
 profess religion; compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 <I>That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God.</I> That which 
 was a bone of contention among them was a different apprehension about 
 meats and drinks, which took rise in distinction between Jews and 
 Gentiles. Now, to prevent and make up this different, he shows how 
 Jesus Christ has received both Jews and Gentiles; in him they are both 
 one, <I>one new man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14-16">Eph. ii. 14-16</A>.
 
 Now it is a rule, <I>Qu&aelig; conveniunt in aliquo tertio, inter se
 conveniunt--Things which agree with a third thing agree with each
 other.</I> Those that agree in Christ, who is the Alpha and the Omega, 
 the first and the last, and the great centre of unity, may well afford 
 to agree among themselves. This coalescence of the Jews and Gentiles in 
 Christ and Christianity was a thing that filled and affected Paul so 
 much that he could not mention it without some enlargement and 
 illustration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He received the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Let not any think hardly or scornfully therefore of those that were 
 originally Jews, and still, through weakness, retain some savour of 
 their old Judaism; for,

 (1.) Jesus Christ was a <I>minister of the circumcision.</I> That he 
 was a <I>minister,</I> <B><I>diakonos</I></B>--<I>a servant,</I> 
 bespeaks his great and exemplary condescension, and puts an honour upon 
 the ministry: but that he was a minister of the circumcision, was 
 himself circumcised and made under the law, and did in his own person 
 preach the gospel to the Jews, who were of the circumcision--this makes 
 the nation of the Jews more considerable than otherwise they appear to 
 be. Christ conversed with the Jews, blessed them, looked upon himself
 as primarily sent to the <I>lost sheep of the house of Israel, laid 
 hold of the seed of Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:16">Heb. ii. 16</A>,

 <I>margin</I>), and by them, as it were, caught at the whole body of 
 mankind. Christ's personal ministry was appropriated to them, though 
 the apostles had their commission enlarged. 

 (2.) He was so for the truth of God. That which he preached to them was 
 the truth; for he came into the world to bear witness to the truth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>.
 
 And he is himself the truth,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6">John xiv. 6</A>.
 
 Or, for the truth of God, that is, to make good the promises given to
 the patriarchs concerning the special mercy God had in store for their 
 seed. It was not for the merit of the Jews, but for the truth of God, 
 that they were thus distinguished--that God might approve himself true
 to this word which he had spoken.--<I>To confirm the promises made unto
 the fathers.</I> The best confirmation of promises is the performance 
 of them. It was promised that in the seed of Abraham all the nations of 
 the earth should be blessed, that Shiloh should come from between the 
 feet of Judah, that out of Israel should he proceed that should have 
 the dominion, that out of Zion should go forth the law, and many the 
 like. There were many intermediate providences which seemed to weaken 
 those promises, providences which threatened the fatal decay of that 
 people; but when Messiah the Prince appeared in the fulness of time, as 
 a minister of the circumcision, all these promises were confirmed, and 
 the truth of them was made to appear; for in Christ all the promises of 
 God, both those of the Old Testament and those of the New, are Yea, and 
 in him Amen. Understanding by <I>the promises made to the fathers</I> 
 the whole covenant of grace, darkly administered under the Old 
 Testament, and brought to a clearer light now under the gospel, it was 
 Christ's great errand to confirm that covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>.

 He confirmed it by shedding the blood of the covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He received the Gentiles likewise. This he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:9-12"><I>v.</I> 9-12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe Christ's favour to the Gentiles, in taking them in to 
 praise God--the work of the church on earth and the wages of that in
 heaven. One design of Christ was that the Gentiles likewise might be 
 converted that they might be one with the Jews in Christ's mystical 
 body. A good reason why they should not think the worse of any 
 Christian for his having been formerly a Gentile; for Christ has 
 received him. He invites the Gentiles, and welcomes them. Now observe 
 how their conversion is here expressed: <I>That the Gentiles might 
 glorify God for his mercy.</I> A periphrasis of conversion. 

 [1.] They shall have matter for praise, even the mercy of God. 
 Considering the miserable and deplorable condition that the Gentile 
 world was in, the receiving of them appears more as an act of mercy 
 than the receiving of the Jews. Those that were <I>Lo-ammi--not a 
 people,</I> were <I>Lo-ruhama--not obtaining mercy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:6,9,2:23">Hos. i. 6, 9; ii. 23</A>.

 The greatest mercy of God to any people is the receiving of them into
 covenant with himself: and it is good to take notice of God's mercy in 
 receiving us. 

 [2.] They shall have a heart for praise. They shall glorify God for his 
 mercy. Unconverted sinners do nothing to glorify God; but converting 
 grace works in the soul a disposition to speak and do all to the glory 
 of God; God intended to reap a harvest of glory from the Gentiles, who 
 had been so long turning his glory into shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The fulfilling of the scriptures in this. The favour of God to the 
 Gentiles was not only mercy, but truth. Though there were not promises 
 directly given to them, as to the fathers of the Jews, yet there were 
 many prophesies concerning them, which related to the calling of them, 
 and the embodying of them in the church, some of which he mentions 
 because it was a thing that the Jews were hardly persuaded to believe. 
 Thus, by referring them to the Old Testament, he labours to qualify 
 their dislike of the Gentiles, and so to reconcile the parties at 
 variance. 

 [1.] It was foretold that the Gentiles should have the gospel preached 
 to them: "<I>I will confess to thee among the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that is, thy name shall be known and owned in the Gentile world, there
 shall gospel grace and love be celebrated." This is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:49">Ps. xviii. 49</A>,

 <I>I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen.</I> A
 thankful explication and commemoration of the name of God are an
 excellent means of drawing others to know and praise God. Christ, in
 and by his apostles and ministers, whom he sent to disciple all
 nations, did confess to God among the Gentiles. The exaltation of
 Christ, as well as the conversion of sinners, is set forth by the
 praising of God. Christ's declaring God's name to his brethren is
 called <I>his praising God in the midst of the congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:22">Ps. xxii. 22</A>.

 Taking these words as spoken by David, they were spoken when he was old 
 and dying, and he was not likely to confess to God among the Gentiles; 
 but when David's psalms are read and sung among the Gentiles, to the
 praise and glory of God, it may be said that David is <I>confessing to
 God among the Gentiles, and singing to his name.</I> He that was the
 sweet psalmist of the Gentiles. Converting grace makes people greatly
 in love with David's psalms. Taking them as spoken by Christ, the Son
 of David, it may be understood of his spiritual indwelling by faith in
 the hearts of all the praising saints. If any confess to God among the
 Gentiles, and sing to his name, it is not they, but Christ and his
 grace in them. <I>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me;</I> so, I
 praise, yet not I, but Christ in me.

 [2.] That the Gentiles should <I>rejoice with his people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This is quoted from that song of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:43">Deut. xxxii. 43</A>.

 Observe, Those who were incorporated among his people are said to
 rejoice with his people. No greater joy can come to any people than
 the coming of the gospel among them in power. Those Jews that retain a 
 prejudice against the Gentiles will by no means admit them to any of 
 their joyful festivities; for (say they) a stranger intermeddleth not 
 with the joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:10">Prov. xiv. 10</A>.

 But, the partition-wall being taken down, the Gentiles are welcome to
 rejoice with his people. Being brought into the church, they share in 
 its sufferings, are companions in patience and tribulation, to 
 recompense which they share in the joy. 

 [3.] That they should praise God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles.</I> This is quoted out of that 
 short psalm,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:1">Ps. cxvii. 1</A>.

 Converting grace sets people a praising God, furnishes with the richest 
 matter for praise, and gives a heart to it. The Gentiles had been, for
 many ages, praising their idols of wood and stone, but now they are 
 brought to praise the Lord; and this David in spirit speaks of. In 
 calling upon all the nations to praise the Lord, it is intimated that 
 they shall have the knowledge of him. 

 [4.] That they should believe in Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>,

 where observe, <I>First,</I> The revelation of Christ, as the Gentiles' 
 king. He is here called <I>the root of Jesse,</I> that is, such a
 branch from the family of David as is the very life and strength of the 
 family: compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>.

 Christ was David's Lord, and yet withal he was the Son of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:45">Matt. xxii. 45</A>),

 for he was the <I>root and offspring of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>.

 Christ, as God, was David's root; Christ, as man, was David's
 offspring.--<I>And he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles.</I> 
 This explains the figurative expression of the prophet, he shall 
 <I>stand for an ensign of the people.</I> When Christ rose from the 
 dead, when he ascended on high, it was to reign over the Gentiles.
 <I>Secondly,</I> The recourse of the Gentiles to him: <I>In him shall 
 the Gentiles trust.</I> Faith is the soul's confidence in Christ and 
 dependence on him. The prophet has it, <I>to him shall the Gentiles 
 seek.</I> The method of faith is first to seek unto Christ, as to one 
 proposed to us for a Saviour; and, finding him able and willing to 
 save, then to trust in him. Those that know him will trust in him. Or, 
 this seeking to him is the effect of a trust in him; seeking him by 
 prayer, and pursuant endeavours. We shall never seek to Christ till we 
 trust in him. Trust is the mother; diligence in the use of means the 
 daughter. Jews and Gentiles being thus united in Christ's love, why 
 should they not be united in one another's love?</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another prayer directed to God, as the God of hope; and it is, 
 as the former 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 for spiritual blessings: these are the blest blessings, and to be first 
 and chiefly prayed for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Observe how he addresses himself to God, as the <I>God of hope.</I> 
 It is good in prayer to fasten upon those names, titles, and attributes 
 of God, which are most suitable to the errand we come upon, and will 
 best serve to encourage our faith concerning it. Every word in the 
 prayer should be a plea. Thus should the cause be skilfully ordered, 
 and the mouth filled with arguments. God is the God of hope. He is the 
 foundation on which our hope is built, and he is the builder that doth 
 himself raise it: he is both the object of our hope, and the author of 
 it. That hope is but fancy, and will deceive us, which is not fastened 
 upon God (as the goodness hoped for, and the truth hoped in), and which
 is not of his working in us. We have both together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:49">Ps. cxix. 49</A>.

 <I>Thy word</I>--there is God the object; <I>on which thou hast caused
 me to hope</I>--there is God the author of our hope,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3">1 Pet. i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he asks of God, not for himself, but for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>That they might be filled with all joy and peace in 
 believing.</I> Joy and peace are two of those things in which the 
 kingdom of God consists, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 17</A>.

 Joy in God, peace of conscience, both arising from a sense of our
 justification; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1,2"><I>ch.</I> v. 1, 2</A>.

 Joy and peace in our own bosoms would promote a cheerful unity and
 unanimity with our brethren. Observe, 

 (1.) How desirable this joy and peace are: they are filling. Carnal joy 
 puffs up the soul, but cannot fill it; therefore in laughter the heart 
 is sad. True, heavenly, spiritual joy is filling to the soul; it has a 
 satisfaction in it, answerable to the soul's vast and just desires. 
 Thus does God satiate and replenish the weary soul. Nothing more than 
 this joy, only more of it, even the perfection of it in glory, is the 
 desire of the soul that hath it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7,36:8,63:5,65:4">Ps. iv. 6, 7; xxxvi. 8; lxiii. 5; lxv. 4</A>.

 (2.) How it is attainable. 

 [1.] By prayer. We must go to God for it; he will for this be enquired 
 of. Prayer fetches in spiritual joy and peace. 

 [2.] By believing; that is the means to be used. It is vain, and 
 flashy, and transient joy, that is the product of fancy; true 
 substantial joy is the fruit of faith. <I>Believing, you rejoice with 
 joy unspeakable,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8">1 Pet. i. 8</A>.

 It is owing to the weakness of our faith that we are so much wanting in
 joy and peace. Only believe; believe the goodness of Christ, the love 
 of Christ, the promises of the covenant, and the joys and glories of 
 heaven; let faith be the substance and evidence of these things, and 
 the result must needs be joy and peace. Observe, It is <I>all</I> joy 
 and peace--all sorts of true joy and peace. When we come to God by 
 prayer we must enlarge our desires; we are not straitened in him, why 
 should we be straitened in ourselves? Ask for all joy; open thy mouth 
 wide, and he will fill it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they might <I>abound in hope through the power of the Holy 
 Ghost.</I> The joy and peace of believers arise chiefly from their 
 hopes. What is laid out upon them is but little, compared with what is 
 laid up for them; therefore the more hope they have the more joy and 
 peace they have. We do then abound in hope when we hope for great 
 things from God, and are greatly established and confirmed in these 
 hopes. Christians should desire and labour after an abundance of hope, 
 such hope as will not make ashamed. This is through the power of the 
 Holy Ghost. The same almighty power that works grace begets and 
 strengthens this hope. Our own power will never reach it; and therefore 
 where this hope is, and is abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all 
 the glory.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye
 also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also

 &nbsp; 15  Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto
 you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace
 that is given to me of God,
 &nbsp; 16  That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the
 Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of
 the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy
 Ghost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. He commends these Christians with the highest characters that could 
 be. He began his epistle with their praises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>),

 <I>Your faith is spoken of throughout the world,</I> thereby to make 
 way for his discourse: and, because sometimes he had reproved them 
 sharply, he now concludes with the like commendation, to qualify them, 
 and to part friends. This he does like an orator. It was not a piece of 
 idle flattery and compliment, but a due acknowledgment of their worth, 
 and of the grace of God in them. We must be forward to observe and 
 commend in others that which is excellent and praise-worthy; it is part 
 of the present recompence of virtue and usefulness, and will be of use 
 to quicken others to a holy emulation. It was a great credit to the 
 Romans to be commended by Paul, a man of such great judgment and 
 integrity, too skilful to be deceived and too honest to flatter. Paul 
 had no personal acquaintance with these Christians, and yet he says he 
 was persuaded of their excellencies, though he knew them only be 
 hearsay. As we must not, on the one hand, be so simple as to believe
 every word; so, on the other hand, we must not be so skeptical as to 
 believe nothing; but especially we must be forward to believe good 
 concerning others: in this case charity hopeth all things, and 
 believeth all things, and (if the probabilities be any way strong, as 
 here they were) is persuaded. It is safer to err on this side. Now 
 observe what it was that he commended them for. 

 1. That they <I>were full of goodness;</I> therefore the more likely to
 take in good part what he had written, and to account it a kindness; 
 and not only so, but to comply with it, and to put it in practice, 
 especially that which relates to their union and to the healing of 
 their differences. A good understanding of one another, and a good will 
 to one another, would soon put an end to strife. 

 2. <I>Filled with all knowledge.</I> Goodness and knowledge together! A
 very rare and an excellent conjunction; the head and the heart of the 
 new man. All knowledge, all necessary knowledge, all the knowledge of 
 those things which belong to their everlasting peace. 

 3. <I>Able to admonish one another.</I> To this there is a further
 gift requisite, even the gift of utterance. Those that have goodness
 and knowledge should communicate what they have for the use and benefit 
 of others. "You that excel so much in good gifts may think you have no
 need of any instructions of mine." It is a comfort to faithful 
 ministers to see their work superseded by the gifts and graces of their 
 people. How gladly would ministers leave off their admonishing work, if 
 people were able and willing to admonish one another! Would to God that 
 all the Lord's people were prophets. But that which is every body's 
 work is nobody's work; and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He clears himself from the suspicion of intermeddling needlessly 
 with that which did not belong to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Observe how affectionately he speaks to them: <I>My brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and again, <I>brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He had himself, and taught others, the art of obliging. He calls them 
 all his brethren, to teach them brotherly love one to another. Probably 
 he wrote the more courteously to them because, being Roman citizens 
 living near the court, they were more genteel, and made a better 
 figure; and therefore Paul, who became all things to all men, was 
 willing, by the respectfulness of his style, to please them for their 
 good. He acknowledges he had written <I>boldly in some 
 sort</I>--<B><I>tolmeroteron apo merous,</I></B> in a manner that 
 looked like boldness and presumption, and for which some might perhaps 
 charge him with taking too much upon him. But then consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He did it only as their remembrancer: <I>As putting you in mind.</I> 
 such humble thoughts had Paul of himself, though he excelled in 
 knowledge, that he would not pretend to tell them that which they did 
 not know before, but only to remind them of that in which they had 
 formerly been by others instructed. So Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12,3:1">2 Pet. i. 12; iii. 1</A>.

 People commonly excuse themselves from hearing the word with this, that
 the minister can tell them nothing but what they knew before. If it be 
 so, yet have they not need to know it better, and to be put in mind of 
 it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He did it as the apostle of the Gentiles. It was in pursuance of his 
 office: <I>Because of the grace</I> (that is, the <I>apostleship,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>)

 <I>given to me of God,</I> to be the minister <I>of Jesus Christ to the
 Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Paul reckoned it a great favour, and an honour that God had put upon 
 him, in putting him into that office,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 13</A>.

 Now, because of this grace given to him, he thus laid out himself among
 the Gentiles, that he might not receive that grace of God in vain.
 Christ received that he might give; so did Paul; so have we talents
 which must not be buried. Places and offices must be filled up with
 duty. It is good for ministers to be often remembering the grace that
 is given unto them of God. <I>Minister verbi es, hoc age--You are a
 minister of the word; give yourself wholly to it,</I> was Mr. Perkins's
 motto. Paul was a minister. Observe here, 

 (1.) Whose minister he was: the <I>minister of Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:1">1 Cor. iv. 1</A>.

 He is our Master; his we are, and him we serve.

 (2.) To whom: to the Gentiles. So God had appointed him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21">Acts xxii. 21</A>.
 
 So Peter and he had agreed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7-9">Gal. ii. 7-9</A>.

 These Romans were Gentiles: "Now," says he, "I do not thrust myself
 upon you, nor seek any lordship over you; I am appointed to it: if you 
 think I am rude and bold, my commission is my warrant, and must bear me 
 out." 

 (3.) What he ministered: the <I>gospel of God;</I> <B><I>hierourgounta 
 to euangelion</I></B>--<I>ministering as about holy things</I> (so the 
 word signifies), executing the office of a Christian priest, more 
 spiritual, and therefore more excellent, than the Levitical priesthood. 
 
 (4.) For what end: <I>that the offering up</I> (or sacrificing) <I>of
 the Gentiles might be acceptable</I>--that god might have the glory 
 which would redound to his name by the conversion of the Gentiles. Paul 
 laid out himself thus to bring about something that might be acceptable 
 to God. Observe how the conversion of the Gentiles is expressed: it is 
 the <I>offering up of the Gentiles;</I> it is <B><I>prosphora ton 
 ethnon</I></B>--<I>the oblation of the Gentiles,</I> in which the 
 Gentiles are looked upon either, 

 [1.] As the priests, offering the oblation of prayer and praise and 
 other acts of religion. Long had the Jews been the holy nation, the 
 kingdom of priests, but now the Gentiles are made priests unto God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:10">Rev. v. 10</A>),

 by their conversion to the Christian faith consecrated to the service 
 of God, that the scripture may be fulfilled, <I>In ever place incense 
 shall be offered, and a pure offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>.

 The converted Gentiles are said to be <I>made nigh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:13">Eph. ii. 13</A>)--

 the periphrasis of priests. Or, 

 [2.] The Gentiles are themselves the sacrifice offered up to God by
 Paul, in the name of Christ, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1"><I>ch.</I> xii. 1</A>.

 A sanctified soul is offered up to God in the flames of love, upon
 Christ the altar. Paul gathered in souls by his preaching, not to keep 
 them to himself, but to offer them up to God: <I>Behold, I, and the 
 children that God hath given me.</I> And it is an acceptable offering, 
 <I>being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</I> Paul preached to them, and 
 dealt with them; but that which made them sacrifices to God was their 
 sanctification; and this was not his work, but the work of the Holy 
 Ghost. None are acceptably offered to God but those that are 
 sanctified: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
 those things which pertain to God.
 &nbsp; 18  For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
 Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by
 word and deed,
 &nbsp; 19  Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit
 of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I
 have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
 &nbsp; 20  Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where
 Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's
 foundation:
 &nbsp; 21  But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they
 shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here gives some account of himself and of his own affairs. 
 Having mentioned his ministry and apostleship, he goes on further to 
 magnify his office in the efficacy of it, and to mention to the glory 
 of God the great success of his ministry and the wonderful things that 
 God had done by him, for encouragement to the Christian church at Rome, 
 that they were not alone in the profession of Christianity, but though, 
 compared with the multitude of their idolatrous neighbours, they were 
 but a little flock, yet, up and down the country, there were many that 
 were their companions in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ. It 
 was likewise a great confirmation of the truth of the Christian 
 doctrine that it had such strange success, and was so far propagated by 
 such weak and unlikely means, such multitudes captivated to the 
 obedience of Christ by the foolishness of preaching. Therefore Paul 
 gives them this account, which he makes the matter of his glorying; not 
 vain glory, but holy gracious glorying, which appears by the 
 limitations; it is <I>through Jesus Christ.</I> Thus does he centre all 
 his glorying in Christ; he teaches us so to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:31">1 Cor. i. 31</A>.
 
 <I>Not unto us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1">Ps. cxv. 1</A>.

 And it is <I>in those things which pertain to God.</I> The conversion
 of souls is one of those things that pertain to God, and therefore is 
 the matter of Paul's glorying; not the things of the flesh. <I>Whereof 
 I may glory,</I> <B><I>echo oun kauchesin en Christo Iesou ta pros 
 Theon.</I></B> I would rather read it thus: <I>Therefore I have a 
 rejoicing in Christ Jesus</I> (it is the same word that is used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12,Php+3:3">2 Cor. i. 12, and Phil. iii. 3</A>,

 where it is the character of the circumcision that they
 <I>rejoice</I>--<B><I>kauchomenoi,</I></B> in Christ Jesus) 
 <I>concerning the things of God;</I> or those things that are offered 
 to God--the living sacrifices of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Paul would have them to rejoice with him in the extent and efficacy of 
 his ministry, of which he speaks not only with the greatest deference 
 possible to the power of Christ, and the effectual working of the 
 Spirit as all in all; but with a protestation of the truth of what he 
 said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath 
 not wrought by me.</I> He would not boast of things without his line, 
 nor take the praise of another man's work, as he might have done when 
 he was writing to distant strangers, who perhaps could not contradict 
 him; but (says he) I dare not do it: a faithful man dares not lie,
 however he be tempted, dares be true, however he be terrified. Now, in
 this account of himself, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His unwearied diligence and industry in his work. He was one that 
 laboured <I>more abundantly than they all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He preached in many places: <I>From Jerusalem,</I> whence the law 
 went forth as a lamp that shineth, and <I>round about unto 
 Illyricum,</I> many hundred miles distant from Jerusalem. We have in 
 the book of the Acts an account of Paul's travels. There we find him,
 after he was sent forth to preach to the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1-52">Acts xiii.</A>),

 labouring in that blessed work in Seleucia, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Pisidia,
 and Lycaonia 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1-14:28">Acts xiii. and xiv.</A>),

 afterwards travelling through Syria and Cilicia, Phrygia, Galatia,
 Mysia, Troas, and thence called over to Macedonia, and so into Europe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1-16:40">Acts xv. and xvi</A>.

 Then we find him very busy at Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, Corinth,
 Ephesus, and the parts adjacent. Those that know the extent and 
 distance of these countries will conclude Paul an active man, rejoicing 
 as a strong man to run a race. Illyricum is the country now called 
 Sclavonia, bordering upon Hungary. Some take it for the same with 
 Bulgaria; others for the lower Pannonia: however, it was a great way 
 from Jerusalem. Now it might be suspected that if Paul undertook so 
 much work, surely he did it by the halves. "No," says he, "<I>I have 
 fully preached the Gospel of Christ</I>--have given them a full account 
 of the truth and terms of the gospel, have not shunned to declare the 
 whole counsel of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>),

 have kept back nothing that was necessary for them to know." <I>Filled 
 the gospel,</I> so the word is; <B><I>peplerokenai to 
 euangelion,</I></B> filled it as the net is filled with fishes in a 
 large draught; or filled the gospel, that is, filled them with the 
 gospel. Such a change does the gospel make that, when it comes in power 
 to any place, it fills the place. Other knowledge is airy, and leaves 
 souls empty, but he knowledge of the gospel is filling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He preached in places that had not heard the gospel before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 He broke up the fallow ground, laid the first stone in many places, and 
 introduced Christianity where nothing had reigned for many ages but 
 idolatry and witchcraft, and all sorts of diabolism. Paul broke the 
 ice, and therefore must needs meet with the more difficulties and 
 discouragements in his work. Those who preached in Judea had upon this 
 account a much easier task than Paul, who was the apostle of the 
 Gentiles; for they entered into the labours of others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:38">John iv. 38</A>.

 Paul, being a hardy man, was called out to the hardest work; there were
 many instructors, but Paul was the great father--many that watered, but 
 Paul was the great planter. Well, he was a bold man that made the first 
 attack upon the palace of the strong man armed in the Gentile world, 
 that first assaulted Satan's interest there, and Paul was that man who 
 ventured the first onset in many places, and suffered greatly for it.
 He mentions this as a proof of his apostleship; for the office of the 
 apostles was especially to bring in those that were without, and to lay 
 the foundations of the new Jerusalem; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:14">Rev. xxi. 14</A>.

 Not but that Paul preached in many places where others had been at work 
 before him; but he principally and mainly laid himself out for the good 
 of those that sat in darkness. He was in care not to <I>build upon 
 another man's foundation,</I> lest he should thereby disprove his 
 apostleship, and give occasion to those who sought occasion to reflect 
 upon him. He quotes a scripture for this out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:15">Isa. lii. 15</A>,

 <I>To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see. That which had not
 been told them, shall they see;</I> so the prophet has it, much to the 
 same purport. This made the success of Paul's preaching the more 
 remarkable. The transition from darkness to light is more sensible
 than the after-growth and increase of that light. And commonly the 
 greatest success of the gospel is at its first coming to a place; 
 afterwards people become sermon-proof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great and wonderful success that he had in his work: It was
 effectual to <I>make the Gentiles obedient.</I> The design of the 
 gospel is to bring people to be <I>obedient;</I> it is not only a truth 
 to be believed, but a law to be obeyed. This Paul aimed at in all his 
 travels; not his own wealth and honour (if he had, he had sadly missed 
 his aim), but the conversion and salvation of souls: this his heart was 
 upon, and for this he travailed in birth again. Now how was this great 
 work wrought? 

 1. Christ was the principal agent. He does not say, "which I worked,"
 but "which Christ wrought by me,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Whatever good we do, it is not we, but Christ by us, that does it; the 
 work is his, the strength his; he is all in all, he works all our 
 works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:13,Isa+26:12">Phil. ii. 13; Isa. xxvi. 12</A>.

 Paul takes all occasions to own this, that the whole praise might be
 transmitted to Christ. 

 2. Paul was a very active instrument: <I>By word and deed,</I> that is,
 by his preaching, and by the miracles he wrought to confirm his 
 doctrine; or his preaching and his living. Those ministers are likely 
 to win souls that preach both by word and deed, by their conversation 
 showing forth the power of the truths they preach. This is according
 to Christ's example, who began both to do and teach,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:1">Acts i. 1</A>.--

 <I>Through mighty signs and wonders:</I> <B><I>en dynamei
 semeion</I></B>--<I>by the power,</I> or in the strength, of signs and 
 wonders. These made the preaching of the word so effectual, being the 
 appointed means of conviction, and the divine seal affixed to the 
 gospel-charter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17,18">Mark xvi. 17, 18</A>.

 3. The <I>power of the Spirit of God</I> made this effectual, and
 crowned all with the desired success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 (1.) The power of the Spirit in Paul, as in the other apostles, for the 
 working of those miracles. Miracles were wrought by the power of the 
 Holy Ghost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8">Acts i. 8</A>),

 therefore reproaching the miracles is called the blasphemy against the 
 Holy Ghost. Or, 

 (2.) The power of the Spirit in the hearts of those to whom the word 
 was preached, and who saw the miracles, making these means effectual to 
 some and not to others. It is the Spirit's operation that makes the 
 difference. Paul himself, as great a preacher as he was, with all his 
 might signs and wonders, could not make one soul obedient further than 
 the power of the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. It was the 
 Spirit of the Lord of hosts that made those great mountains plain 
 before this Zerubbabel. This is an encouragement to faithful ministers, 
 who labour under the sense of great weakness and infirmity, that it is 
 all one to the blessed Spirit to work by many, or by those that have on 
 power. The same almighty Spirit that wrought with Paul often perfects 
 strength in weakness, and ordains praise out of the mouths of babes and 
 sucklings. This success which he had in preaching is that which he here 
 rejoices in; for the converted nations were his joy and crown of 
 rejoicing: and he tells them of it, not only that they might rejoice 
 with him, but that they might be the more ready to receive the truths 
 which he had written to them, and to own him whom Christ had thus 
 signally owned.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming
 to you.
 &nbsp; 23  But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
 great desire these many years to come unto you;
 &nbsp; 24  Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:
 for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way
 thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your
 <I>company.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
 &nbsp; 26  For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
 certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 27  It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For
 if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual
 things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal
 things.
 &nbsp; 28  When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to
 them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

 the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 St. Paul here declares his purpose to come and see the Christians at 
 Rome. Upon this head his matter is but common and ordinary, appointing 
 a visit to his friends; but the manner of his expression is gracious 
 and savoury, very instructive, and for our imitation. We should learn 
 by it to speak of our common affairs in the language of Canaan. Even 
 our common discourse should have an air of grace; by this it will 
 appear what country we belong to. It should seem that Paul's company
 was very much desired at Rome. He was a man that had as many friends 
 and as many enemies as most men ever had: he passed through evil report 
 and good report. No doubt they had heard much of him at Rome, and 
 longed to see him. Should the apostle of the Gentiles be a stranger at 
 Rome, the metropolis of the Gentile world? Why as to this he excuses it 
 that he had not come yet, he promises to come shortly, and gives a good 
 reason why he could not come now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He excuses it that he never came yet. Observe how careful Paul was 
 to keep in with his friends, and to prevent or anticipate any 
 exceptions against him; not as one that lorded it over God's heritage. 
 
 1. He assures them that he had a great desire to see them; not to see
 Rome, though it was now in its greatest pomp and splendour, nor to see 
 the emperor's court, nor to converse with the philosophers and learned 
 men that were then at Rome, though such conversation must needs be very 
 desirable to so great a scholar as Paul was, but <I>to come unto 
 you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 a company of poor despised saints in Rome, hated of the world, but 
 loving God, and beloved of him. These were the men that Paul was 
 ambitious of an acquaintance with at Rome; they were the excellent ones 
 in whom he delighted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:3">Ps. xvi. 3</A>.

 And he had a special desire to see them, because of the great character
 they had in all the churches for faith and holiness; they were men that 
 excelled in virtue, and therefore Paul was so desirous to come to them. 
 This desire Paul had had for many years, and yet could never compass 
 it. The providence of God wisely overrules the purposes and desires of 
 men. God's dearest servants are not always gratified in every thing 
 that they have a mind to. Yet all that delight in God have the desire 
 of their heart fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:4">Ps. xxxvii. 4</A>),

 though all the desires in their heart be not humoured. 

 2. He tells them that the reason why he could not come to them was 
 because he had so much work cut out for him elsewhere. <I>For which 
 cause,</I> that is, because of his labours in other countries, he was 
 so much <I>hindered.</I> God had opened a wide door for him in other 
 places, and so turned him aside. Observe in this, 

 (1.) The gracious providence of God conversant in a special manner 
 about his ministers, casting their lot, not according to their 
 contrivance, but according to his own purpose. Paul was several times 
 crossed in his intentions; sometimes hindered by Satan (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18">1 Thess. ii. 18</A>),

 sometimes forbidden by the Spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:7">Acts xvi. 7</A>),

 and here diverted by other work. Man purposes but God disposes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:9,19:21,Jer+10:23">Prov. xvi. 9; xix. 21; Jer. x. 23</A>.

 Ministers purpose, and their friends purpose concerning them, but God
 overrules both, and orders the journeys, removals, and settlements, of 
 his faithful ministers as he pleases. The stars are in the right hand 
 of Christ, to shine where he sets them. The gospel does not come by 
 chance to any place, but by the will and counsel of God. 

 (2.) The gracious prudence of Paul, in bestowing his time and pains 
 where there was most need. Had Paul consulted his own ease, wealth, and 
 honour, the greatness of the word would never have hindered him from 
 seeing Rome, but would rather have driven him thither, where he might 
 have had more preferment and taken less pains. But Paul sought the 
 things of Christ more than his own things, and therefore would not 
 leave his work of planting churches, no, not for a time, to go and see 
 Rome. The Romans were whole, and needed not the physician as other poor 
 places that were sick and dying. While men and women were every day 
 dropping into eternity, and their precious souls perishing for lack of 
 vision, it was no time for Paul to trifle. There was now a gale of 
 opportunity, the fields were white unto the harvest; such a season 
 slipped might never be retrieved; the necessities of poor souls were 
 pressing, and called aloud, and therefore Paul must be busy. It 
 concerns us all to do that first which is most needful. True grace 
 teaches us to prefer that which is necessary before that which is 
 unnecessary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:41,42">Luke x. 41, 42</A>.

 And Christian prudence teaches us to prefer that which is more
 necessary before that which is less so. This Paul mentions as a 
 sufficient satisfying reason. We must not take it ill of our friends if 
 they prefer necessary work, which is pleasing to God, before 
 unnecessary visits and compliments, which may be pleasing to us. In
 this, as in other things, we must deny ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He promised to come and see them shortly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:23,24,29"><I>v.</I> 23, 24, 29</A>.

 <I>Having no more place in these parts,</I> namely, in Greece, where he 
 then was. The whole of that country being more or less leavened with
 the savour of the gospel, churches being planted in the most 
 considerable towns and pastors settled to carry on the work which Paul 
 had begun, he had little more to do there. He had driven the chariot of 
 the gospel to the sea-coast, and having thus conquered Greece he is 
 ready to wish there were another Greece to conquer. Paul was one that 
 went through with his work, and yet then did not think of taking his 
 ease, but set himself to contrive more work, to devise liberal things. 
 Here was a workman that needed not to be ashamed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he forecasted his intended visit. His project was to see them in 
 his way to Spain. It appears by this that Paul intended a journey into 
 Spain, to plant Christianity there. The difficulty and peril of the 
 work, the distance of the place, the danger of the voyage, the other 
 good works (though less needful, he thinks) which Paul might find to do 
 in other places, did not quench the flame of his holy zeal for the 
 propagating of the gospel, which did even eat him up, and make him 
 forget himself. But it is not certain whether ever he fulfilled his 
 purpose, and went to Spain. Many of the best expositors think he did 
 not, but was hindered in this as he was in others of his purposes. He 
 did indeed come to Rome, but he was brought thither a prisoner, and 
 there was detained two years; and whither he went after is uncertain: 
 but several of his epistles which he wrote in prison intimate his 
 purpose to go eastward, and not towards Spain. However, Paul, forasmuch 
 as it was in thine heart to bring the light of the gospel into Spain, 
 thou didst well, in that it was in thine heart; as God said to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:8">2 Chron. vi. 8</A>.

 The grace of God often with favour accepts the sincere intention, when
 the providence of God in wisdom prohibits the execution. And do not we 
 serve a good Master then?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:12">2 Cor. viii. 12</A>.

 Now, in his way to Spain he proposed to come to them. Observe his
 prudence. It is wisdom for every one of us to order our affairs so that 
 we may do the most work in the least time. Observe how doubtfully he 
 speaks: <I>I trust to see you:</I> not, "I am resolved I will," but, "I
 hope I shall." We must purpose all our purposes and make all our 
 promises in like manner with a submission to the divine providence; not 
 boasting ourselves of to-morrow, because we know not what a day may 
 bring forth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1,Jam+4:13-15">Prov. xxvii. 1; James iv. 13-15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he expected in his intended visit. 

 (1.) What he expected from them. He expected they would bring him on 
 his way towards Spain. It was not a stately attendance, such as princes 
 have but a loving attendance, such as friends give, that Paul expected. 
 Spain was then a province of the empire, well known to the Romans, who 
 had a great correspondence with it, and therefore they might be helpful 
 to Paul in his voyage thither; and it was not barely their accompanying 
 him part of the way, but their furthering him in his expedition, that 
 he counted upon: not only out of their respect to Paul, but out of 
 respect to the souls of those poor Spaniards that Paul was going to 
 preach to. It is justly expected from all Christians that they should 
 lay out themselves for the promoting and furthering of every good work, 
 especially that blessed work of the conversion of souls, which they 
 should contrive to make as easy as may be to their ministers, and as 
 successful as may be to poor souls. 

 (2.) What he expected in them: to <I>be somewhat filled with their 
 company.</I> That which Paul desired was their company and 
 conversation. The good company of the saints is very desirable and 
 delightful. Paul was himself a man of great attainments in knowledge 
 and grace, taller by head and shoulders than other Christians in these 
 things, and yet see how he pleased himself with the thoughts of good 
 company; for as iron sharpens iron so does a man the countenance of his 
 friend. He intimates that he intended to make some stay with them, for 
 he would be filled with their company; not just look at them, and away: 
 and yet he thinks their converse so pleasant that he should never have 
 enough of it; it is but somewhat filled, he thought he should leave 
 them with a desire of more of their company. Christian society, rightly 
 managed and improved, is a heaven upon earth, a comfortable earnest of 
 our gathering together unto Christ at the great day. Yet observe, It is 
 but somewhat filled, <B><I>apo merous</I></B>--<I>in part.</I> The 
 satisfaction we have in communion with the saints in this world is but 
 partial; we are but somewhat filled. It is partial compared with our 
 communion with Christ; that, and that only, will completely satisfy, 
 that will fill the soul. It is partial compared with the communion we 
 hope to have with the saints in the other world. When we shall sit down 
 with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, with all the saints, and none but 
 saints, and saints made perfect, we shall have enough of that society, 
 and be quite filled with that company. 

 (3.) What he expected from God with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He expected to come <I>in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of 
 Christ.</I> Observe, Concerning what he <I>expected</I> from 
 <I>them</I> he speaks doubtfully: <I>I trust to be brought on my way, 
 and to be filled with your company.</I> Paul had learnt not to be too 
 confident of the best. These very men slipped from him afterwards,
 when he had occasion to use them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2 Tim. iv. 16</A>),

 <I>At my first answer, no man stood by me;</I> none of the Christians 
 at Rome. The Lord teach us to cease from man. But concerning what he 
 expected from God he speaks confidently. It was uncertain whether he 
 should come or no, but <I>I am sure when I do come I shall come in the 
 fulness,</I> &c. We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much 
 from God. Now Paul expected that God would bring him to them, loaded 
 with blessings, so that he should be an instrument of doing a great 
 deal of good among them, and fill them with the blessings of the 
 gospel. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>,

 <I>That I may impart unto you some spiritual gift.</I> The blessing of
 the gospel of Christ is the best and most desirable blessing. When Paul 
 would raise their expectation of something great and good in his 
 coming, he directs them to hope for the blessings of the gospel, 
 spiritual blessings, knowledge, and grace, and comfort. There is then a 
 happy meeting between people and ministers, when they are both under 
 the fulness of the blessing. The blessing of the gospel is the treasure 
 which we have in earthen vessels. When ministers are fully prepared to 
 give out, and people fully prepared to receive, this blessing, both are 
 happy. Many have the gospel who have not the blessing of the gospel, 
 and so they have it in vain. The gospel will not profit, unless God 
 bless it to us; and it is our duty to wait upon him for that blessing, 
 and for the fulness of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives them a good reason why he could not come and see them 
 now, because he had other business upon his hands, which required his 
 attendance, upon which he must first make a journey to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:25-28"><I>v.</I> 25-28</A>.

 He gives a particular account of it, to show that the excuse was real.
 He was going to Jerusalem, as the messenger of the church's charity to 
 the poor saints there. Observe what he says,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning this charity itself. And he speaks of that upon this 
 occasion probably to excite the Roman Christians to do the like, 
 according to their ability. Examples are moving, and Paul was very 
 ingenious at begging, not for himself, but for others. Observe, 

 (1.) For whom it was intended: <I>For the poor saints which are at 
 Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It is no strange thing for saints to be poor. Those whom God favours
 the world often frowns upon; therefore riches are not the best things, 
 nor is poverty a curse. It seems, the saints at Jerusalem were poorer 
 than other saints, either because the wealth of that people in general 
 was now declining, as their utter ruin was hastening on (and, to be 
 sure, if any must be kept poor, the saints must), or because the famine 
 that was over all the world in the days of Claudius C&aelig;sar did in 
 a special manner prevail in Judea, a dry country; and, God having 
 called the poor of this world, the Christians smarted most by it. This 
 was the occasion of that contribution mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:28-30">Acts xi. 28-30</A>.

 Or, because the saints at Jerusalem suffered most by persecution; for
 of all people the unbelieving Jews were most inveterate in their rage 
 and malice against the Christians, wrath having come upon them to the 
 uttermost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 The Christian Hebrews are particularly noted too as having had their
 good spoiled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34">Heb. x. 34</A>),

 in consideration of which this contribution was made for them. Though 
 the saints at Jerusalem were at a great distance form them, yet they 
 thus extended their bounty and liberality to them, to teach us as we 
 have ability, and as there is occasion, to stretch out the hand of our 
 charity to all that are of the household of faith, though in places 
 distant from us. Though in personal instances of poverty every church 
 should take care to maintain their own poor (for such poor we have 
 always with us), yet sometimes, when more public instances of poverty 
 are presented as objects of our charity, though a great way off from 
 us, we must extend our bounty, as the sun his beams; and, with the 
 virtuous woman, <I>stretch out our hands to the poor, and reach forth 
 our hands to the needy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:20">Prov. xxxi. 20</A>.

 (2.) By whom it was collected: <I>By those of Macedonia</I> (the chief
 of whom were the Philippians) <I>and Achaia</I> (the chief of whom were 
 the Corinthians), two flourishing churches, though yet in their 
 infancy, newly converted to Christianity. And I wish the observation
 did not hold that people are commonly more liberal at their first 
 acquaintance with the gospel than they are afterwards, that, as well as 
 other instances of the first love and the love of the espousals, being 
 apt to cool and decay after a while. It seems those of Macedonia and 
 Achaia were rich and wealthy, while those at Jerusalem were poor and 
 needy, Infinite Wisdom ordering it so that some should have what others 
 want, and so this mutual dependence of Christians one upon another 
 might be maintained.--<I>It pleased them.</I> This intimates how ready 
 they were to it--they were not pressed nor constrained to it, but they 
 did it of their own accord; and how cheerful they were in it--they took 
 a pleasure in doing good; and God loves a cheerful giver.--<I>To make a 
 certain contribution;</I> <B><I>koinonian tina</I></B>--<I>a 
 communication,</I> in token of the communion of saints, and their 
 fellow-membership, as in the natural body one member communicates to 
 the relief, and succour, and preservation of another, as there is 
 occasion. Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof 
 and instance of that common union which they have one with another in 
 Jesus Christ. Time was when the saints at Jerusalem were on the giving 
 hand, and very liberal they were, when they laid their estates at the 
 apostles' feet for charitable uses, and took special care that the 
 Grecian widows should not be neglected in the daily ministration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1">Acts vi. 1</A>,

 &c. And now that the providence of God had turned the scale, and made
 them necessitous, they found the Grecians kind to them; for the 
 merciful shall obtain mercy. We should give a portion to seven, and
 also to eight, because we know not what evil may be on the earth, which 
 may make us glad to be beholden to others. 

 (3.) What reason there was for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>And their debtors they are.</I> Alms are called righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9">Ps. cxii. 9</A>.

 Being but stewards of what we have, we owe it where our great Master 
 (by the calls of providence, concurring with the precepts of the word) 
 orders us to dispose of it: but here there was a special debt owing; 
 the Gentiles were greatly beholden to the Jews, and were bound in 
 gratitude to be very kind to them. From the stock of Israel came Christ 
 himself, according to the flesh, who is the light to enlighten the 
 Gentiles; out of the same stock came the prophets, and apostles, and 
 first preachers of the gospel. The Jews, having had the lively oracles 
 committed to them, were the Christians' library-keepers--<I>out of Zion 
 went forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem;</I> their 
 political church-state was dissolved, and they were cut off, that the 
 Gentiles might be admitted in. Thus did the Gentiles partake of their 
 spiritual things, and receive the gospel of salvation as it were at 
 second-hand from the Jews; and therefore <I>their duty is,</I> they are 
 bound in gratitude to <I>minister unto them in carnal things:</I> it is 
 the least they can do: <B><I>leitourgesai</I></B>--<I>to minister as 
 unto God in holy things;</I> so the word signifies. A conscientious 
 regard to God in works of charity and almsgiving makes them an 
 acceptable service and sacrifice to God, and fruit abounding to a good 
 account. Paul mentions this, probably, as the argument he had used with 
 them to persuade them to it, and it is an argument of equal cogency to 
 other Gentile churches.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning Paul's agency in this business. He could himself 
 contribute nothing; silver and gold he had none, but lived upon the 
 kindness of his friends; yet he <I>ministered unto the saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 by stirring up others, receiving what was gathered, and transmitting it 
 to Jerusalem. Many good works of that kind stand at a stay for want of 
 some one active person to lead in them, and to set the wheels a going. 
 Paul's labour in this work is not to be interpreted as any neglect of 
 his preaching-work, nor did Paul leave the word of God, to serve 
 tables; for, besides this, Paul had other business in this journey, to 
 visit and confirm the churches, and took this by the bye; this was 
 indeed a part of the trust committed to him, in which he was concerned 
 to approve himself faithful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:10">Gal. ii. 10</A>):

 <I>They would that we should remember the poor.</I> Paul was one that 
 laid out himself to do good every way, like his Master, to the bodies 
 as well as to the souls of people. Ministering to the saints is good 
 work, and is not below the greatest apostles. This Paul had undertaken, 
 and therefore he resolves to go through with it, before he fell upon 
 other work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>When I have sealed to them this fruit.</I> He calls the alms 
 <I>fruit,</I> for it is one of the fruits of righteousness; it sprang 
 from a root of grace in the givers, and redounded to the benefit and 
 comfort of the receivers. And his sealing it intimates his great care 
 about it, that what was given might be kept entire, and not embezzled, 
 but disposed of according to the design of the givers. Paul was very 
 solicitous to approve himself faithful in the management of this 
 matter: an excellent pattern for ministers to write after, that the 
 ministry may in nothing be blamed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's

 &nbsp; 31  That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, I. St. Paul's desire of a share in the prayers of the 
 Romans for him, expressed very earnestly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:30-32"><I>v.</I> 30-32</A>.

 Though Paul was a great apostle, yet he begged the prayers of the
 meanest Christians, not here only, but in several other of the 
 epistles. He had prayed much for them, and this he desires as the 
 return of his kindness. Interchanging prayers is an excellent token of 
 the interchanging of loves. Paul speaks like one that knew himself, and 
 would hereby teach us how to value the effectual fervent prayer of the 
 righteous. How careful should we be lest we do any thing to forfeit our 
 interest in the love and prayers of god's praying people!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe why they must pray for him. He begs it with the greatest 
 importunity. He might suspect they would forget him in their prayers, 
 because they had no personal acquaintance with him, and therefore he 
 urges it so closely, and begs it with the most affectionate 
 obtestations, by all that is sacred and valuable: <I>I beseech you,</I> 
 
 (1.) "<I>For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake.</I> He is my Master, I am 
 going about his work, and his glory is interested in the success of it: 
 if you have any regard to Jesus Christ, and to his cause and kingdom, 
 pray for me. You love Christ, and own Christ; for his sake then do me 
 this kindness." 

 (2.) "<I>For the love of the Spirit.</I> As a proof and instance of 
 that love which the Spirit works in the hearts of believers one to 
 another, pray for me; as a fruit of that communion which we have one 
 with another by the Spirit though we never saw one another. If ever you 
 experienced the Spirit's love to you, and would be found returning your 
 love to the Spirit, be not wanting in this office of kindness."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they must pray for him: <I>That you strive together.</I> 

 (1.) That <I>you strive in prayer.</I> We must put forth all that is 
 within us in that duty; pray with fixedness, faith, and fervency; 
 wrestle with God, as Jacob did; pray in praying, as Elias did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">Jam. v. 17</A>),

 and stir up ourselves to take hold on God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:7">Isa. lxiv. 7</A>);

 and this is not only when we are praying for ourselves, but when we are 
 praying for our friends. True love to our brethren should make us as
 earnest for them as sense of our own need makes us for ourselves. 

 (2.) That you strive together with me. When he begged their prayers for 
 him, he did not intend thereby to excuse his praying for himself; no, 
 "<I>Strive together with me,</I> who am wrestling with God daily, upon 
 my own and my friends' account." He would have them to ply the same 
 oar. Paul and these Romans were distant in place, and likely to be so, 
 and yet they might join together in prayer; those who are put far 
 asunder by the disposal of God's providence may yet meet together at 
 the throne of his grace. Those who beg the prayers of others must not
 neglect to pray for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What they must beg of God for him. He mentions particulars; for, in 
 praying both for ourselves and for our friends, it is good to be 
 particular. <I>What wilt thou that I shall do for thee?</I> So says 
 Christ, when he holds out the golden sceptre. Though he knows our
 state and wants perfectly, he will know them from us. He recommends 
 himself to their prayers, with reference to three things:--

 (1.) The dangers which he was exposed to: <I>That I may be delivered
 from those that do not believe in Judea.</I> The unbelieving Jews were 
 the most violent enemies Paul had and most enraged against him, and 
 some prospect he had of trouble from them in this journey; and 
 therefore they must pray that God would deliver him. We may, and must, 
 pray against persecution. This prayer was answered in several 
 remarkable deliverances of Paul, recorded 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:1-24:27">Acts xxi., xxii., xxiii., and xxiv</A>.

 (2.) His services: <I>Pray that my service which I have for Jerusalem
 may be accepted of the saints.</I> Why, was there any danger that it 
 would not be accepted? Can money be otherwise than acceptable to the 
 poor? Yes, there was some ground of suspicion in this case; for Paul 
 was the apostle of the Gentiles, and as the unbelieving Jews looked 
 spitefully at him, which was their wickedness, so those that believed 
 were shy of him upon that account, which was their weakness. He does 
 not say, "Let them choose whether they will accept it or no; if they 
 will not, it shall be better bestowed;" but, "Pray that it may be 
 accepted." As God must be sought unto for the restraining of the ill 
 will of our enemies, so also for the preserving and increasing of the 
 good will of our friends; for God has the hearts both of the one and of 
 the other in his hands. 

 (3.) His journey to them. To engage their prayers for him, he interests 
 them in his concerns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>That I may come unto you with joy.</I> If his present journey to 
 Jerusalem proved unsuccessful, his intended journey to Rome would be 
 uncomfortable. If he should not do good, and prosper, in one visit, he 
 thought he should have small joy of the next: may <I>come with joy, by 
 the will of God.</I> All our joy depends upon the will of God. The 
 comfort of the creature is in every thing according to the disposal of 
 the Creator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is another prayer of the apostle for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Now the God of peace be with you all, Amen.</I> The Lord of hosts, 
 the God of battle, is the God of peace, the author and lover of peace. 
 He describes God under this title here, because of the divisions among 
 them, to recommend peace to them; if God be the God of peace, let us be 
 men of peace. The Old-Testament blessing was, <I>Peace be with you;</I> 
 now, <I>The god of peace be with you.</I> Those who have the fountain 
 cannot want any of the streams. <I>With you all;</I> both weak and 
 strong. To dispose them to a nearer union, he puts them altogether in 
 this prayer. Those who are united in the blessing of God should be 
 united in affection one to another.</P>
