 In this chapter the apostle pursues his former subject, the priesthood 
 of Christ. And, 

 I. He sums up what he had already said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He sets before them the necessary parts of the priestly office,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 And, 

 III. Largely illustrates the excellency of the priesthood of Christ,
 by considering the excellency of that new dispensation or covenant for 
 which Christ is the Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:6-13">ver. 6, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now of the things which we have spoken <I>this is</I> the sum: We
 have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
 throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
 &nbsp; 2  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle,
 which the Lord pitched, and not man.
 &nbsp; 3  For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and
 sacrifices: wherefore <I>it is</I> of necessity that this man have
 somewhat also to offer.
 &nbsp; 4  For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing
 that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
 &nbsp; 5  Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
 Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
 tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <I>that</I> thou make all things
 according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. A summary recital of what had been said before concerning 
 the excellency of Christ's priesthood, showing what we have in Christ, 
 where he now resides, and what sanctuary he is the minister of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. What we have in Christ; we have a high priest, and such a high 
 priest as no other people ever had, no age of the world, or of the 
 church, ever produced; all others were but types and shadows of this 
 high priest. He is adequately fitted and absolutely sufficient to all 
 the intents and purposes of a high priest, both with respect to the 
 honour of God and the happiness of men and himself; the great honour of 
 all those who have an interest in him. 

 2. Where he now resides: <I>He sits on the right hand of the throne of
 the Majesty on high,</I> that is, of the glorious God of heaven. There 
 the Mediator is placed, and he is possessed of all authority and power 
 both in heaven and upon earth. This is the reward of his humiliation.
 This authority he exercises for the glory of his Father, for his own 
 honour, and for the happiness of all who belong to him; and he will by 
 his almighty power bring every one of them in their own order to the 
 right hand of God in heaven, as members of his mystical body, that 
 where he is they may be also. 

 3. What is that sanctuary of which he is a minister: <I>Of the true
 tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The tabernacle which was pitched by man, according to the appointment 
 of God. There was an outer part, in which was the altar where they were 
 to offer their sacrifices, which typified Christ dying; and there was 
 an interior part within the veil, which typified Christ interceding for 
 the people in heaven. Now this tabernacle Christ never entered into; 
 but, having finished the work of satisfaction in the true tabernacle of 
 his own body, he is now a minister of the sanctuary, the holy of 
 holies, the true tabernacle in heaven, there taking care of his 
 people's affairs, interceding with God for them, that their sins may be 
 pardoned and their persons and services accepted, through the merit of 
 his sacrifice. He is not only in heaven enjoying great dominion and 
 dignity, but, as the high priest of his church, executing this office 
 for them all in general, and every member of the church in 
 particular.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle sets before the Hebrews the necessary parts of Christ's 
 priesthood, or what it was that belonged to that office, in conformity 
 to what every high priest is ordained to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 1. <I>Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices.</I> 
 Whatever was brought by the people to be presented to God, whether 
 expiatory sacrifices, or peace-offerings, or thank-offerings, must be 
 offered by the priest, who was to expiate their guilt by the blood of 
 the sacrifice, and perfume their gifts and services by his holy 
 incense, to render their persons and performances typically acceptable; 
 so then it necessarily belongs to the priesthood of Christ that he 
 should have somewhat to offer; and he, as the antitype, had himself to 
 offer, his human nature upon the altar of his divine nature, as the 
 great atoning sacrifice that finished transgression, and made an end of 
 sin once for all; and he has the incense of his own righteousness and 
 merits too to offer with all that his people offer up to God by him, to 
 render them acceptable. We must not dare to approach to God, or to 
 present any thing to him, but in and through Christ, depending upon his 
 merits and mediation; for if we are accepted, it is in the Beloved. 

 2. Christ must now execute his priesthood in heaven, in the holy of
 holies, the true tabernacle which the Lord hath fixed. Thus the type 
 must be fully answered; having finished the work of sacrificing here, 
 he must go into heaven, to present his righteousness and to make 
 intercession there. For,

 (1.) <I>If Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 that is, not according to the Levitical law, as not being of the line 
 of that priesthood; and so long as that priesthood continued there must 
 be a strict regard paid to the divine institution in everything.

 (2.) All the services of the priest, under the law, as well as every 
 thing in that tabernacle which was framed according to the pattern in 
 the mount, were only exemplars and shadows of heavenly things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Christ is the substance and end of the law for righteousness. Something 
 therefore there must be in Christ's priesthood that answers to the high 
 priest's entering within the veil to make intercession, without which 
 he could not have been a perfect priest; and what is this but the 
 ascension of Christ into heaven, and his appearance there in the sight 
 of God for his people, to present their prayers, and plead their cause?
 So that, if he had still continued on earth, he could not have been a 
 perfect priest; and an imperfect one he could not be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
 much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
 established upon better promises.
 &nbsp; 7  For if that first <I>covenant</I> had been faultless, then should
 no place have been sought for the second.
 &nbsp; 8  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
 saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of
 Israel and with the house of Judah:
 &nbsp; 9  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
 in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the
 land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I
 regarded them not, saith the Lord.
 &nbsp; 10  For this <I>is</I> the covenant that I will make with the house
 of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
 into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to
 them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
 &nbsp; 11  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every
 man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me,
 from the least to the greatest.
 &nbsp; 12  For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
 sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
 &nbsp; 13  In that he saith, A new <I>covenant,</I> he hath made the first
 old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old <I>is</I> ready to vanish
 away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the chapter, the apostle illustrates and confirms the 
 superior excellency of the priesthood of Christ above that of Aaron, 
 from the excellency of that covenant, or that dispensation of the 
 covenant of grace, of which Christ was the Mediator 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 his ministry is more excellent, by how much he is the Mediator of a 
 better covenant. The body and soul too of all divinity (as some 
 observe) consist very much in rightly distinguishing between the two 
 covenants--the covenant of works and the covenant of grace; and between 
 the two dispensations of the covenant of grace--that under the Old 
 Testament and that under the New. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is here said of the old covenant, or rather of the old 
 dispensation of the covenant of grace: of this it is said, 

 1. That it was made with the fathers of the Jewish nation at mount
 Sinai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 and Moses was the Mediator of that covenant, when God took them by the 
 hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt, which intimates the great 
 affection, condescension, and tender care of God towards them. 

 2. That this covenant was not found faultless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>);

 it was a dispensation of darkness and dread, tending to bondage, and 
 only a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; it was perfect in its kind, 
 and fitted to answer its end, but very imperfect in comparison of the 
 gospel. 

 3. That it was not sure or stedfast; <I>for the Jews continued not in
 that covenant, and the Lord regarded them not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They dealt ungratefully with their God, and cruelly with themselves, 
 and fell under God's displeasure. God will regard those who remain in 
 his covenant, but will reject those who cast away his yoke from them. 
 
 4. That it is decayed, grown old, and vanisheth away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is antiquated, canceled, out of date, of no more use in gospel times 
 than candles are when the sun has risen. Some think the covenant of 
 peculiarity did not quite decay till the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 though it was forfeited at the death of Christ, and was made old, and 
 was now to vanish and perish, and the Levitical priesthood vanished 
 with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is here said of the New-Testament dispensation, to prove the 
 superior excellency of Christ's ministry. It is said,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it is a better covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a more clear and comfortable dispensation and discovery of the grace of 
 God to sinners, bringing in holy light and liberty to the soul. It is 
 without fault, well ordered in all things. It requires nothing but what 
 it promises grace to perform. It accepts of godly sincerity, accounting 
 it gospel perfection. Every transgression does not turn us out of 
 covenant; all is put into a good and safe hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it is established upon better promises, more clear and express, 
 more spiritual, more absolute. The promises of spiritual and eternal 
 blessings are in this covenant positive and absolute; the promises of 
 temporal blessings are with a wise and kind proviso, as far as shall be 
 for God's glory and his people's good. This covenant contains in it 
 promises of assistance and acceptance in duty, promises of progress and 
 perseverance in grace and holiness, of bliss and glory in heaven, which 
 were more obscurely shadowed forth by the promises of the land of 
 Canaan, a type of heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is a new covenant, even that new covenant that God long ago 
 declared he would make with the house of Israel, that is, all the 
 Israel of God; this was promised in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:31,32">Jer. xxxi. 31, 32</A>,

 and accomplished in Christ. This will always be a new covenant, in
 which all who truly take hold of it shall be always found preserved by 
 the power of God. It is God's covenant; his mercy, love, and grace 
 moved for it; his wisdom devised it; his Son purchased it; his wisdom 
 devised it; his Son purchased it; his Spirit brings souls into it, and 
 builds them up in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The articles of this covenant are very extraordinary, which are 
 sealed between God and his people by baptism and the Lord's supper; 
 whereby they bind themselves to their part, and God assures them he 
 will do his part; and his is the main and principal part, on which his 
 people depend for grace and strength to do theirs. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God articles with his people <I>that he will put his laws into 
 their minds and write them in their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He once wrote his laws to them, now he will write his laws in them; 
 that is, he will give them understanding to know and to believe his 
 law; he will give them memories to retain them; he will give them 
 hearts to love them and consciences to recognize them; he will give 
 them courage to profess them and power to put them in practice; the 
 whole habit and frame of their souls shall be a table and transcript of 
 the law of God. This is the foundation of the covenant; and, when this 
 is laid, duty will be done wisely, sincerely, readily, easily, 
 resolutely, constantly, and comfortably.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He articles with them to take them into a near and very honourable 
 relation to himself. 

 [1.] He will be to them a God; that is, he will be all that to them, 
 and do all that for them, that God can be and do. Nothing more can be
 said in a thousand volumes than is comprehended in these few words: 
 <I>I will be a God to them.</I>

 [2.] They shall be to him a people, to love, honour, observe, and obey 
 him in all things; complying with his cautions, conforming to his 
 commands, comporting with his providences, copying out his example, 
 taking complacency in his favour. This those must do and will do who 
 have God for their God; this they are bound to do as their part of the 
 contract; this they shall do, for God will enable them to do it, as an 
 evidence that he is their God and that they are his people; for it is 
 God himself who first founds the relation, and then fills it up with 
 grace suitable and sufficient, and helps them in their measure to fill 
 it up with love and duty; so that God engages both for himself and 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He articles with them that they shall grow more and more 
 acquainted with their God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>They shall all know me from the least to the greatest,</I> insomuch 
 that there shall not be so much need of one neighbour teaching another 
 the knowledge of God. Here observe, 

 [1.] In the want of better instruction, one neighbour should be 
 teaching another to know the Lord, as they have ability and opportunity 
 for it.

 [2.] This private instruction shall not be so necessary under the New 
 Testament as it was under the Old. The old dispensation was shadowy, 
 dark, ritual, and less understood; their priests preached but seldom, 
 and but a few at a time, and the Spirit of God was more sparingly given 
 out. But under the new dispensation there shall be such abundance of 
 public qualified preachers of the gospel, and dispensers of ordinances 
 statedly in the solemn assemblies, and so great a flocking to them, as 
 doves to their windows, and such a plentiful effusion of the Spirit of 
 God to make the ministration of the gospel effectual, that there shall 
 be a mighty increase and spreading of Christian knowledge in persons of 
 all sorts, of each sex, and of all ages. O that this promise might be 
 fulfilled in our days, that the hand of God may be with his ministers, 
 that a great number may believe and be turned to the Lord!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) God articles with them about the pardon of their sins, as what 
 always accompanies the true knowledge of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,</I> &c. Observe,

 [1.] The freeness of this pardon. It does not result from merit in man, 
 but from mercy in God; he pardons for his own name's sake. 

 [2.] The fullness of this pardon; it extends to their unrighteousness,
 sins, and iniquities; to all kinds of sin, to sins highly aggravated.

 [3.] The fixedness of this pardon. It is so final and so fixed that God
 will remember their sins no more; he will not recall his pardon; he 
 will not only forgive their sins, but forget them, treat them as if he 
 had forgotten them. This pardoning mercy is connected with all other 
 spiritual mercies. Unpardoned sin prevents mercy, and pulls down
 judgments; but the pardon of sin prevents judgment, and opens a wide 
 door to all spiritual blessings; it is the effect of that mercy that is 
 from everlasting, and the earnest of that mercy that shall be to 
 everlasting. This is the excellency of the new dispensation, and these 
 are the articles of it; and therefore we have no reason to repine, but 
 great reason to rejoice that the former dispensation is antiquated and 
 has vanished away.</P>
