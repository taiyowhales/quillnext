 In this chapter the apostle, 

 I. Blames the Corinthians for their carnality and divisions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He instructs them how what was amiss among them might be rectified,
 by remembering, 

 1. That their ministers were no more than ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:5">ver. 5</A>.

 2. That they were unanimous, and carried on the same design, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.
 
 3. That they built on one and the same foundation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 III. He exhorts them to give due honour to their bodies, by keeping
 them pure 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 and to humility and self-diffidence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>.
 
 IV. And dehorts them from glorying in particular ministers, because of 
 the equal interest they had in all,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
 but as unto carnal, <I>even</I> as unto babes in Christ.
 &nbsp; 2  I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye
 were not able <I>to bear it,</I> neither yet now are ye able.
 &nbsp; 3  For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <I>there is</I> among you
 envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk
 as men?
 &nbsp; 4  For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <I>am</I> of
 Apollos; are ye not carnal?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Paul blames the Corinthians for their weakness and nonproficiency. 
 Those who are sanctified are so only in part: there is still room for 
 growth and increase both in grace and knowledge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18">2 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 Those who through divine grace are renewed to a spiritual life may yet
 in many things be defective. The apostle tells <I>them he could not 
 speak to them as unto spiritual</I> men, <I>but as unto carnal</I> men, 
 <I>as to babes in Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They were so far from forming their maxims and measures upon the ground
 of divine revelation, and entering into the spirit of the gospel, that 
 is was but too evident they were much under the command of carnal and 
 corrupt affections. They were still mere babes in Christ. They had 
 received some of the first principles of Christianity, but had not 
 grown up to maturity of understanding in them, or of faith and 
 holiness; and yet it is plain, from several passages in this epistle, 
 that the Corinthians were very proud of their wisdom and knowledge. 
 Note, It is but too common for persons of very moderate knowledge and 
 understanding to have a great measure of self-conceit. The apostle 
 assigns their little proficiency in the knowledge of Christianity as a 
 reason why he had communicated no more of the deep things of it to 
 them. They could not bear such food, they needed to be fed with milk, 
 not with meat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, It is the duty of a faithful minister of Christ to consult the
 capacities of his hearers and teach them as they can bear. And yet it 
 is natural for babes to grow up to men; and babes in Christ should 
 endeavour to grow in Stature, and become men in Christ. It is expected 
 that their advances in knowledge should be in proportion to their means 
 and opportunities, and their time of professing religion, that they may 
 be able to bear discourses on the mysteries of our religion, and not 
 always rest in plain things. It was a reproach to the Corinthians that 
 they had so long sat under the ministry of Paul and had made no more 
 improvement in Christian knowledge. Note, Christians are utterly to
 blame who do not endeavour to grow in grace and knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He blames them for their carnality, and mentions their contention 
 and discord about their ministers as evidence of it: <I>For you are yet 
 carnal; for whereas there are among you envyings, and strifes, and 
 divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had mutual emulations, and quarrels, and factions among them, upon
 the account of their ministers, <I>while one said, I am of Paul; and 
 another, I am of Apollos,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 These were proofs of their being carnal, that fleshly interests and
 affections too much swayed them. Note, Contentions and quarrels about
 religion are sad evidences of remaining carnality. True religion makes 
 men peaceable and not contentious. Factious spirits act upon human 
 principles, not upon principles of true religion; they are guided by 
 their own pride and passions, and not by the rules of Christianity: 
 <I>Do you not walk as men?</I> Note, It is to be lamented that many who 
 should walk as Christians, that is, above the common rate of men, do 
 indeed walk as men, live and act too much like other men.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Who then is Paul, and who <I>is</I> Apollos, but ministers by whom
 ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
 &nbsp; 6  I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
 &nbsp; 7  So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he
 that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
 &nbsp; 8  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
 man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
 &nbsp; 9  For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's
 husbandry, <I>ye are</I> God's building.
 &nbsp; 10  According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a
 wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another
 buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth
 thereupon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle instructs them how to cure this humour, and rectify 
 what was amiss among them upon this head,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By reminding them that the ministers about whom they contended were 
 but ministers: <I>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers 
 by whom you believed? Even as the Lord gave to every man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 They are but ministers, mere instruments used by the God of all grace.
 Some of the factious people in Corinth seem to have made more of them, 
 as if they were lords of their faith, authors of their religion. Note, 
 We should take care not to deify ministers, nor put them into the place 
 of God. Apostles were not the authors of our faith and religion,
 though they were authorized and qualified to reveal and propagate it. 
 They acted in this office as God gave to every man. Observe, All the 
 gifts and powers that even apostles discovered and exerted in the work 
 of the ministry were from God. They were intended to manifest their 
 mission and doctrine to be divine. It was perfectly wrong, upon their 
 account, to transfer that regard to the apostles which was solely to be 
 paid to the divine authority by which they acted, and to God, from whom 
 they had their authority. <I>Paul had planted and Apollos had 
 watered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Both were useful, one for one purpose, the other for another. Note, God
 makes use of variety of instruments, and fits them to their several 
 uses and intentions. Paul was fitted for planting work, and Apollos for 
 watering work, but God gave the increase. Note, The success of the 
 ministry must be derived from the divine blessing: <I>Neither he that 
 planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth, but God who giveth the 
 increase,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Even apostolical ministers are nothing of themselves, can do nothing
 with efficacy and success unless God give the increase. Note, The best 
 qualified and most faithful ministers have a just sense of their own 
 insufficiency, and are very desirous that God should have all the glory 
 of their success. Paul and Apollos are nothing at all in their own 
 account, but God is all in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By representing to them the unanimity of Christ's ministers: <I>He 
 that planteth and he that watereth are one</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 employed by one Master, entrusted with the same revelation, busied in 
 one work, and engaged in one design--in harmony with one another, 
 however they may be set in opposition to each other by factious 
 party-makers. They have their different gifts from one and the same 
 Spirit, for the very same purposes; and they heartily carry on the same 
 design. Planters and waterers are but fellow-labourers in the same 
 work. Note, All the faithful ministers of Christ are one in the great 
 business and intention of their ministry. They may have differences of 
 sentiment in minor things; they may have their debates and contests; 
 but they heartily concur in the great design of honouring God and 
 saving souls, by promoting true Christianity in the world. All such may 
 expect a glorious recompence of their fidelity, and in proportion to 
 it: <I>Every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own 
 labour.</I> Their business is one, but some may mind it more than 
 others: their end or design is one, but some may pursue it more closely 
 than others: their Master also is one, and yet this good and gracious 
 Master may make a difference in the rewards he gives, according to the 
 different service they do: <I>Every one's own work shall have its own 
 reward.</I> Those that work hardest shall fare best. Those that are 
 most faithful shall have the greatest reward; and glorious work it is 
 in which all faithful ministers are employed. <I>They are labourers 
 with God,</I> <B><I>synergoi</I></B>--<I>co-workers, 
 fellow-labourers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not indeed in the same order and degree, but in subordination to him, 
 as instruments in his hand. They are engaged in his business. They are 
 working together with God, in promoting the purposes of his glory, and 
 the salvation of precious souls; and he who knows their work will take 
 care they do not labour in vain. Men may neglect and vilify one 
 minister while they cry up another, and have no reason for either: they 
 may condemn when they should commend, and applaud what they should 
 neglect and avoid; but the judgment of God is according to truth. He 
 never rewards but upon just reason, and he ever rewards in proportion 
 to the diligence and faithfulness of his servants. Note, Faithful 
 ministers, when they are ill used by men, should encourage themselves 
 in God. And it is to God, the chief agent and director of the great 
 work of the gospel, to whom those that labour with him should endeavour 
 to approve themselves. They are always under his eye, employed in his 
 husbandry and building; and therefore, to be sure, he will carefully 
 look over them: "<I>You are God's husbandry, you are God's 
 building;</I> and therefore are neither of Paul nor of Apollos; neither 
 belong to one nor the other, but to God: they only plant and water you, 
 but it is the divine blessing on his own husbandry that alone can make 
 it yield fruit. You are not our husbandry, but God's. We work under 
 him, and with him, and for him. It is all for God that we have been 
 doing among you. You are God's husbandry and building." He had employed 
 the former metaphor before, and now he goes on to the other of a 
 building: <I>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a 
 wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth 
 thereon.</I> Paul here calls himself a wise master-builder, a character 
 doubly reflecting honour on him. It was honourable to be a 
 master-builder in the edifice of God; but it added to his character to 
 be a wise one. Persons may be in an office for which they are not 
 qualified, or not so thoroughly qualified as this expression implies 
 Paul was. But, though he gives himself such a character, it is not to 
 gratify his own pride, but to magnify divine grace. He was a wise 
 master-builder, but the grace of God made him such. Note, It is no 
 crime in a Christian, but much to his commendation, to take notice of 
 the good that is in him, to the praise of divine grace. Spiritual
 pride is abominable: it is making use of the greatest favours of God to 
 feed our own vanity, and make idols of ourselves. But to take notice of 
 the favours of God to promote our gratitude to him, and to speak of 
 them to his honour (be they of what sort they will), is but a proper 
 expression of the duty and regard we own him. Note, Ministers should 
 not be proud of their gifts or graces; but the better qualified they 
 are for their work, and the more success they have in it, the more 
 thankful should they be to God for his distinguishing goodness: <I>I 
 have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.</I> As before 
 he had said, <I>I have planted, Apollos watered.</I> It was Paul that 
 laid the foundation of a church among them. He had <I>begotten them 
 through the gospel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:15"><I>ch.</I> iv. 15</A>.
 
 Whatever instructors they had besides, <I>they had not many
 fathers.</I> He would derogate from none that had done service among 
 them, nor would he be robbed of his own honour and respect. Note, 
 Faithful ministers may and ought to have a concern for their own 
 reputation. Their usefulness depends much upon it. <I>But let every man 
 take heed how he buildeth thereon.</I> This is a proper caution; there 
 may be very indifferent building on a good foundation. It is easy to 
 err here; and great care should be used, not only to lay a sure and 
 right foundation, but to erect a regular building upon it. Nothing must 
 be laid upon it but what the foundation will bear, and what is of a 
 piece with it. Gold and dirt must not be mingled together. Note, 
 Ministers of Christ should take great care that they do not build their 
 own fancies or false reasonings on the foundation of divine revelation. 
 What they preach should be the plain doctrine of their Master, or what 
 is perfectly agreeable with it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
 is Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 12  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,
 precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
 &nbsp; 13  Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall
 declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire
 shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
 &nbsp; 14  If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he
 shall receive a reward.
 &nbsp; 15  If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but
 he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle informs us what foundation he had laid at the bottom 
 of all his labours among them--<I>even Jesus Christ, the chief
 corner-stone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20">Eph. ii. 20</A>.

 Upon this foundation all the faithful ministers of Christ build. Upon
 this rock all the Christians found their hopes. Those that build their 
 hopes of heaven on any other foundation build upon the sand. <I>Other 
 foundation can no man lay besides what is laid--even Jesus Christ.</I> 
 Note, The doctrine of our Saviour and his mediation is the principal 
 doctrine of Christianity. It lies at the bottom, and is the foundation, 
 of all the rest. Leave out this, and you lay waste all our comforts, 
 and leave no foundation for our hopes as sinners. It is in Christ 
 <I>only that God is reconciling a sinful world to himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:19">2 Cor. v. 19</A>.

 But of those that hold the foundation, and embrace the general doctrine
 of Christ's being the mediator between God and man, there are two 
 sorts:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Some build upon this foundation <I>gold, silver, and precious 
 stones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 namely, those who receive and propagate the pure truths of the gospel, 
 who hold nothing but the <I>truth as it is in Jesus,</I> and preach 
 nothing else. This is building well upon a good foundation, making all 
 of apiece, when ministers not only depend upon Christ as the great 
 prophet of the church, and take him for their guide and infallible 
 teacher, but receive and spread the doctrines he taught, in their 
 purity, with out any corrupt mixtures, without adding or 
 diminishing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Others <I>build wood, hay, and stubble,</I> on this foundation; 
 that is, though they adhere to the foundation, they depart from the 
 mind of Christ in many particulars, substitute their own fancies and 
 inventions in the room of his doctrines and institutions, and build 
 upon the good foundation what will not abide the test when the day of 
 trial shall come, and the fire must make it manifest, as wood, hay, and 
 stubble, will not bear the trial by fire, but must be consumed in it. 
 There is a time coming when a discovery will be made of what men have 
 built on this foundation: <I>Every man's work shall be made 
 manifest,</I> shall be laid open to view, to his own view and that of 
 others. Some may, in the simplicity of their hearts, build wood and 
 stubble on the good foundation, and know not, all the while, what they 
 have been doing; but in the day of the Lord their own conduct shall 
 appear to them in its proper light. Every man's work shall be made 
 manifest to himself, and made manifest to others, both those that have 
 been misled by him and those that have escaped his errors. Now we may 
 be mistaken in ourselves and others; but there is a day coming that 
 will cure all our mistakes, and show us ourselves, and show us our 
 actions in the true light, without covering or disguise: <I>For the day 
 shall declare it</I> (that is, every man's work), <I>because it shall 
 be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what 
 sort it is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The day shall declare and make it manifest, the last day, the great day
 of trial; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5</A>.

 Though some understand it of the time when the Jewish nation was
 destroyed and their constitution thereby abolished, when the 
 superstructure which judaizing teachers would have raised on the 
 Christian foundation was manifested to be no better than hay and 
 stubble, that would not bear the trial. The expression carries in it a
 plain allusion to the refiner's art, in which the fire separates and 
 distinguishes the dross from the gold and silver; as it also will 
 silver and gold and precious stones, that will endure the fire, from 
 wood and hay and stubble, that will be consumed in it. Note, There is a 
 day coming that will as nicely distinguish one man from another, and 
 one man's work from another's, as the fire distinguishes gold from 
 dross, or metal that will bear the fire from other materials that will 
 be consumed in it. In that day, 

 1. Some men's works will <I>abide the trial</I>--will be found
 standard. It will appear that they not only held the foundation, but 
 that they built regularly and well upon it--that they laid on proper 
 materials, and in due form and order. The foundation and the 
 superstructure were all of a piece. The foundation-truths, and those 
 that had a manifest connection with them, were taught together. It may
 not be so easy to discern this connection now, nor know what works will 
 abide the trial then; but that day will make a full discovery. And such 
 a builder shall not, cannot fail of a reward. He will have praise and 
 honour in that day, and eternal recompence after it. Note, Fidelity in 
 the ministers of Christ will meet with a full and ample reward in a 
 future life. Those who spread true and pure religion in all the 
 branches of it, and whose work will abide in the great day, shall 
 receive a reward. And, Lord, how great! how much exceeding their
 deserts! 
 
 2. There are others <I>whose works shall be burnt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 whose corrupt opinions and doctrines, or vain inventions and usages in 
 the worship of God, shall be discovered, disowned, and rejected, in 
 that day--shall be first manifested to be corrupt, and then disapproved 
 of God and rejected. Note, The great day will pluck off all disguises,
 and make things appear as they are: <I>He whose work shall be burnt 
 will suffer loss.</I> If he have built upon the right foundation wood 
 and hay and stubble, he will suffer loss. His weakness and corruption 
 will be the lessening of his glory, though he may in the general have 
 been an honest and an upright Christian. This part of his work will be 
 lost, turning no way to his advantage, though he himself may be saved.
 Observe, Those who hold the foundation of Christianity, though they 
 build hay, wood, and stubble, upon it, may be saved. This may help to 
 enlarge our charity. We should not reprobate men for their weakness: 
 for nothing will damn men but wickedness. He shall be saved, <I>yet so 
 as by fire,</I> saved out of the fire. He himself shall be snatched out 
 of that flame which will consume his work. This intimates that it will 
 be difficult for those that corrupt and deprave Christianity to be 
 saved. God will have no mercy on their works, though he may pluck them 
 as brands out of the burning. On this passage of scripture the papists 
 found their doctrine of purgatory, which is certainly hay and stubble: 
 a doctrine never originally fetched from scripture, but invented in 
 barbarous ages, to feed the avarice and ambition of the clergy, at the 
 cost of those who would rather part with their money than their lusts, 
 for the salvation of their souls. It can have no countenance from this 
 text, 

 (1.) Because this is plainly meant of a figurative fire, not of a real 
 one: for what real fire can consume religious rites or doctrines?

 (2.) Because this fire is to <I>try men's works, of what sort they 
 are;</I> but purgatory-fire is not for trial, not to bring men's 
 actions to the test, but to punish for them. They are supposed to be
 venial sins, not satisfied for in this life, for which satisfaction 
 must be made by suffering the fire of purgatory.

 (3.) Because this fire is to <I>try every man's works,</I> those of
 Paul and Apollos, as well as those of others. Now, no papists will have
 the front to say apostles must have passed through purgatory fires.</P>

 is in the original in both clauses); <I>for the temple of God is holy, 
 which temple you are.</I> It looks from other parts of the epistle, 
 where the apostle argues to the very same purport (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13-20"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13-20</A>),

 as if the false teachers among the Corinthians were not only loose
 livers, but taught licentious doctrines, and what was particularly 
 fitted to the taste of this lewd city, on the head of fornication. Such 
 doctrine was not to be reckoned among hay and stubble, which would be 
 consumed while the person who laid them on the foundation escaped the 
 burning; for it tended to corrupt, to pollute, and destroy the church, 
 which was a building erected for God, and consecrated to him, and 
 therefore should be kept pure and holy. Those who spread principles of 
 this sort would provoke God to destroy them. Note, Those who spread 
 loose principles, that have a direct tendency to pollute the church of 
 God, and render it unholy and unclean, are likely to bring destruction 
 on themselves. It may be understood also as an argument against their 
 discord and factious strifes, division being the way to destruction. 
 But what I have been mentioning seems to be the proper meaning of the 
 passage: <I>Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the 
 Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</I> It may be understood of the church 
 of Corinth collectively, or of every single believer among them; 
 Christian churches are temples of God. He dwells among them by his Holy 
 Spirit. <I>They are built together for a habitation of God through the
 Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:22">Eph. ii. 22</A>.

 Every Christian is a living temple of the living God. God dwelt in the
 Jewish temple, took possession of it, and resided in it, by that 
 glorious cloud that was the token of his presence with that people. So 
 Christ by his Spirit dwells in all true believers. The temple was 
 devoted and consecrated to God, and set apart from every common to a 
 holy use, to the immediate service of God. So all Christians are 
 separated from common uses, and set apart for God and his service. They 
 are sacred to him--a very good argument this against all fleshly lusts, 
 and all doctrines that give countenance to them. If we are the temples 
 of God, we must do nothing that shall alienate ourselves from him, or 
 corrupt and pollute ourselves, and thereby unfit ourselves for his use; 
 and we must hearken to no doctrine nor doctor that would seduce us to 
 any such practices. Note, Christians are holy by profession, and should 
 be pure and clean both in heart and conversation. We should heartily 
 abhor, and carefully avoid, what will defile God's temple, and 
 prostitute what ought to be sacred to him.</P>

 Here he prescribes humility, and a modest opinion of themselves, for 
 the remedy of the irregularities in the church of Corinth, the 
 divisions and contests among them: "<I>Let no man deceive himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Do not be led away from the truth and simplicity of the gospel by
 pretenders to science and eloquence, by a show of deep learning, or a 
 flourish of words, by rabbis, orators, or philosophers." Note, We are 
 in great danger of deceiving ourselves when we have too high an opinion 
 of human wisdom and arts; plain and pure Christianity will be likely to 
 be despised by those who can suit their doctrines to the corrupt taste 
 of their hearers, and set them off with fine language, or support them 
 with a show of deep and strong reasoning. But <I>he who seems to be 
 wise must become a fool that he may be wise.</I> He must be sensible of 
 his own ignorance, and lament it; he must distrust his own 
 understanding, and not lean on it. To have a high opinion of our wisdom 
 is but to flatter ourselves, and self-flattery is the very next step to 
 self-deceit. The way to true wisdom is to sink our opinion of our own 
 to a due level, and be willing to be taught of God. He must become a 
 fool who would be truly and thoroughly wise. The person who resigns his 
 own understanding, that he may follow the instruction of God, is in the 
 way to true and everlasting wisdom. <I>The meek will he guide in 
 judgment, the meek will he teach his way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:9">Ps. xxv. 9</A>.

 He that has a low opinion of his own knowledge and powers will submit
 to better information; such a person may be informed and improved by 
 revelation: but the proud man, conceited of his own wisdom and 
 understanding, will undertake to correct even divine wisdom itself, and 
 prefer his own shallow reasonings to the revelations of infallible 
 truth and wisdom. Note, We must abase ourselves before God if we would
 be either truly wise or good: <I>For the wisdom of this world is 
 foolishness with God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The wisdom which worldly men esteem (policy, philosophy, oratory) <I>is
 foolishness with God.</I> It is so in a way of comparison with his 
 wisdom. <I>He chargeth his angels with folly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18">Job iv. 18</A>),

 and much more the wisest among the children of men. <I>His 
 understanding is infinite,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:5">Ps. cxlvii. 5</A>.

 There can be no more comparison between his wisdom and ours than 
 between his power and being and ours. There is no common measure by 
 which to compare finite and infinite. And much more is the wisdom of 
 man foolishness with God when set in competition with his. How justly 
 does he despise, how easily can he baffle and confound it! <I>He taketh 
 the wise in their own craftiness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:13">Job v. 13</A>),

 he catches them in their own nets, and entangles them in their own 
 snares: he turns their most studies, plausible, and promising schemes 
 against themselves, and ruins them by their own contrivance. Nay, <I>He 
 knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 that they are vanity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:11">Ps. xciv. 11</A>.

 Note, God has a perfect knowledge of the thoughts of men, the deepest 
 thoughts of the wisest men, their most secret counsels and purposes: 
 nothing is hidden from him, but <I>all things are naked and bare</I> 
 before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13">Heb. iv. 13</A>.

 And he knows them to be vanity. The thoughts of the wisest men in the
 world have a great mixture of vanity, of weakness and folly, in them; 
 and before God their wisest and best thoughts are very vanity, 
 compared, I mean, with his thoughts of things. And should not all this 
 teach us modesty, diffidence in ourselves, and a deference to the 
 wisdom of God, make us thankful for his revelations, and willing to be 
 taught of God, and not be led away by specious pretences to human 
 wisdom and skill, from the simplicity of Christ, or a regard to his 
 heavenly doctrine? Note, He who would be wise indeed must learn of God, 
 and not set his own wisdom up in competition with God's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle founds an exhortation against over-valuing their
 teachers on what he had just said, and on the consideration that they
 had an equal interest in all their ministers: <I>Therefore let no man
 glory in men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)--

 forget that their ministers are men, or pay that deference to them that 
 is due only to God, set them at the head of parties, have them in 
 immoderate esteem and admiration, and servilely and implicitly follow 
 their directions and submit to their dictates, and especially in 
 contradiction to God and the truths taught by his Holy Spirit. Mankind 
 are very apt to make the mercies of God cross their intentions. The 
 ministry is a very useful and very gracious institution, and faithful 
 ministers are a great blessing to any people; yet the folly and 
 weakness of people may do much mischief by what is in itself a 
 blessing. They may fall into factions, side with particular ministers, 
 and set them at their head, glory in their leaders, and be carried by 
 them they know not whither. The only way to avoid this mischief is to 
 have a modest opinion of ourselves, a due sense of the common weakness 
 of human understanding, and an entire deference to the wisdom of God 
 speaking in his word. Ministers are not to be set up in competition 
 with one another. All faithful ministers are serving one Lord and 
 pursuing one purpose. They were appointed of Christ, for the common 
 benefit of the church: "<I>Paul, and Apollos, and Cephas, are all 
 yours.</I> One is not to be set up against another, but all are to be 
 valued and used for your own spiritual benefit." Upon this occasion 
 also he gives in an inventory of the church's possessions, the 
 spiritual riches of a true believer: "<I>All is yours</I>--ministers of 
 all ranks, ordinary and extraordinary. Nay the world itself is yours." 
 Not that saints are proprietors of the world, but it stands for their 
 sake, they have as much of it as Infinite Wisdom sees to be fit for 
 them, and they have all they have with the divine blessing. "<I>Life is 
 yours,</I> that you may have season and opportunity to prepare for the 
 life of heaven; and <I>death is yours,</I> that you may go to the 
 possession of it. It is the kind messenger that will fetch you to your 
 Father's house. <I>Things present</I> are yours, for your support on 
 the road; <I>things to come</I> are yours, to enrich and regale you for 
 ever at your journey's end." Note, If we belong to Christ, and are true 
 to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. All is ours, time 
 and eternity, earth and heaven, life and death. <I>We shall want no 
 good thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11">Ps. lxxxiv. 11</A>.

 But it must be remembered, at the same time, <I>that we are
 Christ's,</I> the subjects of his kingdom, his property. He is Lord
 over us, and we must own his dominion, and cheerfully submit to his 
 command and yield themselves to his pleasure, if we would have all 
 things minister to our advantage. All things are ours, upon no other 
 ground than our being Christ's. Out of him we are without just title or 
 claim to any thing that is good. Note, Those that would be safe for 
 time, and happy to eternity, must be Christ's. <I>And Christ is 
 God's.</I> He is the Christ of God, anointed of God, and commissioned 
 by him, to bear the office of a Mediator, and to act therein for the 
 purposes of his glory. Note, All things are the believer's, that Christ 
 might have honour in his great undertaking, and God in all might have 
 the glory. God in Christ reconciling a sinful world to himself, and 
 shedding abroad the riches of his grace on a reconciled world, is the 
 sum and substance of the gospel.</P>
