 We had several important exhortations in the close of the foregoing
 chapter, and they are continued in this: particularly,

 I. We have here an exhortation to mutual love and charity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Against all manner of uncleanness, with proper arguments and
 remedies proposed against such sins: and some further cautions are
 added, and other duties recommended,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:3-20">ver. 3-20</A>.

 III. The apostle directs to the conscientious discharge of relative
 duties, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:21-6:1-9">from ver. 21</A>,

 throughout this, and in the beginning of the next chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the exhortation to mutual love, or to Christian charity. 
 The apostle had been insisting on this in the former chapter, and 
 particularly in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:17-32">last verses</A>

 of it, to which the particle <I>therefore</I> refers, and connects what
 he had said there with what is contained in these verses, thus: 
 "Because God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you, therefore be you 
 followers of God, or <I>imitators</I> of him;" for so the word 
 signifies. Pious persons should imitate the God whom they worship, as 
 far as he has revealed himself as imitable by them. They must conform 
 themselves to his example, and have his image renewed upon them. This 
 puts a great honour upon practical religion, that it is the imitating 
 of God. We must be holy as God is holy, merciful as he is merciful, 
 perfect as he is perfect. But there is no one attribute of God more 
 recommended to our imitation than that of his goodness. Be you 
 imitators of God, or resemble him, in every grace, and especially in 
 his love, and in his pardoning goodness. God <I>is love; and those that 
 dwell in love dwell in God and God in them.</I> Thus he has proclaimed 
 his name, <I>Gracious and merciful, and abundant in goodness. As dear 
 children,</I> as children (who are wont to be greatly beloved by their 
 parents) usually resemble them in the lineaments and features of their 
 faces, and in the dispositions and qualities of their minds; or as 
 becomes the children of God, who are beloved and cherished by their 
 heavenly Father. Children are obliged to imitate their parents in what 
 is good, especially when dearly beloved by them. The character that we 
 bear of God's children obliges us to resemble him, especially in his 
 love and goodness, in his mercy and readiness to forgive. And those 
 only are God's dear children who imitate him in these. It follows, 
 <I>And walk in love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This godlike grace should conduct and influence our whole conversation, 
 which is meant by walking in it. It should be the principle from which 
 we act; it should direct the ends at which we aim. We should be more 
 careful to give proof of the sincerity of our love one to another. 
 <I>As Christ also hath loved us.</I> Here the apostle directs us to the 
 example of Christ, whom Christians are obliged to imitate, and in whom 
 we have an instance of the most free and generous love that ever was, 
 that great love wherewith he hath loved us. We are all joint sharers in 
 that love, and partakers of the comfort of it, and therefore should 
 love one another, Christ having loved us all and given such proof of 
 his love to us; for <I>he hath given himself for us.</I> The apostle 
 designedly enlarges on the subject; for what can yield us more 
 delightful matter for contemplation than this? Christ gave himself to 
 die for us; and the death of Christ was the great sacrifice of 
 atonement: <I>An offering and a sacrifice to God;</I> or an offering, 
 even a sacrifice--a propitiatory sacrifice, to expiate our guilt, which 
 had been prefigured in the legal oblations and sacrifices; and this 
 <I>for a sweet-smelling savour.</I> Some observe that the sin-offerings 
 were never said to be of a sweet-smelling savour; but this is said of 
 <I>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</I> As he 
 offered himself with a design to be accepted of God, so God did accept, 
 was pleased with, and appeased by, that sacrifice. Note, As the 
 sacrifice of Christ was efficacious with God, so his example should be 
 prevailing with us, and we should carefully copy after it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it
 not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
 &nbsp; 4  Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which
 are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
 &nbsp; 5  For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person,
 nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the
 kingdom of Christ and of God.
 &nbsp; 6  Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
 things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
 &nbsp; 7  Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
 &nbsp; 8  For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <I>are ye</I> light in the
 Lord: walk as children of light:
 &nbsp; 9  (For the fruit of the Spirit <I>is</I> in all goodness and
 righteousness and truth;)
 &nbsp; 10  Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
 &nbsp; 11  And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
 darkness, but rather reprove <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are
 done of them in secret.
 &nbsp; 13  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
 light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
 &nbsp; 14  Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
 the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
 &nbsp; 15  See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
 wise,
 &nbsp; 16  Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
 &nbsp; 17  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will
 of the Lord <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 18  And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
 with the Spirit;
 &nbsp; 19  Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual
 songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
 &nbsp; 20  Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father
 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses contain a caution against all manner of uncleanness, with 
 proper remedies and arguments proposed: some further cautions are 
 added, and other duties recommended. Filthy lusts must be suppressed, 
 in order to the supporting of holy love. <I>Walk in love,</I> and
 <I>shun fornication and all uncleanness. Fornication</I> is folly 
 committed between unmarried persons. <I>All uncleanness</I> includes 
 all other sorts of filthy lusts, which were too common among the 
 Gentiles. Or <I>covetousness,</I> which being thus connected, and 
 mentioned as a thing which should not be <I>once named,</I> some 
 understand it, in the chaste style of the scripture, of unnatural lust; 
 while others take it in the more common sense, for an immoderate desire 
 of gain or an insatiable love of riches, which is spiritual adultery; 
 for by this the soul, which was espoused to God, goes astray from him, 
 and embraces the bosom of a stranger, and therefore carnal worldlings 
 are called adulterers: <I>You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not 
 that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?</I> Now these sins 
 must be dreaded and detested in the highest degree: <I>Let it not be 
 once named among you,</I> never in a way of approbation nor without 
 abhorrence, <I>as becometh saints,</I> holy persons, who are separated 
 from the world, and dedicated unto God. The apostle not only cautions 
 against the gross acts of sin, but against what some may be apt to make 
 light of, and think to be excusable. <I>Neither filthiness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 by which may be understood all wanton and unseemly gestures and 
 behaviour; <I>nor foolish talking,</I> obscene and lewd discourse, or, 
 more generally, such vain discourse as betrays much folly and 
 indiscretion, and is far from edifying the hearers; <I>nor jesting.</I> 
 The Greek word <B><I>eutrapelia</I></B> is the same which Aristotle, in 
 his Ethics, makes a virtue: pleasantness of conversation. And there is 
 no doubt an innocent and inoffensive jesting, which we cannot suppose 
 the apostle here forbids. Some understand him of such scurrilous and 
 abusive reflections as tend to expose others and to make them appear 
 ridiculous. This is bad enough: but the context seems to restrain it to 
 such pleasantry of discourse as is filthy and obscene, which he may 
 also design by that <I>corrupt,</I> or putrid and rotten, communication 
 that he speaks of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:29"><I>ch.</I> iv. 29</A>.

 Of these things he says, <I>They are not convenient.</I> Indeed there
 is more than inconvenience, even a great deal of mischief, in them. 
 They are so far from being profitable that they pollute and poison the 
 hearers. But the meaning is, Those things do not become Christians, and 
 are very unsuitable to their profession and character. Christians are 
 allowed to be cheerful and pleasant; but they must be merry and wise. 
 The apostle adds, <I>But rather giving of thanks:</I> so far let the 
 Christian's way of mirth be from that of obscene and profane wit, that 
 he may delight his mind, and make himself cheerful, by a grateful 
 remembrance of God's goodness and mercy to him, and by blessing and 
 praising him on account of these. Note, 

 1. We should take all occasions to render thanksgivings and praises to
 God for his kindness and favours to us. 

 2. A reflection on the grace and goodness of God to us, with a design
 to excite our thankfulness to him, is proper to refresh and delight the 
 Christian's mind, and to make him cheerful. Dr. Hammond thinks that 
 <B><I>eucharistia</I></B> may signify gracious, pious, religious 
 discourse in general, by way of opposition to what the apostle 
 condemns. Our cheerfulness, instead of breaking out into what is vain 
 and sinful, and a profanation of God's name, should express itself as 
 becomes Christians, and in what may tend to his glory. If men abounded 
 more in good and pious expressions, they would not be so apt to utter 
 ill and unbecoming words; for shall <I>blessing</I> and <I>cursing,</I> 
 lewdness and thanksgivings, <I>proceed out of the same mouth?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To fortify us against the sins of uncleanness, &c., the apostle 
 urges several arguments, and prescribes several remedies, in what 
 follows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He urges several arguments, As, 

 (1.) Consider that these are sins which shut persons out of heaven: 
 <I>For this you know,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They knew it, being informed of it by the Christian religion. By <I>a 
 covetous man</I> some understand a lewd lascivious libertine, who 
 indulges himself in those vile lusts which were accounted the certain 
 marks of a heathen and an idolater. Others understand it in the common
 acceptation of the word; and such a man is an idolater because there is 
 spiritual idolatry in the love of this world. As the epicure makes a 
 god of his belly, so the covetous man makes a god of his money, sets 
 those affectations upon it, and places that hope, confidence, and 
 delight, in worldly good, which should be reserved for God only. He 
 serves mammon instead of God. Of these persons it is said that they 
 <I>have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God;</I> that 
 is, the kingdom of Christ, who is God, or the kingdom which is God's by 
 nature, and Christ's as he is Mediator, the kingdom which Christ has 
 purchased and which God bestows. Heaven is here described as a kingdom
 (as frequently elsewhere) with respect to its eminency and glory, its 
 fulness and sufficiency, &c. In this kingdom the saints and servants of 
 God have an inheritance; for it is the <I>inheritance of the saints in 
 light.</I> But those who are impenitent, and allow themselves either in 
 the lusts of the flesh or the love of the world, are not Christians 
 indeed, and so belong not to the kingdom of grace, nor shall they ever 
 come to the kingdom of glory. Let us then be excited to be on our
 guard against those sins which would exclude and shut us out of heaven.

 (2.) These sins bring the wrath of God upon those who are guilty of 
 them: "<I>Let no man deceive you with vain words,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let none flatter you, as though such things were tolerable and to be 
 allowed of in Christians, or as though they were not very provoking and 
 offensive unto God, or as though you might indulge yourselves in them 
 and yet escape with impunity. These are <I>vain words.</I>" Observe, 
 Those who flatter themselves and others with hopes of impunity in sin 
 do but put a cheat upon themselves and others. Thus Satan deceived our 
 first parents with vain words when he said to them, <I>You shall not 
 surely die.</I> They are <I>vain words</I> indeed; for those who trust 
 to them will find themselves wretchedly imposed upon, <I>for because of 
 these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of 
 disobedience.</I> By <I>children of disobedience</I> may be meant the 
 Gentiles, who disbelieved, and refused to comply with, and to submit 
 themselves to, the gospel: or, more generally, all obstinate sinners, 
 who will not be reclaimed, but are given over to disobedience.
 Disobedience is the very malignity of sin. And it is by a usual 
 Hebraism that such sinners are called children of disobedience; and 
 such indeed they are from their childhood, going astray as soon as they 
 are born. <I>The wrath of God comes upon</I> such because of their 
 sins; sometimes in this world, but more especially in the next. And 
 dare we make light of that which will lay us under the wrath of God? O 
 no. <I>Be not you therefore partakers with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "Do not partake with them in their sins, that you may not share in 
 their punishment." We partake with other men in their sins, not only 
 when we live in the same sinful manner that they do, and consent and 
 comply with their temptations and solicitations to sin, but when we 
 encourage them in their sins, prompt them to sin, and do not prevent 
 and hinder them, as far as it may be in our power to do so.

 (3.) Consider what obligations Christians are under to live at another 
 rate than such sinners do: <I>For you were sometimes darkness, but 
 now,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The meaning is, "Such courses are very unsuitable to your present 
 condition; for, whereas in your Gentile and your unregenerate state you 
 were darkness, you have now undergone a great change." The apostle 
 calls their former condition <I>darkness</I> in the abstract, to 
 express the great darkness they were in. They lived wicked and profane 
 lives, being destitute of the light of instruction without and of the 
 illumination and grace of the blessed Spirit within. Note, A state of
 sin is a state of darkness. Sinners, like men in the dark, are going 
 they know not whither, and doing they know not what. But the grace of
 God had produced a mighty change in their souls: <I>Now are you light 
 in the Lord,</I> savingly enlightened by the word and the Spirit of 
 God. <I>Now,</I> upon your believing in Christ, and your receiving the 
 gospel. <I>Walk as children of light.</I> Children of light, according 
 to the Hebrew dialect, are those who are in a state of light, endued 
 with knowledge and holiness. "Now, being such, let your conversation be 
 suitable to your condition and privileges, and accordingly live up to 
 the obligation you are under by that knowledge and those advantages you 
 enjoy--<I>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 examining and searching diligently what God has revealed to be his 
 will, and making it appear that you approve it by conforming yourselves 
 to it." Observe, We must not only dread and avoid that which is 
 displeasing to God, but enquire and consider what will be acceptable to 
 him, searching the scriptures with this view, thus keeping at the 
 greatest distance from these sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle prescribes some remedies against them. As, 

 (1.) If we would not be entangled by the lusts of the flesh, we must 
 bring forth <I>the fruits of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This is expected from the children of light, that, being illuminated, 
 they be also sanctified by the Spirit, and thereupon bring forth his 
 fruit, which <I>is in all goodness,</I> an inclination to do good and 
 to show mercy, <I>and righteousness,</I> which signifies justice in our 
 dealings. Thus they are taken more strictly; but, more generally, all 
 religion is goodness and righteousness. And in and with these must be 
 <I>truth,</I> or sincerity and uprightness of heart.

 (2.) We must have no fellowship with sin nor sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Sinful works are works of darkness: they come from the darkness of 
 ignorance, they seek the darkness of concealment, and they lead to the 
 darkness of hell. These works of darkness are <I>unfruitful works;</I> 
 there is nothing got by them in the long run, whatever profit is 
 pretended by sin, it will by no means balance the loss; for it issues 
 in the utter ruin and destruction of the impenitent sinner. We must 
 therefore <I>have no fellowship</I> with these unfruitful works; as we 
 must not practise them ourselves, so we must not countenance others in 
 the practice of them. There are many ways of our being accessary to the 
 sins of others, by commendation, counsel, consent, or concealment. And, 
 if we share with others in their sin, we must expect to share with them 
 in their plagues. Nay, if we thus have fellowship with them, we shall 
 be in the utmost danger of acting as they do ere long. But, rather than 
 have fellowship with them, we must <I>reprove them,</I> implying that 
 if we do not reprove the sins of others we have fellowship with them.
 We must prudently and in our places witness against the sins of others, 
 and endeavour to convince them of their sinfulness, when we can do it 
 seasonably and pertinently, in our words; but especially by the 
 holiness of our lives, and a religious conversation. Reprove their sins 
 by abounding in the contrary duties. One reason given is, <I>For it is 
 a shame even to speak of those things,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They are so filthy and abominable that it is a shame to mention them, 
 except in a way of reproof, much more must it be a shame to have any 
 fellowship with them. <I>The things which are done of them in
 secret.</I> The apostle seems to speak here of the Gentile idolaters, 
 and of their horrid mysteries, which abounded with detestable 
 wickedness, and which none were permitted to divulge upon pain of 
 death. Observe, A good man is ashamed to speak that which many wicked 
 people are not ashamed to act; but, as far as their wickedness appears, 
 it should be reproved by good men. There follows another reason for
 such reproof: <I>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by 
 the light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The meaning of this passage may be this: "All those unfruitful works of 
 darkness which you are called upon to reprove are laid open, and made 
 to appear in their proper colours to the sinners themselves, by the 
 light of doctrine or of God's word in your mouths, as faithful 
 reprovers, or by that instructive light which is diffused by the 
 holiness of your lives and by your exemplary walk." Observe, The light 
 of God's word, and the exemplification of it in a Christian 
 conversation, are proper means to convince sinners of their sin and 
 wickedness. It follows, <I>For whatsoever doth make manifest is 
 light;</I> that is, it is the light that discovers what was concealed 
 before in darkness; and accordingly it becomes those who are 
 <I>children of light,</I> who are <I>light in the Lord,</I> to discover 
 to others their sins, and to endeavour to convince them of the evil and 
 danger of them, thus shining as lights in the world. The apostle 
 further urges this duty from the example of God or Christ: <I>Wherefore 
 he saith,</I> &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 as if he had said, "In doing this, you will copy after the great God, 
 who has set himself to awaken sinners from their sleep, and to raise 
 them from the death of sin, that they might receive light from Christ." 
 <I>He saith.</I> The Lord is constantly saying in his word what is more 
 particularly expressed in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1">Isa. lx. 1</A>.

 Or, Christ, by his ministers, who preach the everlasting gospel, is
 continually calling upon sinners to this effect: <I>Awake, thou that 
 sleepest, and arise from the dead.</I> The same thing in the main is 
 designed by these different expressions; and they serve to remind us of 
 the great stupidity and the wretched security of sinners, how 
 insensible they are of their danger, and how unapt they naturally are 
 to spiritual motions, sensations, and actions. When God calls upon
 them to awake, and to arise, his meaning is that they would break off 
 their sins by repentance, and enter on a course of holy obedience, and 
 he encourages them to essay and do their utmost that way, by that 
 gracious promise, <I>And Christ shall give thee light; or Christ shall 
 enlighten thee,</I> or <I>shall shine upon thee.</I> "He shall bring 
 thee into a state of knowledge, holiness, and comfort, assisting thee 
 with his grace, and refreshing thy mind with joy and peace here and 
 rewarding thee with eternal glory at length." Observe, When we are 
 endeavouring to convince sinners, and to reform them from their sins, 
 we are imitating God and Christ in that which is their great design 
 throughout the gospel. Some indeed understand this as a call to sinners 
 and to saints: to sinners to repent and turn; to saints to stir up 
 themselves to their duty. The former must arise from their spiritual 
 death; and the latter must awake from their spiritual deadness.

 (3.) Another remedy against sin is circumspection, care, or caution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>See then,</I> &c. This may be understood either with respect to
 what immediately precedes, "If you are to reprove others for their 
 sins, and would be faithful to your duty in this particular, you must 
 look well to yourselves, and to your own behaviour and conduct" (and, 
 indeed, those only are fit to reprove others who walk with due 
 circumspection and care themselves): or else we have here another 
 remedy or rather preservative from the before-mentioned sins; and this 
 I take to be the design of the apostle, being impossible to maintain 
 purity and holiness of heart and life without great circumspection and 
 care. <I>Walk circumspectly,</I> or, as the word signifies, accurately, 
 exactly, in the right way, in order to which we must be frequently 
 consulting our rule, and the directions we have in the sacred oracles. 
 <I>Not as fools,</I> who walk at all adventures, and who have no 
 understanding of their duty, nor of the worth of their souls, and 
 through neglect, supineness, and want of care, fall into sin, and 
 destroy themselves; <I>but as wise,</I> as persons taught of God and 
 endued with wisdom from above. Circumspect walking is the effect of
 true wisdom, but the contrary is the effect of folly. It follows, 
 <I>redeeming the time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 literally, <I>buying the opportunity.</I> It is a metaphor taken from 
 merchants and traders who diligently observe and improve the seasons 
 for merchandise and trade. It is a great part of Christian wisdom to
 redeem the time. Good Christians must be good husbands of their time, 
 and take care to improve it to the best of purposes, by watching 
 against temptations, by doing good while it is in the power of their 
 hands, and by filling it up with proper employment--one special 
 preservative from sin. They should make the best use they can of the 
 present seasons of grace. Our time is a talent given us by God for some 
 good end, and it is misspent and lost when it is not employed according 
 to his design. If we have lost our time heretofore, we must endeavour 
 to redeem it by doubling our diligence in doing our duty for the 
 future. The reason given is <I>because the days are evil,</I> either by 
 reason of the wickedness of those who dwell in them, or rather "as they 
 are troublesome and dangerous times to you who live in them." Those 
 were times of persecution wherein the apostle wrote this: the 
 Christians were in jeopardy every hour. When the days are evil we have 
 one superadded argument to redeem time, especially because we know not 
 how soon they may be worse. People are very apt to complain of bad 
 times; it were well if that would stir them up to redeem time.
 "<I>Wherefore,</I>" says the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 "because of the badness of the times, <I>be you not unwise,</I> 
 ignorant of your duty and negligent about your souls, <I>but 
 understanding what the will of the Lord is.</I> Study, consider, and 
 further acquaint yourselves with the will of God, as determining your 
 duty." Observe, Ignorance of our duty, and neglect of our souls, are 
 evidences of the greatest folly; while an acquaintance with the will of 
 God, and a care to comply with it, bespeak the best and truest 
 wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18-20">three following verses</A> 

 the apostle warns against some other particular sins, and urges some
 other duties. 

 1. He warns against the sin of drunkenness: <I>And be not drunk with 
 wine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was a sin very frequent among the heathens; and particularly on 
 occasion of the festivals of their gods, and more especially in their 
 Bacchanalia: then they were wont to inflame themselves with wine, and 
 all manner of inordinate lusts were consequent upon it: and therefore 
 the apostle adds, <I>wherein,</I> or in which drunkenness, <I>is 
 excess.</I> The word <B><I>asotia</I></B> may signify <I>luxury</I> or 
 <I>dissoluteness;</I> and it is certain that drunkenness is no friend 
 to chastity and purity of life, but it virtually contains all manner of 
 extravagance, and transports men into gross sensuality and vile 
 enormities. Note, Drunkenness is a sin that seldom goes alone, but 
 often involves men in other instances of guilt: it is a sin very 
 provoking to God, and a great hindrance to the spiritual life. The 
 apostle may mean all such intemperance and disorder as are opposite to 
 the sober and prudent demeanor he intends in his advice, to redeem the 
 time. 

 2. Instead of being filled with wine, he exhorts them to <I>be filled
 with the Spirit.</I> Those who are full of drink are not likely to be 
 full of the Spirit; and therefore this duty is opposed to the former 
 sin. The meaning of the exhortation is that men should labour for a 
 plentiful measure of the graces of the Spirit, that would fill their 
 souls with great joy, strength, and courage, which things sensual men 
 expect their wine should inspire them with. We cannot be guilty of any 
 excess in our endeavours after these: nay, we ought not to be satisfied 
 with a little of the Spirit, but to be aspiring after measures, so as 
 to be filled with the Spirit. Now by this means we shall come to 
 <I>understand what the will of the Lord is;</I> for the Spirit of God 
 is given as a Spirit of wisdom and of understanding. And because those 
 who are filled with the Spirit will be carried out in acts of devotion, 
 and all the proper expressions of it, therefore the apostle exhorts, 

 3. To sing unto the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Drunkards are wont to sing obscene and profane songs. The heathens, in 
 their Bacchanalia, used to sing hymns to Bacchus, whom they called the 
 god of wine. Thus they expressed their joy; but the joy of Christians 
 should express itself in songs of praise to their God. In these they 
 should <I>speak to themselves</I> in their assemblies and meetings 
 together, for mutual edification. By <I>psalms</I> may be meant David's 
 psalms, or such composures as were fitly sung with musical instruments.
 By <I>hymns</I> may be meant such others as were confined to matter of 
 praise, as those of Zacharias, Simeon, &c. <I>Spiritual songs</I> may 
 contain a greater variety of matter, doctrinal, prophetical, 
 historical, &c. Observe here,

 (1.) The singing of psalms and hymns is a gospel ordinance: it is an 
 ordinance of God, and appointed for his glory. 

 (2.) Though Christianity is an enemy to profane mirth, yet it 
 encourages joy and gladness, and the proper expressions of these in the 
 professors of it. God's people have reason to rejoice, and to sing for
 joy. They are to <I>sing and to make melody in their hearts;</I> not 
 only with their voices, but with inward affection, and then their doing 
 this will be as delightful and acceptable to God as music is to us: and 
 it must be with a design to please him, and to promote his glory, that 
 we do this; and then it will be done to the Lord. 

 4. Thanksgiving is another duty that the apostle exhorts to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 We are appointed to sing psalms, &c., for the expression of our 
 thankfulness to God; but, though we are not always singing, we should 
 never want a disposition for this duty, as we never want matter for it. 
 We must continue it throughout the whole course of our lives; and we 
 should give thanks <I>for all things;</I> not only for spiritual 
 blessings enjoyed, and eternal ones expected (for what of the former we 
 have in hand, and for what of the other we have in hope), but for 
 temporal mercies too; not only for our comforts, but also for our 
 sanctified afflictions; not only for what immediately concerns 
 ourselves, but for the instances of God's kindness and favour to others 
 also. It is our duty in <I>every thing to give thanks unto God and the 
 Father,</I> to God as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and our 
 Father in him, in whose name we are to offer up all our prayers, and 
 praises, and spiritual services, that they may be acceptable to 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
 &nbsp; 22  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
 Lord.
 &nbsp; 23  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is
 the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
 &nbsp; 24  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <I>let</I> the
 wives <I>be</I> to their own husbands in every thing.
 &nbsp; 25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
 church, and gave himself for it;
 &nbsp; 26  That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
 water by the word,
 &nbsp; 27  That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
 having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be
 holy and without blemish.
 &nbsp; 28  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He
 that loveth his wife loveth himself.
 &nbsp; 29  For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
 cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
 &nbsp; 30  For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
 bones.
 &nbsp; 31  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
 shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
 &nbsp; 32  This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and
 the church.
 &nbsp; 33  Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his
 wife even as himself; and the wife <I>see</I> that she reverence <I>her</I>
 husband.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle begins his exhortation to the discharge of relative 
 duties. As a general foundation for these duties, he lays down that 
 rule 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There is a mutual submission that Christians owe one to another, 
 condescending to bear one another's burdens: not advancing themselves 
 above others, nor domineering over one another and giving laws to one 
 another. Paul was an example of this truly Christian temper, for he 
 <I>became all things to all men.</I> We must be of a yielding and of a 
 submissive spirit, and ready to all the duties of the respective places 
 and stations that God has allotted to us in the world. <I>In the fear 
 of God,</I> that is, so far as is consistent with the fear of God, for 
 his sake, and out of conscience towards him, and that hereby we may 
 give proof that we truly fear him. Where there is this mutual 
 condescension and submission, the duties of all relations will be the 
 better performed. From 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>

 to the end he speaks of the duties of husbands and wives; and he speaks 
 of these in a Christian manner, setting the church as an example of the 
 wife's subjection, and Christ as an example of love in husbands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duty prescribed to wives is submission to their husbands in the 
 Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 which submission includes the honouring and obeying of them, and that 
 from a principle of love to them. They must do this in compliance with 
 God's authority, who has commanded it, which is doing it <I>as unto the 
 Lord;</I> or it may be understood by way of similitude and likeness, so 
 that the sense may be, "as, being devoted to God, you submit yourselves 
 unto him." From the former sense we may learn that by a conscientious 
 discharge of the duties we owe to our fellow-creatures we obey and 
 please God himself; and, from the latter, that God not only requires 
 and insists on those duties which immediately respect himself, but such 
 as respect our neighbours too. The apostle assigns the reason of this
 submission from wives: <I>For the husband is the head of the wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The metaphor is taken from the head in the natural body, which, being 
 the seat of reason, of wisdom, and of knowledge, and the fountain of 
 sense and motion, is more excellent than the rest of the body. God has 
 given the man the pre-eminence and a right to direct and govern by 
 creation, and in that original law of the relation, <I>Thy desire shall 
 be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</I> Whatever there is 
 of uneasiness in this, it is an effect of sin coming into the world.
 Generally, too, the man has (what he ought to have) a superiority in 
 wisdom and knowledge. He is therefore the head, <I>even as Christ is
 the head of the church.</I> There is a resemblance of Christ's 
 authority over the church in that superiority and headship which God 
 has appointed to the husband. The apostle adds, <I>and he is the 
 Saviour of the body.</I> Christ's authority is exercised over the 
 church for the saving of her from evil, and the supplying of her with 
 every thing good for her. In like manner should the husband be employed 
 for the protection and comfort of his spouse; and therefore she should 
 the more cheerfully submit herself unto him. So it follows, 
 <I>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 with cheerfulness, with fidelity, with humility, <I>so let the wives be 
 to their own husbands in every thing</I>--in every thing to which their 
 authority justly extends itself, in every thing lawful and consistent 
 with duty to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duty of husbands (on the other hand), is to love their wives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 for without this they would abuse their superiority and headship, and, 
 wherever this prevails as it ought to do, it will infer the other 
 duties of the relation, it being a special and peculiar affection that 
 is required in her behalf. The love of Christ to the church is proposed 
 as an example of this, which love of his is a sincere, a pure, an 
 ardent, and constant affection, and that notwithstanding the 
 imperfections and failures that she is guilty of. The greatness of his
 love to the church appeared in his giving himself unto the death for 
 it. Observe, As the church's subjection to Christ is proposed as an 
 exemplar to wives, so the love of Christ to his church is proposed as a 
 pattern to husbands; and while such exemplars are offered to both, and 
 so much is required of each, neither has reason to complain of the 
 divine injunctions. The love which God requires from the husband in 
 behalf of his wife will make amends for the subjection which he demands 
 from her to her husband; and the prescribed subjection of the wife will 
 be an abundant return for that love of the husband which God has made 
 her due. The apostle, having mentioned Christ's love to the church, 
 enlarges upon it, assigning the reason why he gave himself for it, 
 namely, that he might sanctify it in this world, and glorify it in the 
 next: <I>That he might sanctify and cleanse it, with the washing of 
 water by the word</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)--

 that he might endue all his members with a principle of holiness, and
 deliver them from the guilt, the pollution, and the dominion of sin. 
 The instrumental means whereby this is affected are the instituted 
 sacraments, particularly the washing of baptism and the preaching and 
 reception of the gospel. <I>And that he might present it to
 himself,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot thinks the apostle alludes here to the Jews'
 extraordinary carefulness in their washings for purification. They were 
 careful that there should be no wrinkle to keep the flesh from the 
 water, and no spot nor dirt which was not thoroughly washed. Others 
 understand him as alluding to a garment come newly out of the fuller's 
 hand, purged from spots, stretched from wrinkles, the former newly 
 contracted, the latter by long time and custom. <I>That he might 
 present it to himself</I>--that he might perfectly unite it to himself 
 in the great day, <I>a glorious church,</I> perfect in knowledge and in 
 holiness, <I>not having spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing,</I> 
 nothing of deformity or defilement remaining, but being entirely 
 amiable and pleasing in his eye, <I>holy and without blemish,</I> free 
 from the least remains of sin. The church in general, and particular 
 believers, will not be without spot or wrinkle till they come to glory. 
 From

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:26-27">this and the former verse</A>

 together we may take notice that the glorifying of the church is
 intended in the sanctifying of it: and that those, and those only, who 
 are sanctified now, will be glorified hereafter.--<I>So ought men to 
 love their wives as their own bodies,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The wife being made one with her husband (not in a natural, but in a 
 civil and in a relative sense), this is an argument why he should love 
 her with as cordial and as ardent an affection as that which he loves 
 himself. <I>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>--

 (no man in his right senses ever hated himself, however deformed, or
 whatever his imperfections might be); so far from it that <I>he 
 nourishes and cherishes it;</I> he uses himself with a great deal of 
 care and tenderness, and is industrious to supply himself with every 
 thing convenient or good for him, with food and clothing, &c. <I>Even 
 as the Lord the church:</I> that is, as the Lord nourishes and 
 cherishes the church, which he furnishes with all things that he sees 
 needful or good for her, with whatever conduces to her everlasting 
 happiness and welfare. The apostle adds, <I>For we are members of his 
 body, of his flesh and of his bones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He assigns this as a reason why Christ nourishes and cherishes his 
 church--because all who belong to it <I>are members of his body,</I> 
 that is, of his mystical body. Or, we are members <I>out of his 
 body:</I> all the grace and glory which the church has are from Christ, 
 as Eve was taken out of the man. But, as one observes, it being the
 manner of the sacred writings to express a complex body by the 
 enumeration of its several parts, as the heaven and earth for the 
 world, evening and morning for the natural day, so here, by body, 
 flesh, and bones, we are to understand himself, the meaning of the 
 verse being that we are members of Christ.--<I>For this cause</I> 
 (because they are one, as Christ and his church are one) <I>shall a man 
 leave his father and mother;</I> the apostle refers to the words of 
 Adam, when Eve was given to him for a meet help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:24">Gen. ii. 24</A>.

 We are not to understand by this that a man's obligation to other
 relations is cancelled upon his marriage, but only that this relation 
 is to be preferred to all others, there being a nearer union between 
 these two than between any others, that the man must rather leave any 
 of those than his wife.--<I>And they two shall be one flesh,</I> that 
 is, by virtue of the matrimonial bond. <I>This is a great mystery,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Those words of Adam, just mentioned by the apostle, are spoken 
 literally of marriage; but they have also a hidden mystical sense in 
 them, relating to the union between Christ and his church, of which the 
 conjugal union between Adam and the mother of us all was a type: though 
 not instituted or appointed by God to signify this, yet it was a kind 
 of natural type, as having a resemblance to it: <I>I speak concerning 
 Christ and the church.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After this, the apostle concludes this part of his discourse with a 
 brief summary of the duty of husbands and wives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 "<I>Nevertheless</I> (though there be such a secret mystical sense, yet 
 the plain literal sense concerns you) <I>let every one of you in
 particular so love his wife even as himself,</I> with such a sincere, 
 peculiar, singular, and prevailing affection as that is which he bears 
 to himself. <I>And the wife see that she reverence her husband.</I>" 
 Reverence consists of love and esteem, which produce a care to please, 
 and of fear, which awakens a caution lest just offence be given. That 
 the wife thus reverence her husband is the will of God and the law of 
 the relation.</P>
