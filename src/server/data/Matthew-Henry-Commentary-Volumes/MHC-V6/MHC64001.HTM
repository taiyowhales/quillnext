 In this epistle the apostle congratulates Gaius upon the prosperity of
 his soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 upon the fame he had among good Christians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>),

 and upon his charity and hospitality to the servants of Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 He complains of contemptuous treatment by an ambitious Diotrephes, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 recommends Demetrius, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:12">ver. 12</A>),

 and expresses his hope of visiting Gaius shortly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
 truth.
 &nbsp; 2  Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
 be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see, I. The sacred penman who writes and sends the letter; not 
 here indeed notified by his name, but a more general character: <I>The 
 elder,</I> he that is so by years and by office; honour and deference 
 are due to both. Some have questioned whether this were John the 
 apostle or no; but his style and spirit seem to shine in the epistle. 
 Those that are beloved of Christ will love the brethren for his sake. 
 Gaius could not question from whom the letter came. The apostle might 
 have assumed many more illustrious characters, but it becomes not 
 Christ's ministers to affect swelling pompous titles. He almost levels 
 himself with the more ordinary pastors of the church, while he styles 
 himself the elder. Or, possibly, most of the extraordinary ministers, 
 the apostles, were now dead, and this holy survivor would countenance 
 the continued standing ministry, by assuming the more common title--the
 elder. <I>The elders I exhort, who am also an elder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1">1 Pet. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The person saluted and honoured by the letter. The former is 
 directed to an elect lady, this to a choice gentleman; such are worthy 
 of esteem and value. He is notified, 

 1. By his name,--<I>Gaius.</I> We read of several of that name,
 particularly of one whom the apostle Paul baptized at Corinth, who 
 possibly might be also the apostle's host and kind entertainer there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Rom. xvi. 23</A>);

 if this be not he, it is his brother in name, estate, and disposition. 
 Then, 

 2. By the kind expressions of the apostle to him: <I>The
 well-beloved,</I> and <I>whom I love in the truth.</I> Love expressed 
 is wont to kindle love. Here seems to be either the sincerity of the 
 apostle's love or the religion of it. The sincerity of it: <I>Whom I 
 love in the truth,</I> for the truth's sake, as abiding and walking in 
 the truth as it is in Jesus. To love our friends for the truth's sake 
 is true love, religious gospel love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The salutation or greeting, containing a prayer, introduced by an 
 affectionate compellation--<I>Beloved,</I> thou beloved one in Christ.
 The minister who would gain love must show it himself. Here is, 

 1. The apostle's good opinion of his friend, that his <I>soul
 prospered.</I> There is such a thing as soul-prosperity--the greatest 
 blessing on this side heaven. This supposes regeneration, and an inward 
 fund of spiritual life; this stock is increasing, and, while spiritual 
 treasures are advancing, the soul is in a fair way to the kingdom of 
 glory. 

 2. His good wish for his friend that his body may <I>prosper and be in
 health</I> as well as his soul. Grace and health are two rich 
 companions; grace will improve health, health will employ grace. It 
 frequently falls out that a rich soul is lodged in a crazy body; grace 
 must be exercised in submission to such a dispensation; but we may well 
 wish and pray that those who have prosperous souls may have healthful 
 bodies too; their grace will shine in a larger sphere of activity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
 of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
 &nbsp; 4  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
 truth.
 &nbsp; 5  Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
 brethren, and to strangers;
 &nbsp; 6  Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
 whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort,
 thou shalt do well:
 &nbsp; 7  Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
 nothing of the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 8  We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
 fellowhelpers to the truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The good report that the apostle had received concerning this friend 
 of his: <I>The brethren came and testified of the truth that is in 
 thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>who have borne witness of thy charity before the church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Here we may see, 

 1. The testimony or thing testified concerning Gaius--the truth that 
 was in him, the reality of his faith, the sincerity of his religion, 
 and his devotedness to God; and this evinced by his charity, which 
 includes his love to the brethren, kindness to the poor, hospitality to 
 Christian strangers, and readiness to accommodate them for the service 
 of the gospel. Faith should work by love; it gives a lustre in and by 
 the offices of love, and induces others to commend its integrity. 

 2. The witnesses-brethren that came from Gaius testified and bore
 witness. A good report is due from those who have received good;
 though a good name is but a small reward for costly service, yet it is 
 <I>better than precious ointment,</I> and will not be refused by the 
 ingenuous and religious. 

 3. The auditory or judicatory before which the report and testimony
 were given--<I>before the church.</I> This seems to be the church at 
 which the apostle now resided. What church this was we are not sure; 
 what occasion they had thus to testify his faith and love before the 
 church we cannot tell; possibly out of the fulness of the heart the 
 mouth spoke; they could not but testify what they found and felt; 
 possibly they would engage the church's prayer for the continued life 
 and usefulness of such a patron, that he might <I>prosper and be in 
 health as his soul prospered.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The report the apostle himself gives of him, introduced by an 
 endearing appellation again: <I>Beloved, thou doest faithfully
 whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. He was hospitable, good to the brethren, even to strangers; it was
 enough to recommend them to Gaius's house that they belonged to Christ.
 Or he was good to <I>the brethren</I> of the same church with himself, 
 and to those who came from far; all who were of the household of faith 
 were welcome to him.

 2. He seems to have been of a catholic spirit; he could overlook the
 petty differences among serious Christians, and be communicative to all 
 who bore the image and did the work of Christ. And,

 3. He was conscientious in what he did: "<I>Thou doest faithfully</I>
 (thou makest faithful work of) <I>whatsoever thou doest;</I> thou doest 
 it as a faithful servant, and from the Lord Christ mayest thou expect 
 the reward of the inheritance." Such faithful souls can hear their own 
 praises without being puffed up; the commendation of what is good in us 
 is designed, not for our pride, but for our encouragement to continue 
 therein, and should be accordingly improved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle's joy therein, in the good report itself, and the good 
 ground of it: <I>I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and 
 testified,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the 
 truth,</I> in the prescripts of the Christian religion. The best 
 evidence of our having the truth is our <I>walking in the truth.</I> 
 Good men will greatly rejoice in the soul-prosperity of others; and 
 they are glad to hear of the grace and goodness of others. <I>They 
 glorified God in me.</I> Love envieth not, but rejoiceth in the good 
 name of other folks. As it is joy to good parents, it will be joy to 
 good ministers, to see their children evidence their sincerity in 
 religion, and adorn their profession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The direction the apostle gives his friend concerning further 
 treatment of the brethren that were with him: <I>Whom if thou bring 
 forward on their journey, after a godly sort, thou shalt do well.</I> 
 It seems to have been customary in those days of love to attend 
 travelling ministers and Christians, at least some part of their road, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:6">1 Cor. xvi. 6</A>.

 It is a kindness to a stranger to be guided in his way, and a pleasure
 to travellers to meet with suitable company: this is a work that may be 
 done <I>after a godly sort,</I> in a manner worthy of God, or suitable 
 to the deference and relation we bear to God. Christians should 
 consider not only what they must do, but what they may do, what they 
 may most honourably and laudably do: <I>the liberal mind deviseth 
 liberal</I> generous <I>things.</I> Christians should do even the 
 common actions of life and of good-will after a godly sort, as serving 
 God therein, and designing his glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The reasons of this directed conduct; these are two:--

 1. <I>Because that for his name's sake these brethren went forth,
 taking nothing of the Gentiles.</I> It appears thus that these were 
 ministerial brethren, that they went forth to preach the gospel and 
 propagate Christianity; possibly they might be sent out by this apostle 
 himself: they went forth to convert the Gentiles; this was excellent 
 service: they went forth for God and his name's sake; this is the 
 minister's highest end, and should be his principal spring and motive, 
 to gather and to build up a people for his name: they went forth also 
 to carry a free gospel about with them, to publish it without charge 
 wherever they came: <I>Taking nothing of the Gentiles.</I> These were 
 worthy of double honour. There are those who are not called to preach 
 the gospel themselves who may yet contribute to the progress of it. The 
 gospel should be made without charge to those to whom it is first 
 preached. Those who know it not cannot be expected to value it;
 churches and Christian patriots ought to concur to support the 
 propagation of holy religion in the pagan countries; public spirits 
 should concur according to their several capacities; those who are 
 freely communicative of Christ's gospel should be assisted by those who 
 are communicative of their purses. 

 2. <I>We ought therefore to receive such, that we may be fellow-helpers
 to the truth,</I> to true religion. The institution of Christ is the
 true religion; it has been attested by God. Those that are true in it 
 and true to it will earnestly desire, and pray for, and contribute to, 
 its propagation in the world. In many ways may the truth be befriended 
 and assisted; those who cannot themselves proclaim it may yet receive, 
 accompany, help, and countenance those who do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
 the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
 &nbsp; 10  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
 doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content
 therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and
 forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <I>them</I> out of the church.
 &nbsp; 11  Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
 good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath
 not seen God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a very different example and character, an officer, a 
 minister in the church, less generous, catholic, and communicative than 
 the private Christians. Ministers may sometimes be out-shone, out-done.
 In reference to this minister, we see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His name--a Gentile name: <I>Diotrephes,</I> attended with an
 unchristian spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His temper and spirit--full of pride and ambition: <I>He loves to
 have the pre-eminence.</I> This ferment sprang and wrought betimes. It 
 is an ill unbeseeming character of Christ's ministers to love 
 pre-eminence, to affect presidency in the church of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His contempt of the apostle's authority, and letter, and friends. 
 
 (1.) Of his authority: <I>The deeds which he doeth</I> contrary to our 
 appointment, <I>prating against us with malicious words.</I> Strange 
 that the contempt should run so high! But ambition will breed malice 
 against those who oppose it. Malice and ill-will in the heart will be 
 apt to vent themselves by the lips. The heart and mouth are both to be 
 watched. 

 (2.) Of his letter: "<I>I wrote to the church</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 namely, in recommendation of such and such brethren. <I>But Diotrephes 
 receiveth us not,</I> admits not our letter and testimony therein." 
 This seems to be the church of which Gaius was a member. A gospel 
 church seems to be such a society as to which a letter may be written 
 and communicated. Gospel churches may well expect and be allowed
 credentials with the strangers who desire to be admitted among them.
 The apostle seems to write by and with these brethren. To an ambitious 
 aspiring spirit apostolical authority or epistle signifies but little.
 
 (3.) Of his friends, the brethren he recommended: <I>Neither doth he 
 himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth those that would, and 
 casteth them out of the church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 There might be some differences or different customs between the Jewish 
 and Gentile Christians. Pastors should seriously consider what 
 differences are tolerable. The pastor is not at absolute liberty, nor 
 lord over God's heritage. It is bad to do no good ourselves; but it is 
 worse to hinder those who would. Church-power and church-censures are
 often abused. Many are cast out of the church who should be received
 there with satisfaction and welcome. But woe to those who cast out the 
 brethren whom the Lord Christ will take into his own communion and 
 kingdom!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostle's menace of this proud domineerer: <I>Wherefore, if I 
 come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 will remember to censure them. This seems to intimate apostolical 
 authority. But the apostle seems not to hold an episcopal court, to
 which Diotrephes must be summoned; but he will come to take cognizance 
 of this affair in the church to which it belongs. Acts of 
 ecclesiastical domination and tyranny ought to be animadverted upon. 
 May it be better agreed to whom that power belongs!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is counsel upon that different character, dissuasion from 
 copying such a pattern, and indeed any evil at all: <I>Beloved, follow 
 not that which is evil, but that which is good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Imitate not such unchristian pernicious evil; but pursue the contrary 
 good, in wisdom, purity, peace, and love. Caution and counsel are not 
 needless to those who are good already. Those cautions and counsels are 
 most likely to be accepted that are seasoned with love. <I>Beloved, 
 follow not that which is evil.</I> To this caution and counsel a reason 
 is respectively subjoined.

 1. To the counsel: <I>Follow that which is good;</I> for <I>he that
 doeth good</I> (naturally and genuinely doeth good, as delighting 
 therein) <I>is of God,</I> is born of God. The practice of goodness is 
 the evidence of our filial happy relation to God.

 2. To the caution: <I>Follow not that which is evil,</I> for <I>he that
 doeth evil</I> (with bent of mind pursues it) <I>hath not seen God,</I> 
 is not duly sensible of his holy nature and will. Evil-workers vainly 
 pretend or boast an acquaintance with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Demetrius hath good report of all <I>men,</I> and of the truth
 itself: yea, and we <I>also</I> bear record; and ye know that our
 record is true.
 &nbsp; 13  I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
 write unto thee:
 &nbsp; 14  But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak
 face to face. Peace <I>be</I> to thee. <I>Our</I> friends salute thee.
 Greet the friends by name.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, I. The character of another person, one <I>Demetrius,</I> 
 not much known otherwise. But here his name will live. A name in the 
 gospel, a fame in the churches, is better than that of sons and 
 daughters. His character was his commendation. His commendation was,
 
 1. General: <I>Demetrius has a good report of all men.</I> Few are well
 spoken of by all; and sometimes it is ill to be so. But universal
 integrity and goodness are the way to (and sometimes obtain) universal
 applause.

 2. Deserved and well founded: <I>And of the truth itself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Some have a good report, but not of the truth itself. Happy are those 
 whose spirit and conduct commend them before God and men. 

 3. Confirmed by the apostle's and his friends' testimony: <I>Yea, and
 we also bear record;</I> and that with an appeal to Gaius's own 
 knowledge: <I>And you</I> (you and your friends) <I>know that our 
 record is true.</I> Probably this Demetrius was known to the church 
 where the apostle now resided, and to that where Gaius was. It is good
 to be well known, or known for good. We must be ready to bear our 
 testimony to those who are good: it is well for those who are commended 
 when those who commend them can appeal to the consciences of those who 
 know them most.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conclusion of the epistle, in which we may observe, 

 1. The referring of some things to personal interview: <I>I have many
 things to write, but I will not with ink and pen, but I trust I shall 
 shortly see thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Many things may be more proper for immediate communication than for 
 letter. A little personal conference may spare the time, trouble, and 
 charge, of many letters; and good Christians may well be glad to see 
 one another. 

 2. The benediction: <I>Peace be to you;</I> all felicity attend you.
 Those that are good and happy themselves wish others so too. 

 3. The public salutation sent to Gaius: <I>Our friends salute thee.</I>
 A friend to the propagation of religion deserves a common remembrance.
 And these pious persons show their friendship to religion as well as to 
 Gaius. 

 4. The apostle's particular salutation of the Christians in Gaius's
 church or vicinity: <I>Greet thy friends by name.</I> I doubt they were 
 not very many who must be so personally saluted. But we must learn 
 humility as well as love. The lowest in the church of Christ should be 
 greeted. And those may well salute and greet one another on earth who 
 hope to live together in heaven. And the apostle who had lain in 
 Christ's bosom lays Christ's friends in his heart.</P>
