 The dissolving of the peculiar church-state of the Jews, and the 
 rejection of that polity by the repealing of their ceremonial law, the 
 vacating of all the institutions of it, the abolishing of their 
 priesthood, the burning of their temple, and the taking away of their 
 place and nation, and in their room the substituting and erecting of a 
 catholic church-state among the Gentile nations, though to us, now that 
 these things have long since been done and completed, they may seem no 
 great matter, yet to those who lived when they were doing, who knew how 
 high the Jews had stood in God's favour, and how deplorable the 
 condition of the Gentile world had been for many ages, it appeared very 
 great and marvellous, and a mystery hard to be understood. The apostle, 
 in this chapter, as in the foregoing and that which follows, is 
 explaining and proving it; but with several very useful digressions, 
 which a little interrupt the thread of his discourse. To two great 
 truths I would reduce this chapter:--

 I. That there is a great difference between the righteousness of the
 law, which the unbelieving Jews were wedded to, and the righteousness 
 of faith offered in the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. That there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles; but, in 
 point of justification and acceptance with God, the gospel sets them 
 both upon the same level, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12-21">ver. 12 to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
 that they might be saved.
 &nbsp; 2  For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
 according to knowledge.
 &nbsp; 3  For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going
 about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
 themselves unto the righteousness of God.
 &nbsp; 4  For Christ <I>is</I> the end of the law for righteousness to every
 one that believeth.
 &nbsp; 5  For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,
 That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
 &nbsp; 6  But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this
 wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that
 is, to bring Christ down <I>from above:</I>)
 &nbsp; 7  Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up
 Christ again from the dead.)
 &nbsp; 8  But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, <I>even</I> in thy
 mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we
 preach;
 &nbsp; 9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
 shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
 dead, thou shalt be saved.
 &nbsp; 10  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and
 with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
 &nbsp; 11  For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall
 not be ashamed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of the apostle in this part of the chapter is to show the 
 vast difference between the righteousness of the law and the 
 righteousness of faith, and the great pre-eminence of the righteousness 
 of faith above that of the law; that he might induce and persuade the 
 Jews to believe in Christ, aggravate the folly and sin of those that 
 refused, and justify God in the rejection of such refusers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul here professes his good affection to the Jews, with the reason 
 of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),

 where he gives them a good wish, and a good witness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A good wish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 a wish that they might be saved--saved from the temporal ruin and 
 destruction that were coming upon them--saved from the wrath to come, 
 eternal wrath, which was hanging over their heads. It is implied in 
 this wish that they might be convinced and converted; he could not pray 
 in faith that they might be saved in their unbelief. Though Paul
 preached against them, yet he prayed for them. Herein he was merciful, 
 as God is, who is <I>not willing that any should perish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:9">2 Pet. iii. 9</A>),

 desires not the death of sinners. It is our duty truly and earnestly to 
 desire the salvation of our own. This, he says, was <I>his heart's 
 desire and prayer,</I> which intimates, 

 (1.) The strength and sincerity of his desire. It was <I>his heart's 
 desire;</I> it was not a formal compliment, as good wishes are with 
 many from the teeth outward, but a real desire. This it was before it 
 was his prayer. The soul of prayer is the heart's desire. Cold desires 
 do but beg denials; we must even breathe out our souls in every prayer.
 
 (2.) The offering up of this desire to God. It was not only his heart's 
 desire, but it was his prayer. There may be desires in the heart, and 
 yet no prayer, unless those desires be presented to God. Wishing and 
 woulding, if that be all, are not praying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A good witness, as a reason of his good wish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I bear them record that they have a zeal of God.</I> The unbelieving 
 Jews were the most bitter enemies Paul had in the world, and yet Paul 
 gives them as good a character as the truth would bear. We should say 
 the best we can even of our worst enemies; this is blessing those that 
 curse us. Charity teaches us to have the best opinion of persons, and
 to put the best construction upon words and actions, that they will 
 bear. We should take notice of that which is commendable even in bad 
 people. <I>They have a zeal of God.</I> Their opposition to the gospel
 is from a principle of respect to the law, which they know to have come 
 from God. There is such a thing as a blind misguided zeal: such was 
 that of the Jews, who, when they hated Christ's people and ministers, 
 and cast them out, said, <I>Let the Lord be glorified</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>);
 
 nay, they killed them, and thought they did God good service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He here shows the fatal mistake that the unbelieving Jews were 
 guilty of, which was their ruin. Their zeal was <I>not according to 
 knowledge.</I> It is true God gave them that law for which they were so 
 zealous; but they might have known that, by the appearance of the 
 promised Messiah, an end was put to it. He introduced a new religion 
 and way of worship, to which the former must give place. He proved 
 himself the Son of God, gave the most convincing evidence that could be 
 of his being the Messiah; and yet they did not know and would not own 
 him, but shut their eyes against the clear light, so that their zeal 
 for the law was blind. This he shows further, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,

 where we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The nature of their unbelief. They <I>have not submitted themselves 
 to the righteousness of God,</I> that is, they have not yielded to 
 gospel-terms, nor accepted the tender of justification by faith in 
 Christ, which is made in the gospel. Unbelief is a non-submission to 
 the righteousness of God, standing it out against the gospel 
 proclamation of indemnity. <I>Have not submitted.</I> In true faith, 
 there is need of a great deal of submission; therefore the first lesson 
 Christ teaches is to deny ourselves. It is a great piece of 
 condescension for a proud heart to be content to be beholden to free 
 grace; we are loth to sue <I>sub forma pauperis--as paupers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The causes of their unbelief, and these are two:--

 (1.) Ignorance of God's righteousness. They did not understand, and
 believe, and consider, the strict justice of God, in hating and 
 punishing sin, and demanding satisfaction, did not consider what need 
 we have of a righteousness wherein to appear before him; if they had, 
 they would never have stood out against the gospel offer, nor expected 
 justification by their own works, as if they could satisfy God's 
 justice. Or, being ignorant of God's way of justification, which he has 
 now appointed and revealed by Jesus Christ. They did not know it, 
 because they would not; they shut their eyes against the discoveries of 
 it, and love darkness rather. 

 (2.) A proud conceit of their own righteousness: <I>Going about to 
 establish their own</I>--a righteousness of their own devising, and of 
 their own working out, by the merit of their works, and by their 
 observance of the ceremonial law. They thought they needed not to be 
 beholden to the merit of Christ, and therefore depended upon their own 
 performances as sufficient to make up a righteousness wherein to appear 
 before God. They could not with Paul disclaim a dependence upon this
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9">Phil. iii. 9</A>),

 <I>Not having my own righteousness.</I> See an instance of this pride 
 in the Pharisee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:10,11">Luke xviii. 10, 11</A>.

 Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He here shows the folly of that mistake, and what an unreasonable 
 thing it was for them to be seeking justification by the works of the 
 law, now that Christ had come, and had brought in an everlasting 
 righteousness; considering,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The subserviency of the law to the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.</I> The design of 
 the law was to lead people to Christ. The moral law was but for the 
 searching of the wound, the ceremonial law for the shadowing forth of 
 the remedy; but Christ is the end of both. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:7,Ga+3:23,24">2 Cor. iii. 7,
 and compare Gal. iii. 23, 24</A>.

 The use of the law was to direct people for righteousness to Christ.

 (1.) Christ is the end of the ceremonial law; he is the period of it,
 because he is the perfection of it. When the substance comes, the 
 shadow is gone. The sacrifices, and offerings, and purifications 
 appointed under the Old Testament, prefigured Christ, and pointed at 
 him; and their inability to take away sin discovered the necessity of a 
 sacrifice that should, by being once offered, take away sin. 

 (2.) Christ is the end of the moral law in that he did what the law 
 could not do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3"><I>ch.</I> viii. 3</A>),

 and secured the great end of it. The end of the law was to bring men to
 perfect obedience, and so to obtain justification. This is now become 
 impossible, by reason of the power of sin and the corruption of nature; 
 but Christ is the end of the law. The law is not destroyed, nor the 
 intention of the lawgiver frustrated, but, full satisfaction being made 
 by the death of Christ for our breach of the law, the end is attained, 
 and we are put in another way of justification. Christ is thus the end 
 of the law for righteousness, that is, for justification; but it is 
 only to <I>every one that believeth.</I> Upon our believing, that is, 
 our humble consent to the terms of the gospel, we become interested in 
 Christ's satisfaction, and so are justified through the redemption that 
 is in Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The excellency of the gospel above the law. This he proves by 
 showing the different constitution of these two.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What is the righteousness which is of the law? This he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The tenour of it is, <I>Do, and live.</I> Though it directs us to a 
 better and more effectual righteousness in Christ, yet in itself, 
 considered as a law abstracted from its respect to Christ and the 
 gospel (for so the unbelieving Jews embraced and retained it), it 
 owneth nothing as a righteousness sufficient to justify a man but that 
 of perfect obedience. For this he quotes that scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:5">Lev. xviii. 5</A>),
 
 <I>You shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if a 
 man do, he shall live in them.</I> To this he refers likewise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:12">Gal. iii. 12</A>,

 <I>The man that doeth them, shall live in them. Live,</I> that is, be 
 happy, not only in the land of Canaan, but in heaven, of which Canaan 
 was a type and figure. The doing supposed must be perfect and sinless, 
 without the least breach or violation. The law which was given upon 
 Mount Sinai, though it was not a pure covenant of works (for who then 
 could be saved under that dispensation?) yet, that is might be the more 
 effectual to drive people to Christ and to make the covenant of grace 
 welcome, it had a very great mixture of the strictness and terror of 
 the covenant of works. Now, was it not extreme folly in the Jews to 
 adhere so closely to this way of justification and salvation, which was 
 in itself so hard, and by the corruption of nature now become 
 impossible, when there was a new and a living way opened?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is that righteousness which is of faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 &c. This he describes in the words of Moses, in Deuteronomy, in the
 <I>second law</I> (so Deuteronomy signifies), where there was a much
 clearer revelation of Christ and the gospel than there was in the first
 giving of the law: he quotes it from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11-14">Deut. xxx. 11-14</A>,
 
 and shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That it is not at all hard or difficult. The way of justification
 and salvation has in it no such depths or knots as may discourage us,
 no insuperable difficulties attending it; but, as was foretold, it is a
 high-way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>.

 We are not put to climb for it--it is not in heaven; we are not put to 
 dive for it--it is not in the deep. <I>First,</I> We need not go to
 heaven, to search the records there, or to enquire into the secrets of 
 the divine counsel. It is true Christ is in heaven; but we may be 
 justified and saved without going thither, to fetch him thence, or 
 sending a special messenger to him. <I>Secondly,</I> We need not go to
 the deep, to fetch Christ out of the grave, or from the state of the 
 dead: <I>Into the deep, to bring up Christ from the dead.</I> This 
 plainly shows that Christ's descent into the <I>deep,</I> or into 
 <B><I>hades,</I></B> was no more than his going into the state of the 
 dead, in allusion to Jonah. It is true that Christ was in the grave, 
 and it is as true that he is now in heaven; but we need not perplex and 
 puzzle ourselves with fancied difficulties, nor must we create to 
 ourselves such gross and carnal ideas of these things as if the method 
 of salvation were impracticable, and the design of the revelation were 
 only to amuse us. No, salvation is not put at so vast a distance from 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But it is very plain and easy: <I>The word is nigh thee.</I> When 
 we speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving Christ, and feeding upon 
 Christ, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we 
 mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ exhibited to us, and offered, 
 in the word. Christ is nigh thee, for the word is nigh thee: nigh thee 
 indeed: it is <I>in thy mouth, and in thy heart;</I> there is no 
 difficulty in understanding, believing, and owning it. The work thou 
 hast to do lies within thee: <I>the kingdom of God is within you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:21">Luke xvii. 21</A>.

 Thence thou must fetch thy evidences, not out of the records of heaven.
 <I>It is,</I> that is, it is promised that it shall be, <I>in thy 
 mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>),

 <I>and in thy heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:33">Jer. xxxi. 33</A>.

 All that which is done for us is already done to our hands. Christ is
 come down from heaven; we need not go to fetch him. He is come up from 
 the deep; we need not perplex ourselves how to bring him up. There is 
 nothing now to be done, but a work in us; this must be our care, to 
 look to our heart and mouth. Those that were under the law were to do 
 all themselves, <I>Do this, and live;</I> but the gospel discovers the 
 greatest part of the work done already, and what remains cut short in 
 righteousness, salvation offered upon very plain and easy terms, 
 brought to our door, as it were, in the word which is nigh us. It is in 
 our mouth--we are reading it daily; it is in our heart--we are, or should
 be, thinking of it daily. Even <I>the word of faith;</I> the gospel and 
 the promise of it, called the word of faith because it is the object of 
 faith about which it is conversant, the word which we believe;--because
 it is the precept of faith, commanding it, and making it the great 
 condition of justification;--and because it is the ordinary means by
 which faith is wrought and conveyed. Now what is this word of faith? We 
 have the tenour of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>,

 the sum of the gospel, which is plain and easy enough. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> What is promised to us: <I>Thou shalt be saved.</I> It is 
 salvation that the gospel exhibits and tenders--saved from guilt and
 wrath, with the salvation of the soul, an eternal salvation, which 
 Christ is the author of, a Saviour to the uttermost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Upon what terms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Two things are required as conditions of 
 salvation:--

 (<I>a.</I>) <I>Confessing the Lord Jesus</I>--openly professing relation
 to him and dependence on him, as our prince and Saviour, owning 
 Christianity in the face of all the allurements and affrightments of 
 this world, standing by him in all weathers. Our Lord Jesus lays a 
 great stress upon this confessing of him before men; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32,33">Matt. x. 32, 33</A>.
 
 It is the product of many graces, evinces a great deal of self-denial,
 love to Christ, contempt of the world, a mighty courage and resolution. 
 It was a very great thing, especially, when the profession of Christ or 
 Christianity hazarded estate, honour, preferment, liberty, life, and 
 all that is dear in this world, which was the case in the primitive 
 times. 

 (<I>b.</I>) <I>Believing in the heart that God raised him from the 
 dead.</I> The profession of faith with the mouth, if there be not the 
 power of it in the heart, is but a mockery; the root of it must be laid 
 in an unfeigned assent to the revelation of the gospel concerning 
 Christ, especially concerning his resurrection, which is the 
 fundamental article of the Christian faith, for thereby he was declared 
 to be the Son of God with power, and full evidence was given that God 
 accepted his satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> This is further illustrated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and the order inverted, because there must first be faith in the heart 
 before there can be an acceptable confession with the mouth. 

 (<I>a.</I>) Concerning faith: It is <I>with the heart that man 
 believeth,</I> which implies more than an assent of the understanding, 
 and takes in the consent of the will, an inward, hearty, sincere, and 
 strong consent. It is not believing (not to be reckoned so) if it be 
 not with the heart. This is <I>unto righteousness.</I> There is the 
 righteousness of justification and the righteousness of sanctification.
 Faith is to both; it is the condition of our justification

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>),

 and it is the root and spring of our sanctification; in it it is begun;
 by it it is carried on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9">Acts xv. 9</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) Concerning profession: It is with <I>the mouth that
 confession is made</I>--confession to God in prayer and praise 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6"><I>ch.</I> xv. 6</A>),

 confession to men by owning the ways of God before others, especially
 when we are called to it in a day of persecution. It is fit that God
 should be honoured with the mouth, for he made man's mouth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:11">Exod. iv. 11</A>),

 and at such a time has promised to give his faithful people a <I>mouth
 and wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:15">Luke xxi. 15</A>.

 It is part of the honour of Christ that every tongue shall confess,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:11">Phil. ii. 11</A>.

 And this is said to be <I>unto salvation,</I> because it is the
 performance of the condition of that promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32">Matt. x. 32</A>.

 Justification by faith lays the foundation of our title to salvation;
 but by confession we build upon that foundation, and come at last to 
 the full possession of that to which we were entitled. So that we have 
 here a brief summary of the terms of salvation, and they are very 
 reasonable; in short this, that we must devote, dedicate, and give up, 
 to God, our souls and our bodies--our souls in believing with the 
 heart, and our bodies in confessing with the mouth. This do, and thou 
 shalt live. For this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 he quotes 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>,

 <I>Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed;</I> <B><I>ou 
 kataischynthesetai.</I></B> That is, 

 [<I>a.</I>] He will not be ashamed to own that Christ in whom he 
 trusts; he that believes in the heart will not be ashamed to confess 
 with the mouth. It is sinful shame that makes people deny Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:38">Mark viii. 38</A>.

 He that believeth will not make haste (so the prophet has it)--will not 
 make haste to run away from the sufferings he meets with in the way of 
 his duty, will not be ashamed of a despised religion. 

 [<I>b.</I>] He shall not be ashamed of his hope in Christ; he shall not 
 be disappointed of his end. It is our duty that we must not, it is our 
 privilege that we shall not, be ashamed of our faith in Christ. He 
 shall never have cause to repent his confidence in reposing such a 
 trust in the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek:
 for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
 &nbsp; 13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
 saved.
 &nbsp; 14  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
 believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not
 heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
 &nbsp; 15  And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is
 written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
 gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
 &nbsp; 16  But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,
 Lord, who hath believed our report?
 &nbsp; 17  So then faith <I>cometh</I> by hearing, and hearing by the word
 of God.
 &nbsp; 18  But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
 into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
 &nbsp; 19  But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
 provoke you to jealousy by <I>them that are</I> no people, <I>and</I> by a
 foolish nation I will anger you.
 &nbsp; 20  But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
 sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after
 me.
 &nbsp; 21  But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth
 my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words express the design of the apostle through these verses, 
 that there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles, but they stand 
 upon the same level in point of acceptance with God. In Jesus Christ 
 there is neither Greek nor Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.

 God doth not save any nor reject any because they are Jews, nor because
 they are Greeks, but doth equally accept both upon gospel terms: 
 <I>There is no difference.</I> For the proof of this he urges two 
 arguments:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God is the same to all: <I>The same Lord over all is rich unto 
 all.</I> There is not one God to the Jews who is more kind, and another 
 to the Gentiles who is less kind; but he is the same to all, a common 
 father to all mankind. When he proclaimed his name, <I>The Lord, the 
 Lord god, gracious and merciful,</I> he thereby signified not only what 
 he was to the Jews, but what he is and will be to all his creatures 
 that seek unto him: not only good, but rich, plenteous in goodness: he
 hath wherewith to supply them all, and he is free and ready to give out 
 to them; he is both able and willing: not only rich, but rich unto us, 
 liberal and bountiful in dispensing his favours <I>to all that call 
 upon him.</I> Something must be done by us, that we may reap of this 
 bounty; and it is as little as can be, we must call upon him. He will 
 for this be enquired of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37">Ezek. xxxvi. 37</A>),

 and surely that which is not worth the asking is not worth the having. 
 We have nothing to do but to draw out by prayer, as there is 
 occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the promise is the same to all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Whoever shall call</I>--one as well as another, without exception. 
 This extent, this undifferencing extent, of the promise both to Jews 
 and Gentiles he thinks should not be surprising, for it was foretold by 
 the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:32">Joel ii. 32</A>.

 Calling upon the name of the Lord is here put for all practical
 religion. What is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It 
 implies a sense of our dependence on him, an entire dedication of 
 ourselves to him, and a believing expectation of our all from him. He 
 that thus calls upon him shall be saved. It is but ask and have; what 
 would we have more? for the further illustration of this he 
 observes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How necessary it was that the gospel should be preached to the 
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 This was what the Jews were so angry with Paul for, that he was the 
 apostle of the Gentiles, and preached the gospel to them. Now he shows 
 how needful it was to bring them within the reach of the forementioned 
 promise, an interest in which they should not envy to any of their 
 fellow-creatures.

 (1.) <I>They cannot call on him in whom they have not believed.</I> 
 Except they believe that he is God, they will not call upon him by 
 prayer; to what purpose should they? The grace of faith is absolutely 
 necessary to the duty of prayer; we cannot pray aright, nor pray to 
 acceptation, without it. He that comes to God by prayer must believe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.

 Till they believed the true God, they were calling upon idols, O Baal, 
 hear us.

 (2.) <I>They cannot believe in him of whom they have not heard.</I>
 some way or other the divine revelation must be made known to us, 
 before we can receive it and assent to it; it is not born with us. In 
 hearing is included reading, which is tantamount, and by which many are 
 brought to believe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:31">John xx. 31</A>):

 <I>These things are written that you may believe.</I> But hearing only 
 is mentioned, as the more ordinary and natural way of receiving 
 information. 

 (3.) <I>They cannot hear without a preacher;</I> how should they? 
 Somebody must tell them what they are to believe. Preachers and
 hearers are correlates; it is a blessed thing when they mutually 
 rejoice in each other--the hearers in the skill and faithfulness of the 
 preacher, and the preacher in the willingness and obedience of the 
 hearers. 

 (4.) <I>They cannot preach except they be sent,</I> except they be both 
 commissioned and in some measure qualified for their preaching work. 
 How shall a man act as an ambassador, unless he have both his 
 credentials and his instructions from the prince that sends him? This 
 proves that to the regular ministry there must be a regular mission and 
 ordination. It is God's prerogative to send ministers; he is the Lord 
 of the harvest, and therefore to him we must <I>pray that he would send 
 forth labourers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:38">Matt. ix. 38</A>.

 He only can qualify men for, and incline them to, the work of the
 ministry. But the competency of that qualification, and the sincerity 
 of that inclination, must not be left to the judgment of every man for 
 himself: the nature of the thing will by no means admit this; but, for 
 the preservation of due order in the church, this must needs be 
 referred and submitted to the judgment of a competent number of those 
 who are themselves in that office and of approved wisdom and experience 
 in it, who, as in all other callings, are presumed the most able 
 judges, and who are empowered to set apart such as they find so 
 qualified and inclined to this work of the ministry, that by this 
 preservation of the succession the name of Christ may endure for ever 
 and his throne as the days of heaven. And those that are thus set 
 apart, not only may, but must preach, as those that are sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached, 
 because it showed the way to salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 For this he quotes
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7">Isa. lii. 7</A>.
 
 The like passage we have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:15">Nah. i. 15</A>,

 which, if it point at the glad tidings of the deliverance of Israel out 
 of Babylon in the type, yet looks further to the gospel, the good news 
 of our salvation by Jesus Christ. Observe,

 (1.) What the gospel is: It is <I>the gospel of peace;</I> it is the
 word of reconciliation between God and man. <I>On earth peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14">Luke ii. 14</A>.

 Or, peace is put in general for all good; so it is explained here; it 
 is <I>glad tidings of good things.</I> The things of the gospel are 
 good things indeed, the best things; tidings concerning them are the 
 most joyful tidings, the best news that ever came from heaven to earth.

 (2.) What the work of ministers is: To preach this gospel, to <I>bring
 these glad tidings;</I> to <I>evangelize peace</I> (so the original 
 is), to evangelize good things. Every good preacher is in this sense an 
 evangelist: he is not only a messenger to carry the news, but an 
 ambassador to treat; and the first gospel preachers were angels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:13">Luke ii. 13</A>,

 &c. 

 (3.) How acceptable they should therefore be to the children of men for 
 their work's sake: <I>How beautiful are the feet,</I> that is, how 
 welcome are they! Mary Magdalene expressed her love to Christ by 
 kissing his feet, and afterwards by holding him by the feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9">Matt. xxviii. 9</A>.
 
 And, when Christ was sending forth his disciples, he washed their feet.
 Those that preach the gospel of peace should see to it that their feet
 (their life and conversation) be beautiful: the holiness of ministers'
 lives is the beauty of their feet. <I>How beautiful!</I> namely, in the
 eyes of those that hear them. Those that welcome the message cannot but
 love the messengers. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:12,13">1 Thess. v. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He answers an objection against all this, which might be taken from 
 the little success which the gospel had in many places 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>But they have not all obeyed the gospel.</I> All the Jews have not, 
 all the Gentiles have not; far the greater part of both remain in 
 unbelief and disobedience. Observe, The gospel is given us not only to 
 be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, 
 but a rule of practice. This little success of the word was likewise 
 foretold by the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>):

 <I>Who hath believed our report?</I> Very few have, few to what one 
 would think should have believed it, considering how faithful a report 
 it is and how well worthy of all acceptation,--very few to the many 
 that persist in unbelief. It is no strange thing, but it is a very sad 
 and uncomfortable thing, for the ministers of Christ to bring the 
 report of the gospel, and not to be believed in it. Under such a 
 melancholy consideration it is good for us to go to God and make our 
 complaint to him. <I>Lord, who hath believed,</I> &c. In answer to 
 this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows that the word preached is the ordinary means of working 
 faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>So then,</I> <B><I>ara</I></B>--<I>however;</I> though many that 
 hear do not believe, yet those that believe have first heard. <I>Faith 
 cometh by hearing.</I> It is the summary of what he had said before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The beginning, progress, and strength of faith, are by hearing. The 
 word of God is therefore called <I>the word of faith:</I> it begets and 
 nourishes faith. God gives faith, but it is by the word as the 
 instrument. <I>Hearing</I> (that hearing which works faith) is <I>by 
 the word of God.</I> It is not hearing the enticing words of man's 
 wisdom, but hearing the word of God, that will befriend faith, and 
 hearing it as the word of God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13">1 Thess. ii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That those who would not believe the report of the gospel, yet, 
 having heard it, were thereby left inexcusable, and may thank 
 themselves for their own ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 <I>to the end.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The Gentiles have heard it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Have they not heard?</I> Yes, more or less, they have either heard 
 the gospel, or at least heard of it. <I>Their sound went into all the 
 earth;</I> not only a confused sound, but their <I>words</I> (more 
 distinct and intelligible notices of these things) are <I>gone unto the 
 ends of the world.</I> The commission which the apostles received runs 
 thus: <I>Go you into all the world--preach to every creature--disciple 
 all nations;</I> and they did with indefatigable industry and wonderful 
 success pursue that commission. See the extent of Paul's province,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>.

 To this remote island of Britain, one of the utmost corners of the
 world, not only the sound, but the words, of the gospel came within a 
 few years after Christ's ascension. It was in order to this that the 
 gift of tongues was at the very first poured so plentifully upon the 
 apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-47">Acts ii</A>.

 In the expression here he plainly alludes to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:4">Ps. xix. 4</A>,

 which speaks of the notices which the visible works of God in the
 creation give to all the world of the power and Godhead of the Creator.
 As under the Old Testament God provided for the publishing of the work 
 of creation by the sun, moon, and stars, so now for the publishing of 
 the work of redemption to all the world by the preaching of gospel 
 ministers, who are therefore called <I>stars.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The Jews have heard it too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 For this he appeals to two passages of the Old Testament, to show how 
 inexcusable they are too. <I>Did not Israel know</I> that the Gentiles 
 were to be called in? They might have known it from Moses and
 Isaiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> One is taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21">Deut. xxxii. 21</A>,

 <I>I will provoke you to jealousy.</I> The Jews not only had the offer,
 but saw the Gentiles accepting it and benefitted by that acceptance, 
 witness their vexation at the event. They had the refusal: <I>To you 
 first,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>.

 In all places where the apostles came still the Jews had the first
 offer, and the Gentiles had but their leavings. If one would not, 
 another would. Now this provoked them to jealousy. They, as the elder 
 brother in the parable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:1-32">Luke xv.</A>)

 envied the reception and entertainment of the prodigal Gentiles upon
 their repentance. The Gentiles are here called <I>no people,</I> and 
 <I>a foolish nation,</I> that is, not the professing people of God. How 
 much soever there be of the wit and wisdom of the world, those that are 
 not the people of God are, and in the end will be found to be, a 
 foolish people. Such was the state of the Gentile world, who yet were 
 made the people of God, and Christ to them the wisdom of God. What a 
 provocation it was to the Jews to see the Gentiles taken into favour we 
 may see, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:45,17:5,13">Acts xiii. 45; xvii. 5, 13</A>,
 
 and especially

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:22">Acts xxii. 22</A>.

 It was an instance of the great wickedness of the Jews that they were
 thus enraged; and this in Deuteronomy is the matter of a threatening. 
 God often makes people's sin their punishment. A man needs no greater 
 plague than to be left to the impetuous rage of his own lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Another is taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1,2">Isa. lxv. 1, 2</A>,

 which is very full, and in it Esaias is very bold--bold indeed, to
 speak so plainly of the rejection of his own countrymen. Those that 
 will be found faithful have need to be very bold. Those that are 
 resolved to please God must not be afraid to displease any man. Now 
 Esaias speaks boldly and plainly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Of the preventing grace and favour of God in the reception 
 and entertainment of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I was found of those that sought me not.</I> The prescribed method 
 is, Seek and find; this is a rule for us, not a rule for God, who is 
 often found of those that do not seek. His grace is his own, 
 distinguishing grace his own, and he dispenses it in a way of 
 sovereignty, gives of withholds it at pleasure--anticipates us with the 
 blessings, the riches choicest blessings, of his goodness. Thus he 
 manifested himself to the Gentiles, by sending the light of the gospel 
 among them, when they were so far from seeking him and asking after him 
 that they were following after lying vanities, and serving dumb idols. 
 Was not this our own particular case? Did not God begin in love, and 
 manifest himself to us when we did not ask after him? And was not that 
 a time of love indeed, to be often remembered with a great deal of 
 thankfulness?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Of the obstinacy and perverseness of Israel, notwithstanding 
 the fair offers and affectionate invitations they had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) God's great goodness to them: <I>All day long I have 
 stretched forth my hands.</I> 

 [<I>a.</I>] His offers: <I>I have stretched forth my hands,</I> 
 offering them life and salvation with the greatest sincerity and 
 seriousness that can be, with all possible expressions of earnestness 
 and importunity, showing them the happiness tendered, setting it before 
 them with the greatest evidence, reasoning the case with them. 
 Stretching forth the hands is the gesture of those that require 
 audience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:1">Acts xxvi. 1</A>),
 
 or desire acceptance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24">Prov. i. 24</A>.
 
 Christ was crucified with his hands stretched out. <I>Stretched forth
 my hands</I> as offering reconciliation--come let us shake hands and be
 friends; and our duty is to give the hand to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:8">2 Chron. xxx. 8</A>.
 
 [<I>b.</I>] His patience in making these offers: <I>All day long.</I>
 The patience of God towards provoking sinners is admirable. He waits to
 be gracious. The time of God's patience is here called a day, lightsome
 as a day and fit for work and business, but limited as a day, and a
 night at the end of it. he bears long, but he will not bear always.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) Their great badness to him. They were a <I>disobedient
 gainsaying people.</I> One word in the Hebrew, in Isaiah, is here well 
 explained by two; not only disobedient to the call, not yielding to it, 
 but gainsaying, and quarrelling with it, which is much worse. Many that 
 will not accept of a good proposal will yet acknowledge that they have
 nothing to say against it: but the Jews who believed not rested not 
 there, but contradicted and blasphemed. God's patience with them was a 
 very great aggravation of their disobedience, and rendered it the more 
 exceedingly sinful; as their disobedience advanced the honour of God's 
 patience and rendered it the more exceedingly gracious. It is a wonder 
 of mercy in God that his goodness is not overcome by man's badness; and 
 it is a wonder of wickedness in man that his badness is not overcome by 
 God's goodness.</P>
