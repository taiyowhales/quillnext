 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have, with a great deal of pleasure, attended the apostle in his
 travels throughout the Gentile nations to preach the gospel, and have
 seen a great harvest of souls gathered in to Christ; there we have seen
 likewise what persecutions he endured; yet still out of them all the
 Lord presently delivered him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11">2 Tim. iii. 11</A>.

 But now we are to attend him to Jerusalem, and there into lasting
 bonds; the days of his service now seem to be over, and nothing to 
 remain but days of suffering, days of darkness, for they are many. It 
 is a thousand pities that such a workman should be laid aside; yet so 
 it is, and we must not only acquiesce, as his friends then did, saying, 
 "The will of the Lord be done;" but we must believe, and shall find 
 reason to do so, that Paul in the prison, and at the bar, is as truly 
 glorifying God, and serving Christ's interest, as Paul in the pulpit 
 was. In this chapter we have,

 I. A journal of Paul's voyage from Ephesus to C&aelig;sarea, the next
 sea-port to Jerusalem, some places he touched at, and his landing there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The struggles he had with his friends at C&aelig;sarea, who
 mightily opposed his going up to Jerusalem, but could not prevail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:8-14">ver. 8-14</A>.

 III. Paul's journey from C&aelig;sarea to Jerusalem, and the kind 
 entertainment which the Christians there gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 IV. His compliance with the persuasions of the brethren there, who
 advised him so far to compliment the Jews as to go and purify that it 
 might appear he was no such enemy to the Mosaic rites and ceremonies as 
 he was reported to be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:18-26">ver. 18-26</A>.

 V. The turning of this very thing against him by the Jews, and the 
 apprehending of him in the temple as a criminal thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>.
 
 VI. The narrow escape he had of being pulled to pieces by the rabble, 
 and the taking of him into fair and legal custody by the chief captain, 
 who permitted him to speak for himself to the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:31-40">ver. 31-40</A>.

 And so we have him made a prisoner, and shall never have him otherwise 
 to the end of the history of this book.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and
 had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the
 <I>day</I> following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
 &nbsp; 2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went
 aboard, and set forth.
 &nbsp; 3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left
 hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the
 ship was to unlade her burden.
 &nbsp; 4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said
 to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
 our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and
 children, till <I>we were</I> out of the city: and we kneeled down on
 the shore, and prayed.
 &nbsp; 6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
 and they returned home again.
 &nbsp; 7 And when we had finished <I>our</I> course from Tyre, we came to
 Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How much ado Paul had to get clear from Ephesus, intimated in the 
 first words of the chapter, <I>after we had gotten from them,</I> that 
 is, were drawn from them as by violence. It was a force put upon both 
 sides; Paul was loth to leave them, and they were loth to part with 
 him, and yet there was no remedy, but so it must be. When good people 
 are taken away by death, they are, as it were, gotten from their 
 friends here below, who struggled hard to have detained them if 
 possible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a prosperous voyage they had thence. Without any difficulty, 
 <I>they came with a straight course,</I> by direct sailing, <I>to 
 Coos,</I> a famous Grecian island,--<I>the next day to Rhodes,</I>
 talked of for the Colossus there,--<I>thence to Patara,</I> a famous
 port, the metropolis of Lycia 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 here they very happily <I>found a ship sailing over into Phenicia,</I>
 the very course they were steering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Providence must be acknowledged when things happen thus opportunely, 
 and we are favoured by some little circumstances that contribute to the 
 expediting of our affairs; and we must say, <I>It is God that maketh 
 our way perfect.</I> This ship that was bound for Phenicia (that is, 
 Tyre) they took the convenience of, <I>went on board, and set sail</I> 
 for Tyre. In this voyage <I>they discovered Cyprus,</I> the island that 
 Barnabas was of, and which he took care of, and therefore Paul did not 
 visit it, but <I>we left it on the left hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>sailed</I> upon the coast of <I>Syria, and</I> at length <I>landed
 at Tyre,</I> that celebrated mart of the nations, so it had been, but 
 was now reduced; yet something of a trade it had still, <I>for there 
 the ship was to unlade her burden,</I> and did so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The halt that Paul made at Tyre; when he had arrived there, he was 
 upon the coast of the land of Israel, and found now that he could 
 compass the remainder of his journey within the time he had fixed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>At Tyre he found disciples,</I> some that had embraced the 
 gospel, and professed the Christian faith. Observe, Wherever Paul came, 
 he enquired what disciples were there, found them out, and associated 
 with them; for we know what is the usage with birds of a feather. When 
 Christ was upon earth, though he went sometimes into the coast of Tyre, 
 yet he never went thither to preach the gospel there; nor did he think 
 fit to afford to Tyre and Sidon the advantages which Chorazin and 
 Bethsaida had, though he knew that if they had had them they would have 
 made a better improvement of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:13,14">Luke x. 13, 14</A>.

 But, after the enlarging of the gospel-commission, Christ was preached
 at Tyre, and had disciples there; and to this, some think, that 
 prophecy concerning Tyre had reference

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>),

 <I>Her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Paul, <I>finding those disciples at Tyre, tarried there seven 
 days,</I> they urging him to stay with them as long as he could. He 
 staid seven days at Troas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6"><I>ch.</I> xx. 6</A>),

 and here so many days at Tyre, that he might be sure to spend one
 Lord's day with them, and so might have an opportunity of preaching 
 publicly among them; for it is the desire of good men to do good 
 wherever they come, and where we find disciples we may either benefit 
 them or be benefited by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The disciples at Tyre were endowed with such gifts that they could 
 by the Spirit foretel the troubles Paul would meet with at Jerusalem; 
 for <I>the Holy Ghost witnessed it in every city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:23"><I>ch.</I> xx. 23</A>.

 Being a thing that would be so much talked of when it came to pass, God
 saw fit to have it much prophesied of before, that people's faith, 
 instead of being offended, might be confirmed. And withal they were 
 endowed with such graces that foreseeing his troubles, out of love to 
 him and concern for the church, especially the churches of the 
 Gentiles, that could ill spare him, they begged of him <I>that he would 
 not go up to Jerusalem,</I> for they hoped the decree was conditional: 
 If he go up, he will come into trouble there; as the prediction to 
 David <I>that the men of Keilah will deliver him up</I> (that is, if he 
 <I>venture himself with them</I>); and therefore they said to him, 
 <I>by the Spirit, that he should not go up,</I> because they concluded 
 it would be most for the glory of God that he should continue at 
 liberty; and it was not at all their fault to think so, and 
 consequently to dissuade him; but it was their mistake, for his trial 
 would be for the glory of God and the furtherance of the gospel, and he 
 knew it; and the importunity that was used with him, to dissuade him 
 from it, renders his pious and truly heroic resolution the more 
 illustrious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The disciples of Tyre, though they were none of Paul's converts, yet 
 showed a very great respect to Paul, whose usefulness in the church 
 they had heard so much of when he departed from Tyre. Though they had 
 had but seven days' acquaintance with him, yet, as if he had been some 
 great man, they all came together, <I>with their wives and 
 children,</I> solemnly to take leave of him, to beg his blessing, and 
 to bring him as far on his way as the sea would permit them. Note, 

 (1.) We should pay respect, not only to our own ministers, that are 
 over us in the Lord, and admonish us, and, for their work's sake among 
 us, <I>esteem them highly in love,</I> but we must, as there is 
 occasion, testify our love and respect to all the faithful ministers of 
 Christ, both for his sake whose ministers they are, and for their 
 work's sake among others. 

 (2.) We must, in a particular manner, honour those whom God hath 
 singularly honoured, by making them eminently useful in their 
 generation. 

 (3.) It is good to train up children in a respect to good people and 
 good ministers. This was particularly remarkable at Tyre, which we have 
 not met with any where else, that they brought their wives and children 
 to attend Paul, to do him the more honour and to receive benefit by his 
 instructions and prayers; and as angry notice was taken of the children 
 of the idolaters of Bethel, that mocked a prophet, so, no doubt, 
 gracious notice was taken of the children of the disciples at Tyre, 
 that honoured an apostle, as Christ accepted the hosannas of the little 
 children. 

 (4.) We should be good husbands of our opportunities, and make the 
 utmost we can of them for the good of our souls. <I>They brought Paul 
 on his way,</I> that they might have so much the more of his company 
 and his prayers. Some refer us to
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:12">Ps. xlv. 12</A>,

 as a prediction of this, <I>The daughter of Tyre shall be there with a
 gift;</I> for it is probable that they made some presents to Paul at 
 parting, as usual to our friends that are going to sea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:10"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They parted with prayer, as Paul and the Ephesians elders had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:36"><I>ch.</I> xx. 36</A>.

 Thus Paul has taught us by example, as well as rule, to pray always, to
 pray without ceasing. <I>We kneeled down on the shore and prayed.</I> 
 Paul prayed for himself, prayed for them, prayed for all the churches; 
 as he was much in prayer so he was mighty in prayer. They prayed upon 
 the shore, that their last farewell might be sanctified and sweetened 
 with prayer. Those that are going to sea should, when they quit the 
 shore, commit themselves to God by prayer, and put themselves under his 
 protection, as those that hope, even when they leave the <I>terra 
 firma,</I> to find firm footing for their faith in the providence and 
 promise of God. They kneeled down on the shore, though we may suppose 
 it either stony or dirty, and there prayed. Paul would <I>that men 
 should pray every where,</I> and so he did himself; and, where he 
 lifted up his prayer, he bowed his knees. Mr. George Herbert says, 
 <I>Kneeling never spoiled silk stockings.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They parted at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>When we had taken our leave one of another,</I> with the most 
 affectionate embraces and expressions of love and grief, <I>we took 
 ship</I> to be gone, and <I>they returned home again,</I> each 
 complaining that this is a parting world. Observe how they disposed of 
 themselves: "We, that had a journey before us, took ship, thankful that 
 we had a ship to carry us; and those, who had no occasions to call them 
 abroad returned home again, thankful that they had a home to go to." 
 <I>Rejoice Zebulun in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents.</I> 
 Paul left his blessing behind him with those that returned home, and 
 those that staid sent their prayers after those that went to sea.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their arrival at Ptolemais, which was not far from Tyre 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 
 <I>We came to Ptolemais,</I> which some think is the same place with 
 Accho, which we find in the tribe of Asher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:31">Judg. i. 31</A>.

 Paul begged leave to go ashore there, <I>to salute the brethren,</I> to
 enquire of their state, and to testify his good will to them; though he 
 could not stay long with them, yet he would not pass by them without 
 paying his respects to them, and he <I>abode with them one day,</I> 
 perhaps it was a Lord's day; better a short stay than no visit.</P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>The Prophecy of Agabus; Paul's Adherence to His Resolution to Visit Jerusalem.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the next <I>day</I> we that were of Paul's company departed,
 and came unto C&aelig;sarea: and we entered into the house of Philip
 the evangelist, which was <I>one</I> of the seven; and abode with him.
 &nbsp; 9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
 prophesy.
 &nbsp; 10 And as we tarried <I>there</I> many days, there came down from
 Jud&aelig;a a certain prophet, named Agabus.
 &nbsp; 11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and
 bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy
 Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth
 this girdle, and shall deliver <I>him</I> into the hands of the
 Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
 place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
 heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at
 Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The
 will of the Lord be done.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Paul and his company arrived at length at C&aelig;sarea, where
 he designed to make some stay, it being the place where the gospel was 
 first preached to the Gentiles, and <I>the Holy Ghost fell upon 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1,44"><I>ch.</I> x. 1, 44</A>.

 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who it was that entertained Paul and his company <I>at 
 C&aelig;sarea.</I> He seldom had occasion to go to a public house, but, 
 wherever he came, some friend or other took him in, and bade him 
 welcome. Observe, those that had sailed together parted when the voyage 
 was accomplished, according as their business was. "Those that were 
 concerned in the cargo staid where the ship was <I>to unlade her
 burden</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 others, when they came to Ptolemais, went as their occasions led them;
 but we that were of Paul's company went where he went, and came to 
 C&aelig;sarea." Those that travel together through this world will separate
 at death, and then it will appear who are of Paul's company and who are 
 not. Now at C&aelig;sarea.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were entertained by Philip the evangelist, whom we left at 
 C&aelig;sarea many years ago, after he had baptized the eunuch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:40"><I>ch.</I> viii. 40</A>),

 and there we now find him again. 

 (1.) He was originally a deacon, one of the seven that were chosen to 
 serve tables,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:5"><I>ch.</I> vi. 5</A>.

 (2.) He was now and had long been an evangelist, one that went about to
 plant and water churches, as the apostles did, and gave himself, as 
 they did, <I>to the word and prayer;</I> thus, having <I>used the 
 office of a deacon well, he purchased to himself a good degree;</I> 
 and, having been <I>faithful in a few things, was made ruler over many 
 things.</I> 

 (3.) He had a house at C&aelig;sarea, fit to entertain Paul and all his 
 company, and he bade him and them very welcome to it; <I>We entered 
 into the house of Philip the evangelist, and we abode with him.</I> 
 Thus does it become Christians and ministers, according as their 
 ability is, to <I>use hospitality one to another, without grudging,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9">1 Pet. iv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This Philip <I>had four maiden daughters, who did prophesy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It intimates that they prophesied of Paul's troubles at Jerusalem, as 
 others had done, and dissuaded him from going; or perhaps they 
 prophesied for his comfort and encouragement, in reference to the 
 difficulties that were before him. Here was a further accomplishment of 
 that prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joel ii. 28</A>,

 of such a plentiful pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh that their
 <I>sons and their daughters should prophesy,</I> that is, foretel 
 things to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A plain and full prediction of the sufferings of Paul, by a noted 
 prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 1. Paul and his company tarried many days at C&aelig;sarea, perhaps 
 Cornelius was yet living there, and (though Philip lodged them) yet 
 might be many ways kind to them, and induce them to stay there. What 
 cause Paul saw to tarry so long there, and to make so little haste at 
 the latter end of his journey to Jerusalem, when he seemed so much in 
 haste at the beginning of it, we cannot tell; but we are sure he did 
 not stay either there or any where else to be idle; he measured his 
 time by days, and numbered them. 

 2. <I>Agabus the prophet came to C&aelig;sarea from Judea;</I> this was
 he of whom we read before, who came <I>from Jerusalem to Antioch,</I> 
 to foretel a general famine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:27,28"><I>ch.</I> xi. 27, 28</A>.

 See how God dispenseth his gifts variously. To Paul was given the word 
 of wisdom and knowledge, as an apostle, by the Spirit, and the gifts of 
 healing; to Agabus, and to Philip's daughters, was given prophecy, by 
 the same Spirit--the foretelling of things to come, which came to pass
 according to the prediction. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:8,10">1 Cor. xii. 8, 10</A>.

 So that that which was the most eminent gift of the Spirit under the
 Old Testament, the foretelling of things to come, was under the New 
 Testament quite outshone by other gifts, and was bestowed upon those 
 that were of less note in the church. It should seem as if Agabus came 
 on purpose to C&aelig;sarea, to meet Paul with this prophetic 
 intelligence.

 3. He foretold Paul's bonds at Jerusalem,

 (1.) By a sign, as the prophets of old did, Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:3"><I>ch.</I> xx. 3</A>),

 Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:1,27:2"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 1; xxvii. 2</A>),

 Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:1,12:3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1; xii. 3</A>),

 and many others. <I>Agabus took Paul's girdle,</I> when he laid it by,
 or perhaps took it from about him, and with it <I>bound</I> first 
 <I>his own hands, and then his own feet,</I> or perhaps bound his hands 
 and feet together; this was designed both to confirm the prophecy (it 
 was as sure to be done as if it were done already) and to affect those 
 about him with it, because that which we see usually makes a greater 
 impression upon us than that which we only hear of. 

 (2.) By an explication of the sign: <I>Thus saith the Holy Ghost,</I> 
 the Spirit of prophecy, <I>So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man 
 that owneth this girdle, and,</I> as they dealt with his Master 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:18,19">Matt. xx. 18, 19</A>),

 <I>shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles,</I> as the Jews in 
 other places had all along endeavoured to do, by accusing him to the 
 Roman governors. Paul had this express warning given him of his 
 troubles, that he might prepare for them, and that when they came they 
 might be no surprise nor terror to him; the general notice given us 
 <I>that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of 
 God</I> should be of the same use to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great importunity which his friends used with him to dissuade 
 him from going forward to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "Not only those of that place, but we that were of Paul's company, and 
 among the rest Luke himself, who had heard this often before, and seen 
 Paul's resolution notwithstanding, besought him with tears that he 
 would not go up to Jerusalem, but steer his course some other way." 
 Now, 

 1. Here appeared a commendable affection to Paul, and a value for him,
 upon account of his great usefulness in the church. Good men that are
 very active sometimes need to be dissuaded from overworking themselves,
 and good men that are very bold need to be dissuaded from exposing
 themselves too far. <I>The Lord is for the body,</I> and so we must be.
 
 2. Yet there was a mixture of infirmity, especially in those of Paul's
 company, who knew he undertook this journey by divine direction, and 
 had seen with what resolution he had before broken through the like 
 opposition. But we see in them the infirmity incident to us all; when 
 we see trouble at a distance, and have only a general notice of it, we 
 can make light of it; but when it comes near we begin to shrink, and 
 draw back. <I>Now that it toucheth thee thou art troubled,</I>

 IV. The holy bravery and intrepidity with which Paul persisted in his 
 resolution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves them for dissuading him. Here is a quarrel of love on 
 both sides, and very sincere and strong affections clashing with each 
 other. They love him dearly, and therefore oppose his resolution; he 
 loves them dearly, and therefore chides them for opposing it: <I>What 
 mean you to weep and to break my heart?</I> They were an offence to 
 him, as Peter was to Christ, when, in a like case, he said, <I>Master, 
 spare thyself.</I> Their weeping about him <I>broke his heart.</I> 

 (1.) It was a temptation to him, it shocked him, it began to weaken
 and slacken his resolution, and caused him to entertain thoughts of 
 tacking about: "I know I am appointed to suffering, and you ought to 
 animate and encourage me, and to say that which will strengthen my 
 heart; but you, with your tears, break my heart, and discourage me. 
 What do you mean by doing thus? Has not our Master told us to take up 
 our cross? And would you have me to avoid mine?"

 (2.) It was a trouble to him that they should so earnestly press him to 
 that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his 
 conscience. Paul was of a very tender spirit. As he was much in tears 
 himself, so he had a compassionate regard to the tears of his friends; 
 they made a great impression upon him, and would bring him almost to 
 yield to any thing. But now it breaks his heart, when he is under a
 necessity of denying the request of his weeping friends. It was an 
 unkind kindness, a cruel pity, thus to torment him with their 
 dissuasions, and to add affliction to his grief. When our friends are 
 called out to sufferings, we shall show our love rather by comforting 
 them than by sorrowing for them. But observe, These Christians at 
 C&aelig;sarea, if they could have foreseen the particulars of that 
 event, the general notice of which they received with so much 
 heaviness, would have been better reconciled to it for their own sakes; 
 for, when Paul was made a prisoner at Jerusalem, he was presently sent 
 to C&aelig;sarea, the very place where he now was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:33"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 33</A>),
 
 and there he continued at least <I>two years</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:27"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 27</A>),
 
 and he was a prisoner at large, as appears
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:23"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 23</A>),

 orders being given that he should have liberty to go among his friends,
 and his friends to come to him; so that the church at C&aelig;sarea had 
 much more of Paul's company and help when he was imprisoned than they 
 could have had if he had been at liberty. That which we oppose, as 
 thinking it to operate much against us, may be overruled by the 
 providence of God to work for us, which is a reason why we should 
 follow providence, and not fear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He repeats his resolution to go forward, notwithstanding: "<I>What 
 mean you to weep thus? I am ready</I> to suffer whatever is appointed 
 for me. I am fully determined to go, whatever comes of it, and 
 therefore it is to no purpose for you to oppose it. I am willing to 
 suffer, and therefore why are you unwilling that I should suffer? Am 
 not I nearest myself, and fittest to judge for myself? If the trouble 
 found me unready, it would be a trouble indeed, and you might well weep 
 at the thoughts of it. But, blessed be God, it does not. It is very
 welcome to me, and therefore should not be such a terror to you. For my 
 part, <I>I am ready,</I>" <B><I>etoimos echo</I></B>--<I>I have myself
 in a readiness,</I> as soldiers for an engagement. "I expect trouble, I 
 count upon it, it will be no surprise to me. I was told at first 
 <I>what great things I must suffer,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:16"><I>ch.</I> ix. 16</A>.

 "I am <I>prepared</I> for it, by a clear conscience, a firm confidence
 in God, a holy contempt of the world and the body, a lively faith in 
 Christ, and a joyful hope of eternal life. I can <I>bid it welcome,</I> 
 as we do a friend that we look for, and have made preparation for. I 
 can, through grace, not only bear it, but rejoice in it." Now, 

 (1.) See how far his resolution extends: You are told that I must be 
 bound at Jerusalem, and you would have me keep away for fear of this. I 
 tell you, "<I>I am ready not only to be bound, but,</I> if the will of 
 God be so, <I>to die at Jerusalem;</I> not only to lose my liberty, but 
 to lose my life." It is our wisdom to think of the worst that may befal 
 us, and to prepare accordingly, that we may <I>stand complete in all 
 the will of God.</I> 

 (2.) See what it is that carries him out thus, that makes him willing 
 to suffer and die: it is <I>for the name of the Lord Jesus.</I> All 
 that a man has will he give for his life; but life itself will Paul 
 give for the service and honour of the name of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The patient acquiescence of his friends in his resolution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. They submitted to the wisdom of a good man. They had carried the
 matter as far as they could with decency; but, "<I>when he would not be 
 persuaded, we ceased</I> our importunity. Paul knows best his own
 mind, and what he has to do, and it becomes us to leave it to himself, 
 and not to censure him for what he does, nor to say he is rash, and 
 wilful, and humoursome, and has a spirit of contradiction, as some 
 people are apt to judge of those that will not do just as they would 
 have them do. No doubt, Paul has a good reason for his resolution, 
 though he sees cause to keep it to himself, and God has gracious ends 
 to serve in confirming him in it." It is good manners not to over-press 
 those in their own affairs that will not be persuaded. 

 2. They submitted to the will of a good God: <I>We ceased,</I> saying,
 <I>The will of the Lord be done.</I> They did not resolve his 
 resolution into his stubbornness, but into his willingness to suffer, 
 and God's will that he should. <I>Father in heaven, thy will be 
 done,</I> as it is a rule to our prayers and to our practice, so it is 
 to our patience. This may refer,

 (1.) To Paul's present firmness; he is inflexible, and unpersuadable, 
 and in this they see the will of the Lord done. "It is he that has 
 wrought this fixed resolution in him, and therefore we acquiesce in 
 it." Note, In the turning of the hearts of our friends or ministers, 
 this way or that way (and it may be quite another way than we could 
 wish), we should eye the hand of God, and submit to that. 

 (2.) To his approaching sufferings: "If there be no remedy, but Paul 
 will run himself into bonds, the will of the Lord Jesus be done. We 
 have done all that we could do on our parts to prevent it, and now we 
 leave it to God, we leave it to Christ, to whom the Father has 
 committed all judgment, and therefore we do, not as we will, but as he 
 will." Note, When we see trouble coming, and particularly that of our 
 ministers' being silenced or removed from us, it becomes us to say, 
 <I>The will of the Lord be done.</I> God is wise, and knows how to make 
 all work for good, and therefore "welcome his holy will." Not only, 
 "The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy;" but, "Let 
 the will of the Lord be done, for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth 
 all according to the counsel of it; let him therefore do with us and 
 ours as seemeth good in his eyes." When a trouble is come, this must 
 allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it 
 coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be 
 done, to which we must say, <I>Amen,</I> let it be done.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up
 to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 16 There went with us also <I>certain</I> of the disciples of
 C&aelig;sarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old
 disciple, with whom we should lodge.
 &nbsp; 17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
 gladly.
 &nbsp; 18 And the <I>day</I> following Paul went in with us unto James; and
 all the elders were present.
 &nbsp; 19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
 things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
 &nbsp; 20 And when they heard <I>it,</I> they glorified the Lord, and said
 unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there
 are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
 &nbsp; 21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the
 Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that
 they ought not to circumcise <I>their</I> children, neither to walk
 after the customs.
 &nbsp; 22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come
 together: for they will hear that thou art come.
 &nbsp; 23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men
 which have a vow on them;
 &nbsp; 24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges
 with them, that they may shave <I>their</I> heads: and all may know
 that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,
 are nothing; but <I>that</I> thou thyself also walkest orderly, and
 keepest the law.
 &nbsp; 25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written
 <I>and</I> concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that
 they keep themselves from <I>things</I> offered to idols, and from
 blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
 &nbsp; 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself
 with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment
 of the days of purification, until that an offering should be
 offered for every one of them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's journey to Jerusalem from C&aelig;sarea, and the company that went
 along with him. 

 1. They <I>took up their carriages,</I> their bag and baggage, and as
 it should seem, like poor travellers or soldiers, were their own 
 porters; so little had they of change of raiment. <I>Omnia mea mecum 
 porto--My property is all about me.</I> Some think they had with them
 the money that was collected in the churches of Macedonia and Achaia 
 for the poor saints at Jerusalem. If they could have persuaded Paul to 
 go some other way, they would gladly have gone along with him; but if, 
 notwithstanding their dissuasive, he will go to Jerusalem, they do no 
 say, "Let him go by himself then;" but as Thomas, in a like case, when 
 Christ would go into danger at Jerusalem, <I>Let us go and die with 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:16">John xi. 16</A>.

 Their resolution to cleave to Paul was like that of Ittai to cleave to 
 David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:21">2 Sam. xv. 21</A>):

 <I>In what place my Lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, 
 there also will thy servant be.</I> Thus Paul's boldness emboldened 
 them. 

 2. Certain of the disciples of C&aelig;sarea went along with them. 
 Whether they designed to go however, and took this opportunity of going 
 with so much good company, or whether they went on purpose to see if 
 they could do Paul any service and if possible prevent his trouble, or 
 at least minister to him in it, does not appear. The less while that 
 Paul is likely to enjoy his liberty the more industrious they are to 
 improve every opportunity of conversation with him. Elisha kept close 
 to Elijah when he knew the time was at hand that he should be taken up.

 3. They brought with them an honest old gentleman that had a house of
 his own at Jerusalem, in which he would gladly entertain Paul and his
 company, <I>one Mnason of Cyprus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>with whom we should
 lodge.</I> Such a great concourse of people there was to the feast that 
 it was a hard matter to get lodgings; the public houses would be taken 
 up by those of the better sort, and it was looked upon as a scandalous 
 thing for those that had private houses to let their rooms out at those 
 times, but they must freely accommodate strangers with them. Every one 
 then would choose his friends to be his guests, and Mnason took Paul 
 and his company to be his lodgers; though he had heard what trouble 
 Paul was likely to come into, which might bring those that entertained 
 him into trouble too, yet he shall be welcome to him, whatever comes of 
 it. This Mnason is called an <I>old disciple</I>--a disciple <I>from
 the beginning;</I> some think, one of the seventy disciples of Christ, 
 or one of the first converts after the pouring out of the Spirit, or 
 one of the first that was converted by the preaching of the gospel in 
 Cyprus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:4"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 4</A>.

 However it was, it seems he had been long a Christian, and was now in
 years. Note, It is an honourable thing to be an old disciple of Jesus 
 Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a 
 course of duty, stedfast in the faith, and growing more and more 
 prudent and experienced to a good old age. And with these old disciples 
 one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years will teach 
 wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul's welcome at Jerusalem. 

 1. Many of the brethren there <I>received him gladly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 As soon as they had notice that he was come to town, they went to his
 lodgings at Mnason's house, and congratulated him on his safe arrival, 
 and told him they were glad to see him, and invited him to their 
 houses, accounting it an honour to be known to one that was such an 
 eminent servant of Christ. Streso observes that the word here used 
 concerning the welcome they gave to the apostles, <B><I>asmenos 
 apodechein,</I></B> is used concerning the welcome of the apostles' 
 doctrine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:41"><I>ch.</I> ii. 41</A>.

 They <I>gladly received his word.</I> We think if we had Paul among us
 we should gladly receive him; but it is a question whether we should or 
 no it, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that. 

 2. They paid a visit to James and the elders of the church, at a
 church-meeting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>The day following, Paul went unto James,</I> and took us with him,
 that were his companions, to introduce us into acquaintance with the 
 church at Jerusalem." It should seem that James was now the only 
 apostle that was resident at Jerusalem; the rest had dispersed 
 themselves to preach the gospel in other places. But still they 
 forecasted to have an apostle at Jerusalem, perhaps sometimes one and 
 sometimes another, because there was a great resort thither from all 
 parts. James was now upon the spot, and all the elders or presbyters 
 that were the ordinary pastors of the church, both to preach and 
 govern, were present. Paul saluted them all, paid his respects to them, 
 enquired concerning their welfare, and gave them the right hand of 
 fellowship. He <I>saluted them,</I> that is, he wished them all health 
 and happiness, and prayed to God to bless them. The proper
 signification of salutation is, wishing salvation to you: <I>salve,</I> 
 or <I>salus tibi sit;</I> like <I>peace be unto you.</I> And such 
 mutual salutations, or good wishes, very well become Christians, in 
 token of their love to each other and joint regard to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account they had from him of his ministry among the Gentiles, 
 and their satisfaction in it. 

 1. He gave them a narrative of the success of the gospel in those
 countries where he had been employed, knowing it would be very 
 acceptable to them to hear of the enlarging of Christ's kingdom: <I>He 
 declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by 
 his ministry,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Observe how modestly he speaks, not what things he had wrought (he was 
 but the instrument), but what God had wrought by his ministry. It was 
 <I>not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</I> He planted and 
 watered, but God gave the increase. He declared it particularly, that 
 the grace of God might appear the more illustrious in the circumstances 
 of his success. Thus David will tell others what God has done for his 
 soul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>),

 as Paul here what God has done by his hand, and both that their friends
 may help them to be thankful.

 2. Hence they took occasion to give praise to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>When they heart it, they glorified the Lord.</I> Paul ascribed it 
 all to God, and to God they gave the praise of it. They did not break 
 out into high encomiums of Paul, but left it to his Master to say to 
 him, <I>Well done, good and faithful servant;</I> but they gave glory 
 to the grace of God, which was extended to the Gentiles. Note, The 
 conversion of sinners ought to be the matter of our joy and praise as 
 it is of the angels'. God had honoured Paul more than any of them, in 
 making his usefulness more extensive, yet they did not envy him, nor 
 were they jealous of his growing reputation, but, on the contrary, 
 <I>glorified the Lord.</I> And they could not do more to encourage Paul 
 to go on cheerfully in his work than to glorify God for his success in 
 it; for, if God be praised, Paul is pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The request of James and the elders of the church at Jerusalem to 
 Paul, or their advice rather, that he would gratify the believing Jews 
 by showing some compliance with the ceremonial law, and appearing 
 publicly in the temple to offer sacrifice, which was not a thing in 
 itself sinful; for the ceremonial law, though it was by no means to be 
 imposed upon the Gentile converts (as the false teachers would have it, 
 and thereby endeavoured to subvert the gospel), yet it was not become 
 unlawful as yet to those that had been bred up in the observance of it, 
 but were far from expecting justification by it. It was dead, but not 
 buried; dead, but not yet deadly. And, being not sinful, they thought 
 it was a piece of prudence in Paul to conform thus far. Observe the
 counsel they give to Paul herein, not as having authority over him, but 
 an affection for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They desired him to take notice of the great numbers there were of 
 the Jewish converts: <I>Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of the 
 Jews there are who believe.</I> They called him brother, for they 
 looked upon him as a joint-commissioner with them in gospel-work.
 Though they were of the circumcision and he the apostle of the 
 Gentiles, though they were conformists and he a nonconformist, yet they 
 were brethren, and owned the relation. Thou hast been in some of our 
 assemblies, and seest how numerous they are: <I>how many myriads of 
 Jews believe.</I> The word signifies, not thousands, but <I>ten 
 thousands.</I> Even among the Jews, who were most prejudiced against 
 the gospel, yet there were great multitudes that received it; for the 
 grace of God can break down the strongest holds of Satan. The number of 
 the names at first was but one hundred and twenty, yet now many 
 thousands. Let none therefore despise the day of small things; for, 
 though the beginning be small, God can make the latter end greatly to 
 increase. Hereby it appeared that God had not quite cast away his 
 people the Jews, for among them there was a remnant, an election, that 
 obtained (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1,5,7">Rom. xi. 1, 5, 7</A>):

 <I>many thousands that believed.</I> And this account which they could 
 give to Paul of the success of the gospel among the Jews was, no doubt, 
 as grateful to Paul as the account which he gave them of the conversion 
 of the Gentiles was to them; for his heart's desire and prayer to God 
 for the Jews was <I>that they might be saved.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They informed him of a prevailing infirmity these believing Jews 
 laboured under, of which they could not yet be cured: <I>They are all 
 zealous of the law.</I> They believe in Christ as the true Messiah, 
 they rest upon his righteousness and submit to his government; but they 
 know the law of Moses was of God, they have found spiritual benefit in 
 their attendance on the institutions of it, and therefore they can by 
 no means think of parting with it, no, nor of growing cold to it. And 
 perhaps they urged Christ's being <I>made under the law,</I> and 
 observing it (which was designed to be our deliverance from the law), 
 as a reason for their continuance under it. This was a great weakness 
 and mistake, to be so fond of the shadows when the substance was come, 
 to keep their necks under a yoke of bondage when Christ had come to 
 make them free. But see, 

 (1.) The power of education and long usage, and especially of a 
 ceremonial law. 

 (2.) The charitable allowance that must be made in consideration of 
 these. These Jews that believed were not therefore disowned and
 rejected as no Christians because they were for the law, nay, were 
 zealous for it, while it was only in their own practice, and they did 
 not impose it upon others. Their being zealous of the law was capable 
 of a good construction, which charity would put upon it; and it was 
 capable of a good excuse, considering what they were brought up in, and 
 among whom they lived.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They gave him to understand that these Jews, who were so zealous of 
 the law, were ill-affected to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Paul himself, though as faithful a servant as any Christ ever had, yet 
 could not get the good word of all that belonged to Christ's family: 
 "<I>They are informed of thee</I> (and form their opinion of thee 
 accordingly) that thou not only dost not teach the Gentiles to observe 
 the law, as some would have had thee (we have prevailed with them to 
 drop that), but <I>dost teach all the Jews who are</I> dispersed 
 <I>among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, not to circumcise their 
 children nor to walk after the customs</I> of our nation, which were of 
 divine appointment, so far as they might be observed even among the 
 Gentiles, at a distance from the temple,--not to observe the fasts and
 feasts of the church, not to wear their phylacteries, nor abstain from 
 unclean meats." Now,

 (1.) It was true that Paul preached the abrogation of the law of Moses, 
 taught them that it was impossible to be justified by it, and therefore 
 we are not bound up any longer to the observance of it. But, 

 (2.) It was false that he taught them to forsake Moses; for the 
 religion he preached tended not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. 
 He preached Christ (<I>the end of the law for righteousness</I>), and 
 repentance and faith, in the exercise of which we are to make great use 
 of the law. The Jews among the Gentiles whom Paul taught were so far
 from forsaking Moses that they never understood him better, nor ever 
 embraced him so heartily as now when they were taught to make use of 
 him as a <I>schoolmaster to bring them to Christ.</I> But even the 
 believing Jews, having got this notion of Paul, that he was an enemy to 
 Moses, and perhaps giving too much regard to the unbelieving Jews too, 
 were much exasperated against him. Their ministers, the elders here 
 present, loved and honoured him, and approved of what he did, and 
 called him brother, but the people could hardly be induced to entertain 
 a favourable thought of him; for it is certain the least judicious are 
 the most censorious, the weak-headed are the hot-headed. They could not
 distinguish upon Paul's doctrine as they ought to have done, and 
 therefore condemned it in the gross, through ignorance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They therefore desired Paul that he would by some public act, now 
 that he had come to Jerusalem, make it to appear that the charge 
 against him was false, and that he did not teach people to forsake 
 Moses and to break the customs of the Jewish church, for he himself 
 retained the use of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They conclude that something of this kind must be done: "<I>What 
 is it therefore?</I> What must be done? The <I>multitude will hear that 
 thou art come</I> to town." This is an inconvenience that attends men 
 of fame, that their coming and going are taken notice of more than 
 other people's, and will be talked of, by some for good-will and by 
 others for ill-will. "When they hear thou art come, <I>they must needs 
 come together,</I> they will expect that we call them together, to 
 advise with them whether we should admit thee to preach among us as a 
 brother or no; or, they will come together of themselves expecting to 
 hear thee." Now something must be done to satisfy them that Paul does 
 not teach the people to forsake Moses, and they think it necessary, 
 
 [1.] For Paul's sake, that his reputation should be cleared, and that
 so good a man may not lie under any blemish, nor so useful a man labour 
 under any disadvantage which may obstruct his usefulness. 

 [2.] For the people's sake, that they may not continue prejudiced 
 against so good a man, nor lose the benefit of his ministry by those 
 prejudices. 

 [3.] For their own sake, that since they knew it was their duty to own 
 Paul their doing it might not be turned to their reproach among those 
 that were under their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They produce a fair opportunity which Paul might take to clear 
 himself: "<I>Do this that we say unto thee,</I> take our advice in this 
 case. <I>We have four men,</I> Jews who believe, of our own churches, 
 and <I>they have a vow on them,</I> a vow of Nazariteship for a certain 
 time; their time has now expired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and they are to offer their offering according to the law, when they 
 shave the head of their separation, a he-lamb for a burnt-offering, a
 ewe-lamb for a sin-offering, and a ram for a peace-offering, with other
 offerings pertinent to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:13-20">Num. vi. 13-20</A>.

 Many used to do this together, when their vow expired about the same
 time, either for the greater expedition or for the greater solemnity. 
 Now Paul having so far of late complied with the law as to take upon 
 him the vow of a Nazarite, and to signify the expiration of it by 
 shaving his head at Cenchrea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 18</A>),

 according to the custom of those who lived at a distance from the
 temple, they desire him but to go a little further, and to join with 
 these four in offering the sacrifices of a Nazarite: <I>'Purify thyself 
 with them</I> according to the law; and be willing not only to take 
 that trouble, but to be at charges with them, in buying sacrifices for 
 this solemn occasion, and to join with them in the sacrifice." This, 
 they think, will effectually stop the mouth of calumny, and every one 
 will be convinced that the report was false, that Paul was not the man 
 he was represented to be, did not teach the Jews to forsake Moses, but 
 that he himself, being originally a Jew, walked orderly, and kept the 
 law; and then all would be well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They enter a protestation that this shall be no infringement at all 
 of the decree lately made in favour of the Gentile converts, nor do 
 they intend by this in the least to derogate from the liberty allowed 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>As touching the Gentiles</I> who <I>believe, we have written and 
 concluded,</I> and resolve to abide by it, <I>that they observe no such 
 things;</I> we would not have them to be bound up by the ceremonial law 
 by any means, but only that they keep themselves from <I>things offered 
 to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from 
 fornication;</I> but let not them be tied to the Jewish sacrifices or 
 purifications, nor any of their rites and ceremonies." They knew how 
 jealous Paul was for the preservation of the liberty of the converted 
 Gentiles, and therefore expressly covenant to abide by that. Thus far 
 is their proposal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is Paul's compliance with it. He was willing to gratify them in 
 this matter. Though he would not be persuaded not to go to Jerusalem, 
 yet, when he was there, he was persuaded to do as they there did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>Then Paul took the men,</I> as they advised, and the very <I>next 
 day, purifying himself with them,</I> and not <I>with multitude nor 
 tumult,</I> as he himself pleads

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:18"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 18</A>),

 he <I>entered into the temple,</I> as other devout Jews that came upon
 such errands did, to signify the accomplishment of the days of 
 purification to the priests; desiring the priest would appoint a time 
 when the offering should be offered for every one of them, one for 
 each. Ainsworth, on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:18">Num. vi. 18</A>,

 quotes out of Maimonides a passage which gives some light to this:
 <I>If a man say, Upon me behalf the oblations of a Nazarite,</I> or, 
 <I>Upon me be half the shaving of a Nazarite, them he brings half the 
 offerings by what Nazarite he will, and that Nazarite pays his offering 
 out of that which is his.</I> So Paul did here; he contributed what he 
 vowed to the offerings of these Nazarites, and some think bound himself 
 to the law of Nazariteship, and to an attendance at the temple with 
 fastings and prayers for seven days, not designing that the offering 
 should be offered till them, which was what he signified to the priest. 
 Now it has been questioned whether James and the elders did well to 
 give Paul this advice, and whether he did well to take it. 

 1. Some have blamed this occasional conformity of Paul's, as indulging
 the Jews too much in their adherence to the ceremonial law, and a 
 discouragement of those who stood fast in the liberty wherewith Christ 
 had made them free. Was it not enough for James and the elders of 
 Jerusalem to connive at this mistake in the Jewish converts themselves, 
 but must they wheedle Paul to countenance them in it? Had it not been 
 better, when they had told Paul how zealous the believing Jews were for 
 the law, if they had desired, whom God had endued with such excellent 
 gifts, to take pains with their people to convince them of their error, 
 and to show them that they were made free from the law by their 
 marriage to Christ? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4">Rom. vii. 4</A>.

 To urge him to encourage them in it by his example seems to have more
 in it of fleshly wisdom than of the grace of God. Surely Paul knew what 
 he had to do better than they could teach him. But,

 2. Others think the advice was prudent and good, and Paul's following
 it was justifiable enough, as the case stood. It was Paul's avowed 
 principle, <I>To the Jews became I as a Jew, that I might gain the 
 Jews,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:20">1 Cor. ix. 20</A>.

 He had circumcised Timothy, to please the Jews; though he would not 
 constantly observe the ceremonial law, yet, to gain an opportunity of 
 doing good, and to show how far he could comply, he would occasionally 
 go to the temple and join in the sacrifices there. Those that are weak 
 in the faith are to be borne with, when those that undermine the faith 
 must be opposed. It is true, this compliance of Paul's sped ill to him, 
 for this very thing by which he hoped to pacify the Jews did but 
 provoke them, and bring him into trouble; yet this is not a sufficient 
 ground to go upon in condemning it: Paul might do well, and yet suffer 
 for it. But perhaps the wise God overruled both their advice and Paul's 
 compliance with it to serve a better purpose than was intended; for we 
 have reason to think that when the believing Jews, who had endeavoured 
 by their zeal for the law to recommend themselves to the good opinion 
 of those who believed not, saw how barbarously they used Paul (who 
 endeavoured to oblige them), they were by this more alienated from the 
 ceremonial law than they could have been by the most argumentative or 
 affecting discourses. They saw it was in vain to think of pleasing men 
 that would be pleased with nothing else but the rooting out of 
 Christianity. Integrity and uprightness will be more likely to preserve 
 us than sneaking compliances. And when we consider what a great trouble 
 it must needs be to James and the presbyters, in the reflection upon 
 it, that they had by their advice brought Paul into trouble, it should 
 be a warning to us not to press men to oblige us by doing any thing 
 contrary to their own mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which
 were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the
 people, and laid hands on him,
 &nbsp; 28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that
 teacheth all <I>men</I> every where against the people, and the law,
 and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple,
 and hath polluted this holy place.
 &nbsp; 29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
 Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
 temple.)
 &nbsp; 30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
 they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the
 doors were shut.
 &nbsp; 31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the
 chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
 &nbsp; 32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down
 unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,
 they left beating of Paul.
 &nbsp; 33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and
 commanded <I>him</I> to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he
 was, and what he had done.
 &nbsp; 34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
 and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he
 commanded him to be carried into the castle.
 &nbsp; 35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was
 borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
 &nbsp; 36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
 with him.
 &nbsp; 37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
 chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
 Greek?
 &nbsp; 38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest
 an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men
 that were murderers?
 &nbsp; 39 But Paul said, I am a man <I>which am</I> a Jew of Tarsus, <I>a
 city</I> in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee,
 suffer me to speak unto the people.
 &nbsp; 40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
 and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was
 made a great silence, he spake unto <I>them</I> in the Hebrew tongue,
 saying,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Paul brought into a captivity which we are not likely to 
 see the end of; for after this he is either hurried from one bar to 
 another, or lies neglected, first in one prison and then in another, 
 and can neither be tried nor bailed. When we see the beginning of a 
 trouble, we know not either how long it will last or how it will 
 issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here Paul seized, and laid hold on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was seized in the temple, when he was there attending the days of 
 his purifying, and the solemn services of those days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Formerly he had been well known in the temple, but now he had been so 
 long in his travels abroad that he had become a stranger there; so that 
 it was not till <I>the seven days were almost ended</I> that he was 
 taken notice of by those that had an evil eye towards him. In the 
 temple, where he should have been protected, as in a sanctuary, he was 
 most violently set upon by those who did what they could to have his 
 blood mingled with his sacrifices--in the temple, where he should have
 been welcomed as one of the greatest ornaments of it that ever had been 
 there since the Lord of the temple left it. The temple, which they 
 themselves pretended such a mighty zeal for, yet did they themselves 
 thus profane. Thus is the church polluted by none more than by popish 
 persecutors, under the colour of the church's name and interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The informers against him were the Jews of Asia, not those of 
 Jerusalem--the Jews of the dispersion, who knew him best, and who were
 most exasperated against him. Those who seldom came up to worship at 
 the temple in Jerusalem themselves, but contentedly lived at a distance 
 from it, in pursuit of their private advantages, yet appeared most 
 zealous for the temple, as if thereby they would atone for their 
 habitual neglect of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The method they took was to raise the mob, and to incense them 
 against him. They did not go to the high priest, or the magistrates of 
 the city, with their charge (probably because they expected not to 
 receive countenance from them), but <I>they stirred up all the 
 people,</I> who were at this time more than ever disposed to any thing 
 that was tumultuous and seditious, riotous and outrageous. Those are 
 fittest to be employed against Christ and Christianity that are 
 governed least by reason and most by passion; therefore Paul described 
 the Jewish persecutors to be not only wicked, but absurd unreasonable 
 men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The arguments wherewith they exasperated the people against him were 
 popular, but very false and unjust. They cried out, "<I>Men of Israel, 
 help.</I> If you are indeed men of Israel, true-born Jews, that have a 
 concern for your church and your country, now is your time to show it, 
 by helping to seize an enemy to both." Thus <I>they cried after him as 
 after a thief</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:5">Job xxx. 5</A>),

 or after a mad dog. Note, The enemies of Christianity, since they could 
 never prove it to be an ill thing, have been always very industrious, 
 right or wrong, to put it into an ill name, and so run it down by 
 outrage and outcry. It had become men of Israel to help Paul, who 
 preached up him who was so much the <I>glory of his people Israel;</I> 
 yet here the popular fury will not allow them to be men of Israel, 
 unless they will help against him. This was like, <I>Stop thief,</I> or 
 Athaliah's cry, <I>Treason, treason;</I> what is wanting in right is 
 made up in noise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They charge upon him both bad doctrine and bad practice, and both 
 against the Mosaic ritual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They charge upon him bad doctrine; not only that he holds corrupt 
 opinions himself, but that he vents and publishes them, though not here 
 at Jerusalem, yet in other places, nay in all places, he teaches all 
 men, every where; so artfully is the crime aggravated, as if, because 
 he was an itinerant, he was a ubiquitary: "He spreads to the utmost of 
 his power certain damnable and heretical positions," 

 [1.] Against the people of the Jews. He had taught that Jews and 
 Gentiles stand on the same level before God, <I>and neither 
 circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision;</I> nay, he had 
 taught against the unbelieving Jews that they were rejected (and 
 therefore had separated from them and their synagogues), and this is 
 interpreted to be speaking against the whole nation, as if no doubt but 
 <I>they were the people, and wisdom must die with them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:2">Job xii. 2</A>),

 whereas God, though he had cast them off, yet had not <I>cast away his 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.
 
 They were <I>Lo-ammi, not a people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:9">Hos. i. 9</A>),

 and yet pretended to be the only people. Those commonly seem most 
 jealous for the church's name that belong to it in name only. 

 [2.] Against the law. His teaching men to believe the gospel as the end 
 of the law, and the perfection of it, was interpreted his preaching 
 against the law; whereas it was so far from making void the law that it 
 established it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:31">Rom. iii. 31</A>.

 [3.] Against <I>this place,</I> the temple. Because he taught men to
 pray every where, he was reproached as an enemy to the temple, and 
 perhaps because he sometimes mentioned the destruction of Jerusalem and 
 the temple, and of the Jewish nation, which his Master had foretold. 
 Paul had himself been active in persecuting Stephen, and putting him to 
 death for words spoken <I>against this holy place,</I> and now the same 
 thing is laid to his charge. He that was then made use of as the tool 
 is now set up as the butt of Jewish rage and malice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They charge upon him bad practices. To confirm their charge
 against him, as teaching people against this holy place, they charge it 
 upon him that he had himself polluted it, and by an overt-act showed 
 his contempt of it, and a design to make it common. He <I>has brought 
 Gentiles also into the temple,</I> into the inner court of the temple, 
 which none that were uncircumcised were admitted, under any pretence, 
 to come into; there was written upon the wall that enclosed this inner 
 court, in Greek and Latin, <I>It is a capital crime for strangers to 
 enter.</I>--Josephus <I>Antiq.</I> 15. 417. Paul was himself a Jew, and
 had right to enter into the court of the Jews. And they, seeing some 
 with him there that joined with him in his devotions, concluded that 
 Trophimus an Ephesian, who was a Gentile, was one of them. Why? Did 
 they see him there? Truly no; but they had seen him with Paul in the 
 streets of the city, which was no crime at all, and therefore they 
 affirm that he was with Paul in the inner court of the temple, which 
 was a heinous crime. They had seen him with him in the city, and 
 therefore they supposed that Paul had brought him with him into the 
 temple, which was utterly false. See here, 

 [1.] Innocency is no fence against calumny and false accusation. It is 
 no new thing for those that mean honestly, and act regularly, to have 
 things laid to their charge which they know not, nor ever thought of. 
 
 [2.] <I>Evil men dig up mischief,</I> and go far to seek proofs of 
 their false accusations, as they did here, who, because they saw a 
 Gentile with Paul in the city, will thence infer that he was with him 
 in the temple. This was a strained innuendo indeed, yet by such unjust 
 and groundless suggestions have wicked men thought to justify 
 themselves in the most barbarous outrages committed upon the 
 <I>excellent ones of the earth.</I> 

 [3.] It is common for malicious people to improve that against those 
 that are wise and good with which they thought to have obliged them and 
 ingratiated themselves with them. Paul thought to recommend himself to
 their good opinion by going into the temple, he had not been so 
 maligned by them. This is the genius of ill-nature; <I>for my love, 
 they are my adversaries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:4,Ps+69:10">Ps. cix. 4; lxix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have Paul in danger of being pulled in pieces by the rabble. They 
 will not be at the pains to have him before the high priest, or the 
 sanhedrim; that is a roundabout way: the execution shall be of a piece 
 with the prosecution, all unjust and irregular. They cannot prove the 
 crime upon him, and therefore dare not bring him upon a fair trial; 
 nay, so greedily do they thirst after his blood that they have not 
 patience to proceed against him by a due course of law, though they 
 were ever so sure to gain their point; and therefore, as those who 
 neither feared God nor regarded man, they resolved to knock him on the 
 head immediately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All the city was in an uproar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The people, who though they had little holiness themselves, yet had a 
 mighty veneration for the holy place, when they heard a hue-and-cry
 from the temple, were up in arms presently, being resolved to stand by 
 that with their lives and fortunes. <I>All the city was moved,</I> when 
 they were called to from the temple, <I>Men of Israel, help,</I> with 
 as much violence as if the old complaint were revived

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1">Ps. lxxix. 1</A>),

 <I>O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy holy temple 
 have they defiled.</I> Just such a zeal the Jews here show for God's 
 temple as the Ephesians did for Diana's temple, when Paul was informed 
 against as an enemy to that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:29"><I>ch.</I> xix. 29</A>):

 <I>The whole city was full of confusion.</I> But God does not reckon
 himself at all honoured by those whose zeal for him transports them to 
 such irregularities, and who, while they pretend to act for him, act in 
 such a brutish barbarous manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They drew Paul out of the temple, and shut the doors between the 
 outer and inner court of the temple, or perhaps the doors of the outer 
 court. In dragging him furiously out of the temple, 

 (1.) They showed a real detestation of him as one not fit to be 
 suffered in the temple, nor to worship there, nor to be looked upon as 
 a member of the Jewish nation; as if his sacrifice had been an 
 abomination. 

 (2.) They pretended a veneration for the temple; like that of good 
 Jehoiada, who would not have Athaliah to be <I>slain in the house of 
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:15">2 Kings xi. 15</A>.

 See how absurd these wicked men were; they condemned Paul for drawing
 people from the temple, and yet, when he himself was very devoutly 
 worshipping in the temple, they drew him out of it. The officers of the 
 temple shut the doors, either,

 [1.] Lest Paul should find means to get back and take hold of the horns 
 of the altar, and so protect himself by that sanctuary from their rage. 
 Or rather, 

 [2.] Lest the crowd should by the running in of more to them be thrust 
 back into the temple, and some outrage should be committed, to the 
 profanation of that holy place. Those that made no conscience of doing 
 so ill a thing as the murdering of a good man for well-doing, yet would 
 be thought to scruple doing it in a holy place, or at a holy time: 
 <I>Not in the temple, as Not on the feast-day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They went about to kill him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 for they fell a beating him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 resolving to beat him to death by blows without number, a punishment 
 which the Jewish doctors allowed in some cases (not at all to the 
 credit of their nation), and called <I>the beating of the rebels.</I> 
 Now was Paul, like a lamb, thrown into a den of lions, and made an easy 
 prey to them, and, no doubt, he was still of the same mind as when he 
 said, <I>I am ready not only to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem,</I> 
 to die so great a death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here Paul rescued out of the hands of his Jewish enemies 
 by a Roman enemy. 

 1. Tidings were brought of the tumult, and that the mob was up, <I>to 
 the chief captain of the band,</I> the governor of the castle, or, 
 whoever he was, the now commander-in-chief of the Roman forces that
 were quartered in Jerusalem. Somebody that was concerned not for Paul, 
 but for the public peace and safety, gave this information to the 
 colonel, who had always a jealous and watchful eye upon these 
 tumultuous Jews, and he is the man that must be instrumental to save 
 Paul's life, when never a friend he had was capable of doing him any 
 service. 

 2. The tribune, or chief captain, got his forces together with all
 possible expedition, and went to suppress the mob: <I>He took 
 soldiers</I> and <I>centurions,</I> and <I>ran down to them.</I> Now at 
 the feast, as at other such solemn times, the guards were up, and the 
 militia more within call than at other times, and so he had them near 
 at hand, and <I>he ran down unto the multitude;</I> for at such times 
 delays are dangerous. Sedition must be crushed at first, lest it grow 
 headstrong. 

 3. The very sight of the Roman general frightened them from beating
 Paul; for they knew they were doing what they could not justify, and 
 were in danger of being called in question for this day's uproar, as 
 the town clerk told the Ephesians. They were deterred from that by the 
 power of the Romans from which they ought to have been restrained by 
 the justice of God and the dread of his wrath. Note, God often makes
 the earth to help the woman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>),

 and those to be a protection to his people who yet have no affection 
 for his people; they have only a compassion for sufferers, and are 
 zealous for the public peace. The shepherd makes use even of his dogs 
 for the defence of his sheep. It is Streso's comparison here. See here 
 how these wicked people were frightened away at the very sight of the 
 chief captain; for the <I>king that sitteth on the throne of judgment 
 scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</I> The governor takes him into 
 custody. He rescued him, not out of a concern for him, because he 
 thought him innocent, but out of a concern for justice, because he 
 ought not to be put to death without trial; and because he knew not how 
 dangerous the consequence might be to the Roman government of such 
 tumultuous proceedings were not timely suppressed, nor what such an 
 outrageous people might do if once they knew their own strength: he 
 therefore takes Paul out of the hands of the mob into the hands of the 
 law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>He took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains,</I> that 
 the people might be satisfied he did not intend to discharge him, but 
 to examine him, <I>for he demanded of</I> those who were so eager 
 against him <I>who he was, and what he had done.</I> This violent 
 taking of him out of the hands of the multitude, though there was all 
 the reason in the world for it, yet they laid to the charge of the 
 chief captain as his crime

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:7"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 7</A>):

 <I>The chief captain Lysias came with great violence, and took him out
 of our hands,</I> which refers to this rescue as appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:27,28"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 27, 28</A>,

 where the chief captain gives an account of it to Felix.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The provision which the chief captain made, with much ado, to bring 
 Paul to speak for himself. One had almost as good enter into a struggle 
 with the winds and the waves, as with such a mob as was here got 
 together; and yet Paul made a shift to get liberty of speech among 
 them.</P>

 1. There was no knowing the sense of the people; for when the chief 
 captain enquired concerning Paul, having perhaps never heard of his 
 name before (such strangers were the great ones to the excellent ones 
 of the earth, and affected to be so), <I>some cried one thing, and some 
 another,</I> among the multitude; so that it was impossible for the 
 chief captain to know their mind, when really they knew not either one 
 another's mind or their own, when every one pretended to give the sense 
 of the whole body. Those that will hearken to the clamours of the
 multitude will know nothing for a certainty, any more than the builders 
 of Babel, when their tongues were confounded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was no quelling the rage and fury of the people; for when 
 <I>the chief captain commanded that Paul should be carried into the 
 castle,</I> the tower of Antonia, where the Roman soldiers kept 
 garrison, near the temple, the soldiers themselves had much ado to get 
 him safely thither out of the noise, the people were so violent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>When he came upon the stairs,</I> leading up to the castle, the 
 soldiers were forced to take him up in their arms, and carry him (which 
 they might easily do, for he was a little man, and his bodily presence 
 weak), to keep him from the people, who would have pulled him limb from 
 limb if they could. When they could not reach him with their cruel 
 hands, they followed him with their <I>sharp arrows, even bitter words: 
 They followed, crying, Away with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 See how the most excellent persons and things are often run down by a 
 popular clamour. Christ himself was so, with, <I>Crucify him, crucify
 him,</I> though they could not say what evil he had done. <I>Take him
 out of the land of the living</I> (so the ancients expound it), chase 
 him out of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Paul at length begged leave of the chief captain to speak to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>As he was to be led into the castle,</I> with a great deal of 
 calmness and composedness in himself, and a great deal of mildness and 
 deference to those about him, <I>he said unto the chief captain, "May I 
 speak unto thee?</I> Will it be no offence, nor construed as a breach 
 of rule, if I give thee some account of myself, since my persecutors 
 can give no account of me?" What a humble modest question was this!
 Paul knew how to speak to the greatest of men, and had many a time 
 spoken to his betters, yet he humbly begs to leave to speak to this 
 commander, and will not speak till he has obtained leave: <I>May I 
 speak unto thee?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The chief captain tells him what notion he had of him: <I>Canst thou 
 speak Greek?</I> I am surprised to hear thee speak a learned language; 
 for, <I>Art not thou that Egyptian who made an uproar?</I> The Jews 
 made the uproar, and then would have it thought that Paul had given 
 them occasion for it, by beginning first; for probably some of them 
 whispered this in the ear of the chief captain. See what false mistaken 
 notions of good people and good ministers many run away with, and will 
 not be at the pains to have the mistake rectified. It seems, there had 
 lately been an insurrection somewhere in that country, headed by an 
 Egyptian, who took on him to be a prophet. Josephus mentions this 
 story, that "an Egyptian raised a seditious party, promised to show 
 them the fall of <I>the walls of Jerusalem from the mount of 
 Olives,</I> and that they should enter the city upon the ruins." The 
 captain here says <I>that he led out into the wilderness four thousand 
 men that were murderers</I>--desperadoes, banditti, raparees,
 cut-throats. What a degeneracy was there in the Jewish nation, when 
 there were found there so many that had such a character, and could be 
 drawn into such an attempt upon the public peace! But Josephus says 
 that "Felix the Roman president went out against them, killed four 
 hundred, and took two hundred prisoners, and the rest were 
 dispersed."--<I>Antiq.</I> 20. 171; <I>Wars</I> 2. 263. And Eusebius
 speaks of it, <I>Hist.</I> 2. 20. It happened in the thirteenth year of 
 Claudius, a little before those days, about three years ago. The 
 ringleader of this rebellion, it seems, had made his escape, and the 
 chief captain concluded that one who lay under so great an odium as 
 Paul seemed to lie under, and against whom there was so great an 
 outcry, could not be a criminal of less figure than this Egyptian. See 
 how good men are exposed to ill-will by mistake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Paul rectifies his mistake concerning him, by informing him 
 particularly what he was; not such a vagabond, a scoundrel, a rake, as 
 that Egyptian, who could give no good account of himself. No: <I>I am a 
 man who is a Jew</I> originally, and no Egyptian--a Jew both by nation
 and religion; <I>I am of Tarsus, a city of Cilicia,</I> of honest 
 parents and a liberal education (Tarsus was a university), and, besides 
 that, <I>a citizen of no mean city.</I> Whether he means Tarsus or Rome 
 is not certain; they were neither of them mean cities, and he was a 
 freeman of both. Though the chief captain had put him under such an 
 invidious suspicion, that he was that Egyptian, he kept his temper, did 
 not break out into any passionate exclamations against the times he 
 lived in or the men he had to do with, did not render railing for 
 railing, but mildly denied the charge, and owned what he was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He humbly desired a permission from the chief captain, whose 
 prisoner he now was, to speak to the people. He does not demand it as a 
 debt, though he might have done so, but sues for it as a favour, which 
 he will be thankful for: <I>I beseech thee, suffer me to speak to the 
 people.</I> The chief captain rescued him with no other design than to 
 give him a fair hearing. Now, to show that his cause needs no art to 
 give it a plausible colour, he desires he may have leave immediately to 
 defend himself; for it needed no more than to be set in a true light; 
 nor did he depend only on the goodness of his cause, but upon the 
 goodness and fidelity of his patron, and that promise of his to all his 
 advocates, <I>that it should be given them in that same hour what they 
 should speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He obtained leave to plead his own cause, for he needed not to have 
 counsel assigned him, when the Spirit of the Father was ready to 
 dictate to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:20">Matt. x. 20</A>.
 
 <I>The chief captain gave him license</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 so that now he could speak with a good grace, and with the more
 courage; he had, I will not say that favour, but that justice, done him 
 by the chief captain, which he could not obtain from his countrymen the 
 Jews; for they would not hear him, but the captain would, though it 
 were but to satisfy his curiosity. This licence being obtained, 

 (1.) The people were attentive to hear: <I>Paul stood on the 
 stairs,</I> which gave a little man like Zaccheus some advantage, and 
 consequently some boldness, in delivering himself. A sorry pulpit it 
 was, and yet better than none; it served the purpose, though it was 
 not, like Ezra's pulpit of wood, made for the purpose. There he 
 <I>beckoned with the hand unto the people,</I> made signs to them to be 
 quiet and to have a little patience, for he had something to say to 
 them; and so far he gained his point that every one cried hush to his 
 neighbour, and there was made a profound silence. Probably the chief 
 captain also intimated his charge to all manner of people to keep 
 silence; if the people were not required to give audience, it was to no 
 purpose at all that Paul was allowed to speak. When the cause of Christ 
 and his gospel is to be pleaded, there ought to be a great silence, 
 that we may <I>give the more earnest heed,</I> and all little enough.
 
 (2.) Paul addressed himself to speak, well assured that he was serving 
 the interest of Christ's kingdom as truly and effectually as if he had 
 been preaching in the synagogue: he <I>spoke unto them in the Hebrew 
 tongue,</I> that is, in their own vulgar tongue, which was the language 
 of their country, to which he hereby owned not only an abiding 
 relation, but an abiding respect.</P>
