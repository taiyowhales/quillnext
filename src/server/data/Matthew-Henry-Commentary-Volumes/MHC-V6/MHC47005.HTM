 The apostle proceeds in showing the reasons why they did not faint 
 under their afflictions, namely, their expectation, desire, and 
 assurance of happiness after death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>),

 and deduces an inference for the comfort of believers in their present
 state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>),

 and another to quicken them in their duty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 Then he makes an apology for seeming to commend himself, and gives a
 good reason for his zeal and diligence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>),

 and mentions two things that are necessary in order to our living to
 Christ, regeneration and reconciliation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:16-21">ver. 16, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For we know that if our earthly house of <I>this</I> tabernacle
 were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with
 hands, eternal in the heavens.
 &nbsp; 2  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
 with our house which is from heaven:
 &nbsp; 3  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
 &nbsp; 4  For we that are in <I>this</I> tabernacle do groan, being
 burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon,
 that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
 &nbsp; 5  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <I>is</I> God,
 who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
 &nbsp; 6  Therefore <I>we are</I> always confident, knowing that, whilst we
 are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
 &nbsp; 7  (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
 &nbsp; 8  We are confident, <I>I say,</I> and willing rather to be absent
 from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
 &nbsp; 9  Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
 be accepted of him.
 &nbsp; 10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
 that every one may receive the things <I>done</I> in <I>his</I> body,
 according to that he hath done, whether <I>it be</I> good or bad.
 &nbsp; 11  Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;
 but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made
 manifest in your consciences.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle in these verses pursues the argument of the former chapter, 
 concerning the grounds of their courage and patience under afflictions.
 And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He mentions their expectation, and desire, and assurance, of eternal 
 happiness after death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1-5"><I>v.</I> 1-5</A>.
 
 Observe particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The believer's expectation of eternal happiness after death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 He does not only know, or is well assured by faith of the truth and 
 reality of the thing itself--that there is another and a happy life
 after this present life is ended, but he has good hope through grace of 
 his interest in that everlasting blessedness of the unseen world: "We 
 know that we have a building of God, we have a firm and well-grounded 
 expectation of the future felicity." Let us take notice, 

 (1.) What heaven is in the eye and hope of a believer. He looks upon it 
 as a house, or habitation, a dwelling-place, a resting-place, a 
 hiding-place, our Father's house, where there are many mansions, and 
 our everlasting home. It is a house in the heavens, in that high and 
 holy place which as far excels all the palaces of this earth as the 
 heavens are high above the earth. It is a building of God, whose 
 builder and maker is God, and therefore is worthy of its author; the 
 happiness of the future state is what God hath prepared for those that 
 love him. It is eternal in the heavens, everlasting habitations, not 
 like the earthly tabernacles, the poor cottages of clay in which our 
 souls now dwell, which are mouldering and decaying, and <I>whose 
 foundations are in the dust.</I> 

 (2.) When it is expected this happiness shall be enjoyed--immediately 
 after death, so soon as <I>our house of this earthly tabernacle is 
 dissolved.</I> Note, 

 [1.] That the body, this earthly house, is but a tabernacle, that must 
 be dissolved shortly; the nails or pins will be drawn, and the cords be 
 loosed, and then the body will return to dust as it was.

 [2.] When this comes to pass, then comes the house not made with hands. 
 The spirit returns to God who gave it; and such as have walked with God 
 here shall dwell with God for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The believer's earnest desire after this future blessedness, which 
 is expressed by this word, <B> <I>stenazomen</I></B>--<I>we groan,</I>
 which denotes, 

 (1.) A groaning of sorrow under a heavy load; so believers groan under 
 the burden of life: <I>In this we groan earnestly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>We that are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The body of flesh is a heavy burden, the calamities of life are a heavy 
 load. But believers groan because burdened with a body of sin, and the 
 many corruptions that are still remaining and raging in them. This 
 makes them complain, <I>O wretched man that I am!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:24">Rom. vii. 24</A>.

 (2.) There is a groaning of desire after the happiness of another life;
 and thus believers groan: <I>Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with 
 our house which is from heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 to obtain a blessed immortality, <I>that mortality might be swallowed 
 up of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>that being found clothed, we may not be naked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that, if it were the will of God, we might not sleep, but be changed; 
 for it is not desirable in itself to be unclothed. Death considered
 merely as a separation of soul and body is not to be desired, but 
 rather dreaded; but, considered as a passage to glory, the believer is 
 <I>willing rather</I> to die than live, <I>to be absent from the body, 
 that he may be present with the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 to leave this body that he may go to Christ, and to put off these rags 
 of mortality that he may put on the robes of glory. Note, 

 [1.] Death will strip us of the clothing of flesh, and all the comforts 
 of life, as well as put an end to all our troubles here below. Naked we 
 came into this world, and naked shall we go out of it. But,

 [2.] Gracious souls are not found naked in the other world; no, they 
 are clothed with garments of praise, with robes of righteousness and 
 glory. They shall be delivered out of all their troubles, and shall 
 have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:14">Rev. vii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The believer's assurance of his interest in this future blessedness, 
 on a double account:--

 (1.) From the experience of the grace of God, in preparing and making
 him meet for this blessedness. He that hath <I>wrought us for the 
 self-same thing is God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, All who are designed for heaven hereafter are wrought or prepared 
 for heaven while they are here; the stones of that spiritual building 
 and temple above are squared and fashioned here below. And he that hath 
 wrought us for this is God, because nothing less than a divine power 
 can make a soul partaker of a divine nature; no hand less than the hand 
 of God can work us for this thing. A great deal is to be done to 
 prepare our souls for heaven, and that preparation of the heart is from 
 the Lord.

 (2.) The <I>earnest of the Spirit</I> gave them this assurance: for an 
 earnest is part of payment, and secures the full payment. The present 
 graces and comforts of the Spirit are earnests of everlasting grace and 
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle deduces an inference for the comfort of believers in 
 their present state and condition in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.
 
 Here observe,
 
 1. What their present state or condition is: they <I>are absent from 
 the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they are pilgrims and strangers in this world; they do but sojourn here 
 in their earthly home, or in this tabernacle; and though God is with us 
 here, by his Spirit, and in his ordinances, yet we are not with him as 
 we hope to be: we cannot see his face while we live: <I>For we walk by
 faith, not by sight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 We have not the vision and fruition of God, as of an object that is 
 present with us, and as we hope for hereafter, when we <I>shall see as 
 we are seen.</I> Note, Faith is for this world, and sight is reserved 
 for the other world: and it is our duty, and will be our interest, to 
 walk by faith, till we come to live by sight. 

 2. How comfortable and courageous we ought to be in all the troubles of
 life, and in the hour of death: <I>Therefore we are,</I> or ought to 
 be, <I>always confident</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>We are confident, and willing rather to be absent from the body.</I> 
 True Christians, if they duly considered the prospect faith gives them 
 of another world, and the good reasons of their hope of blessedness 
 after death, would be comforted under the troubles of life, and 
 supported in the hour of death: they should take courage, when they are 
 encountering the last enemy, and be willing rather to die than live, 
 when it is the will of God that they should <I>put off this 
 tabernacle.</I> Note, As those who are born from above long to be 
 there, so it is but being absent from the body, and we shall very soon 
 be present with the Lord--but to die, and be with Christ--but to close 
 our eyes to all things in this world, and we shall open them in a world 
 of glory. Faith will be turned into sight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He proceeds to deduce an inference to excite and quicken himself 
 and others to duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 So it is that well-grounded hopes of heaven will be far from giving the 
 least encouragement to sloth and sinful security; on the contrary, they 
 should stir us up to use the greatest care and diligence in religion: 
 <I>Wherefore,</I> or because we hope to be present with the Lord, <I>we 
 labour</I> and take pains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <B><I>Philotimoumetha</I></B>--<I>We are ambitious,</I> and labour as 
 industriously as the most ambitious men do to obtain what they aim at. 
 Here observe, 

 1. What it was that the apostle was thus ambitious of--<I>acceptance
 with God.</I> We labour that, living and dying, whether present in the 
 body or absent from the body, <I>we may be accepted of him,</I> the 
 Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that we <I>may please him who hath chosen us,</I> that our great Lord
 may say to us, <I>Well done.</I> This they coveted as the greatest 
 favour and the highest honour: it was the summit of their ambition. 

 2. What further quickening motives they had to excite their diligence,
 from the consideration of the judgment to come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 There are many things relating to this great matter that should awe the 
 best of men into the utmost care and diligence in religion; for 
 example, the certainty of this judgment, for we must appear; the 
 universality of it, for we must all appear; the great Judge before 
 whose judgment-seat we must appear, the Lord Jesus Christ, who himself 
 will appear in flaming fire; the recompence to be then received, for 
 things done in the body, which will be very particular (unto every 
 one), and very just, according to what we have done, whether good or 
 bad. The apostle calls this awful judgment <I>the terror of the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and, by the consideration thereof, was excited to persuade men to 
 repent, and live a holy life, that, when Christ shall appear terribly, 
 they may appear before him comfortably. And, concerning his fidelity
 and diligence, he comfortably appeals unto God, and the consciences of 
 those he wrote to: <I>We are made manifest unto God, and I trust also 
 are made manifest in your consciences.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
 occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to
 <I>answer</I> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
 &nbsp; 13  For whether we be beside ourselves, <I>it is</I> to God: or
 whether we be sober, <I>it is</I> for your cause.
 &nbsp; 14  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus
 judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
 &nbsp; 15  And <I>that</I> he died for all, that they which live should not
 henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
 them, and rose again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here observe, I. The apostle makes an apology for seeming to commend 
 himself and his fellow-labourers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and tells them, 

 1. It was not to commend themselves, nor for their own sakes, that he 
 had spoken of their fidelity and diligence in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1-11">former verses</A>;

 nor was he willing to suspect their good opinion of him. But, 

 2. The true reason was this, to put an argument in their mouths
 wherewith to answer his accusers, who made vain boastings, and gloried 
 in appearances only; that he might give them <I>an occasion to glory on 
 their behalf,</I> or to defend them against the reproaches of their 
 adversaries. And if the people can say that the word has been 
 manifested to their consciences, and been effectual to their conversion 
 and edification, this is the best defence they can make for the 
 ministry of the word, when they are vilified and reproached.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives good reasons for their great zeal and diligence. Some of 
 Paul's adversaries had, it is likely, reproached him for his zeal and 
 fervour, as if he had been a madman, or, in the language of our days, a 
 fanatic; they imputed all to enthusiasm, as the Roman governor told 
 him, <I>Much learning has made thee mad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:24">Acts xxvi. 24</A>.

 But the apostle tells them,

 1. It was for the glory of God, and the good of the church, that he was
 thus zealous and industrious: "<I>Whether we be beside ourselves, or 
 whether we be sober</I> (whether you or others do think the one or the 
 other), it is <I>to God,</I> and for his glory: and it is <I>for your 
 cause,</I> or to promote your good,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 If they manifested the greatest ardour and vehemency at some times, and 
 used the greatest calmness in strong reasonings at other times, it was 
 for the best ends; and in both methods they had good reason for what 
 they did. For, 
 
 2. <I>The love of Christ constrained them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 They were under the sweetest and strongest constraints to do what they 
 did. Love has a constraining virtue to excite ministers and private 
 Christians in their duty. Our love to Christ will have this virtue; and 
 Christ's love to us, which was manifested in this great instance of his 
 dying for us, will have this effect upon us, if it be duly considered 
 and rightly judged of. For observe how the apostle argues for the 
 reasonableness of love's constraints, and declares,

 (1.) What we were before, and must have continued to be, had not Christ 
 died for us: <I>We were dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>If one died for all, then were all dead;</I> dead in law, under 
 sentence of death; dead in sins and trespasses, spiritually dead. Note, 
 This was the deplorable condition of all those for whom Christ died: 
 they were lost and undone, dead and ruined, and must have remained thus 
 miserable for ever if Christ had not died for them.

 (2.) What such should do, for whom Christ died; namely, that they 
 should live to him. This is what Christ designed, that <I>those who 
 live,</I> who are made alive unto God by means of his death, <I>should 
 live to him that died for them, and rose again</I> for their sakes 
 also, and that they should not live <I>to themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Note, We should not make ourselves, but Christ, the end of our living 
 and actions: and it was one end of Christ's death to cure us of this 
 self-love, and to excite us always to act under the commanding 
 influence of his love. A Christian's life should be consecrated to 
 Christ; and then do we live as we ought to live when we live to Christ, 
 who died for us.</P>

 reconciliation;

 committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
 &nbsp; 20  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did

 that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle mentions two things that are necessary in 
 order to our living to Christ, both of which are the consequences of 
 Christ's dying for us; namely, regeneration and reconciliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Regeneration, which consists of two things; namely, 

 1. Weanedness from the world: "<I>Henceforth we know no man after the
 flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 We do not own nor affect any person or thing in this world for carnal 
 ends and outward advantage: we are enabled, by divine grace, not to 
 mind nor regard this world, nor the things of this world, but to live 
 above it. The love of Christ is in our hearts, and the world is under 
 our feet." Note, Good Christians must enjoy the comforts of this life, 
 and their relations in this world, with a holy indifference. <I>Yea,
 though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet,</I> says the apostle, 
 <I>we know him no more.</I> It is questioned whether Paul had seen 
 Christ in the flesh. However, the rest of the apostles had, and so 
 might some among those he was now writing to. However, he would not 
 have them value themselves upon that account; for even the bodily 
 presence of Christ is not to be desired nor doted upon by his 
 disciples. We must live upon his spiritual presence, and the comfort it 
 affords. Note, Those who make images of Christ, and use them in their 
 worship, do not take the way that God has appointed for strengthening 
 their faith and quickening their affections; for it is the will of God 
 that we should not know Christ any more after the flesh. 

 2. A thorough change of the heart: <I>For if any man be in Christ,</I>
 if any man be a Christian indeed, and will approve himself such, <I>he 
 is,</I> or he must be, <I>a new creature,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Some read it, <I>Let him be a new creature.</I> This ought to be the 
 care of all who profess the Christian faith, that they be new 
 creatures; not only that they have a new name, and wear a new livery, 
 but that they have a new heart and new nature. And so great is the 
 change the grace of God makes in the soul, that, as it follows, <I>old 
 things are passed away</I>--old thoughts, old principles, and old 
 practices, are passed away; and <I>all these things must become 
 new.</I> Note, Regenerating grace creates a new world in the soul; all 
 things are new. The renewed man acts from new principles, by new rules, 
 with new ends, and in new company.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Reconciliation, which is here spoken of under a double notion:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As an unquestionable privilege, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Reconciliation supposes a quarrel, or breach of friendship; and sin has 
 made a breach, it has broken the friendship between God and man. The 
 heart of the sinner is filled with enmity against God, and God is 
 justly offended with the sinner. Yet, behold, there may be a 
 reconciliation; the offended Majesty of heaven is willing to be 
 reconciled. And observe, 

 1. He has appointed the Mediator of reconciliation. He has reconciled
 us to himself by Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 God is to be owned from first to last in the undertaking and 
 performance of the Mediator. All things relating to our reconciliation 
 by Jesus Christ are of God, who by the mediation of Jesus Christ has 
 reconciled the world to himself, and put himself into a capacity of 
 being actually reconciled to offenders, without any wrong or injury to 
 his justice or holiness, and does not impute to men their trespasses, 
 but recedes from the rigour of the first covenant, which was broken, 
 and does not insist upon the advantage he might justly take against us 
 for the breach of that covenant, but is willing to enter into a new 
 treaty, and into a new covenant of grace, and, according to the tenour 
 thereof, freely to forgive us all our sins, and justify freely by his 
 grace all those who do believe. 

 2. He has appointed the <I>ministry of reconciliation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 By the inspiration of God the scriptures were written, which contain 
 the word of reconciliation, showing us that peace was made by the blood 
 of the cross, that reconciliation is wrought, and directing us how we 
 may be interested therein. And he has appointed the office of the 
 ministry, which is a <I>ministry of reconciliation:</I> ministers are 
 to open and proclaim to sinners the terms of mercy and reconciliation, 
 and persuade them to comply therewith. For,</P>

 2. Reconciliation is here spoken of as our indispensable duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 As God is willing to be reconciled to us, we ought to be reconciled to 
 God. And it is the great end and design of the gospel, that word of 
 reconciliation, to prevail upon sinners to lay aside their enmity 
 against God. Faithful ministers are Christ's ambassadors, sent to treat 
 with sinners on peace and reconciliation: they come in God's name, with 
 his entreaties, and act in Christ's stead, doing the very thing he did 
 when he was upon this earth, and what he wills to be done now that he 
 is in heaven. Wonderful condescension! Though God can be no loser by 
 the quarrel, nor gainer by the peace, yet by his ministers he beseeches 
 sinners to lay aside their enmity, and accept of the terms he offers, 
 that they would be reconciled to him, to all his attributes, to all his 
 laws, and to all his providences, to believe in the Mediator, to accept 
 the atonement, and comply with his gospel, in all the parts of it and 
 in the whole design of it. And for our encouragement so to do the 
 apostle subjoins what should be well known and duly considered by us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 namely, 

 (1.) The purity of the Mediator: <I>He knew no sin.</I> 

 (2.) The sacrifice he offered: <I>He was made sin;</I> not a sinner, 
 but <I>sin,</I> that is, a sin-offering, a sacrifice for sin.

 (3.) The end and design of all this: that <I>we might be made the
 righteousness of God in him,</I> might be justified freely by the grace 
 of God through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Note, 

 [1.] As Christ, who knew no sin of his own, was made sin for us, so we, 
 who have no righteousness of our own, are made the righteousness of God 
 in him.

 [2.] Our reconciliation to God is only through Jesus Christ, and for
 the sake of his merit: on him therefore we must rely, and make mention 
 of his righteousness and his only.</P>
