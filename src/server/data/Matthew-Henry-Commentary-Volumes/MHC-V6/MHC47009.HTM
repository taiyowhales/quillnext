 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle seems to excuse his earnestness in pressing
 the Corinthians to the duty of charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>),

 and proceeds to give directions about the acceptable way and manner of
 performing it, namely, bountifully, deliberately, and freely; and gives
 good encouragement for so doing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:6-15">ver. 6, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is
 superfluous for me to write to you:
 &nbsp; 2  For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of
 you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and
 your zeal hath provoked very many.
 &nbsp; 3  Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should
 be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
 &nbsp; 4  Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you
 unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this
 same confident boasting.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that
 they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your
 bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be
 ready, as <I>a matter of</I> bounty, and not as <I>of</I> covetousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle speaks very respectfully to the 
 Corinthians, and with great skill; and, while he seems to excuse his 
 urging them so earnestly to charity, still presses them thereto, and 
 shows how much his heart was set upon this matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells them it was needless to press them with further arguments 
 to afford relief to their poor brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 being satisfied he had said enough already to prevail with those of 
 whom he had so good an opinion. For, 

 1. <I>He knew their forwardness</I> to every good work, and how they
 had begun this good work a year ago, insomuch that, 

 2. He had boasted of their zeal to the Macedonians, and this had
 provoked many of them to do as they had done.  Wherefore he was 
 persuaded, that, as they had begun well, they would go on well; and so, 
 commending them for what they had done, he lays an obligation on them 
 to proceed and persevere.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He seems to apologize for sending Titus and the other brethren to 
 them. He is unwilling they should be offended at him for this, as if he 
 were too earnest, and pressed too hard upon them; and tells the true 
 reasons why he sent them, namely, 

 1.  That, having this timely notice, they might be fully ready

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and not surprised with hasty demands, when he should come to them. When 
 we would have others to do that which is good we must act towards them 
 prudently and tenderly, and give them time. 

 2.  That he might not be ashamed of his boasting concerning them, if
 they should be found unready,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 He intimates that some from Macedonia might <I>haply come with him:</I> 
 and, if the collection should not then be made, this would make him, 
 not to say them, ashamed, considering the boasting of the apostle 
 concerning them. Thus careful was he to preserve their reputation and 
 his own. Note, Christians should consult the reputation of their 
 profession, and endeavour to <I>adorn the doctrine of God our 
 Saviour.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But this <I>I say,</I> He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
 sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
 bountifully.
 &nbsp; 7  Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <I>so let him
 give;</I> not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful
 giver.
 &nbsp; 8  And God <I>is</I> able to make all grace abound toward you; that
 ye, always having all sufficiency in all <I>things,</I> may abound to
 every good work:
 &nbsp; 9  (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to
 the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
 &nbsp; 10  Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister
 bread for <I>your</I> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase
 the fruits of your righteousness;)
 &nbsp; 11  Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which
 causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
 &nbsp; 12  For the administration of this service not only supplieth
 the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many
 thanksgivings unto God;
 &nbsp; 13  Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify
 God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and
 for <I>your</I> liberal distribution unto them, and unto all <I>men;</I>
 &nbsp; 14  And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the
 exceeding grace of God in you.
 &nbsp; 15  Thanks <I>be</I> unto God for his unspeakable gift.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Proper directions to be observed about the right and acceptable 
 manner of bestowing charity; and it is of great concernment that we not 
 only do what is required, but do it as is commanded. Now, as to the 
 manner in which the apostle would have the Corinthians give, observe, 
 
 1. It should be bountifully; this was intimated,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 that a liberal contribution was expected, a matter of bounty, not what 
 savoured of covetousness; and he offers to their consideration that men 
 who expect a good return at harvest are not wont to pinch and spare in 
 sowing their seed, for the return is usually proportionable to what 
 they sow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 2. It should be deliberately <I>Every man, according as he purposes in 
 his heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Works of charity, like other good works, should be done with thought 
 and design; whereas some do good only by accident.  They comply, it may 
 be hastily, with the importunity of others, without any good design, 
 and give more than they intended, and then repent of it afterwards. Or 
 possibly, had they duly considered all things, they would have given 
 more. Due deliberation, as to this matter of our own circumstances, and 
 those of the persons we are about to relieve, will be very helpful to 
 direct us how liberal we should be in our contributions for charitable 
 uses. 

 3. It should be freely, whatever we give, be it more or less: <I>Not
 grudgingly, nor of necessity,</I> but cheerfully,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Persons sometimes will give merely to satisfy the importunity of those 
 who ask their charity, and what they give is in a manner squeezed or 
 forced from them, and this unwillingness spoils all they do. We ought 
 to give more freely than the modesty of some necessitous persons will 
 allow them to ask: we should not only deal out bread, but draw out our 
 souls to the hungry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:10">Isa.  lviii. 10</A>.

 We should give liberally, with an open hand, and cheerfully, with an
 open countenance, being glad we have ability and an opportunity to be 
 charitable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Good encouragement to perform this work of charity in the manner 
 directed. Here the apostle tells the Corinthians,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They themselves would be no losers by what they gave in charity. 
 This may serve to obviate a secret objection in the minds of many 
 against this good work who are ready to think they may want what they 
 give away; but such should consider that what is given to the poor in a 
 right manner is far from being lost; as the precious seed which is cast 
 into the ground is not lost, though it is buried there for a time, for 
 it will spring up, and bear fruit; the sower shall receive it again 
 with increase, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>.

 Such good returns may those expect who give freely and liberally in 
 charity. For,

 (1.) God loveth a cheerful giver 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and what may not those hope to receive who are the objects of the 
 divine love? Can a man be a loser by doing that with which God is 
 pleased? May not such a one be sure that he shall some way or other be 
 a gainer? Nay, are not the love and favour of God better than all other 
 things, <I>better than life</I> itself? 

 (2.) God is able to make our charity redound to our advantage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 We have no reason to distrust the goodness of God, and surely we have 
 no reason to question his power; he is <I>able to make all grace 
 abound</I> towards us, and abound in us; to give a large increase of 
 spiritual and temporal good things. He can cause us to have a 
 sufficiency in all things, to be content with what we have, to make up 
 what we give, to be able to give yet more: as it is written 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9">Ps. cxii. 9</A>)
 
 concerning the charitable man, <I>He hath dispersed abroad. He hath 
 given to the poor. His righteousness,</I> that is, his almsgiving, 
 <I>endureth for ever.</I> The honour of it is lasting, the reward of it 
 eternal, and he is still able to live comfortably himself and to give 
 liberally to others. 

 (3.) The apostle puts up a prayer to God in their behalf that they 
 might be gainers, and not losers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 [1.] To whom the prayer is made--to God, <I>who ministereth seed to the 
 sower,</I> who by his providence giveth such an increase of the fruits 
 of the earth that we have not only bread sufficient to eat for one 
 year, but enough to sow again for a future supply: or thus, It is God 
 who giveth us not only a competency for ourselves, but that also 
 wherewith we may supply the wants of others, and so should be as seed 
 to be sown. 

 [2.] For what he prayeth. There are several things which he desires for 
 them, namely, that they may have <I>bread for their food,</I> always a 
 competency for themselves, <I>food convenient,</I>--that God will 
 <I>multiply their seed sown,</I> that they may still be able to do more 
 good,--and that there may be <I>an increase of the fruits of 
 righteousness,</I> that they may reap plentifully, and have the best 
 and most ample returns of their charity, so as to be <I>enriched in 
 every thing to all bountifulness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>),--

 that upon the whole they may find it true that they shall be no losers, 
 but great gainers.  Note, Works of charity are so far from 
 impoverishing us that they are the proper means truly to enrich us, or 
 make us truly rich.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. While they would be no losers, the poor distressed saints would be 
 gainers; for this service would <I>supply their wants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 If we have reason to think them to be saints, whom we believe to be of 
 the household of faith, whose wants are great, how ready should we be 
 to do them good! Our goodness can not extend unto God, but we should 
 freely extend it to these <I>excellent ones of the earth,</I> and thus 
 show that we delight in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This would redound to the praise and glory of God. Many 
 thanksgivings would be given to God on this account, by the apostle, 
 and by those who were employed in this ministration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 These would bless God, who had made them happy instruments in so good a 
 work, and rendered them successful in it. Besides these, others also 
 would be thankful; the poor, who were supplied in their wants, would 
 not fail to be very thankful to God, and bless God for them; and all 
 who wished well to the gospel would <I>glorify God for this 
 experiment,</I> or proof <I>of subjection to the gospel of Christ,</I> 
 and true love to all men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note,

 (1.) True Christianity is a subjection to the gospel, a yielding of 
 ourselves to the commanding influence of its truths and laws. 

 (2.) We must evince the sincerity of our subjection to the gospel by 
 works of charity.

 (3.) This will be for the credit of our profession, and to the praise 
 and glory of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Those whose wants were supplied would make the best return they were 
 able, by sending up many prayers to God for those who had relieved 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And thus should we recompense the kindnesses we receive when we are not 
 in a capacity of recompensing them in any other way; and, as this is 
 the only recompence the poor can make, so it is often greatly for the 
 advantage of the rich.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The apostle concludes this whole matter with this 
 doxology, <I>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Some think that by this unspeakable gift he means the gift of grace 
 bestowed on the churches, in making them able and willing to supply the 
 necessities of the saints, which would be attended with unspeakable 
 benefit both to the givers and receivers. It should seem rather that he 
 means Jesus Christ, who is indeed the unspeakable gift of God unto this 
 world, a gift we have all reason to be very thankful for.</P>
