 In this chapter the apostle prosecutes the argument at the close of the 
 last, and, 

 I. Warns the Corinthians against security, by the example of the Jews,
 who, notwithstanding their profession and privileges, were terribly 
 punished of God for their many sins, their history being left upon 
 record for the admonition of Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. He resumes his former argument

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1-13"><I>ch.</I> viii.</A>),

 about eating things offered to idols; and shows that it was utterly
 inconsistent with true Christianity, that it was downright gross
 idolatry, to eat them as things offered to idols; it is having
 fellowship with devils, which cannot consist with having fellowship
 with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 III. He lets them yet know that though they must not eat of things 
 sacrificed to idols as such, and out of any regard to the idol, yet 
 they might buy such flesh in the markets, or eat it at the table of 
 heathen acquaintances, without asking any questions; for that the 
 heathens' abuse of them did not render the creatures of God unfit to be 
 the food of his servants. Yet liberty of this kind must be used with a 
 due regard to weak consciences, and no offence given by it t Jew nor 
 Gentile, nor to the church of God,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant,
 how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed
 through the sea;
 &nbsp; 2  And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
 &nbsp; 3  And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
 &nbsp; 4  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of
 that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
 &nbsp; 5  But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
 overthrown in the wilderness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In order to dissuade the Corinthians from communion with idolaters, and 
 security in any sinful course, he sets before them the example of the 
 Jews, the church under the Old Testament. They enjoyed great 
 privileges, but, having been guilty of heinous provocations, they fell 
 under very grievous punishments. In these verses he reckons up their 
 privileges, which, in the main, were the same with ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He prefaces this discourse with a note of regard: "<I>Moreover, 
 brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant.</I> I would not have 
 you without the knowledge of this matter; it is a thing worthy both of 
 your knowledge and attention. It is a history very instructive and 
 monitory." Judaism was Christianity under a veil, wrapt up in types and 
 dark hints. The gospel was preached to them, in their legal rites and 
 sacrifices. And the providence of God towards them, and what happened 
 to them notwithstanding these privileges, may and ought to be warnings 
 to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He specifies some of their privileges. He begins, 

 1. With their deliverance from Egypt: "<I>Our fathers,</I> that is, the
 ancestors of us Jews, were <I>under the cloud, and all passed through 
 the sea.</I> They were all under the divine covering and conduct." The 
 cloud served for both purposes: it sometimes contracted itself into a 
 cloudy pillar, shining on one side to show them their way, dark on the 
 other to hide them from their pursuing enemies; and sometimes spread 
 itself over them as a mighty sheet, to defend them from the burning sun 
 in the sandy desert, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:39">Ps. cv. 39</A>.

 They were miraculously conducted through the Red Sea, where the
 pursuing Egyptians were drowned: it was a lane to them, but a grave to 
 these: a proper type of our redemption by Christ, who saves us by 
 conquering and destroying his enemies and ours. They were very dear to 
 God, and much in his favour, when he would work such miracles for their 
 deliverance, and take them so immediately under his guidance and 
 protection.

 2. They had sacraments like ours.

 (1.) <I>They were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud, and in the 
 sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 or into Moses, that is, brought under obligation to Moses's law and 
 covenant, as we are by baptism under the Christian law and covenant. It 
 was to them a typical baptism. 

 (2.) <I>They did all eat of the same spiritual meat, and drink of the 
 same spiritual drink,</I> that we do. The manna on which they fed was
 a type of Christ crucified, the bread which came down from heaven, 
 which whoso eateth shall live forever. Their drink was a stream
 fetched from a rock which followed them in all their journeyings in the 
 wilderness; and this rock was Christ, that is, in type and figure. He 
 is the rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams 
 that issue from him do all believers drink, and are refreshed. Now all 
 the Jews did eat of this meat, and drink of this rock, called here a 
 spiritual rock, because it typified spiritual things. These were great 
 privileges. One would think that this should have saved them; that all 
 who ate of that spiritual meat, and drank of that spiritual drink, 
 should have been holy and acceptable to God. Yet was it otherwise: 
 <I>With many of them God was not well pleased; for they were overthrown 
 in the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, Men may enjoy many and great spiritual privileges in this world, 
 and yet come short of eternal life. Many of those <I>who were baptized
 unto Moses in the cloud and sea,</I> that is, had their faith of his 
 divine commission confirmed by these miracles, were yet overthrown in 
 the wilderness, and never saw the promised land. Let none presume upon 
 their great privileges, or profession of the truth; these will not 
 secure heavenly happiness, nor prevent judgments here on earth, except 
 the <I>root of the matter</I> be in us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should
 not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
 &nbsp; 7  Neither be ye idolaters, as <I>were</I> some of them; as it is
 written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
 play.
 &nbsp; 8  Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed,
 and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
 &nbsp; 9  Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted,
 and were destroyed of serpents.
 &nbsp; 10  Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
 destroyed of the destroyer.
 &nbsp; 11  Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and
 they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the
 world are come.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
 he fall.
 &nbsp; 13  There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to
 man: but God <I>is</I> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
 above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a
 way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having recited their privileges, proceeds here to an 
 account of their faults and punishments, their sins and plagues, which 
 are left upon record for an example to us, a warning against the like 
 sins, if we would escape the like punishments. We must not do as they 
 did, lest we suffer as they suffered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Several of their sins are specified as cautions to us; as, 

 1. We should shun inordinate desires after carnal objects: <I>Not lust
 after evil things, as they lusted,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God fed them with manna, but they must have flesh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4">Num. xi. 4</A>.

 They had food for their supply, but, not content with this, they asked
 <I>meat for their lusts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:14">Ps. xvi. 14</A>.

 Carnal desires get head by indulgence, and therefore should be observed 
 and checked in their first rise: if once they prevail, and bear sway in 
 us, we know not whither they will carry us. This caution stands first, 
 because carnal appetites indulged are the root and source of much sin. 
 
 2. He warns against idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
 The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</I> The sin 
 of the golden calf is referred to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:6">Exod. xxxii. 6</A>.

 They first sacrificed to their idol, then feasted on the sacrifices,
 and then danced before it. Though only eating and drinking are
 mentioned here, yet the sacrifice is supposed. The apostle is speaking
 to the case of the Corinthians, who were tempted to feast on the 
 heathen sacrifices, things offered to idols, though they do not seem to 
 have been under any temptation to offer sacrifice themselves. Even 
 eating and drinking of the sacrifices before the idol, and as things 
 sacrificed, was idolatry, which, by the example of the Israelites, they 
 should be warned to avoid.

 3. He cautions against fornication, a sin to which the inhabitants of
 Corinth were in a peculiar manner addicted. They had a temple among 
 them dedicated to Venus (that is, to lust), with above a thousand 
 priestesses belonging to it, all common prostitutes. How needful was a 
 caution against fornication to those who lived in so corrupt a city, 
 and had been used to such dissolute manners, especially when they were 
 under temptations to idolatry too! and spiritual whoredom did in many 
 cases lead to bodily prostitution. Most of the gods whom the heathens 
 served were represented as patterns of lewdness; and much lewdness was 
 committed in the very worship of many of them. Many of the Jewish 
 writers, and many Christians after them, think that such worship was 
 paid to Baal-Peor; and that fornication was committed with the 
 daughters of Moab in the worship of that idol. They were enticed by 
 these women both to spiritual and corporal whoredom; first to feast on 
 the sacrifice, if not to do more beastly acts, in honour of the idol, 
 and then to defile themselves with strange flesh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1-18">Num. xxv.</A>),

 which brought on a plague, that in one day slew twenty-three thousand,
 besides those who fell by the hand of public justice. Note, 
 Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge, in whatever external 
 relation they may stand to him, and whatever outward privileges he may 
 bestow upon them. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun 
 their plagues. 

 4. He warns us against <I>tempting Christ (as some of them tempted, and
 were destroyed of serpents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 or provoking him to jealousy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He was with the church in the wilderness; he was the angel of the 
 covenant, who went before them. But he was greatly grieved and provoked 
 by them in many ways: <I>They spoke against him and Moses, Wherefore 
 have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?</I> for 
 which reason God sent fiery serpents among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:5,6">Num. xxi. 5, 6</A>),

 by which many of them were stung mortally. And it is but just to fear 
 that such as tempt Christ under the present dispensation will be left 
 by him in the power of the old serpent. 

 5. He warns against murmuring: <I>Neither murmur you as some of them
 also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 by a destroying angel, an executioner of divine vengeance. They 
 quarrelled with God, and murmured against Moses his minister, when any 
 difficulties pressed them. When they met with discouragements in the 
 way to Canaan, they were very apt to fly in the face of their leaders, 
 were for displacing them, and going back to Egypt under the conduct of 
 others of their own choosing. Something like this seems to have been 
 the case of the Corinthians; they murmured against Paul, and in him 
 against Christ, and seem to have set up other teachers, who would 
 indulge and soothe them in their inclinations, and particularly in a 
 revolt to idolatry. Rather let them feast on idol sacrifices than bear
 the reproach, or expose themselves to the ill-will, of heathen 
 neighbours. Such conduct was very provoking to God, and was likely to 
 bring upon them swift destruction, as it did on the Israelites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:37">Num. xiv. 37</A>.

 Note, Murmuring against divine disposals and commands is a sin that
 greatly provokes, especially when it grows to such a head as to issue 
 in apostasy, and a revolt from him and his good ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle subjoins to these particular cautions a more general 
 one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>All these things happened to them for ensamples, and were written 
 for our admonition.</I> Not only the laws and ordinances of the Jews, 
 but the providences of God towards them, were typical. Their sins
 against God, and backslidings from him, were typical of the infidelity 
 of many under the gospel. God's judgments on them were types of 
 spiritual judgments now. Their exclusion from the earthly Canaan 
 typified the exclusion of many under the gospel out of the heavenly 
 Canaan, for their unbelief. Their history was written, to be a standing 
 monitor to the church, even under the last and most perfect 
 dispensation: <I>To us, on whom the end of the world is come,</I> the 
 concluding period of God's gracious government over men. Note, Nothing 
 in scripture is written in vain. God had wise and gracious purposes 
 towards us in leaving the Jewish history upon record; and it is our 
 wisdom and duty to receive instruction from it. Upon this hint the 
 apostle grounds a caution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</I> Note, 
 The harms sustained by others should be cautious to us. He that thinks 
 he stands should not be confident and secure, but upon his guard. 
 Others have fallen, and so may we. And then we are most likely to fall 
 when we are most confident of our own strength, and thereupon most apt 
 to be secure, and off our guard. Distrust of himself, putting him at
 once upon vigilance and dependence on God, is the Christian's best 
 security against all sin. Note, He who thinks he stands is not likely 
 to keep his footing, if he fears no fall, nor guards against it. God 
 has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to 
 ourselves: his protection supposes our own care and caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. But to this word of caution he adds a word of comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Though it is displeasing to God for us to presume, it is not pleasing 
 to him for us to despair. If the former be a great sin, the latter is 
 far from being innocent. Though we must fear and take heed lest we 
 fall, yet should we not be terrified and amazed; for either our trials 
 will be proportioned to our strength, or strength will be supplied in 
 proportion to our temptations. We live indeed in a tempting world, 
 where we are compassed about with snares. Every place, condition, 
 relation, employment, and enjoyment, abounds with them; yet what 
 comfort may we fetch from such a passage! For, 

 1. "<I>No temptation,</I>" says the apostle, "<I>hath yet taken you,
 but such as is common to man,</I> what is human; that is, such as you 
 may expect from men of such principles as heathens, and such power; or 
 else such as is common to mankind in the present state; or else such as 
 the spirit and resolution of mere men may bear you through." Note, The 
 trials of common Christians are but common trials: others have the like 
 burdens and the like temptations; what they bear up under, and break 
 through, we may also. 

 2. <I>God is faithful.</I> Though Satan be a deceiver, God is true. Men
 may be false, and the world may be false; but God is faithful, and our 
 strength and security are in him. He keepeth his covenant, and will 
 never disappoint the filial hope and trust of his children. 

 3. He is wise as well as faithful, and will proportion our burden to
 our strength. <I>He will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are 
 able.</I> He knows what we can bear, and what we can bear up against; 
 and he will, in his wise providence, either proportion our temptations 
 to our strength or make us able to grapple with them. He will take care 
 that we be not overcome, if we rely upon him, and resolve to approve 
 ourselves faithful to him. We need not perplex ourselves with the 
 difficulties in our way when God will take care that they shall not be 
 too great for us to encounter, especially.

 4. When he will make them to issue well. <I>He will make a way to
 escape,</I> either the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it.
 There is no valley so dark but he can find a way through it, no 
 affliction so grievous but he can prevent, or remove, or enable us to 
 support it, and in the end overrule it to our advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. And upon this argument he grounds another caution against idolatry: 
 <I>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</I> Observe, 

 1. How he addresses them: <I>My dearly beloved.</I> It is out of
 tender affection to them that he presses this advice upon them. 

 2. The matter of his advice: "<I>Flee idolatry;</I> shun it, and all
 approaches towards it." Idolatry is the most heinous injury and affront 
 to the true God; it is transferring his worship and honour to a rival.
 
 3. The ground of this advice: "Seeing you have such encouragement to
 trust God, and to be faithful, do you approve yourselves men, be not 
 shaken by any discouragements your heathen enemies may lay before you.
 God will succour and assist, help you in your trials, and help you out 
 of them; and therefore be not guilty of any idolatrous compliances." 
 Note, We have all the encouragement in the world to flee sin and prove 
 faithful to God. We cannot fall by a temptation if we cleave fast to 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
 &nbsp; 16  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
 of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
 communion of the body of Christ?
 &nbsp; 17  For we <I>being</I> many are one bread, <I>and</I> one body: for we
 are all partakers of that one bread.
 &nbsp; 18  Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
 sacrifices partakers of the altar?
 &nbsp; 19  What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which
 is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
 &nbsp; 20  But I <I>say,</I> that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,

 &nbsp; 21  Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils:
 ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of
 devils.
 &nbsp; 22  Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle urges the general caution against idolatry, 
 in the particular case of eating the heathen sacrifices as such, and 
 out of any religious respect to the idol to whom they were 
 sacrificed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He prefaces his argument with an appeal to their own reason and 
 judgment: "<I>I speak to wise men, judge you what I say,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 You are great pretenders to wisdom, to close reasoning and argument; I 
 can leave it with your own reason and conscience whether I do not argue 
 justly." Note, It is no dishonour to an inspired teacher, nor 
 disadvantage to his argument, to appeal for the truth of it to the 
 reason and consciences of his hearers. It comes upon them with the 
 greater force when it comes with this conviction. Paul, an inspired 
 apostle, would yet, in some cases, leave it with the Corinthians to 
 judge whether what he taught was not conformable to their own light and 
 sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He lays down his argument from the Lord's supper: <I>The cup which 
 we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread 
 which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</I> Is 
 not this sacred rite an instrument of communion with God? Do we not 
 therein profess to be in friendship, and to have fellowship, with him? 
 Is it not a token whereby we professedly hold communion with Christ, 
 whose body was broken, and blood shed, to procure remission of our 
 sins, and the favour of God? And can we be in alliance with Christ, or 
 friendship with God, without being devoted to him? In short, the Lord's 
 supper is a feast on the sacrificed body and blood of our Lord, 
 <I>epulum ex oblatis.</I> And to eat of the feast is to partake of the 
 sacrifice, and so to be his guests to whom the sacrifice was offered, 
 and this in token of friendship with him. Thus to partake of the Lord's 
 table is to profess ourselves his guests and covenant people. This is 
 the very purpose and intention of this symbolical eating and drinking; 
 it is holding communion with God, and partaking of those privileges, 
 and professing ourselves under those obligations, which result from the 
 death and sacrifice of Christ; and this in conjunction with all true 
 Christians, with whom we have communion also in this ordinance. 
 <I>Because the bread is one, we, being many, are one body, for we are 
 made partakers of one bread,</I> or loaf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 which I think is thus more truly rendered: "By partaking of one broken 
 loaf, the emblem of our Saviour's broken body, who is the only true 
 bread that came down from heaven, we coalesce into one body, become 
 members of him and one another." Those who truly partake by faith have 
 this communion with Christ, and one another; and those who eat the 
 outward elements make profession of having this communion, of belonging 
 to God and the blessed fraternity of his people and worshippers. This 
 is the true meaning of this holy rite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He confirms this from the Jewish worship and customs: <I>Behold 
 Israel after the flesh: are not those who eat of the sacrifices 
 partakers of the altar,</I> that is, of the sacrifice offered upon it? 
 Those who were admitted to eat of the offerings were reckoned to 
 partake of the sacrifice itself, as made for them, and to be sanctified 
 thereby; and therefore surely to worship God, and be in alliance or 
 covenant with him, even the God of Israel, to whom the sacrifice was 
 made: this was a symbol or token of holding communion with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He applies this to the argument against feasting with idolaters on 
 their sacrifices, and to prove those that do so idolaters. This he 
 does, 

 1. By following the principle on which they would argue it to be
 lawful, namely, that an idol was nothing. Many of them were nothing at
 all, none of them had any divinity in them. What was sacrificed to 
 idols was nothing, no way changed from what it was before, but was 
 every whit as fit for food, considered in itself. They indeed seem to 
 argue that, because an idol was nothing, what was offered was no 
 sacrifice, but common and ordinary food, of which they might therefore 
 eat with as little scruple. Now the apostle allows that the food was 
 not changed as to its nature, was as fit to be eaten as common food, 
 where it was set before any who knew not of its having been offered to 
 an idol. But, 

 2. He proves that the eating of it as a part of a heathen sacrifice
 was,

 (1.) A partaking with them in their idolatry. <I>It was having 
 fellowship with devils,</I> because what the Gentiles sacrificed they 
 sacrificed to devils; and to feast with them upon these sacrifices was 
 to partake in the sacrifice, and therefore to worship the god to whom 
 it was made, and have fellowship or communion with him just as he who 
 eats the Lord's supper is supposed to partake in the Christian 
 sacrifice; or as those who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what 
 was offered on their altar. But heathens sacrificed to devils: 
 "Therefore do not feast on their sacrifices. Doing it is a token of 
 your having fellowship with the demons to whom they are offered. I 
 would not have you be in communion with devils." 

 (2.) It was a virtual renouncing of Christianity: <I>You cannot drink 
 the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: you cannot be partakers of 
 the Lord's table, and the table of devils,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 To partake of this Christian feast was to have communion with Christ: 
 to partake of the feasts made in honour of the heathen idols, and made 
 of things sacrificed to them, was to have communion with devils. Now 
 this was to compound contraries; it was by no means consistent. 
 Communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at 
 once. One must be renounced, if the other was maintained. He who held 
 communion with Christ must renounce that with devils; he who held 
 communion with devils must by that very deed renounce communion with 
 Christ. And what a manifest self-contradiction must that man's conduct 
 be that would partake of the Lord's table, and yet partake of the table 
 of demons! God and mammon can never be served together, nor fellowship
 be at once had with Christ and Satan. Those who communicate with devils 
 must virtually renounce Christ. This may also intimate that such as 
 indulge themselves in gluttony or drunkenness, and by so doing make 
 their own table the table of devils, or keep up fellowship with Satan 
 by a course of known and wilful wickedness, cannot partake truly of the 
 cup and table of the Lord. They may use the sign, but do not the thing 
 signified thereby. For a man can never be at once in communication with 
 Christ and his church and yet in fellowship with Satan. Note, How much 
 reason have we to look to it that every sin and idol be renounced by 
 us, when we eat and drink at the Lord's table.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He warns them, upon the whole, against such idolatry, by signifying 
 to them that God is a jealous God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</I> It 
 is very probable that many among the Corinthians made light of being at 
 these heathen feasts, and thought there was no harm in it. But the 
 apostle bids them beware. The reason with which the second commandment 
 is enforced is, <I>I am a jealous God.</I> God cannot endure a rival in 
 matter of worship; nor give his glory, nor suffer it to be given, to 
 another. Those who have fellowship with other gods provoke him to 
 jealousy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:16">Deut. xxxii. 16</A>.

 And, before this be done, persons should consider whether they are
 stronger than he. It is a dangerous thing to provoke God's anger, 
 unless we could withstand his power. But <I>who can stand before him 
 when he is angry?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:6">Nah. i. 6</A>.

 This should be considered by all who continue in the love and liking of
 sin, and in league with it, while yet they profess to keep up communion 
 with Christ. Is not this the way to provoke his jealousy and
 indignation? Note, Attention to the greatness of God's power should 
 restrain us from provoking his jealousy, from doing any thing to 
 displease him. Shall we rouse almighty wrath? And how shall we 
 withstand it? Are we a match for God? Can we resist his power, or
 control it? And, if not, shall we arm it against us, by provoking him 
 to jealousy? No, let us fear his power, and let this restrain us from 
 all provocation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle shows in what instances, notwithstanding, 
 Christians might lawfully eat what had been sacrificed to idols. They 
 must not eat it out of religious respect to the idol, nor go into his 
 temple, and hold a feast there, upon what they knew was an 
 idol-sacrifice; nor perhaps out of the temple, if they knew it was a
 feast held upon a sacrifice, but there were cases wherein they might 
 without sin eat what had been offered. Some such the apostle here 
 enumerates.--But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives a caution against abusing our liberty in lawful things. 
 That may be lawful which is not expedient, which will not edify. A 
 Christian must not barely consider what is lawful, but what is 
 expedient, and for the use of edification. A private Christian should 
 do so even in his private conduct. <I>He must not seek his own only, 
 but his neighbour's wealth.</I> He must be concerned not to hurt his 
 neighbour, nay, he must be concerned to promote his welfare; and must 
 consider how to act so that he may help others, and not hinder them in 
 their holiness, comfort, or salvation. Those who allow themselves in 
 every thing not plainly sinful in itself will often run into what is 
 evil by accident, and do much mischief to others. Every thing lawful in 
 itself to be done is not therefore lawfully done. Circumstances may 
 make that a sin which in itself is none. These must be weighed, and the 
 expediency of an action, and its tendency to edification, must be 
 considered before it be done. Note, The welfare of others, as well as 
 our own convenience, must be consulted in many things we do, if we 
 would do them well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells them that what was <I>sold in the shambles they might eat 
 without asking questions.</I> The priest's share of heathen sacrifices 
 was thus frequently offered for sale, after it had been offered in the 
 temple. Now the apostle tells them they need not be so scrupulous as to 
 ask the butcher in the market whether the meat he sold had been offered 
 to an idol? It was there sold as common food, and as such might be 
 bought and used; <I>for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness 
 thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and the fruit and products of the earth were designed by him, the great 
 proprietor, for the use and subsistence of mankind, and more especially 
 of his own children and servants. <I>Every creature of God is good, and 
 nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is 
 sanctified by the word of God and prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4,5">1 Tim. iv. 4, 5</A>.

 <I>To the pure all things are pure,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 Note, Though it is sinful to use any food in an idolatrous manner, it
 is no sin, after such abuse, to apply it, in a holy manner, to its 
 common use.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He adds that if they were invited by any heathen acquaintances to 
 a feast, <I>they might go, and eat what was set before them, without 
 asking questions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>nay, though</I> they knew things sacrificed to idols were served up 
 at such entertainments, as well as sold in the shambles. Note, The 
 apostle does not prohibit their going to a feast upon the invitation of 
 those that believed not. There is a civility owing even to infidels and 
 heathens. Christianity does by no means bind us up from the common 
 offices of humanity, nor allow us an uncourteous behaviour to any of 
 our own kind, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments 
 or practices. And when Christians were invited to feast with infidels 
 they were not to ask needless questions about the food set before them, 
 but eat without scruple. Needless enquiries might perplex their minds 
 and consciences, for which reason they were to be avoided. Any thing 
 fit to be eaten, that was set before them at a common entertainment, 
 they might lawfully eat. And why then should they scrupulously enquire 
 whether what was set before them had been sacrificed? It is to be 
 understood of civil feasting, not religious; for the latter among the 
 heathens was feasting upon their sacrifices, which he had condemned 
 before as a participation in their idolatrous worship. At a common 
 feast they might expect common food; and they needed not to move 
 scruples in their own minds whether what was set before them was 
 otherwise or no. Note, Though Christians should be very careful to know 
 and understand their duty, yet they should not, by needless enquiries, 
 perplex themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Yet, even at such an entertainment, he adds, if any should say it 
 was a thing that had been offered to idols, they should refrain: <I>Eat 
 not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience' sake.</I> Whether 
 it were the master of the feast or any of the guests, whether it were 
 spoken in the hearing of all or whispered in the ear, they should 
 refrain for his sake who suggested this to them, whether he were an 
 infidel or an infirm Christian; and for conscience' sake, out of regard 
 to conscience, that they might show a regard to it in themselves, and 
 keep up a regard to it in others. This he backs with the same reason as 
 the former: <I>For the earth is the Lord's.</I> There is food enough 
 provided by our common Lord, of which we maya eat without scruple. The 
 same doctrine may be variously improved, as here: "The earth is the 
 Lord's, therefore you may eat any thing without scruple that is set 
 before you as common food; and yet, because the earth is the Lord's, 
 eat nothing that will give offence, lay a stumbling-block before 
 others, and encourage some in idolatry, or tempt others to eat when 
 they are not clear in their own mind that it is lawful, and so sin, and 
 wound their own consciences." Note, Christians should be very cautious 
 of doing what may thus prejudice the consciences of others, and weaken 
 their authority with them, which is by all means to be kept up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He urges them to refrain where they will give offence, while yet he 
 allows it lawful to eat what was set before them as common food, though 
 it had been offered in sacrifice. "Another man's conscience is no 
 measure to our conduct. What he thinks unlawful is not thereby made 
 unlawful to me, but may be a matter of liberty still; and as long as I 
 own God as a giver of my food, and render him thanks for it, it is very 
 unjust to reproach me for using it." This must be understood abstracted 
 from the scandal given by eating in the circumstance mentioned. Though 
 some understand it to mean, "Why should I, by using the liberty I have, 
 give occasion to those who are scandalized to speak evil of me?" 
 According to that advice of the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:16">Rom. xiv. 16</A>),

 <I>Let not your good be evil spoken of.</I> Note, Christians should 
 take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, nor their own 
 reproach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostle takes occasion from this discourse to lay down a rule 
 for Christians' conduct, and apply it to this particular case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),

 namely, that in eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at 
 the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the 
 fundamental principle of practical godliness. The great end of all 
 practical religion must direct us where particular and express rules 
 are wanting. Nothing must be done against the glory of God, and the 
 good of our neighbours, connected with it. Nay, the tendency of our 
 behaviour to the common good, and the credit of our holy religion, 
 should give direction to it. And therefore nothing should be done by us 
 to offend any, <I>whether Jew, or Gentile, or the church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 The Jews should not be unnecessarily grieved nor prejudiced, who have 
 such an abhorrence of idols that they reckon every thing offered to 
 them thereby defiled, and that it will pollute and render culpable all 
 who partake of it; nor should heathens be countenanced in their 
 idolatry by any behaviour of ours, which they may construe as homage or 
 honour done to their idols; nor young converts from Gentilism take any 
 encouragement from our conduct to retain any veneration for the heathen 
 gods and worship, which they have renounced: nor should we do any thing 
 that may be a means to pervert any members of the church from their 
 Christian profession or practice. Our own humour and appetite must not 
 determine our practice, but the honour of God and the good and 
 edification of the church. We should not so much consult our own 
 pleasure and interest as the advancement of the kingdom of God among 
 men. Note, A Christian should be a man devoted to God, and of a public 
 spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He presses all upon them by his own example: <I>Even as I please 
 all men</I> (or study to do it) <I>in all things</I> (that I lawfully
 can), <I>not seeking my own profit, but that of many, that they may be 
 saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Note, A preacher may press his advice home with boldness and authority 
 when he can enforce it with his own example. He is most likely to 
 promote a public spirit in others who can give evidence of it in 
 himself. And it is highly commendable in a minister to neglect his own 
 advantage that he may promote the salvation of his hearers. This shows 
 that he has a spirit suitable to his function. It is a station for 
 public usefulness, and can never be faithfully discharged by a man of a 
 narrow spirit and selfish principles.</P>
