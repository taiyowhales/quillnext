 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have an account of the persecutions of the 
 Christians, and the propagating of Christianity thereby. It was 
 strange, but very true, that the disciples of Christ the more they were 
 afflicted the more they multiplied. 

 I. Here is the church suffering; upon the occasion of putting Stephen
 to death a very sharp storm arose, which forced many from Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Here is the church spreading by the ministry of Philip and others
 that were dispersed upon that occasion. We have here, 

 1. The gospel brought to Samaria, preached there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>),
 
 embraced there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>),
 
 even by Simon Magus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>);

 the gift of the Holy Ghost conferred upon some of the believing 
 Samaritans by the imposition of the hands of Peter and John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>);

 and the severe rebuke given by Peter to Simon Magus for offering money 
 for a power to bestow that gift, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>.

 2. The gospel sent to Ethiopia, by the eunuch, a person of quality of 
 that country. He is returning home in his chariot from Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 Philip is sent to him, and in his chariot preaches Christ to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:29-35">ver. 29-35</A>),
 
 baptizes him upon his profession of the Christian faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:36-38">ver. 36-38</A>),
 
 and the leaves him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39,40">ver. 39, 40</A>.

 Thus in different ways and methods the gospel was dispersed among the
 nations, and, one way or other, "Have they not all heard?"</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time
 there was a great persecution against the church which was at
 Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the
 regions of Jud&aelig;a and Samaria, except the apostles.
 &nbsp; 2 And devout men carried Stephen <I>to his burial,</I> and made
 great lamentation over him.
 &nbsp; 3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into
 every house, and haling men and women committed <I>them</I> to prison.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Something more concerning Stephen and his death; how people stood 
 affected to it--variously, as generally in such cases, according to
 men's different sentiments of things. Christ had said to his disciples, 
 when he was parting with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:20">John xvi. 20</A>),

 <I>You shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice.</I> 
 Accordingly here is, 

 1. Stephen's death rejoiced in by one--by many, no doubt, but by one in
 particular, and that was Saul, who was afterwards called Paul; he was 
 <I>consenting to his death,</I> <B><I>syneudokon</I></B>--<I>he
 consented to it with delight</I> (so the word signifies); he was 
 pleased with it. He fed his eyes with this bloody spectacle, in hopes 
 it would put a stop to the growth of Christianity. We have reason to 
 think that Paul ordered Luke to insert this, for shame to himself, and 
 glory to free grace. Thus he owns himself guilty of the blood of 
 Stephen, and aggravates it with this, that he did not do it with regret 
 and reluctancy, but with delight and a full satisfaction, like those 
 who not only <I>do such things, but have pleasure in those that do 
 them.</I> 
 
 2. Stephen's death bewailed by others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)--

 <I>devout men,</I> which some understand of those that were properly so 
 called, <I>proselytes,</I> one of whom Stephen himself probably was. 
 Or, it may be taken more largely; some of the church that were more 
 devout and zealous than the rest went and gathered up the poor crushed 
 and broken remains, to which they gave a decent interment, probably in 
 the <I>field of blood,</I> which was bought some time ago to bury 
 strangers in. They buried him solemnly, and made great lamentation over 
 him. Though his death was of great advantage to himself, and great
 service to the church, yet they bewailed it as a general loss, so well 
 qualified was he for the service, and so likely to be useful both as a 
 deacon and as a disputant. It is a bad symptom if, when such men are 
 taken away, it is not laid to heart. Those devout men paid these their 
 last respects to Stephen, 

 (1.) To show that they were not ashamed of the cause for which he 
 suffered, nor afraid of the wrath of those that were enemies to it; 
 for, though they now triumph, the cause is a righteous cause, and will 
 be at last a victorious one.

 (2.) To show the great value and esteem they had for this faithful 
 servant of Jesus Christ, this first martyr for the gospel, whose memory 
 shall always be precious to them, notwithstanding the ignominy of his 
 death. They study to do honour to him upon whom God put honour. 

 (3.) To testify their belief and hope of the <I>resurrection of the 
 dead, and the life of the world to come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of this persecution of the church, which begins upon the 
 martyrdom of Stephen. When the fury of the Jews ran with such violence, 
 and to such a height, against Stephen, it could not quickly either stop 
 itself or spend itself. The bloody are often in scripture called 
 <I>blood-thirsty;</I> for when they have tasted blood they thirst for 
 more. One would have thought Stephen's dying prayers and dying comforts 
 should have overcome them, and melted them into a better opinion of 
 Christians and Christianity; but it seems they did not: the persecution 
 goes on; for they were more exasperated when they saw they could 
 prevail nothing, and, as if they hoped to be too hard for God himself, 
 they resolve to follow their blow; and perhaps, because they were none 
 of them struck dead upon the place for stoning Stephen, their hearts 
 were the more fully set in them to do evil. Perhaps the disciples were 
 also the more emboldened to dispute against them as Stephen did, seeing 
 how triumphantly he finished his course, which would provoke them so 
 much the more. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Against whom this persecution was raised: It was <I>against the 
 church in Jerusalem,</I> which is no sooner planted than it is 
 persecuted, as Christ often intimated that tribulation and persecution 
 would arise <I>because of the word.</I> And Christ had particularly 
 foretold that Jerusalem would soon be made too hot for his followers, 
 for that city had been famous for killing the prophets and stoning 
 those that were sent to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 It should seem that in this persecution many were put to death, for
 Paul owns that at this time he persecuted this way <I>unto the 
 death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:4"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 4</A>),
 
 and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:10"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 10</A>)

 that <I>when they were put to death he gave his voice against 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who was an active man in it; none so zealous, so busy, as Saul, a 
 young Pharisee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 As for Saul (who had been twice mentioned before, and now again for a 
 notorious persecutor) <I>he made havoc of the church;</I> he did all he 
 could to lay it waste and ruin it; he cared not what mischief he did to 
 the disciples of Christ, nor knew when to stop. He aimed at no less 
 than the cutting off of the gospel Israel, that the name of it should 
 be no more in remembrance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4">Ps. lxxxiii. 4</A>.

 He was the fittest tool the chief priests could find out to serve their
 purposes; he was informer-general against the disciples, a messenger of 
 the great council to be employed in searching for meetings, and seizing 
 all that were suspected to favour that way. Saul was bred a scholar, a 
 gentleman, and yet did not think it below him to be employed in the 
 vilest work of that kind.

 (1.) He <I>entered into every house,</I> making no difficulty of 
 breaking open doors, night or day, and having a force attending him for 
 that purpose. He entered into every house where they used to hold their 
 meetings, or every house that had any Christians in it, or was thought 
 to have. No man could be secure in his own house, though it was his 
 castle. 

 (2.) He haled, with the utmost contempt and cruelty, both men and 
 women, dragged them along the streets, without any regard to the 
 tenderness of the weaker sex; he stooped so low as to take cognizance 
 of the meanest that were leavened with the gospel, so extremely bigoted 
 was he. 

 (3.) He committed them to prison, in order to their being tried and put 
 to death, unless they would renounce Christ; and some, we find, were 
 compelled by him to blaspheme,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:11"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What was the effect of this persecution: <I>They were all scattered 
 abroad</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not all the believers, but all the preachers, who were principally 
 struck at, and against whom warrants were issued out to take them up. 
 They, remembering our Master's rule (<I>when they persecute you in one 
 city, flee to another</I>), dispersed themselves by agreement 
 <I>throughout the regions of Judea</I> and of Samaria; not so much for 
 fear of sufferings (for Judea and Samaria were not so far off from 
 Jerusalem but that, if they made a public appearance there, as they 
 determined to do, their persecutors' power would soon reach them 
 there), but because they looked upon this as an intimation of 
 Providence to them to scatter. Their work was pretty well done in 
 Jerusalem, and now it was time to think of the necessities of other 
 places; for their Master had told them that they must be his witnesses 
 in Jerusalem first, and then <I>in all Judea and in Samaria,</I> and 
 then <I>to the uttermost part of the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>),

 and this method they observe. Through persecution may not drive us off
 from our work, yet it may send us, as a hint of Providence, to work 
 elsewhere. The preachers were all scattered <I>except the
 apostles,</I> who, probably, were directed by the Spirit to continue at 
 Jerusalem yet for some time, they being, by the special providence of 
 God, screened from the storm, and by the special grace of God enabled 
 to face the storm. They tarried at Jerusalem, that they might be ready
 to go where their assistance was most needed by the other preachers 
 that were sent to break the ice; as Christ ordered his disciples to go 
 to those places where he himself designed to go, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1">Luke x. 1</A>.

 The apostles continued longer together at Jerusalem than one would have
 thought, considering the command and commission given them, to <I>go 
 into all the world,</I> and to <I>disciple all nations.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:6;Ga+1:17"><I>ch.</I> xv. 6; Gal. i. 17</A>.

 But what was done by the evangelists whom they sent forth was reckoned
 as done by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
 preaching the word.
 &nbsp; 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached
 Christ unto them.
 &nbsp; 6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things
 which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
 &nbsp; 7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
 that were possessed <I>with them:</I> and many taken with palsies, and
 that were lame, were healed.
 &nbsp; 8 And there was great joy in that city.
 &nbsp; 9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime
 in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of
 Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
 &nbsp; 10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
 saying, This man is the great power of God.
 &nbsp; 11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
 bewitched them with sorceries.
 &nbsp; 12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things
 concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they
 were baptized, both men and women.
 &nbsp; 13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized,
 he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles
 and signs which were done.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Samson's riddle is here again unriddled: <I>Out of the eater comes 
 forth meat, and out of the strong sweetness.</I> The persecution that 
 was designed to extirpate the church was by the overruling providence 
 of God made an occasion of the enlargement of it. Christ had said, <I>I 
 am come to send fire on the earth;</I> and they thought, by scattering 
 those who were kindled with that fire, to have put it out, but instead 
 of this they did but help to spread it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a general account of what was done by them all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>They went every where, preaching the word.</I> They did not go to 
 hide themselves for fear of suffering, no, nor to show themselves as 
 proud of their sufferings; but they went up and down to scatter the 
 knowledge of Christ in every place where they were scattered. They went 
 every where, into the way of the Gentiles, and the cities of the 
 Samaritans, which before they were forbidden to go into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5">Matt. x. 5</A>.

 They did not keep together in a body, though this might have been a
 strength to them; but they scattered into all parts, not to take their 
 ease, but to find out work. They went <I>evangelizing</I> the world, 
 preaching the word of the gospel; it was this which filled them, and 
 which they endeavoured to fill the country with, those of them that 
 were preachers in their preaching, and others in their common converse. 
 They were now in a country where they were no strangers, for Christ and 
 his disciples had conversed much in the regions of Judea; so that they 
 had a foundation laid there for them to build upon; and it would be 
 requisite to let the people there know what that doctrine which Jesus 
 had preached there some time ago was come to, and that it was not lost 
 and forgotten, as perhaps they were made to believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular account of what was done by Philip. We shall hear of 
 the progress and success of others of them afterwards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19"><I>ch.</I> xi. 19</A>),

 but here must attend the motions of Philip, not Philip the apostle, but
 Philip the deacon, who was chosen and ordained to serve tables, but
 having <I>used the office of a deacon well he purchased to himself a
 good degree, and great boldness in the faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:13">1 Tim. iii. 13</A>.

 Stephen was advanced to the degree of a martyr, Philip to the degree of
 an evangelist, which when he entered upon, being obliged by it to 
 <I>give himself to the word and prayer,</I> he was, no doubt, 
 discharged from the office of a deacon; for how could he serve tables 
 at Jerusalem, which by that office he was obliged to do, when he was 
 preaching in Samaria? And it is probable that two others were chosen in 
 the room of Stephen and Philip. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What wonderful success Philip had in his preaching, and what 
 reception he met with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The place he chose was the city of Samaria, the head city of 
 Samaria, the metropolis of that country, which stood where the city of 
 Samaria had formerly stood, of the building of which we read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:24">1 Kings xvi. 24</A>,

 now called <I>Sebaste.</I> Some think it was the same with Sychem or
 Sychar, that city of Samaria where Christ was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:5">John iv. 5</A>.

 Many of that city then believed in Christ, though he did no miracle
 among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39,41"><I>v.</I> 39, 41</A>),

 and now Philip, three years after, carries on the work then begun. The
 Jews would have no dealings with the Samaritans; but Christ sent his 
 gospel to slay all enmities, and particularly that between the Jews and 
 the Samaritans, by making them one in his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The doctrine he preached was Christ; for he determined to know 
 nothing else. He <I>preached Christ to them; he proclaimed Christ to 
 them</I> (so the word signifies), as a king, when he comes to the 
 crown, is proclaimed throughout his dominions. The Samaritans had an
 expectation of the Messiah's coming, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:25">John iv. 25</A>.

 Now Philip tells them that he is come, and that the Samaritans are
 welcome to him. Ministers' business is to preach Christ--Christ, and
 him crucified--Christ, and him glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The proofs he produced for the confirmation of his doctrine were 
 miracles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 To convince them that he had his commission from heaven (and therefore 
 not only they might venture upon what he said, but they were bound to 
 yield to it), he shows them this broad seal of heaven annexed to it, 
 which the God of truth would never put to a lie. The miracles were 
 undeniable; they heard and saw the miracles which he did. They heard
 the commanding words he spoke, and saw the amazing effects of them 
 immediately; that he spoke, and it was done. And the nature of the 
 miracles was such as suited the intention of his commission, and gave 
 light and lustre to it. 

 [1.] He was sent to break the power of Satan; and, in token of this, 
 unclean spirits, being charged in the name of the Lord Jesus to remove, 
 <I>came out of many that were possessed with them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 As far as the gospel prevails, Satan is forced to quit his hold of men 
 and his interest in them, and then those are restored to themselves, 
 and to their right mind again, who, while he kept possession, were 
 distracted. Wherever the gospel gains the admission and submission it 
 ought to have, evil spirits are dislodged, and particularly <I>unclean 
 spirits,</I> all inclinations to the lusts of the flesh, which war 
 against the soul; for God has called us from uncleanness to holiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:7">1 Thess. iv. 7</A>.

 This was signified by the casting of these unclean spirits out of the
 bodies of people, who, it is here said, came out <I>crying with a loud 
 voice,</I> which signifies that they came out with great reluctancy, 
 and sorely against their wills, but were forced to acknowledge 
 themselves overcome by a superior power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:26,3:11,9:26">Mark i. 26; iii. 11; ix. 26</A>.

 [2.] He was sent to heal the minds of men, to cure a distempered world,
 and to put it in to a good state of health; and, in token of this, 
 <I>many that were taken with palsies, and that were lame, were 
 healed.</I> Those distempers are specified that were most difficult to 
 be cured by the course of nature (that the miraculous cure might be the 
 more illustrious), and those that were most expressive of the disease 
 of sin and that moral impotency which the souls of men labour under as 
 to the service of God. The grace of God in the gospel is designed for 
 the healing of those that are spiritually lame and paralytic, and 
 cannot help themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:6">Rom. v. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The acceptance which Philip's doctrine, thus proved, met with in 
 Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip 
 spoke,</I> induced thereto by the miracles which served at first to 
 gain attention, and so by degrees to gain assent. There then begin to 
 be some hopes of people when they begin to take notice of what is said 
 to them concerning the things of their souls and eternity--when they
 begin to give heed to the word of God, as those that are well pleased 
 to hear it, desirous to understand and remember it, and that look upon 
 themselves as concerned in it. The common people gave heed to Philip, 
 <B><I>oi ochloi</I></B>--<I>a multitude of them,</I> not here and there
 one, but with one accord; they were all of a mind, that it was fit the 
 doctrine of the gospel should be enquired into, and an impartial 
 hearing given to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The satisfaction they had in attending on, and attending to,
 Philip's preaching, and the success it had with many of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>There was great joy in that city;</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 <I>they believed Philip, and were baptized</I> into the faith of 
 Christ, the generality of them, <I>both men and women.</I> Observe, 
 
 [1.] Philip preached <I>the things concerning the kingdom of God,</I> 
 the constitution of that kingdom, the laws and ordinances of it, the 
 liberties and privileges of it, and the obligations we are all under to 
 be the loyal subjects of that kingdom; and he preached the name of 
 Jesus Christ, as king of that kingdom--his <I>name, which is above
 every name.</I> He preached it up in its commanding power and 
 influence--all that by which he has made himself known.

 [2.] The people not only gave heed to what he said, but at length 
 believed it, were fully convinced that it was of God and not of men, 
 and gave up themselves to the direction and government of it. As to 
 this mountain, on which they had hitherto worshipped God, and placed a 
 great deal of religion in it, they were now as much weaned from it as 
 every they had been wedded to it, and become <I>the true worshippers, 
 who worship the Father in spirit and in truth,</I> and in the name of 
 Christ, the true temple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:20-23">John iv. 20-23</A>.

 [3.] When they believed, without scruple (though they were Samaritans)
 and without delay <I>they were baptized,</I> openly professed the 
 Christian faith, promised to adhere to it, and then, by washing them 
 with water, were solemnly admitted into the communion of the Christian 
 church, and owned as brethren by the disciples. <I>Men</I> only were 
 capable of being admitted into the Jewish church by circumcision; but, 
 to show that <I>in Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>),

 but both are alike welcome to him, the initiating ordinance is such as 
 women are capable of, for they are numbered with God's spiritual 
 Israel, though not with Israel according to the flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+1:2">Num. i. 2</A>.

 And hence it is easily gathered that women are to be admitted to the
 Lord's supper, though it does not appear that there were any among 
 those to whom it was first administered.

 [4.] This occasioned great joy; each one rejoiced for himself, as he in 
 the parable who <I>found the treasure hid in the field;</I> and they 
 all rejoiced for the benefit hereby brought to their city, and that it 
 came without opposition, which it would scarcely have done if Samaria 
 had been within the jurisdiction of the chief priests. Note, The 
 bringing of the gospel to any place is just matter of joy, of great 
 joy, to that place. Hence the spreading of the gospel in the world is
 often prophesied of in the Old Testament as the diffusing of joy among
 the nations: <I>Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:4,1Th+1:6">Ps. lxvii. 4; 1 Thess. i. 6</A>.

 The gospel of Christ does not make men melancholy, but fills them with
 joy, if it be received as it should be; for it is <I>glad tidings of 
 great joy to all people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:10">Luke ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What there was in particular at this city of Samaria that made the 
 success of the gospel there more than ordinarily wonderful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Simon Magus had been busy there, and had gained a great 
 interest among the people, and <I>yet they believed the things that 
 Philip spoke.</I> To unlearn that which is bad proves many times a 
 harder task than to learn that which is good. These Samaritans, though
 they were not idolaters as the Gentiles, nor prejudiced against the 
 gospel by traditions received from their fathers, yet had of late been 
 drawn to follow Simon, a conjurer (For so <I>Magus</I> signifies) who 
 made a mighty noise among them, and had strangely <I>bewitched 
 them.</I> We are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How strong the delusion of Satan was by which they were brought 
 into the interests of this great deceiver. He had been for some time, 
 nay, for a <I>long time, in this city, using sorceries;</I> perhaps he 
 came there by the instigation of the devil, soon after our Saviour had 
 been there, to undo what he had been doing there; for it was always 
 Satan's way to crush a good work in its bud and infancy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:3,1Th+3:5">2 Cor. xi. 3; 1 Thess. iii. 5</A>.

 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Simon assumed to himself that which was considerable: 
 <I>He gave out that he himself was some great one,</I> and would have 
 all people to believe so and to pay him respect accordingly; and then, 
 as to every thing else, they might do as they pleased. He had no design 
 to reform their lives, nor improve their worship and devotion, only to 
 make them believe that he was, <B><I>tis megas</I></B>--<I>some divine
 person.</I> Justin Martyr says that he would be worshipped as 
 <B><I>proton theon</I></B>--<I>the chief god.</I> He gave out himself
 to be <I>the Son of God, the Messiah,</I> so some think; or to be an 
 angel, or a prophet. Perhaps he was uncertain within himself what title 
 of honour to pretend to; but he would be thought <I>some great one.</I> 
 Pride, ambition, and an affectation of grandeur, have always been the 
 cause of abundance of mischief both to the world and to the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The people ascribed to him what he pleased. 

 1. <I>They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest,</I>
 both young and old, both poor and rich, both governors and governed. 
 <I>To him they had regard</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>),

 and perhaps the more because the time fixed for the coming of the 
 Messiah had now expired, which had raised a general expectation of the 
 appearing of some great one about this time. Probably he was a native
 of their country, and therefore they embraced him the more cheerfully, 
 that by giving honour to him they might reflect it upon themselves. 

 2. They said of him, <I>This man is the great power of God--the power
 of God, that great power</I> (so it might be read), that power which 
 made the world. See how ignorant inconsiderate people mistake that 
 which is done by the power of Satan, as if it were done by the power of 
 God. Thus, in the Gentile world, devils pass for deities; and in the
 antichristian kingdom <I>all the world wonders after a beast,</I> to 
 whom the dragon gives his power, and <I>who opens his mouth in 
 blasphemy against God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:2-5">Rev. xiii. 2-5</A>.

 3. They were brought to it by his sorceries: <I>He bewitched the people
 of Samaria</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>bewitched them with sorceries</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 that is, either, 

 (1.) By his magic arts <I>he bewitched the minds of the people,</I> at 
 least some of them, who drew in others. Satan, by God's permission, 
 filled their hearts to follow Simon. <I>O foolish Galatians,</I> saith 
 Paul, <I>who hath bewitched you?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:1">Gal. iii. 1</A>.

 These people are said to be bewitched by Simon, because they were so 
 strangely infatuated to believe a lie. Or,

 (2.) By his magic arts he did <I>many signs and lying wonders,</I>
 which seemed to be miracles, but really were not so: like those of the 
 magicians of Egypt, and those of <I>the man of sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:9">2 Thess. ii. 9</A>.

 When they knew no better, they were influenced by his sorceries; but,
 when they were acquainted with Philip's real miracles, they saw plainly 
 that the one was real and the other a sham, and that there was as much 
 difference as between Aaron's rod and those of the magicians. <I>What 
 is the chaff to the wheat?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:28">Jer. xxiii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus, notwithstanding the influence Simon Magus had had upon them, and 
 the unwillingness there generally is in people to own themselves in an 
 error, and to retract it, yet, when they saw the difference between 
 Simon and Philip, they quitted Simon, gave heed no longer to him, but 
 to Philip: and thus you see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How strong the power of Divine grace is, by which they were 
 brought to Christ, who is truth itself, and was, as I may say, the 
 great undeceiver. By that grace working with the word those that had 
 been led captive by Satan <I>were brought into obedience to Christ.</I> 
 Where Satan, as a <I>strong man armed,</I> kept possession of the 
 palace, and thought himself safe, Christ, as a <I>stronger than he,</I> 
 dispossessed him, and <I>divided the spoil; led captivity captive,</I> 
 and made those the trophies of his victory whom the devil had triumphed 
 over. Let us not despair of the worst, when even those whom Simon Magus 
 had bewitched were brought to believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is another thing yet more wonderful, that Simon Magus himself 
 became a convert to the faith of Christ, in show and profession, for a 
 time. <I>Is Saul also among the prophets?</I> Yes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>Simon himself believed also.</I> He was convinced that Philip 
 preached a true doctrine, because he saw it confirmed by real miracles, 
 of which he was the better able to judge because he was conscious to 
 himself of the trick of his own pretended ones. 

 [1.] The present conviction went so far that <I>he was baptized,</I> 
 was admitted, as other believers were, into the church by baptism; and 
 we have no reason to think that Philip did amiss in baptizing him, no, 
 nor in baptizing him quickly. Though he had been a very wicked man, a 
 sorcerer, a pretender to divine honours, yet, upon his solemn 
 profession of repentance for his sin and faith in Jesus Christ, he was 
 baptized. For, as great wickedness before conversion keeps not true 
 penitents from the benefits of God's grace, so neither should it keep 
 professing ones from church-fellowship. Prodigals, when they return,
 must be joyfully welcomed home, though we cannot be sure but that they 
 will play the prodigal again. Nay, though he was now but a hypocrite, 
 and really in <I>the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity</I> all 
 this while, and would soon have been found to be so if he had been 
 tried awhile, yet Philip baptized him; for it is God's prerogative to 
 know the heart. The church and its ministers must go by a judgment of 
 charity, as far as there is room for it. It is a maxim in the law, 
 <I>Donec contrarium patet, semper pr&aelig;sumitur meliori parti--We
 must hope the best as long as we can.</I> And it is a maxim in the 
 discipline of the church, <I>De secretis non judicat ecclesia--The
 secrets of the heart God only judges.</I> 

 [2.] The present conviction lasted so long that he continued with 
 Philip. Though afterwards he apostatized from Christianity, yet not 
 quickly. He courted Philip's acquaintance, and now he that had given 
 out himself to be some great one is content to sit at the feet of a 
 preacher of the gospel. Even bad men, very bad, may sometimes be in a 
 good frame, very good; and those whose hearts still go after their 
 covetousness may possibly not only come before God as his people come, 
 but continue with them. 

 [3.] The present conviction was wrought and kept up by the miracles; he 
 wondered to see himself so far outdone in signs and miracles. Many 
 wonder at the proofs of divine truths who never experience the power of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that
 Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter
 and John:
 &nbsp; 15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they
 might receive the Holy Ghost:
 &nbsp; 16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
 baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
 &nbsp; 17 Then laid they <I>their</I> hands on them, and they received the
 Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles'
 hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
 &nbsp; 19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay
 hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
 thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
 money.
 &nbsp; 21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart
 is not right in the sight of God.
 &nbsp; 22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
 perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
 &nbsp; 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and
 <I>in</I> the bond of iniquity.
 &nbsp; 24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me,
 that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
 &nbsp; 25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of
 the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many
 villages of the Samaritans.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had wonderfully owned Philip in his work as an evangelist at 
 Samaria, but he could do no more than an evangelist; there were some 
 peculiar powers reserved to the apostles, for the keeping up of the 
 dignity of their office, and here we have an account of what was done 
 by two of them there--<I>Peter and John.</I> The twelve kept together
 at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and thither these good tidings were brought them <I>that Samaria had
 received the word of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that a great harvest of souls was gathered, and was likely to be 
 gathered in to Christ there. The word of God was not only preached to 
 them, but received by them; they bade it welcome, admitted the light of 
 it, and submitted to the power of it: <I>When they heard it, they sent 
 unto them Peter and John.</I> If Peter had been, as some say he was, 
 the prince of the apostles, he would have sent some of them, or, if he 
 had seen cause, would have gone himself of his own accord; but he was 
 so far from this that he submitted to an order of the house, and, as a 
 servant to the body, went whither they sent him. Two apostles were 
 sent, the two most eminent, to Samaria, 

 1. To encourage Philip, to assist him, and strengthen his hands.
 Ministers in a higher station, and that excel in gifts and graces, 
 should contrive how they may be helpful to those in a lower sphere, and 
 contribute to their comfort and usefulness. 

 2. To carry on the good work that was begun among the people, and, with
 those heavenly graces that had enriched them, to confer upon them 
 spiritual gifts. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they advanced and improved those of them that were sincere. It 
 is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of them,</I> in those 
 extraordinary powers which were conveyed by the descent of the Spirit 
 upon the day of pentecost. They were none of them endued with the gift
 of tongues, which seems then to have been the most usual immediate 
 effect of the pouring out of the Spirit. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:45,46"><I>ch.</I> x. 45, 46</A>.

 This was both an eminent sign to those that believed not, and of
 excellent service to those that did. This, and other such gifts, they 
 had not, <I>only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,</I> 
 and so engaged in him and interested in him, which was necessary to 
 salvation, and in this they had joy and satisfaction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 though they could not speak with tongues. Those that are indeed given 
 up to Christ, and have experienced the sanctifying influences and 
 operations of the Spirit of grace, have great reason to be thankful, 
 and no reason to complain, though they have not those gifts that are 
 for ornament, and would make them bright. But it is intended that they 
 should go on to the perfection of the present dispensation, for the 
 greater honour of the gospel. We have reason to think that Philip had 
 received these gifts of the Holy Ghost himself, but had not a power to 
 confer them; the apostles must come to do this; and they did it not 
 upon all that were baptized, but upon some of them, and, it should 
 seem, such as were designed for some office in the church, or at least 
 to be eminent active members of it; and upon some of them <I>one gift 
 of the Holy Ghost,</I> and upon others <I>another.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4,8,14:26">1 Cor. xii. 4, 8; xiv. 26</A>.
 
 Now in order to this, 

 1. <I>The apostles prayed for them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The Spirit is given, not to ourselves only

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13">Luke xi. 13</A>),

 but to others also, in answer to prayer: <I>I will put my Spirit within
 you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:27">Ezek. xxxvi. 27</A>),

 <I>but I will for this be enquired of,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 We may take encouragement from this example in praying to God to give 
 the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to those whose spiritual welfare 
 we are concerned for--for our children, for our friends, for our
 ministers. We should pray, and pray earnestly, <I>that they may receive 
 the Holy Ghost;</I> for this includes all blessings.

 2. They laid their hands on them, to signify that their prayers were
 answered, and <I>that the gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon 
 them;</I> for, upon the use of this sign, <I>they received the Holy 
 Ghost, and spoke with tongues.</I> The laying on of hands was anciently 
 used in blessing, by those who blessed with authority. Thus the 
 apostles blessed these new converts, ordained some to be ministers, and 
 confirmed others in their Christianity. We cannot now, nor can any, 
 thus give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; but this may 
 intimate to us that those whom we pray for we should use our endeavours 
 with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they discovered and discarded him that was a hypocrite among 
 them, and this was Simon Magus; for they knew how to <I>separate 
 between the precious and the vile.</I> Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The wicked proposal that Simon made, by which his hypocrisy was 
 discovered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 <I>When he saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy 
 Ghost was given</I> (which should have confirmed his faith in the 
 doctrine of Christ, and increased his veneration for the apostles), it
 gave him a notion of Christianity as no other than an exalted piece of 
 sorcery, in which he thought himself capable of being equal to the 
 apostles, and therefore <I>offered them money, saying, Give me also 
 this power.</I> He does not desire them to lay their hands on him, that 
 he might receive the Holy Ghost himself (for he did not foresee that 
 any thing was to be got by that), but that they would convey to him a 
 power to bestow the gift upon others. He was ambitious to have the 
 honour of an apostle, but not at all solicitous to have the spirit and 
 disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to 
 himself than to do good to others. Now, in making this motion, 

 (1.) He put a great affront upon the apostles, as if they were 
 mercenary men, would do any thing for money, and loved it as well as he 
 did; whereas they had left what they had, for Christ, so far were they 
 from aiming to make it more--

 (2.) He put a great affront upon Christianity, as if the miracles that 
 were wrought for the proof of it were done by magic arts, only of a 
 different nature from what he himself had practised formerly. 

 (3.) He showed that, like Balaam, he aimed at the rewards of 
 divination; for he would not have offered money for this power if he 
 had not hoped to get money by it. 

 (4.) He showed that he had a very high conceit of himself, and that he 
 had never his heart truly humbled. Such a wretch as he had been before
 his baptism should have asked, like the prodigal, to be made as one of 
 the hired servants. But, as soon as he is admitted into the family, no 
 less a place will serve him than to be one of the stewards of the 
 household, and to be entrusted with a power which Philip himself had 
 not, but the apostles only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The just rejection of his proposal, and the cutting reproof Peter 
 gave him for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:20-23"><I>v.</I> 20-23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter shows him his crime 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with 
 money;</I> and thus, 

 [1.] He had overvalued the wealth of this world, as if it were an 
 equivalent for any thing, and as if, because, as Solomon saith, <I>it 
 answers all things,</I> relating to the life that now is, it would 
 answer all things relating to the other life, and would purchase the 
 pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. 

 [2.] He had undervalued the gift of the Holy Ghost and put it upon a 
 level with the common gifts of nature and providence. He thought the 
 power of an apostle might as well be had for a good fee as the advice 
 of a physician or a lawyer, which was the greatest despite that could 
 be done to the Spirit of grace. All the buying and selling of pardons 
 and indulgences in the church of Rome is the product of this same 
 wicked <I>thought, that the gift of God may be purchased with 
 money,</I> when the offer of divine grace so expressly runs, <I>without 
 money and without price.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows him his character, which is inferred from his crime. From 
 every thing that a man says or does amiss we cannot infer that he is a 
 hypocrite in the profession he makes of religion; but this of Simon's 
 was such a fundamental error as could by no means consist with a state 
 of grace; his offering money (and that got by sorcery too) was an 
 incontestable evidence that he was yet under the power of a worldly and 
 carnal mind, and was yet that <I>natural man which receiveth not the 
 things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them.</I> And 
 therefore Peter tells him plainly, 

 [1.] That his heart was <I>not right in the sight of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 "Though thou professest to believe, and art baptized, yet thou art not 
 sincere." We are as our hearts are; if they be not right, we are wrong; 
 and they are open in the sight of God, who knows them, judges them, and 
 judges of us by them. Our hearts are that which they are in the sight 
 of God, who cannot be deceived; and if they be not right in his sight, 
 whatever our pretensions be, our religion is vain, and will stand us in 
 no stead: our great concern is to approve ourselves to him in our 
 integrity, for otherwise we cheat ourselves into our own ruin. Some 
 refer this particularly to the proposal he made; what he asked is 
 denied him, because his <I>heart is not right in the sight of God</I> 
 in asking it. He does not aim at the glory of God nor the honour of 
 Christ in it, but to make a hand of it for himself; he <I>asks, and has 
 not, because he asks amiss, that he may consume it upon his lusts,</I> 
 and be still thought some great one.

 [2.] That he is in <I>the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of 
 iniquity: I perceive that thou art</I> so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is plain dealing, and plain dealing is best when we are dealing 
 about souls and eternity. Simon had got a great name among the people, 
 and of late a good name too among God's people, and yet Peter here 
 gives him a black character. Note, It is possible for a man to continue 
 under the power of sin, and yet to put on a form of godliness. <I>I
 perceive it,</I> saith Peter. It was not so much by the spirit of 
 discerning, with which Peter was endued, that he perceived this, as by 
 Simon's discovery of it in the proposal he made. Note, The disguises of 
 hypocrites many times are soon seen through; the nature of the wolf 
 shows itself notwithstanding the cover of the sheep's clothing. Now the 
 character here given of Simon is really the character of all wicked 
 people. <I>First,</I> They are <I>in the gall of
 bitterness</I>--odious to God, as that which is bitter as gall is to
 us. Sin is an abominable thing, which the Lord hates, and sinners are 
 by it made abominable to him; they are vicious in their own nature.
 Indwelling sin is <I>a root of bitterness,</I> that <I>bears gall and 
 wormwood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:18">Deut. xxix. 18</A>.

 The faculties are corrupted, and the mind embittered against all good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>.

 It intimates likewise the pernicious consequences of sin; the <I>end is
 bitter as wormwood. Secondly,</I> They are <I>in the bond of
 iniquity</I>--bound over to the judgment of God by the guilt of sin,
 and bound under the dominion of Satan by the power of sin; led captive 
 by him at his will, and it is a sore bondage, like that in Egypt, 
 making the life bitter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reads him his doom in two things--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He shall sink with his worldly wealth, which he overvalued: <I>Thy 
 money perish with thee. First,</I> Hereby Peter rejects his offer with 
 the utmost disdain and indignation: "Dost thou think thou canst bribe 
 us to betray our trust, and to put the power we are entrusted with into 
 such unworthy hands? Away with thee and thy money too; we will have 
 nothing to do with either. <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I>" When we 
 are tempted with money to do an evil thing, we should see what a 
 perishing thing money is, and scorn to be biassed by it--It is the
 character of the upright man that he shakes his hands from holding, 
 from touching bribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He warns him of his danger of utter destruction if he
 continued in this mind: "Thy money will perish and thou wilt lose it, 
 and all that thou canst purchase with it. As <I>meats for the belly and 
 the belly for meats</I>

 so goods for money and money for goods, <I>but God shall destroy both 
 it and them</I>--they perish in the using; but this is not the worst of
 it: <I>thou wilt perish with it, and it with thee;</I> and it will be 
 an aggravation of thy ruin, and a heavy load upon thy perishing soul, 
 that thou hadst money, which might have been made to turn to a good 
 account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9">Luke xvi. 9</A>),

 which might have been laid at the apostles' feet, as a charity, and 
 would have been accepted, but was thrust into their hands as a bribe, 
 and was rejected. <I>Son, remember this.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He shall come short of the spiritual blessings which he 
 undervalued 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter;</I> thou hast 
 nothing to do with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, thou dost not 
 understand them, thou art excluded from them, hast put a bar in thine 
 own door; thou canst not receive the Holy Ghost thyself, nor power to 
 confer the Holy Ghost upon others, for <I>thy heart is not right in the 
 sight of God,</I> if thou thinkest that Christianity is a trade to live 
 by in this world, and therefore <I>thou hast no part nor lot</I> in the 
 eternal life in the other world which the gospel offers." Note, 
 <I>First,</I> There are many who profess the Christian religion, and 
 yet have <I>no part nor lot in the matter, no part in Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:8">John xiii. 8</A>),

 <I>no lot in the heavenly Canaan. Secondly,</I> They are those whose 
 <I>hearts are not right in the sight of God,</I> are not animated by a 
 right spirit, nor guided by a right rule, nor directed to the right 
 end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He gives him good counsel, notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Though he was angry with him, yet he did not abandon him; and, though 
 he would have him see his case to be very bad, yet he would not have 
 him think it desperate; <I>yet now there is hope in Israel.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What it is that he advises him to: He must do his first works. 
 <I>First,</I> He must <I>repent,</I>--must see his error and retract
 it--must change his mind and way--must be humbled and ashamed for what
 he has done. His repentance must be particular: "Repent of this, own 
 thyself guilty in this, and be sorry for it." He must lay a load upon 
 himself for it, must not extenuate it, by calling it a mistake, or 
 misguided zeal, but must aggravate it by calling it <I>wickedness,</I> 
 his wickedness, the fruit of his own corruption. Those that have said 
 and done amiss must, as far as they can, unsay it and undo it again by 
 repentance. <I>Secondly,</I> He must <I>pray</I> to God, must pray that 
 God would give him repentance, and pardon upon repentance. Penitents
 must pray, which implies a desire towards God, and a confidence in 
 Christ. Simon Magus, as great a man as he thinks himself, shall not be 
 courted into the apostles' communion (how much soever some would think 
 it a reputation to them) upon any other terms than those upon which 
 other sinners are admitted--repentance and prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What encouragement he gives him to do this: <I>If perhaps the 
 thought of thy heart,</I> this wicked thought of thine, <I>may be 
 forgiven thee.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> There may be a great deal of 
 wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt 
 affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are 
 undone. <I>Secondly,</I> The thought of the heart, though ever so 
 wicked, shall be forgiven, upon our repentance, and not laid to our 
 charge. When Peter here puts a <I>perhaps</I> upon it, the doubt is of 
 the sincerity of his repentance, not of his pardon if his repentance be 
 sincere. <I>If indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven,</I> so 
 it may be read. Or it intimates that the greatness of his sin might 
 justly make the pardon doubtful, though the promise of the gospel had 
 put the matter out of doubt, in case he did truly repent: like that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:29">Lam. iii. 29</A>),
 
 <I>If so be there may be hope.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Simon's request to them to pray for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He was startled and put into confusion by that which Peter said, 
 finding that resented thus which he thought would have been embraced 
 with both arms; and he cries out, <I>Pray you to the Lord for me, that 
 none of the things which you have spoken come upon me.</I> Here was, 
 <I>First,</I> Something well--that he was affected with the reproof
 given him, and terrified by the character given of him, enough to make 
 the stoutest heart to tremble; and, this being so, he begged the 
 prayers of the apostles for him, wishing to have an interest in them, 
 who, he believed, had a good interest in heaven. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Something wanting. He begged of them to pray for him, but did not pray 
 for himself, as he ought to have done; and, in desiring them to pray 
 for him, his concern is more that the judgments he had made himself 
 liable to might be prevented than that his corruptions might be 
 mortified, and his heart, by divine grace, be made right in the sight 
 of God; like Pharaoh, who would have Moses entreat the Lord for him, 
 that he would take away this death only, not that he would take away 
 this sin, this hardness of heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:8,10:17">Exod. viii. 8; x. 17</A>.

 Some think that Peter had denounced some particular judgments against
 him, as against Ananias and Sapphira, which, upon this submission of 
 his, at the apostle's intercession, were prevented; or, from what is 
 related, he might infer that some token of God's wrath would fall upon 
 him, which he thus dreaded and deprecated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the return of the apostles to Jerusalem, when 
 they had finished the business they came about; for as yet they were 
 not to disperse; but, though they came hither to do that work which was 
 peculiar to them as apostles, yet, opportunity offering itself, they 
 applied themselves to that which was common to all gospel ministers. 

 1. There, in the city of Samaria, they were preachers: <I>They
 testified the word of the Lord,</I> solemnly attested the truth of the 
 gospel, and confirmed what the other ministers preached. They did not 
 pretend to bring them any thing new, though they were apostles, but 
 bore their testimony to the word of the Lord as they had received it. 
 
 2. In their road home they were itinerant preachers; as they passed
 through many villages of the Samaritans they preached the gospel. 
 Though the congregations there were not so considerable as those in the 
 cities, either for number or figure, yet their souls were as precious, 
 and the apostles did not think it below them to preach the gospel to 
 them. God has a regard to the inhabitants of his villages in Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>),
 
 and so should we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise,
 and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
 Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
 &nbsp; 27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
 eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians,
 who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem
 for to worship,
 &nbsp; 28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
 prophet.
 &nbsp; 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself
 to this chariot.
 &nbsp; 30 And Philip ran thither to <I>him,</I> and heard him read the
 prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
 &nbsp; 31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And
 he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
 &nbsp; 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was
 led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his
 shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
 &nbsp; 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who
 shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of
 whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
 &nbsp; 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same
 scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
 &nbsp; 36 And as they went on <I>their</I> way, they came unto a certain
 water: and the eunuch said, See, <I>here is</I> water; what doth
 hinder me to be baptized?
 &nbsp; 37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart,
 thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus
 Christ is the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
 down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
 baptized him.
 &nbsp; 39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of
 the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and
 he went on his way rejoicing.
 &nbsp; 40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he
 preached in all the cities, till he came to C&aelig;sarea.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of the conversion of an Ethiopian eunuch to the 
 faith of Christ, by whom, we have reason to think, the knowledge of 
 Christ was sent into that country where he lived, and that scripture 
 fulfilled, <I>Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands</I> (one of the 
 first of the nations) <I>unto God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:31">Ps. lxviii. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Philip the evangelist is directed into the road where he would meet 
 with this Ethiopian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 When the churches in Samaria were settled, and had ministers appointed 
 them, the apostles went back to Jerusalem; but Philip stays, expecting 
 to be employed in breaking up fresh ground in the country. And here we 
 have, 

 1. Direction given him by an angel (probably in a dream or vision of
 the night) what course to steer: <I>Arise, and go towards the 
 south.</I> Though angels were not employed to preach the gospel, they 
 were often employed in carrying messages to ministers for advice and 
 encouragement, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:19"><I>ch.</I> v. 19</A>.

 We cannot now expect such guides in our way; but doubtless there is a
 special providence of God conversant about the removes and settlements 
 of ministers, and one way or other he will direct those who sincerely 
 desire to follow him into that way in which he will own them: <I>he 
 will guide them with his eye.</I> Philip must <I>go southward, to the 
 way that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza,</I> through the desert or 
 wilderness of Judah. He would never have thought of going thither, into 
 a desert, into a common road through the desert; small probability of 
 finding work there! Yet thither he is sent, according to our Saviour's 
 parable, fore-telling the call of the Gentiles, <I>Go you into the 
 highways, and the hedges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:9">Matt. xxii. 9</A>.

 Sometimes God opens a door of opportunity to his ministers in places 
 very unlikely. 
 
 2. His obedience to this direction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>He arose and went,</I> without objecting, or so much as asking,
 "What business have I there?" Or, "What likelihood is there of doing 
 good there?" <I>He went out, not knowing whither he went,</I> or whom 
 he was to meet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account is given of this eunuch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 who and what he was, on whom this distinguishing favour was bestowed. 
 
 1. He was a foreigner, <I>a man of Ethiopia.</I> There were two
 Ethiopias, one in Arabia, but that lay east from Canaan; it should seem 
 this was Ethiopia in Africa, which lay south, beyond Egypt, a great way 
 off from Jerusalem; for <I>in Christ those that were afar off were made 
 nigh,</I> according to the promise, <I>that the ends of the earth 
 should see the great salvation.</I> The Ethiopians were looked upon as 
 the meanest and most despicable of the nations, blackamoors, as if 
 nature had stigmatized them; yet the gospel is sent to them, and divine 
 grace looks upon them, <I>though they are black, though the sun has 
 looked upon them.</I> 

 2. He was a person of quality, a great man in his own country, <I>a
 eunuch,</I> not in body, but in office-lord chamberlain or steward of 
 the household; and either by the dignity of his place or by his 
 personal character, which commanded respect, he was <I>of great 
 authority,</I> and bore a mighty sway <I>under Candace queen of the 
 Ethiopians,</I> who probably was successor to the queen of Sheba, who 
 is called <I>the queen of the south,</I> that country being governed by 
 queens, to whom <I>Candace</I> was a common name, as <I>Pharaoh</I> to 
 the kings of Egypt. He <I>had the charge of all her treasure;</I> so 
 great a trust did she repose in him. <I>Not many mighty, not many 
 noble, are called;</I> but some are. 

 3. He was a proselyte to the Jewish religion, for <I>he came to
 Jerusalem to worship.</I> Some think that he was a proselyte of 
 righteousness, who was circumcised, and kept the feasts; others that he 
 was only a proselyte of the gate, a Gentile, but who had renounced 
 idolatry, and worshipped the God of Israel occasionally in the court of 
 the Gentiles; but, if so, then Peter was not the first that preached 
 the gospel to the Gentiles, as he says he was. Some think that there 
 were remains of the knowledge of the true God in this country, ever 
 since the queen of Sheba's time; and probably the ancestor of this 
 eunuch was one of her attendants, who transmitted to his posterity what 
 he learned at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Philip and the eunuch are brought together into a close 
 conversation; and now Philip shall know the meaning of his being sent 
 into a desert, for there he meets with a chariot, that shall serve for 
 a synagogue, and one man, the conversion of whom shall be in effect, 
 for aught he knows, the conversion of a whole nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Philip is ordered to fall into company with this traveller that is 
 going home from Jerusalem towards Gaza, thinking he has done all the 
 business of his journey, when the great business which the overruling 
 providence of God designed in it was yet undone. He had been at 
 Jerusalem, where the apostles were preaching the Christian faith, and 
 multitudes professing it, and yet there he had taken no notice of it, 
 and made no enquiries after it--nay, it should seem, had slighted it,
 and turned his back upon it; yet the grace of God pursues him, 
 overtakes him in the desert, and there overcomes him. Thus God is often 
 <I>found of those that sought him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.

 Philip has this order, not by an angel, as before, but by the Spirit 
 whispering it in his ear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Go near, and join thyself to this chariot;</I> go so near as that
 gentleman may take notice of thee." We should study to do good to those 
 we light in company with upon the road: thus the lips of the righteous 
 may feed many. We should not be so shy of all strangers as some affect 
 to be. Of those of whom we know nothing else we know this, that they 
 have souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He finds him reading in his Bible, as he sat in his chariot 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 
 He <I>ran to him, and heard him read;</I> he read out, for the benefit 
 of those that were with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He not only relieved the tediousness of the journey, but redeemed time 
 by reading, not philosophy, history, nor politics, much less a romance 
 or a play, but the scriptures, <I>the book of Esaias;</I> that book 
 Christ read in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:17">Luke iv. 17</A>)

 and the eunuch here, which should recommend it particularly to our 
 reading. Perhaps the eunuch was now reading over again those portions 
 of scripture which he had heard read and expounded at Jerusalem, that 
 he might recollect what he had heard. Note, 

 (1.) It is the duty of every one of us to converse much with the holy 
 scriptures.

 (2.) Persons of quality should abound more than others in the exercises 
 of piety, because their example will influence many, and they have 
 their time more at command. 

 (3.) It is wisdom for men of business to redeem time for holy duties; 
 time is precious, and it is the best husbandry in the world to gather 
 up the fragments of time, that none be lost, to fill up every minute 
 with something that will turn to a good account.

 (4.) When we are returning from public worship we should use means in 
 private for the keeping up of the good affections there kindled, and 
 the preserving of the good impressions there made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:18">1 Chron. xxix. 18</A>.

 (5.) Those that are diligent in searching the scriptures are in a fair 
 way to improve in knowledge; for <I>to him that hath shall be 
 given.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He puts a fair question to him: <I>Understandest thou what thou 
 readest?</I> Not by way of reproach, but with design to offer him his 
 service. Note, What we read and hear of the word of God it highly 
 concerns us to understand, especially what we read and hear concerning 
 Christ; and therefore we should often ask ourselves whether we 
 understand it or no: <I>Have you understood all these things?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:51">Matt. xiii. 51</A>.

 And have you understood them aright? We cannot profit by the
 scriptures unless we do in some measure understand them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:16,17">1 Cor. xiv. 16, 17</A>.

 And, blessed by God, what is necessary to salvation is easy to be
 understood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The eunuch in a sense of his need of assistance, desires Philip's 
 company 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>How can I understand,</I> says he, <I>except some one guide me?</I> 
 Therefore pray come up, and sit with me." 

 (1.) He speaks as one that had very low thoughts of himself, and his 
 own capacity and attainments. He was so far from taking it as an
 affront to be asked whether he understood what he read, though Philip 
 was a stranger, on foot, and probably looked mean (which many a less 
 man would have done, and have called him an impertinent fellow, and bid 
 him go about his business, what was it to him?) that he takes the 
 question kindly, makes a very modest reply, <I>How can I?</I> We have 
 reason to think he was an intelligent man, and as well acquainted with 
 the meaning of scripture as most were, and yet he modestly confesses 
 his weakness. Note, Those that would learn must see their need to be 
 taught. The prophet must first own that he knows not what these are, 
 and then the angel will tell him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:13">Zech. iv. 13</A>.

 (2.) He speaks as one very desirous to be taught, to have some one to
 guide him. Observe, He read the scripture, though there were many 
 things in it which he did not understand. Though there are many things 
 in the scriptures which are <I>dark and hard to be understood,</I> nay, 
 which are often misunderstood, yet we must not therefore throw them by, 
 but study them for the sake of those things that are easy, which is the 
 likeliest way to come by degrees to the understanding of those things 
 that are difficult: for knowledge and grace grow gradually. 

 (3.) He invited Philip to <I>come up and sit with him;</I> not as Jehu 
 took Jonadab into his chariot, to come and see his zeal for the Lord of 
 hosts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:16">2 Kings x. 16</A>),

 but rather, "Come, see my ignorance, and instruct me." He will gladly 
 do Philip the honour to take him into the coach with him, if Philip 
 will do him the favour to expound a portion of scripture to him. Note,
 In order to our right understanding of the scripture, it is requisite 
 we should have some one to guide us; some good books, and some good 
 men, but, above all, the Spirit of grace, to lead us into all 
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The portion of scripture which the eunuch recited, with some hints 
 of Philip's discourse upon it. The preachers of the gospel had a very 
 good handle to take hold of those by who were conversant with the 
 scriptures of the Old Testament and received them, especially when they 
 found them actually engaged in the study of them, as the eunuch was 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The chapter he was reading was the fifty-third of Isaiah, two verses
 of which are here quoted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7,8;Ac+8:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>),

 part of the seventh and eighth verses; they are set down according to
 the Septuagint version, which in some things differs from the original
 Hebrew. Grotius thinks the eunuch read it in the Hebrew, but that Luke
 takes the Septuagint translation, as readier to the language in which
 he wrote; and he supposes that the eunuch had learned from the many
 Jews that were in Ethiopia both their religion and language. But,
 considering that the Septuagint version was made in Egypt, which was
 the next country adjoining to Ethiopia, and lay between it and 
 Jerusalem, I rather think that translation was most familiar to him: it 
 appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:4">Isa. xx. 4</A>

 that there was much communication between those two nations--Egypt and
 Ethiopia. The greatest variation from the Hebrew is that what in the 
 original is, <I>He was taken from prison and from judgment</I> (hurried 
 with the utmost violence and precipitation from one judgment-seat to 
 another; or, <I>From force and from judgment he was taken away;</I> 
 that is, It was from the fury of the people, and their continual 
 clamours, and the judgment of Pilate thereupon, that he was taken 
 away), is here read, <I>In his humiliation his judgment was taken 
 away.</I> He appeared so mean and despicable in their eyes that they 
 denied him common justice, and against all the rules of equity, to
 the benefit of which every man is entitled, they declared him innocent,
 and yet condemned him to die; nothing criminal can be proved upon him,
 but he is down, and down with him. Thus <I>in his humiliation his
 judgment was taken away;</I> so, the sense is much the same with that
 of the Hebrew. So that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7,8;Ac+8:32,33">these verses</A>

 foretold concerning the Messiah, 

 (1.) That he should die, should be <I>led to the slaughter,</I> as 
 sheep that were offered in sacrifice--that his life should be taken
 from among men, taken from the earth. With what little reason then was 
 the death of Christ a stumbling-block to the unbelieving Jews, when it 
 was so plainly foretold by their own prophets, and was so necessary to 
 the accomplishment of his undertaking! Then is the offence of the cross 
 ceased. 

 (2.) That he should die wrongfully, should die by violence, should be 
 hurried out of his life, and <I>his judgment shall be taken 
 away</I>--no justice done to him; for he must be <I>cut off, but not
 for himself.</I> 

 (3.) That he should die patiently. Like <I>a lamb dumb before the 
 shearer,</I> nay, and before the butcher too, <I>so he opened not his 
 mouth.</I> Never was there such an example of patience as our Lord 
 Jesus was in his sufferings; when he was accused, when he was abused, 
 he was silent, <I>reviled not again, threatened not.</I> 

 (4.) That yet he should live for ever, to ages which cannot be 
 numbered; for so I understand those words, <I>Who shall declare his 
 generation?</I> The Hebrew word properly signifies <I>the duration of 
 one life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:4">Eccl. i. 4</A>.

 Now who can conceive or express how long he shall continue,
 notwithstanding this; <I>for his life is taken</I> only <I>from the 
 earth;</I> in heaven he shall live to endless and innumerable ages, as 
 it follows in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>,

 <I>He shall prolong his days.</I></P>

 2. The eunuch's question upon this is, <I>Of whom speaketh the prophet 
 this?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 He does not desire Philip to give him some critical remarks upon the 
 words and phrases, and the idioms of the language, but to acquaint him 
 with the general scope and design of the prophecy, to furnish him with 
 a key, in the use of which he might, by comparing one thing with 
 another, be led into the meaning of the particular passage. Prophecies
 had usually in them something of obscurity, till they were explained by 
 the accomplishment of them, as this now was. It is a material question 
 he asks, and a very sensible one: "Does the prophet speak this of 
 himself, in expectation of being used, being misused, as the other 
 prophets were? or does he speak it <I>of some other man,</I> in his own 
 age, or in some age to come?" Though the modern Jews will not allow it 
 to be spoken of the Messiah, yet their ancient doctors did so interpret 
 it; and perhaps the eunuch knew this, and did partly understand it so 
 himself, only he proposed this question, to draw on discourse with 
 Philip; for the way to improve in learning is to consult the learned. 
 As <I>they must enquire the law at the mouth of the priests</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>),

 so they must enquire the gospel, especially that part of the treasure 
 which is hid in the field of the Old Testament, at the mouth of the 
 ministers of Christ. The way to receive good instructions is to ask 
 good questions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Philip takes this fair occasion given him to open to him the great 
 mystery of the gospel concerning <I>Jesus Christ, and him 
 crucified.</I> He <I>began at this scripture,</I> took this for his 
 text (as Christ did another passage of the same prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:21">Luke iv. 21</A>),
 
 and <I>preached unto him Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 This is all the account given us of Philip's sermon, because it was the
 same in effect with Peter's sermons, which we have had before. The 
 business of gospel ministers is to preach Jesus, and this is the 
 preaching that is likely to do good. It is probable that Philip had now 
 occasion for his gift of tongues, that he might preach Christ to this 
 Ethiopian in the language of his own country. And here we have an 
 instance of speaking of the things of God, and speaking of them to good 
 purpose, not only as we <I>sit in the house,</I> but <I>as we walk by 
 the way,</I> according to that rule,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">Deut. vi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The eunuch is baptized in the name of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:36-38"><I>v.</I> 36-38</A>.

 It is probable that the eunuch had heard at Jerusalem of the doctrine 
 of Christ, so that it was not altogether new to him. But, if he had, 
 what could that do towards this speedy conquest that was made of his 
 heart for Christ. It was a powerful working of the Spirit with and by 
 Philip's preaching that gained the point. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The modest proposal which the eunuch made of himself for baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>As they went on their way,</I> discoursing of Christ, the eunuch 
 asking more questions and Philip answering them to his satisfaction, 
 they <I>came unto a certain water,</I> a well, river, or pond, the 
 sight of which made the eunuch think of being baptized. Thus God, by 
 hints of providence which seem casual, sometimes puts his people in 
 mind of their duty, of which otherwise perhaps they would not have 
 thought. The eunuch knew not how little a while Philip might be with 
 him, nor where he might afterwards enquire for him. He could not expect 
 his travelling with him to his next stage, and therefore, if Philip 
 think fit, he will take the present convenience which offers itself of 
 being baptized: "<I>See, here is water,</I> which perhaps we may not 
 meet with a great while again; <I>what doth hinder me to be 
 baptized?</I> Canst thou show any cause why I should not be admitted a 
 disciple and follower of Christ by baptism?" Observe, 

 (1.) He does not demand baptism, does not say, "Here is water and here 
 I am resolved I will be baptized;" for, if Philip have any thing to 
 offer to the contrary, he is willing to waive it for the present. If he 
 think him not fit to be baptized, or if there be any thing in the 
 institution of the ordinance which will not admit such a speedy 
 administration of it, he will not insist upon it. The most forward zeal 
 must submit to order and rule. But, 

 (2.) He does desire it, and, unless Philip can show cause why not, he 
 desires it now, and is not willing to defer it. Note, In the solemn 
 dedicating and devoting of ourselves to God, it is good to make haste, 
 and not to delay; for the present time is the best time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:60">Ps. cxix. 60</A>.
 
 Those who have received the thing signified by baptism should not put
 off receiving the sign. The eunuch feared lest the good affections now 
 working in him should cool and abate, and therefore was willing 
 immediately to bind his soul with the baptismal bonds unto the Lord, 
 that he might bring the matter to an issue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The fair declaration which Philip made him of the terms upon which 
 he might have the privilege of baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 "<I>If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest;</I> that is, If 
 thou believest this doctrine which I have preached to thee concerning 
 Jesus, if thou receivest the record God has given concerning him, and 
 set to thy seal that it is true." He must believe with all his heart, 
 for with the heart man believeth, not with the head only, by an assent 
 to gospel truths in the understanding; but with the heart, by a consent 
 of the will to gospel terms. "If thou do indeed believe with all thy 
 heart, thou art by that united to Christ, and, if thou give proofs and 
 evidences that thou dost so, thou mayest by baptism be joined to the 
 church."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The confession of faith which the eunuch made in order to his being 
 baptized. It is very short, but it is comprehensive and much to the 
 purpose, and what was sufficient: <I>I believe that Jesus Christ is the 
 Son of God.</I> He was before a worshipper of the true God, so that all 
 he had to do now was to <I>receive Christ Jesus the Lord.</I> 

 (1.) He believes that Jesus is <I>the Christ,</I> the true Messiah 
 promised, the <I>anointed One.</I> 

 (2.) That Christ is <I>Jesus--a Saviour,</I> the only Saviour of his
 people from their sins. And, 

 (3.) That this Jesus Christ is the <I>Son of God,</I> that he has a 
 divine nature, as the Son is of the same nature with the Father; and 
 that, being the Son of God, he is the <I>heir of all things.</I> This 
 is the principal peculiar doctrine of Christianity, and whosoever 
 believe this with all their hearts, and confess it, they and their seed 
 are to be baptized.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The baptizing of him hereupon. The eunuch ordered his coachman to 
 stop, <I>commanded the chariot to stand still.</I> It was the best 
 baiting place he ever met with in any of his journeys. <I>They went 
 down both into the water,</I> for they had no convenient vessels with 
 them, being upon a journey, wherewith to take up water, and must 
 therefore go down into it; not that they stripped off their clothes, 
 and went naked into the water, but, going barefoot according to the 
 custom, they went perhaps up to the ankles or mid-leg into the water, 
 and Philip sprinkled water upon him, according to the prophecy which 
 this eunuch had probably but just now read, for it was but a few verses
 before those which Philip found him upon, and was very apposite to his
 case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:15">Isa. lii. 15</A>):

 <I>So shall he sprinkle many nations, kings</I> and great men <I>shall 
 shut their mouths at him,</I> shall submit to him, and acquiesce in 
 him, <I>for that which had not</I> before <I>been told them shall they 
 see, and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</I> 
 Observe, Though Philip had very lately been deceived in Simon Magus, 
 and had admitted him to baptism, though he afterwards appeared to be no 
 true convert, yet he did not therefore scruple to baptize the eunuch 
 upon his profession of faith immediately, without putting him upon a 
 longer trial than usual. If some hypocrites crowd into the church, who 
 afterwards prove a grief and scandal to us, yet we must not therefore 
 make the door of admission any straiter than Christ has made it; they 
 shall answer for their apostasy, and not we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Philip and the eunuch are separated presently; and this is as 
 surprising as the other parts of the story. One would have expected 
 that the eunuch should either have stayed with Philip, or have taken 
 him along with him into his own country, and, there being so many 
 ministers in those parts, he might be spared, and it would be worth 
 while: but God ordered otherwise. As soon as they had <I>come up out of 
 the water,</I> before the eunuch went into his chariot again, <I>the 
 Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 and did not give him time to make an exhortation to the eunuch, as 
 usual after baptism, which it is probable the one intended and the 
 other expected. But his sudden departure was sufficient to make up the 
 want of that exhortation, for it seems to have been miraculous, and 
 that he was <I>caught up</I> in the air in the eunuch's sight, and so 
 carried out of his sight; and the working of this miracle upon Philip 
 was a confirmation of his doctrine, as much as the working of a miracle 
 by him would have been. He was <I>caught away, and the eunuch saw him 
 no more,</I> but, having lost his minister, returned to the use of his 
 Bible again. Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the eunuch was disposed: He <I>went on his way rejoicing.</I> He 
 pursued his journey. Business called him home, and he must hasten to 
 it; for it was no way inconsistent with his Christianity, which places 
 no sanctity nor perfection in men's being hermits or recluses, but is a 
 religion which men may and ought to carry about with them into the 
 affairs of this life. But he went on rejoicing; so far was he from 
 reflecting upon this sudden revolution and change, or advancement 
 rather, in his religion, with any regret, that his second thoughts 
 confirmed him abundantly in it, and he went on, <I>rejoicing with joy 
 unspeakable and full of glory;</I> he was never better pleased in all 
 his life. He rejoiced, 

 (1.) That he himself was joined to Christ and had an interest in him. 
 And, 

 (2.) That he had these good tidings to bring to his countrymen, and a 
 prospect of bringing them also, by virtue of his interest among them, 
 into fellowship with Christ; for he returned, not only a Christian, but 
 a minister. Some copies read

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39">this verse</A>

 thus: <I>And, when they were come up out of the water, the Holy Spirit
 fell upon the eunuch</I> (without the ceremony of the apostle's
 imposition of hands), <I>but the angel of the Lord caught away 
 Philip.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How Philip was disposed of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>He was found at Azotus</I> or <I>Ashdod,</I> formerly a city of the 
 Philistines; there the angel or Spirit of the Lord dropped him, which 
 was about thirty miles from Gaza, whither the eunuch was going, and 
 where Dr. Lightfoot thinks he took ship, and went by sea into his own 
 country. But Philip, wherever he was, would not be idle. <I>Passing 
 through, he preached in all the cities</I> till he came to Cesarea, and 
 there he settled, and, for aught that appears, had his principal 
 residence ever after; for at Cesarea we find him in a house of his own,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:8"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 8</A>.

 He that had been faithful in working for Christ as an itinerant at
 length gains a settlement.</P>
