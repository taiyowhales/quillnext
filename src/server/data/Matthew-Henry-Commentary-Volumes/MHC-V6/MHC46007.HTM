 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle answers some cases proposed to him by the 
 Corinthians about marriage. He, 

 I. Shows them that marriage was appointed as a remedy against
 fornication, and therefore that persons had better marry than burn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. He gives direction to those who are married to continue together,
 though they might have an unbelieving relative, unless the unbeliever 
 would part, in which case a Christian would not be in bondage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 III. He shows them that becoming Christians does not change their
 external state; and therefore advises every one to continue, in the
 general, in that state in which he was called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.

 IV. He advises them, by reason of the present distress, to keep
 themselves unmarried; hints the shortness of time, and how they should
 improve it, so as to grow dead and indifferent to the comforts of the 
 world; and shows them how worldly cares hinder their devotions, and 
 distract them in the service of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:25-35">ver. 25-35</A>.

 V. He directs them in the disposal of their virgins,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:36-38">ver. 36-38</A>.

 VI. And closes the chapter with advice to widows how to dispose of
 themselves in that state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:39,40">ver. 39, 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: <I>It is</I>
 good for a man not to touch a woman.
 &nbsp; 2  Nevertheless, <I>to avoid</I> fornication, let every man have his
 own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
 &nbsp; 3  Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and
 likewise also the wife unto the husband.
 &nbsp; 4  The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
 likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the
 wife.
 &nbsp; 5  Defraud ye not one the other, except <I>it be</I> with consent for
 a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and
 come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your
 incontinency.
 &nbsp; 6  But I speak this by permission, <I>and</I> not of commandment.
 &nbsp; 7  For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man
 hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another
 after that.
 &nbsp; 8  I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for
 them if they abide even as I.
 &nbsp; 9  But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better
 to marry than to burn.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle comes now, as a faithful and skilful casuist, to answer
 some cases of conscience which the Corinthians had proposed to him.
 Those were <I>things whereof they wrote to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 As the lips of ministers should <I>keep knowledge,</I> so the people
 should <I>ask the law at their mouths.</I> The apostle was as ready to
 resolve as they were to propose their doubts. In the former chapter, he
 warns them to avoid fornication; here he gives some directions about
 marriage, the remedy God had appointed for it. He tells them in
 general,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it was good, in that juncture of time at least, to abstain from 
 marriage altogether: <I>It is good for a man not to touch a woman</I> 
 (not to take her to wife), by good here not understanding what is so 
 conformable to the mind and will of God as if to do otherwise were sin, 
 an extreme into which many of the ancients have run in favour of 
 celibacy and virginity. Should the apostle be understood in this sense, 
 he would contradict much of the rest of his discourse. But it is good, 
 that is, either abstracting from circumstances there are many things in 
 which the state of celibacy has the advantage above the marriage state; 
 or else <I>at this juncture,</I> by reason of the distress of the 
 Christian church, it would be a convenience for Christians to keep 
 themselves single, provided they have the gift of continency, and at 
 the same time can keep themselves chaste. The expression also may carry 
 in it an intimation that Christians must avoid all occasions of this 
 sin, and flee all fleshly lusts, and incentives to them; must neither 
 look on nor touch a woman, so as to provoke lustful inclinations.
 Yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He informs them that marriage, and the comforts and satisfactions 
 of that state, are by divine wisdom prescribed for preventing 
 fornication 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <B><I>Porneias</I></B>--<I>Fornications,</I> all sorts of lawless lust. 
 To avoid these, <I>Let every man,</I> says he, <I>have his own wife, 
 and every woman her own husband;</I> that is, marry, and confine 
 themselves to their own mates. And, when they are married, let each 
 render the other <I>due benevolence</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 consider the disposition and exigency of each other, and render 
 conjugal duty, which is owing to each other. For, as the apostle argues 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 in the married state neither person has power over his own body, but 
 has delivered it into the power of the other, the wife hers into the 
 power of the husband, the husband his into the power of the wife. Note, 
 Polygamy, or the marriage of more persons than one, as well as 
 adultery, must be a breach of marriage-covenants, and a violation of 
 the partner's rights. And therefore they should not defraud one another 
 of the use of their bodies, nor any other of the comforts of the 
 conjugal state, appointed of God for keeping <I>the vessel in 
 sanctification and honour,</I> and preventing the lusts of uncleanness, 
 except it be <I>with mutual consent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and <I>for a time</I> only, while they employ themselves in some 
 extraordinary duties of religion, <I>or give themselves to fasting and 
 prayer.</I> Note, Seasons of deep humiliation require abstinence from 
 lawful pleasures. But this separation between husband and wife must
 not be for a continuance, lest they expose themselves to Satan's 
 temptations, by reason of their incontinence, or inability to contain. 
 Note, Persons expose themselves to great danger by attempting to 
 perform what is above their strength, and at the same time not bound 
 upon them by any law of God. If they abstain from lawful enjoyments, 
 they may be ensnared into unlawful ones. The remedies God hath provided 
 against sinful inclinations are certainly best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle limits what he had said about <I>every man's having 
 his own wife,</I> &c. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I speak this by permission, not of command.</I> He did not lay it as 
 an injunction upon every man to marry without exception. Any man might 
 marry. No law of God prohibited the thing. But, on the other hand, not
 law bound a man to marry so that he sinned if he did not; I mean, 
 unless his circumstances required it for preventing the lust of 
 uncleanness. It was a thing in which men, by the laws of God, were in a 
 great measure left at liberty. And therefore Paul did not bind every 
 man to marry, though every man had an allowance. No, he <I>could wish 
 all men were as himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, single, and capable of living continently in that state.
 There were several conveniences in it, which at that season, if not at 
 others, made it more eligible in itself. Note, It is a mark of true 
 goodness to wish all men as happy as ourselves. But it did not answer 
 the intentions of divine Providence as well for all men to have as much 
 command of this appetite as Paul had. It was a gift vouchsafed to such
 persons as Infinite Wisdom thought proper: <I>Every one hath his proper 
 gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.</I> Natural 
 constitutions vary; and, where there may not be much difference in the 
 constitution, different degrees of grace are vouchsafed, which may give 
 some a greater victory over natural inclination than others. Note, The 
 gifts of God, both in nature and grace, are variously distributed. Some 
 have them after this manner and some after that. Paul could wish all 
 men were as himself, but <I>all men cannot receive such a saying, save 
 those to whom it is given,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:11">Matt. xix. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He sums up his sense on this head
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows,</I> to those in a state 
 of virginity or widowhood, <I>It is good for them if they abide even as 
 I.</I> There are many conveniences, and especially at this juncture, in 
 a single state, to render it preferable to a married one. It is 
 convenient therefore <I>that the unmarried abide as I,</I> which 
 plainly implies that Paul was at that time unmarried. <I>But, if they 
 cannot contain, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to 
 burn.</I> This is God's remedy for lust. The fire may be quenched by 
 the means he has appointed. And marriage, with all its inconveniences, 
 is much better than to burn with impure and lustful desires. 
 <I>Marriage is honourable in all;</I> but it is a duty in those who 
 cannot contain nor conquer those inclinations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And unto the married I command, <I>yet</I> not I, but the Lord,
 Let not the wife depart from <I>her</I> husband:
 &nbsp; 11  But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be
 reconciled to <I>her</I> husband: and let not the husband put away
 <I>his</I> wife.
 &nbsp; 12  But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a
 wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him,
 let him not put her away.
 &nbsp; 13  And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and
 if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
 &nbsp; 14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and
 the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your
 children unclean; but now are they holy.
 &nbsp; 15  But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or
 a sister is not under bondage in such <I>cases:</I> but God hath
 called us to peace.
 &nbsp; 16  For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save <I>thy</I>
 husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save
 <I>thy</I> wife?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this paragraph the apostle gives them direction in a case which must 
 be very frequent in that age of the world, especially among the Jewish 
 converts; I mean whether they were to live with heathen relatives in a 
 married state. Moses's law permitted divorce; and there was a famous 
 instance in the Jewish state, when the people were obliged to put away 
 their idolatrous wives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:3">Ezra x. 3</A>.

 This might move a scruple in many minds, whether converts to
 Christianity were not bound to put away or desert their mates, 
 continuing infidels. Concerning this matter the apostle here gives 
 direction. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, he tells them that marriage, by Christ's command, is for 
 life; and therefore those who are married must not think of separation. 
 The wife <I>must not depart from the husband</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 nor the <I>husband put away his wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This <I>I command,</I> says the apostle; <I>yet not I, but the 
 Lord.</I> Not that he commanded any thing of his own head, or upon his 
 own authority. Whatever he commanded was the Lord's command, dictated
 by his Spirit and enjoined by his authority. But his meaning is that 
 the Lord himself, with his own mouth, had forbidden such separations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:32,19:9,Mk+10:11,Lu+16:18">Matt. v. 32; xix. 9;
 Mark x. 11; Luke xvi. 18</A>.

 Note, Man and wife cannot separate at pleasure, nor dissolve, when they
 will, their matrimonial bonds and relation. They must not separate for 
 any other cause than what Christ allows. And therefore the apostle 
 advises that if any woman had been separated, either by a voluntary act 
 of her own or by an act of her husband, she should continue unmarried, 
 and seek reconciliation with her husband, that they might cohabit 
 again. Note, Husbands and wives should not quarrel at all, or should be 
 quickly reconciled. They are bound to each other for life. The divine 
 law allows of no separation. They cannot throw off the burden, and 
 therefore should set their shoulders to it, and endeavour to make it as 
 light to each other as they can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He brings the general advice home to the case of such as had an
 unbelieving mate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord;</I> that is, the Lord had not 
 so expressly spoken to this case as to the former divorce. It does not 
 mean that the apostle spoke without authority from the Lord, or decided 
 this case by his own wisdom, without the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 
 He closes this subject with a declaration to the contrary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 I think <I>also that I have the Spirit of God.</I> But, having thus 
 prefaced his advice, we may attend,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To the advice itself, which is that if an unbelieving husband or 
 wife were pleased to dwell with a Christian relative, the other should 
 not separate. The husband should not put away an unbelieving wife, nor 
 the wife leave an unbelieving husband, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 The Christian calling did not dissolve the marriage covenant, but bind 
 it the faster, by bringing it back to the original institution, 
 limiting it to two persons, and binding them together for life. The 
 believer is not by faith in Christ loosed from matrimonial bonds to an 
 unbeliever, but is at once bound and made apt to be a better relative. 
 But, though a believing wife or husband should not separate from an 
 unbelieving mate, yet if the unbelieving relative desert the believer, 
 and no means can reconcile to a cohabitation, in such <I>a case a 
 brother or sister is not in bondage</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 not tied up to the unreasonable humour, and bound servilely to follow 
 or cleave to the malicious deserter, or not bound to live unmarried 
 after all proper means for reconciliation have been tried, at least of 
 the deserter contract another marriage or be guilty of adultery, which 
 was a very easy supposition, because a very common instance among the 
 heathen inhabitants of Corinth. In such a case the deserted person must 
 be free to marry again, and it is granted on all hands. And some think 
 that such a malicious desertion is as much a dissolution of the 
 marriage-covenant as death itself. For how is it possible that <I>the 
 two shall be one flesh</I> when the one is maliciously bent to part 
 from or put away the other? Indeed, the deserter seems still bound by 
 the matrimonial contract; and therefore the apostle says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>If the woman depart from her husband</I> upon the account of his 
 infidelity, <I>let her remain unmarried.</I> But the deserted party 
 seems to be left more at liberty (I mean supposing all the proper means 
 have been used to reclaim the deserter, and other circumstances make it 
 necessary) to marry another person. It does not seem reasonable that 
 they should be still bound, when it is rendered impossible to perform 
 conjugal duties or enjoy conjugal comforts, through the mere fault of 
 their mate: in such a case marriage would be a state of servitude 
 indeed. But, whatever liberty be indulged Christians in such a case as 
 this, they are not allowed, for the mere infidelity of a husband or 
 wife, to separate; but, if the unbeliever be willing, they should 
 continue in the relation, and cohabit as those who are thus related.
 This is the apostle's general direction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have here the reasons of this advice. 

 (1.) Because the relation or state is sanctified by the holiness of 
 either party: <I>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, 
 and the unbelieving wife by the husband</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 or <I>hath been sanctified.</I> The relation itself, and the conjugal 
 use of each other, are sanctified to the believer. <I>To the pure all 
 things are pure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>.

 Marriage is a divine institution; it is a compact for life, by God's
 appointment. Had converse and congress with unbelievers in that 
 relation defiled the believer, or rendered him or her offensive to God, 
 the ends of marriage would have been defeated, and the comforts of it 
 in a manner destroyed, in the circumstances in which Christians then 
 were. But the apostle tells them that, though they were yoked with
 unbelievers, yet, if they themselves were holy, marriage was to them a 
 holy state, and marriage comforts, even with an unbelieving relative, 
 were sanctified enjoyments. It was no more displeasing to God for them 
 to continue to live as they did before, with their unbelieving or 
 heathen relation, than if they had become converts together. If one of 
 the relatives had become holy, nothing of the duties or lawful comforts 
 of the married state could defile them, and render them displeasing to 
 God, though the other were a heathen. He is sanctified for the wife's 
 sake. She is sanctified for the husband's sake. Both are one flesh. He 
 is to be reputed clean who is one flesh with her that is holy, and 
 <I>vice vers&acirc;: Else were your children unclean, but now are they 
 holy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that is, they would be heathen, out of the pale of the church and 
 covenant of God. They would not be of the holy seed (as the Jews are 
 called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:13">Isa. vi. 13</A>),

 but common and unclean, in the same sense as heathens in general were
 styled in the apostle's vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:28">Acts x. 28</A>.

 This way of speaking is according to the dialect of the Jews, among
 whom a child begotten by parents yet heathens, was said to be begotten 
 <I>out of holiness;</I> and a child begotten by parents made proselytes 
 was said to be begotten <I>intra sanctitatem--within the holy 
 enclosure.</I> Thus Christians are called commonly <I>saints;</I> such 
 they are by profession, separated to be a peculiar people of God, and 
 as such distinguished from the world; and therefore the children born 
 to Christians, though married to unbelievers, are not to be reckoned as 
 part of the world, but of the church, a holy, not a common and unclean 
 seed. "Continue therefore to live even with unbelieving relatives; for, 
 if you are holy, the relation is so, the state is so, you may make a 
 holy use even of an unbelieving relative, in conjugal duties, and your 
 seed will be holy too." What a comfort is this, where both relatives 
 are believers!

 (2.) Another reason is that <I>God hath called Christians to peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The Christian religion obliges us to act peaceably in all relations, 
 natural and civil. We are bound, <I>as much as in us lies, to live 
 peaceably with all men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:18">Rom. xii. 18</A>),

 and therefore surely to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest 
 relatives, those with whom we are one flesh, nay, though they should be 
 infidels. Note, It should be the labour and study of those who are 
 married to make each other as easy and happy as possible. 

 (3.) A third reason is that it is possible for the believing relative 
 to be an instrument of the other's salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?</I> 
 Note, It is the plain duty of those in so near a relation to seek the 
 salvation of those to whom they are related. "Do not separate. There is 
 other duty now called for. The conjugal relation calls for the most 
 close and endeared affection; it is a contract for life. And should a 
 Christian desert a mate, when an opportunity offers to give the most 
 glorious proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of 
 thy relative. Endeavour to save a soul. Who knows but this may be the
 event? It is not impossible. And, though there be no great probability, 
 saving a soul is so good and glorious a service that the bare 
 possibility should put one on exerting one's self." Note, Mere 
 possibility of success should be a sufficient motive with us to use our 
 diligent endeavours for saving the souls of our relations. "<I>What
 know I but I may save his soul?</I> should move me to attempt it."</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle takes occasion to advise them to continue in the state 
 and condition in which Christianity found them, and in which they 
 became converts to it. And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down this rule in general--<I>as God hath distributed to
 every one.</I> Note, Our states and circumstances in this world are 
 distributions of divine Providence. <I>This fixes the bounds of men's 
 habitations,</I> and orders their steps. God setteth up and pulleth 
 down. And again, <I>As the Lord hath called every one, so let him 
 walk.</I> Whatever his circumstances or condition was when he was 
 converted to Christianity, let him abide therein, and suit his 
 conversation to it. The rules of Christianity reach every condition. 
 And in every state a man may live so as to be a credit to it. Note, It 
 is the duty of every Christian to suit his behaviour to his condition 
 and the rules of religion, to be content with his lot, and conduct 
 himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. The apostle adds 
 that this was a general rule, to be observed at all times and in all 
 places; <I>So ordain I in all churches.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He specifies particular cases; as, 

 1. That of circumcision. <I>Is any man called being circumcised? Let
 him not be uncircumcised. Is any man called being uncircumcised? Let 
 him not be circumcised.</I> It matters not whether a man be a Jew or 
 Gentile, within the covenant of peculiarity made with Abraham or 
 without it. He who is converted, being a Jew, has no need to give 
 himself uneasiness upon that head, and wish himself uncircumcised. Nor, 
 is he who is converted from Gentilism under an obligation to be 
 circumcised: nor should he be concerned because he wants that mark of 
 distinction which did heretofore belong to the people of God. For, as 
 the apostle goes on, <I>circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is 
 nothing, but keeping the commandments of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 In point of acceptance with God, it is neither here nor there whether 
 men be circumcised or not. Note, It is practical religion, sincere 
 obedience to the commands of God, on which the gospel lays stress. 
 External observances without internal piety are as nothing. Therefore
 let every man abide <I>in the calling</I> (the state) <I>wherein he was 
 called,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 2. That of servitude and freedom. It was common in that age of the
 world for many to be in a state of slavery, bought and sold for money, 
 and so the property of those who purchased them. "Now," says the 
 apostle, "<I>art thou called being a servant? Care not for it.</I> Be 
 not over-solicitous about it. It is not inconsistent with thy duty, 
 profession, or hopes, as a Christian. <I>Yet, if thou mayest be made
 free, use it rather,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There are many conveniences in a state of freedom above that of 
 servitude: a man has more power over himself, and more command of his 
 time, and is not under the control of another lord; and therefore 
 liberty is the more eligible state. But men's outward condition does 
 neither hinder nor promote their acceptance with God. For he that is 
 called <I>being a servant is the Lord's 
 freed-man</I>--<B><I>apeleutheros,</I></B> <I>as he that is called 
 being free is the Lord's servant.</I> Though he be not discharged from 
 his master's service, he is freed from the dominion and vassalage of 
 sin. Though he be not enslaved to Christ, yet he is bound to yield 
 himself up wholly to his pleasure and service; and yet that service is 
 perfect freedom. Note, Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are 
 to Christ, not what we are in the world. The goodness of our outward 
 condition does not discharge us from the duties of Christianity, nor 
 the badness of it debar us from Christian privileges. He who is a
 slave may yet be a Christian freeman; he who is a freeman may yet be 
 Christ's servant. He is bought with a price, and should not therefore 
 be the servant of man. Not that he must quit the service of his master, 
 or not take all proper measures to please him (this were to contradict 
 the whole scope of the apostle's discourse); but he must not be so the 
 servant of men but that Christ's will must be obeyed, and regarded, 
 more than his master's. He has paid a much dearer price for him, and 
 has a much fuller property in him. He is to be served and obeyed 
 without limitation or reserve. Note, The servants of Christ should be 
 at the absolute command of no other master besides himself, should 
 serve no man, any further than is consistent with their duty to him.
 <I>No man can serve two masters.</I> Though some understand this 
 passage of persons being bought out of slavery by the bounty and 
 charity of fellow-Christians; and read the passage thus, <I>Have you 
 been redeemed out of slavery with a price? Do not again become 
 enslaved;</I> just as before he had advised that, if in slavery they 
 had any prospect of being made free, they should choose it rather. This 
 meaning the words will bear, but the other seems the more natural. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:20"><I>ch.</I> vi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He sums up his advice: <I>Let every man wherein he is called abide 
 therein with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This is to be understood of the state wherein a man is converted to 
 Christianity. No man should make his faith or religion an argument to 
 break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and 
 comfortably abide in the condition in which he is; and this he may well 
 do, when he may abide therein with God. Note, The special presence and 
 favour of God are not limited to any outward condition or performance. 
 He may enjoy it who is circumcised; and so may he who is uncircumcised. 
 He who is bound may have it as well as he who is free. In this respect 
 <I>there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, 
 barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.

 The favour of God is not bound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord:
 yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the
 Lord to be faithful.
 &nbsp; 26  I suppose therefore that this is good for the present
 distress, <I>I say,</I> that <I>it is</I> good for a man so to be.
 &nbsp; 27  Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
 loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
 &nbsp; 28  But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
 marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble
 in the flesh: but I spare you.
 &nbsp; 29  But this I say, brethren, the time <I>is</I> short: it remaineth,
 that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
 &nbsp; 30  And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
 rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as
 though they possessed not;
 &nbsp; 31  And they that use this world, as not abusing <I>it:</I> for the
 fashion of this world passeth away.
 &nbsp; 32  But I would have you without carefulness. He that is
 unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he
 may please the Lord:
 &nbsp; 33  But he that is married careth for the things that are of the
 world, how he may please <I>his</I> wife.
 &nbsp; 34  There is difference <I>also</I> between a wife and a virgin. The
 unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may
 be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married
 careth for the things of the world, how she may please <I>her</I>
 husband.
 &nbsp; 35  And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a
 snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may
 attend upon the Lord without distraction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here resumes his discourse, and gives directions to virgins 
 how to act, concerning which we may take notice,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the manner wherein he introduces them: "<I>Now concerning virgins 
 I have no commandment of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 I have no express and universal law delivered by the Lord himself 
 concerning celibacy; but <I>I give my judgment, as one who hath 
 obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful,</I>" namely, in the 
 apostleship. He acted faithfully, and therefore his direction was to be 
 regarded as a rule of Christ: for he gave judgment as one who was a 
 faithful apostle of Christ. Though Christ had before delivered no 
 universal law about that matter, he now gives direction by an inspired 
 apostle, one who had obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. Note, 
 Faithfulness in the ministry is owing to the grace and mercy of Christ. 
 It is what Paul was ready to acknowledge upon all occasions: <I>I 
 laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God 
 which was with me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10"><I>ch.</I> xv. 10</A>.

 And it is a great mercy which those obtain from God who prove faithful
 in the ministry of his word, either ordinary or extraordinary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The determination he gives, which, considering the present 
 distress, was that a state of celibacy was preferable: <I>It is good 
 for a man so to be,</I> that is, <I>to be single. I suppose,</I> says 
 the apostle, or it is my opinion. It is worded with modesty, but 
 delivered, notwithstanding, with apostolic authority. It is not the 
 mere opinion of a private man, but the very determination of the Spirit 
 of God in an apostle, though it be thus spoken. And it was thus 
 delivered to give it the more weight. Those that were prejudiced 
 against the apostle might have rejected this advice had it been given 
 with a mere authoritative air. Note, Ministers do not lose their 
 authority by prudent condescensions. They must become all things to all 
 men, that they may do them the more good. <I>This is good,</I> says he, 
 <I>for the present distress.</I> Christians, at the first planting of 
 their religion, were grievously persecuted. Their enemies were very 
 bitter against them, and treated them very cruelly. They were 
 continually liable to be tossed and hurried by persecution. This being 
 the then state of things, he did not think it so advisable for 
 Christians that were single to change conditions. The married state 
 would bring more care and cumber along with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>),

 and would therefore make persecution more terrible, and render them 
 less able to bear it. Note, Christians, in regulating their conduct, 
 should not barely consider what is lawful in itself, but what may be 
 expedient for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Notwithstanding he thus determines, he is very careful to satisfy 
 them that he does not condemn marriage in the gross, nor declare it 
 unlawful. And therefore, though he says, "If thou <I>art loosed from a 
 wife</I> (in a single state, whether bachelor or widower, virgin or 
 widow) <I>do not seek a wife,</I> do not hastily change conditions;" 
 yet he adds, "<I>If thou art bound to a wife, do not seek to be 
 loosed.</I> It is thy duty to continue in the married relation, and do 
 the duties of it." And though such, if they were called to suffer 
 persecution, would find peculiar difficulties in it; yet, to avoid 
 these difficulties, they must not cast off nor break through the bonds 
 of duty. Duty must be done, and God trusted with events. But to neglect 
 duty is the way to put ourselves out of the divine protection. He adds 
 therefore, <I>I thou marry thou hast not sinned; or if a virgin marry 
 she hath not sinned: but such shall have trouble in the flesh.</I> 
 Marrying is not in itself a sin, but marrying at that time was likely 
 to bring inconvenience upon them, and add to the calamities of the 
 times; and therefore he thought it advisable and expedient that such as 
 could contain should refrain from it; but adds that he would not lay 
 celibacy on them as a yoke, nor, by seeming to urge it too far, draw 
 them into any snare; and therefore says, <I>But I spare you.</I> Note, 
 How opposite in this are the papist casuists to the apostle Paul! They 
 forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows of celibacy, whether 
 they can bear the yoke or no.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He takes this occasion to give general rules to all Christians to
 carry themselves with a holy indifferency towards the world, and every 
 thing in it. 

 1. <I>As to relations:</I> Those <I>that had wives must be as though
 they had none;</I> that is, they must not set their hearts too much on
 the comforts of the relation; they must be as though they had none.
 They know not how soon they shall have none. This advice must be
 carried into every other relation. Those that have children should be
 as though they had none. Those that are their comfort now may prove
 their greatest cross. And soon may the flower of all comforts be cut
 down. 

 2. As to afflictions: <I>Those that weep must be as though they wept
 not;</I> that is, we must not be dejected too much with any of our 
 afflictions, nor indulge ourselves in the sorrow of the world, but keep 
 up a holy joy in God in the midst of all our troubles, so that even in 
 sorrow the heart may be joyful, and the end of our grief may be 
 gladness. <I>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy will come in the 
 morning.</I> If we can but get to heaven at last, <I>all tears shall be 
 wiped from our eyes;</I> and the prospect of it now should make us 
 moderate our sorrows and refrain our tears. 

 3. As to worldly enjoyments: <I>Those that rejoice should be as though
 they rejoiced not;</I> that is, they should not take too great a 
 complacency in any of their comforts. They must be moderate in their 
 mirth, and sit loose to the enjoyments they most value. Here is not 
 their rest, nor are these things their portion; and therefore their 
 hearts should not be set on them, nor should they place their solace or 
 satisfaction in them. 

 4. As to worldly traffic and employment: <I>Those that buy must be as
 though they possessed not.</I> Those that prosper in trade, increase in 
 wealth, and purchase estates, should hold these possessions as though 
 they held them not. It is but setting their hearts on that which is not

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>)

 to do otherwise. Buying and possessing should not too much engage our 
 minds. They hinder many people altogether from minding the better part. 
 Purchasing land and trying oxen kept the guests invited from the 
 wedding-supper,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:18,19">Luke xiv. 18, 19</A>.

 And, when they do not altogether hinder men from minding their chief
 business, they do very much divert them from a close pursuit. Those are 
 most likely to run so as to obtain the prize who ease their minds of 
 all foreign cares and cumbrances. 

 5. As to all worldly concerns: <I>Those that use this world as not
 abusing it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The world may be used, but must not be abused. It is abused when it is
 not used to those purposes for which it is given, to honour God and do 
 good to men--when, instead of being oil to the wheels of our obedience, 
 it is made fuel to lust--when, instead of being a servant, it is made 
 our master, our idol, and has that room in our affections which should 
 be reserved for God. And there is great danger of abusing it in all 
 these respects, if our hearts are too much set upon it. We must keep 
 the world as much as may be out of our hearts, that we may not abuse it 
 when we have it in our hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He enforces these advices with two reasons:--

 1. <I>The time is short,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 We have but little time to continue in this world; but a short season 
 for possessing and enjoying worldly things; <B><I>kairos 
 synestalmenos.</I></B> It is contracted, reduced to a narrow compass. 
 It will soon be gone. It is just ready to be wrapped up in eternity. 
 Therefore do not set your hearts on worldly enjoyments. Do not be 
 overwhelmed with worldly cares and troubles. Possess what you must
 shortly leave without suffering yourselves to be possessed by it. Why
 should your hearts be much set on what you must quickly resign?

 2. <I>The fashion of this world passeth away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 <B><I>schema</I></B>--<I>the habit,</I> figure, appearance, of the
 world, passeth away. It is daily changing countenance. It is in a 
 continual flux. It is not so much a world as the appearance of one. All 
 is show, nothing solid in it; and it is transient show too, and will 
 quickly be gone. How proper and powerful an argument is this to
 enforce the former advice! How irrational is it to be affected with the 
 images, the fading and transient images, of a dream! <I>Surely man 
 walketh in a vain show</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:6">Ps. xxxix. 6</A>),

 in an image, amidst the faint and vanishing appearances of things. And 
 should he be deeply affected, or grievously afflicted, with such a 
 scene?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He presses his general advice by warning them against the 
 embarrassment of worldly cares: <I>But I would have you without 
 carefulness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Indeed to be careless is a fault; a wise concern about worldly 
 interests is a duty; but to be careful, full of care, to have an 
 anxious and perplexing care about them, is a sin. All that care which 
 disquiets the mind, and distracts it in the worship of God, is evil; 
 for God must <I>be attended upon without distraction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The whole mind should be engaged when God is worshipped. The work 
 ceases while it diverts to any thing else, or is hurried and drawn 
 hither and thither by foreign affairs and concerns. Those who are 
 engaged in divine worship should attend to this very thing, should make 
 it their whole business. But how is this possible when the mind is 
 swallowed up of the cares of this life? Note, It is the wisdom of a 
 Christian so to order his outward affairs, and choose such a condition 
 in life, as to be without distracting cares, that he may attend upon 
 the Lord with a mind at leisure and disengaged. This is the general 
 maxim by which the apostle would have Christians govern themselves. In 
 the application of it Christian prudence must direct. That condition of 
 life is best for every man which is best for his soul, and keeps him 
 most clear of the cares and snares of the world. By this maxim the 
 apostle solves the case put to him by the Corinthians, whether it were 
 advisable to marry? To this he says, That, by reason of the present
 distress, and it may be in general, at that time, when Christians were 
 married to infidels, and perhaps under a necessity of being so, if 
 married at all: I say, in these circumstances, to continue unmarried 
 would be the way to free themselves from any cares and incumbrances, 
 and allow them more vacation for the service of God. Ordinarily, the 
 less care we have about the world the more freedom we have for the 
 service of God. Now the married state at that time (if not at all 
 times) did bring most worldly care along with it. <I>He that is married 
 careth for the things of the world, that he may please his wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 <I>And she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she 
 may please her husband.</I> But the unmarried man and woman mind the 
 things of the Lord, that they may please the Lord, and be holy both in 
 body and spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:32,34"><I>v.</I> 32, 34</A>.

 Not but the married person may be holy both in body and spirit too. 
 Celibacy is not in itself a state of greater purity and sanctity than 
 marriage; but the unmarried would be able to make religion more their 
 business at that juncture, because they would have less distraction 
 from worldly cares. Marriage is that condition of life that brings care 
 along with it, though sometimes it brings more than at others. It is 
 the constant care of those in that relation to please each other; 
 though this is more difficult to do at some reasons, and in some cases, 
 than in others. At that season, therefore, the apostle advises that 
 those who were single should abstain from marriage, if they were under 
 no necessity to change conditions. And, where the same reason is plain 
 at other times, the rule is as fit to be observed. And the very same 
 rule must determine persons for marriage where there is the same 
 reason, that is, if in the unmarried state persons are likely to be 
 more distracted in the service of God than if they were married, which 
 is a case supposable in many respects. This is the general rule, which 
 every one's discretion must apply to his own particular case; and by it 
 should he endeavour to determine, whether it be for marriage or 
 against. That condition of life should be chosen by the Christian in 
 which it is most likely he will have the best helps, and the fewest 
 hindrances, in the service of God and the affairs of his own 
 salvation.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle is commonly supposed to give advice about 
 the disposal of children in marriage, upon the principle of his former 
 determination. In this view the general meaning is plain. It was in 
 that age, and those parts of the world, and especially among the Jews, 
 reckoned a disgrace for a woman to remain unmarried past a certain 
 number of years: it gave a suspicion of somewhat that was not for her 
 reputation. "Now," says the apostle, "if any man thinks he behaves 
 unhandsomely towards his daughter, and that it is not for her credit to 
 remain unmarried, when she is of full age, and that upon this principle 
 it is needful to dispose of her in marriage, he may use his pleasure. 
 It is no sin in him to dispose of her to a suitable mate. But if a man 
 has determined in himself to keep her a virgin, and stands to this 
 determination, and is under no necessity to dispose of her in marriage, 
 but is at liberty, with her consent, to pursue his purpose, he does 
 well in keeping her a virgin. In short, he that gives her in marriage 
 does well; but he that keeps her single, if she can be easy and 
 innocent in such a state, does what is better; that is, more convenient 
 for her in the present state of things, if not at all times and 
 seasons." Note, 

 1. Children should be at the disposal of their parents, and not
 dispose of themselves in marriage. Yet, 

 2. Parents should consult their children's inclinations, both to
 marriage in general and to the person in particular, and not reckon 
 they have uncontrollable power to do with them, and dictate to them, as 
 they please. 

 3. It is our duty not only to consider what is lawful, but in many
 cases, at least, what is fit to be done, before we do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But I think the apostle is here continuing his former discourse, and 
 advising unmarried persons, who are at their own disposal, what to do, 
 the man's virgin being meant of his virginity. <B><I>Terein ten
 heautou parthenon</I></B> seems to be rather meant of preserving his 
 own virginity than keeping his daughter a virgin, though it be 
 altogether uncommon to use the word in this sense. Several other 
 reasons may be seen in Locke and Whitby, by those who will consult 
 them. And it was a common matter of reproach among Jews and civilized 
 heathens, for a man to continue single beyond such a term of years, 
 though all did not agree in limiting the single life to the same term. 
 The general meaning of the apostle is the same, that it was no sin to 
 marry, if a man thought there was a necessity upon, to avoid popular 
 reproach, much less to avoid the hurrying fervours of lust. But he that 
 was in his own power, stood firm in his purpose, and found himself 
 under no necessity to marry, would, at that season, and in the 
 circumstances of Christians at that time, at least, make a choice every 
 way most for his own conveniency, ease, and advantage, as to his 
 spiritual concerns. And it is highly expedient, if not a duty, for 
 Christians to be guided by such a consideration.</P>

 The whole is here closed up with advice to widows: <I>As long as the 
 husband liveth the wife is bound by the law,</I> confined to one 
 husband, and bound to continue and cohabit with him. Note, The 
 marriage-contract is for life; death only can annul the bond. <I>But,
 the husband being dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will.</I> 
 There is no limitation by God's law to be married only for such a 
 number of times. It is certain, from this passage, that second 
 marriages are not unlawful; for then the widow could not be at liberty 
 to marry whom she pleased, nor to marry a second time at all. But the 
 apostle asserts she has such a liberty, when her husband is dead, only 
 with a limitation that <I>she marry in the Lord.</I> In our choice of 
 relations, and change of conditions, we should always have an eye to
 God. Note, Marriages are likely to have God's blessing only when they 
 are made in the Lord, when persons are guided by the fear of God, and 
 the laws of God, and act in dependence on the providence of God, in the 
 change and choice of a mate--when they can look up to God, and sincerely
 seek his direction, and humbly hope for his blessing upon their 
 conduct. <I>But she is happier,</I> says the apostle, <I>if she so 
 abide</I> (that is, continue a widow) <I>in my judgment; and I think I 
 have the Spirit of God,</I>

 At this juncture, at least, if not ordinarily, it will be much more for 
 the peace and quiet of such, and give them less hindrance in the 
 service of God, to continue unmarried. And this, he tells them, was by
 inspiration of the Spirit. "Whatever your false apostles may think of 
 me, I think, and have reason to know, that I have the Spirit of God." 
 Note, Change of condition in marriage is so important a matter that it 
 ought not to be made but upon due deliberation, after careful 
 consideration of circumstances, and upon very probable grounds, at 
 least, that it will be a change to advantage in our spiritual 
 concerns.</P>
