 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are the more concerned to take notice of and to improve what is here
 recorded concerning blessed Paul because, after the story of this
 chapter, we hear no more of him in the sacred history, though we have a
 great deal of him yet before us in his epistles. We have attended him
 through several chapters from one judgment-seat to another, and could
 at last have taken leave of him with the more pleasure if we had left
 him at liberty; but in this chapter we are to condole with him, and yet
 congratulate him.

 I. We condole with him as a poor shipwrecked passenger, stripped of
 all; and yet congratulate him,

 1. As singularly owned by his God in his distress, preserved himself
 from receiving hurt by a viper that fastened on his hand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and being made an instrument of much good in the island on which they
 were cast, in healing many that were sick, and particularly the father 
 of Publius, the chief man of the island, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 2. As much respected by the people there, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:10">ver. 10</A>.

 II. We condole with him as a poor confined prisoner, carried to Rome
 under the notion of a criminal removed by "habeas corpus"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>),

 and yet we congratulate him, 

 1. Upon the respect shown him by the Christians at Rome, who came a 
 great way to meet him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:15">ver. 15</A>.

 2. Upon the favour he found with the captain of the guard, into whose 
 custody he was delivered, who suffered him to dwell by himself, and did 
 not put him in the common prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:16">ver. 16</A>.

 3. Upon the free conference he had with the Jews at Rome, both about
 his own affair

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>)

 and upon the subject of the Christian religion in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:23">ver. 23</A>),

 the issue of which was that God was glorified, many were edified, the
 rest left inexcusable, and the apostles justified in preaching the
 gospel to the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:24-29">ver. 24-29</A>.

 4. Upon the undisturbed liberty he had to preach the gospel to all
 comers in his own house for two years together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:30-31">ver. 30-31</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island
 was called Melita.
 &nbsp; 2 And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for
 they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the
 present rain, and because of the cold.
 &nbsp; 3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid
 <I>them</I> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and
 fastened on his hand.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the barbarians saw the <I>venomous</I> beast hang on his
 hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a
 murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
 suffereth not to live.
 &nbsp; 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
 &nbsp; 6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen
 down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and
 saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that
 he was a god.
 &nbsp; 7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
 island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us
 three days courteously.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
 fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed,
 and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
 &nbsp; 9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
 island, came, and were healed:
 &nbsp; 10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we
 departed, they laded <I>us</I> with such things as were necessary.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What a great variety of places and circumstances do we find Paul in! He
 was a planet, and not a fixed star. Here we have him in an island to 
 which, in all probability, he had never come if he had not been thrown 
 upon it by a storm; and yet it seems God has work for him to do here. 
 Even stormy winds fulfil God's counsel, and an ill wind indeed it is 
 that blows nobody any good; this ill wind blew good to the island of 
 Melita; for it gave them Paul's company for three months, who was a 
 blessing to every place he came to. This island was called Melita, 
 lying between Sicily and Africa, twenty miles long, and twelve broad; 
 it lies furthest from the continent of any island in the Mediterranean; 
 it is about sixty miles from Sicily. It has been famous since for the 
 knights of Malta, who, when the Turks overran that part of Christendom, 
 made a noble stand, and gave some check to the progress of their arms. 
 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The kind reception which the inhabitants of this island gave to the 
 distressed strangers that were shipwrecked on their coast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>The barbarous people showed us no little kindness.</I> God had 
 promised that there should be no loss of any man's life; and,<I> as for 
 God, his work is perfect.</I> If they had escaped the sea, and when 
 they came ashore had perished for cold or want, it had been all one; 
 therefore Providence continues its care of them, and what benefits we 
 receive by the hand of man must be acknowledged to come from the hand 
 of God; for every creature is that to us, and no more, that he makes it 
 to be, and when he pleases, as he can make enemies to be at peace, so 
 he can make strangers to be friends, friends in need, and those are 
 friends indeed--friends <I>in adversity,</I> and that is <I>the time
 that a brother is born for.</I> Observe, 

 1. The general notice taken of the kindness which the natives of Malta
 showed to Paul and his company. They are called <I>barbarous
 people,</I> because they did not, in language and customs, conform 
 either to the Greeks or Romans, who looked (superciliously enough) upon 
 all but themselves as barbarians, though otherwise civilized enough, 
 and perhaps in some cases more civil than they. These barbarous people, 
 however they were called so, were full of humanity: They <I>showed us 
 not little kindness.</I> So far were they from making a prey of this 
 shipwreck, as many, I fear, who are called Christian people, would have 
 done, that they laid hold of it as an opportunity of showing mercy. 
 <I>The Samaritan</I> is a better neighbour to the poor wounded man 
 <I>than the priest or Levite.</I> And verily we have not found greater 
 humanity among Greeks, or Romans, or Christians, than among these 
 barbarous people; and it is written for our imitation, that we may 
 hence learn to be compassionate to those that are in distress and 
 misery, and to relieve and succour them to the utmost of our ability, 
 as those <I>that know we ourselves are also in the body.</I> We should 
 be ready <I>to entertain strangers, as Abraham, who sat at his tent 
 door to invite passengers in</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:2">Heb. xiii. 2</A>),

 but especially strangers in distress, as these were. <I>Honour all 
 men.</I> If Providence hath so <I>appointed the bounds of our 
 habitation</I> as to give us an opportunity of being frequently 
 serviceable to persons at a loss, we should not place it among the 
 inconveniences of our lot, but the advantages of it; because <I>it is 
 more blessed to give than to receive.</I> Who knows but these barbarous 
 people had their lot cast in this island for such a time as this! 

 2. A particular instance of their kindness: <I>They kindled a fire,</I> 
 in some large hall or other, and <I>they received us everyone</I>--made 
 room for us about the fire, and bade us all welcome, without asking 
 either what country we were of or what religion. In swimming <I>to the 
 shore,</I> and coming on <I>the broken pieces of the ship,</I> we must 
 suppose that they were sadly wet, that they had not a dry thread on 
 them; and, as if that were not enough, to complete the deluge, waters 
 from above met those from below, and it rained so hard that this would 
 wet them to the skin presently; and <I>it was a cold rain too,</I> so 
 that they wanted nothing so much as a good fire (for they had eaten 
 heartily but just before on ship-board), and this they got for them 
 presently, <I>to warm them, and dry their clothes.</I> It is sometimes 
 as much a piece of charity to poor families to supply them with fuel as 
 with food or raiment. <I>Be you warmed,</I> is as necessary as <I>Be 
 you filled.</I> When in the extremities of bad weather we find 
 ourselves fenced against the rigours of the season, by the 
 accommodations of a warm house, bed, clothes, and a good fire, we 
 should think how many lie exposed <I>to the present rain, and to the 
 cold,</I> and pity them, and pray for them, and help them if we 
 can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The further danger that Paul was in by a viper's fastening on his 
 hand, and the unjust construction that the people put upon it. Paul is 
 among strangers, and appears one of the meanest and most contemptible 
 of the company, therefore God distinguishes him, and soon causes him to 
 be taken notice of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When the fire was to be made, and too be made bigger, that so great 
 a company might all have the benefit of it, Paul was as busy as any of 
 them in gathering sticks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Though he was free from all, and of greater account than any of them, 
 <I>yet he made himself servant of all.</I> Paul was an industrious 
 active man, and loved to be doing when any thing was to be done, and 
 never contrived to take his ease. Paul was a humble self-denying man, 
 and would stoop to any thing by which he might be serviceable, even to 
 the gathering of sticks to make a fire of. We should reckon nothing 
 below us but sin, and be willing to condescend to the meanest offices, 
 if there be occasion, for the good of our brethren. The people were 
 ready to help them; yet Paul, wet and cold as he is, will not throw it 
 all upon them, but will help himself. Those that receive benefit by
 the fire should help to carry fuel to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The sticks being old dry rubbish, it happened there was a viper 
 among them, that lay as dead till it came to the heat, and then 
 revived, or lay quiet till it felt the fire, and then was provoked, and 
 flew at him that unawares threw it into the fire, and <I>fastened upon 
 his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Serpents and such venomous creatures commonly lie among sticks; hence 
 we read of him <I>that leans on the wall, and a serpent bites him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:19">Amos v. 19</A>.

 It was so common that people were by it frightened from tearing hedges 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:8">Eccl. x. 8</A>):

 <I>Whoso breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</I> As there is a 
 snake under the green grass, so there is often under the dry leaves. 
 See how many perils human life is exposed to, and what danger we are in 
 from the inferior creatures, which have many of them become enemies to 
 men, since men became rebels to God; and what a mercy it is that we are 
 preserved from them as we are. We often meet with that which is 
 mischievous where we expect that which is beneficial; and many come by 
 hurt when they are honestly employed, and in the way of their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The barbarous people concluded that Paul, being a prisoner, was 
 certainly a murderer, who had appealed to Rome, to escape justice in 
 his own country, and that this viper was sent by divine justice to be 
 the avenger of blood; or, if they were not aware that he was a 
 prisoner, they supposed that he was in his flight; and <I>when they saw 
 the venomous animal hand on his hand,</I> which it seems he could not, 
 or would not, immediately throw off, but let it hang, they concluded, 
 "<I>No doubt this man is a murderer,</I> has shed innocent blood, and 
 therefore, <I>though he has escaped the sea, yet</I> divine 
 <I>vengeance</I> pursues him, and fastens upon him now that he is 
 pleasing himself with the thoughts of that escape, and will <I>not 
 suffer him to live.</I>" Now in this we may see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some of the discoveries of natural light. They were barbarous 
 people, perhaps had no books nor learning among them, and yet they knew 
 naturally, 

 [1.] That there is a God that governs the world, and a providence that 
 presides in all occurrences, that things do not come to pass by chance, 
 no, not such a thing as this, but by divine direction.

 [2.] That evil pursues sinners, that there are good works which God 
 will reward and wicked works which he will punish; there is a divine 
 <I>nemesis--a vengeance,</I> which sooner or later will reckon for 
 enormous crimes. They believe not only that there is a God, but that
 this God hath said, <I>Vengeance is mine, I will repay,</I> even to 
 death. 

 [3.] That murder is a heinous crime, and which shall not long go 
 unpunished, that <I>whoso sheds man's blood,</I> if his blood be not 
 shed by man (by the magistrate, as it ought to be) it shall be shed by 
 the righteous Judge of heaven and earth, who is the avenger of wrong.
 Those that think they shall go unpunished in any evil way will be 
 judged out of the mouth of these barbarians, who could say, without 
 book, <I>Woe to the wicked, for it shall be ill with them, for the 
 reward of their hands shall be given them.</I> Those who, because they 
 have escaped many judgments are secure, and say, <I>We shall have peace 
 though we go on,</I> and have their hearts so much the more <I>set to 
 do evil because sentence against their evil works is not executed 
 speedily,</I> may learn from these illiterate people that, though 
 malefactors have escaped the vengeance of the sea, yet there is no 
 outrunning divine justice, <I>vengeance suffers not to live.</I> In 
 Job's time you might ask <I>those that to by the way,</I> ask the next 
 body you met, and they would tell you that <I>the wicked is reserved to 
 the day of destruction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Some of the mistakes of natural light, which needed to be 
 rectified by divine revelation. In two things their knowledge was 
 defective:--

 [1.] That they thought all wicked people were punished in this life; 
 that divine vengeance never suffers great and notorious sinners, such 
 as murderers are, to live long; but that, if <I>they come up out of the 
 pit, they shall be taken in the snare</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:43,44">Jer. xlviii. 43, 44</A>),

 if <I>they flee from a lion, a bear shall meet them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:19">Amos v. 19</A>),

 if they escape being drowned, a viper shall fasten upon them; whereas 
 it is not so. The wicked, even murderers, sometimes <I>live, become 
 old, yea, are mighty in power;</I> for the day of vengeance is to come 
 in the other world, <I>the great day of wrath;</I> and though some are 
 made examples of in this world, to prove that there is a God and a 
 providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a 
 judgment to come.

 [2.] That they thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life 
 were wicked people; that a man on whose hand a viper fastens may thence 
 be judged to be a murderer, as if those on whom the tower in Siloam 
 fell must needs be greater sinners than all in Jerusalem. This mistake 
 Job's friends went upon, in their judgment upon his case; but divine 
 revelation sets this matter in a true light--that all things come 
 ordinarily alike to all, that good men are oftentimes greatly afflicted 
 in this life, for the exercise and improvement of their faith and 
 patience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When he shook off the viper from his hand, yet they expected that 
 divine vengeance would ratify the censure they had passed, and <I>that 
 he would have swollen</I> and burst, through the force of the poison, 
 or <I>that he would have fallen down dead suddenly.</I> See how apt men 
 are, when once they have got an ill opinion of a man, though ever so 
 unjust, to abide by it, and to think that God must necessarily confirm 
 and ratify their peevish sentence. It was well they did not knock him 
 down themselves, when they saw he did not swell and fall down; but so 
 considerate they are as to let Providence work, and to attend the 
 motions of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Paul's deliverance from the danger, and the undue construction the 
 people put upon this. The viper's fastening on his hand was a trial of 
 his faith; and it was found to praise, and honour, and glory: for, 

 1. It does not appear that it put him into any fright or confusion at
 all. He did not shriek or start, nor, as it would be natural for us to
 do, throw it off with terror and precipitation; for he suffered it to 
 hang on so long that the people had time to take notice of it and to 
 make their remarks upon it. Such a wonderful presence of mind he had, 
 and such a composure, as no man could have upon such a sudden accident, 
 but by the special aids of divine grace, and the actual belief and 
 consideration of that word of Christ concerning his disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:18">Mark xvi. 18</A>),

 <I>They shall take up serpents.</I> This it is to have <I>the heart 
 fixed, trusting in God.</I> 

 2. He carelessly <I>shook off the viper into the fire,</I> without any 
 difficulty, calling for help, or any means used to loosen its hold; and 
 it is probable that it was consumed in the fire. Thus, in the strength 
 of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, 
 with a holy resolution, saying, as Christ did, <I>Get thee behind me, 
 Satan; The Lord rebuke thee;</I> and thus they <I>keep themselves, that 
 the wicked one toucheth them not,</I> so as to fasten upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18">1 John v. 18</A>.

 When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them
 with a holy contempt, having the testimony of conscience for us, then 
 we do, as Paul here, <I>shake off the viper into the fire.</I> It does 
 us no harm, except we fret at it, or be deterred by it from our duty, 
 or be provoked to render railing for railing.

 3. He was none the worse. Those that thought it would have been his
 death <I>looked a great while, but saw no harm at all come to him.</I> 
 God hereby intended to make him remarkable among these barbarous 
 people, and so to make way for the entertainment of the gospel among 
 them. It is reported that after this no venomous creature would live in 
 that island, any more than in Ireland; but I do not find that the 
 matter of fact is confirmed, though the popish writers speak of it with 
 assurance. 

 4. They then magnified him as much as before they had vilified him:
 <I>They changed their minds, and said that he was a god</I>--an 
 immortal god; for they thought it impossible that a mortal man should 
 have a viper hang on his hand so long and be never the worse. See the 
 uncertainty of popular opinion, how it turns with the wind, and how apt 
 it is to run into extremes both ways; from <I>sacrificing to Paul and 
 Barnabas to stoning them;</I> and here, from condemning him as a 
 murderer to idolizing him as a god.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The miraculous cure of an old gentleman that was ill of a fever, 
 and of others that were otherwise diseased, by Paul. And, with these 
 confirmations of the doctrine of Christ, no doubt there was a faithful 
 publication of it. Observe, 

 1. The kind entertainment which <I>Publius, the chief man of the
 island,</I> gave to these distressed strangers; he had a considerable 
 estate in the island, and some think was governor, and he <I>received 
 them and lodged them three days very courteously,</I> that they might 
 have time to furnish themselves in other places at the best hand. It is 
 happy when God gives a large heart to those to whom he has given a 
 large estate. It became him, who was the chief man of the island, to be 
 most hospitable and generous,--who was the richest man, to be rich in 
 good works. 

 2. The illness of <I>the father of Publius:</I> He <I>lay sick of a 
 fever and a bloody flux,</I> which often go together, and, when they 
 do, are commonly fatal. Providence ordered it that he should be ill
 just at this time, that the cure of him might be a present recompence 
 to Publius for his generosity, and the cure of him by miracle a 
 recompence particularly for his kindness to Paul, whom he received in 
 the name of a prophet, and had this prophet's reward. 

 3. His cure: Paul took cognizance of his case, and though we do not
 find he was urged to it, for they had no thought of any such thing, yet 
 he entered in, not as a physician to heal him by medicines, but as an 
 apostle to heal him by miracle; and he prayed to God, in Christ's name, 
 for his cure, and then laid his hands on him, and he was perfectly well 
 in an instant. Though he must needs be in years, yet he recovered his 
 health, and the lengthening out of his life yet longer would be a mercy 
 to him.

 4. The cure of many others, who were invited by this cure to apply to
 Paul. If he can heal diseases so easily, so effectually, he shall soon 
 have patients enough; and he <I>bade them all welcome,</I> and sent 
 them away with what they came for. He did not plead that he was a 
 stranger there, thrown accidentally among them, under no obligations to 
 them and waiting to be gone by the first opportunity, and therefore 
 might be excused from receiving their applications. No, a good man will 
 endeavour to do good wherever the providence of God casts him. Paul 
 reckoned himself a debtor, not only to the Greeks, but to the 
 Barbarians, and thanked God for an opportunity of being useful among 
 them. Nay, he was particularly obliged to these inhabitants of Malta 
 for the seasonable shelter and supply they had afforded him, and hereby 
 he did in effect discharge his quarters, which should encourage us to 
 entertain strangers, for some thereby have entertained angels and some 
 apostles unawares. God will not be behind--hand with any for kindness 
 shown to his people in distress. We have reason to think that Paul with 
 these cures preached the gospel to them, and that, coming thus 
 confirmed and recommended, it was generally embraced among them. And, 
 if so, never were any people so enriched by a shipwreck on their coasts 
 as these Maltese were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The grateful acknowledgement which even these barbarous people made 
 of the kindness Paul had done them, in preaching Christ unto them. They 
 were civil to him, and to the other ministers that were with him, who, 
 it is likely, were assisting to him in preaching among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 1. They <I>honoured us with many honours.</I> They showed them all
 possible respect; they saw God honoured them, and therefore they justly 
 thought themselves obliged to honour them, and thought nothing too much 
 by which they might testify the esteem they had for them. Perhaps they 
 made them free of their island by naturalizing them, and admitted them 
 members of their guilds and fraternities. The faithful preachers of the 
 gospel are worthy of a double honour, especially when they succeeded in 
 their labours. 

 2. <I>When we departed, they loaded us with such things as were 
 necessary;</I> or, they put on board such things as we had occasion 
 for. Paul could not labour with his hands here, for he had nothing to 
 work upon, and therefore accepted the kindness of the good people of 
 Melita, not as a fee for his cures (freely he had received, and freely 
 he gave), but as the relief of his wants, and theirs that were with 
 him. And, having reaped of their spiritual things, it was but just they 
 should make them those returns,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
 which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
 &nbsp; 12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <I>there</I> three days.
 &nbsp; 13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium:
 and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day
 to Puteoli:
 &nbsp; 14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
 seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
 &nbsp; 15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
 meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when
 Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
 &nbsp; 16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the
 prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to
 dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

 We have here the progress of Paul's voyage towards Rome, and his 
 arrival there at length. A rough and dangerous voyage he had hitherto 
 had, and narrowly escaped with his life; but after a storm comes a 
 calm: the latter part of his voyage was easy and quiet.</P>

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their leaving Malta. That island was a happy shelter to them, but it 
 was not their home; when they are refreshed they must put to sea again. 
 The difficulties and discouragements we have met with in our Christian 
 course must not hinder us from pressing forward. Notice is here taken, 
 
 1. Of the time of their departure: <I>After three months,</I> the three
 winter months. Better lie by, though they lay upon charges, than go 
 forward while the season was dangerous. Paul had warned them against 
 venturing to sea in winter weather, and they would not take the 
 warning; but, now that they had learned it by the difficulties and 
 dangers they had gone through, he needed not to warn them: their 
 learning did them good when they had paid dearly for it. Experience is 
 therefore called the mistress of fools, because those are fools that 
 will not learn till experience has taught them. 

 2. Of the ship in which they departed. It was in a ship of Alexandria; 
 so was that which was cast away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:6"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 6</A>.

 This ship had <I>wintered in that isle,</I> and was safe. See what
 different issues there are of men's undertakings in this world. Here 
 were two ships, both of Alexandria, both bound for Italy, both thrown 
 upon the same island, but one is wrecked there and the other is saved.
 Such occurrences may often be observed. Providence sometimes favours 
 those that deal in the world, and prospers them, that people may be 
 encouraged to set their hands to worldly business; at other times 
 Providence crosses them, that people may be warned not to set their 
 hearts upon it. Events are thus varied, that we may learn both how to 
 want and how to abound. The historian takes notice of the sign of the 
 ship, which probably gave it its name: it was <I>Castor and Pollux.</I> 
 Those little foolish pagan deities, which the poets had made to preside 
 over storms and to protect seafaring men, as gods of the sea, were 
 painted or graven upon the fore-part of the ship, and thence the ship 
 took its name. I suppose this is observed for no other reason than for 
 the better ascertaining of the story, that ship being well known by 
 that name and sign by all that dealt between Egypt and Italy. Dr. 
 Lightfoot thinks that Luke mentions this circumstance to intimate the 
 men's superstition, that they hoped they should have better sailing 
 under this badge than they had had before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their landing in or about Italy, and the pursuing of their journey 
 towards Rome. 

 1. They landed first at Syracuse in Sicily, the chief city of that
 island. There they <I>tarried three days,</I> probably having some 
 goods to put ashore, or some merchandise to make there; for it seems to 
 have been a trading voyage that this ship made. Paul had now his 
 curiosity gratified with the sight of places he had often heard of and 
 wished to see, particularly Syracuse, a place of great antiquity and 
 note; and yet, it should seem, there were no Christians there. 

 2. From Syracuse they came to Rhegium, a city in Italy, directly
 opposite to Messina in Sicily, belonging to the kingdom of Calabria or 
 Naples. There, it seems they staid one day; and a very formal story
 the Romish legends tell of Paul's preaching here at this time, and the 
 fish coming to the shore to hear him,--that with a candle he set a 
 stone pillar on fire, and by that miracle convinced the people of the 
 truth of his doctrine, and they were many of them baptized, and he 
 ordained Stephen, one of his companions in this voyage, to be their 
 bishop,--and all this, they tell you, was done in this one day; whereas 
 it does not appear that they did so much as go ashore, but only came to 
 an anchor in the road. 

 3. From Rhegium they came to Puteoli, a sea-port town not far from
 Naples, now called <I>Pozzolana.</I> The ship of Alexandria was bound 
 for that port, and therefore there Paul, and the rest that were bound 
 for Rome, were put ashore, and went the remainder of their way by land. 
 At Puteoli they <I>found brethren,</I> Christians. Who brought the 
 knowledge of Christ hither we are not told, but here it was, so 
 wonderfully did the leaven of the gospel diffuse itself. God has many 
 that serve and worship him in places where we little think he has. And 
 observe,

 (1.) Though it is probable there were but few brethren in Puteoli, yet 
 Paul found them out; either they heard of him, or he enquired them out, 
 but as it were by instinct they got together. Brethren in Christ
 should find out one another, and keep up communion with each other, as 
 those of the same country do in a foreign land.

 (2.) They desired Paul and his companions to <I>tarry with them seven 
 days,</I> that is, to forecast to stay at least one Lord's day with 
 them, and to assist them in their public worship that day. They knew 
 not whether ever they should see Paul at Puteoli again, and therefore 
 he must not go without giving them a sermon or two, or more. And Paul 
 was willing to allow them so much of his time; and the centurion under 
 whose command Paul now was, perhaps having himself friends or business 
 at Puteoli, agreed to stay one week there, to oblige Paul. 

 4. From Puteoli they went forward towards Rome; whether they travelled
 on foot, or whether they had beasts provided for them to ride on (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:24"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 24</A>),
 
 does not appear; but to Rome they must go, and this was their last
 stage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The meeting which the Christians at Rome gave to Paul. It is 
 probable that notice was sent to them by the Christians at Puteoli, as 
 soon as ever Paul had come thither, how long he intended to stay there, 
 and when he would set forward for Rome, which gave an opportunity for 
 this interview. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great honour they did to Paul. They had heard much of his fame, 
 what use God had made of him, and what eminent service he had done to 
 the kingdom of Christ in the world, and to what multitudes of souls he 
 had been a spiritual father. They had heard of his sufferings, and how 
 God had owned him in them, and therefore they not only longed to see 
 him, but thought themselves obliged to show him all possible respect, 
 as a glorious advocate for the cause of Christ. He had some time ago 
 written a long epistle to them, and a most excellent one, <I>the 
 epistle to the Romans,</I> in which he had not only expressed his great 
 kindness for them, but had given them a great many useful instructions, 
 in return for which they show him this respect. They <I>went to meet 
 him,</I> that they might bring him in state, as ambassadors and judges 
 make their public entry, though he was a prisoner. Some of them went as 
 far as <I>Appii-forum,</I> which was fifty-one miles from Rome; others 
 to a place called the <I>Three Taverns,</I> which was twenty-eight 
 miles (some reckon it thirty-three miles) from Rome. They are to be 
 commended for it, that they were so far from being ashamed of him, or 
 afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that for that very 
 reason they counted him worthy of double honour, and were the more 
 careful to show him respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great comfort Paul had in this. Now that he was drawing near to 
 Rome, and perhaps heard at Puteoli what character the emperor Nero now 
 had, and what a tyrant he had of late become, he began to have some 
 melancholy thoughts about his appeal to C&aelig;sar, and the consequences of
 it. He was drawing near to Rome, where he had never been, where there 
 were few that knew him or that he knew, and what things might befal him 
 here he could not tell; but he began to grow dull upon it, till he met 
 with these good people that came from Rome to show him respect; and 
 <I>when he saw them,</I> 

 (1.) He <I>thanked God.</I> We may suppose he thanked them for their 
 civility, told them again and again how kindly he took it; but this was 
 not all: he <I>thanked God.</I> Note, If our friends be kind to us, it 
 is God that makes them so, that puts it into their hearts, and into the 
 power of their hands, to be so, and we must give him the glory of it. 
 He thanked God, no doubt, for the civility and generosity of the 
 barbarous people at Melita, but much more for the pious care of the 
 Christian people at Rome for him. When he saw so many Christians that 
 were of Rome, he thanked God that the gospel of Christ had had such 
 wonderful success there in the metropolis of the empire. When we go
 abroad, or but look abroad, into the world, and meet with those, even 
 in strange places, that bear up Christ's name, and fear God, and serve 
 him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving; blessed be 
 God that there are so many excellent ones on this earth, bad as it is. 
 Paul had thanked God for the Christians at Rome before he had ever seen 
 them, upon the report he had heard concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Rom. i. 8</A>):

 <I>I thank my God for you all.</I> But now that he saw them (and
 perhaps they appeared more fashionable and genteel people than most he 
 had conversed with, or more grave, serious, and intelligent, than most) 
 <I>he thanked God.</I> But this was not all: 

 (2.) He <I>took courage.</I> It put new life into him, cheered up his 
 spirits, and banished his melancholy, and now he can enter Rome a 
 prisoner as cheerfully as ever he had entered Jerusalem at liberty. he 
 finds there are those there who love and value him, and whom he may 
 both converse with and consult with as his friends, which will take off 
 much of the tediousness of his imprisonment, and the terror of his 
 appearing before Nero. Note, it is an encouragement to those who are 
 travelling towards heaven to meet with their fellow travellers, who are 
 their <I>companions in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.</I> 
 When we see the numerous and serious assemblies of good Christians, we 
 should not only give thanks to God, but take courage to ourselves. And 
 this is a good reason why respect should be shown to good ministers, 
 especially when they are in sufferings, and have contempt put upon 
 them, that it encourages them, and makes both their sufferings and 
 their services more easy. Yet it is observable that though the 
 Christians at Rome were now so respectful to Paul, and he had promised 
 himself so much from their respect, yet they failed him when he most 
 needed them; for he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2 Tim. iv. 16</A>),

 <I>At my first answer, no man stood with me, but all men forsook 
 me.</I> They could easily take a ride of forty or fifty miles to go and 
 meet Paul, for the pleasantness of the journey; but to venture the 
 displeasure of the emperor and the disobliging of other great men, by 
 appearing in defence of Paul and giving evidence for him, here they 
 desire to be excused; when it comes to this, they will rather ride as 
 far out of town to miss him as now they did to meet him, which is an 
 intimation to us to cease from man, and to encourage ourselves in the 
 Lord our God. The courage we take from his promises will never fail us, 
 when we shall be ashamed of that which we took from men's compliments. 
 <I>Let God be true, but every man a liar.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The delivering of Paul into custody at Rome, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He is now come to his journey's end. And,

 1. He is still a prisoner. He had longed to see Rome, but, when he
 comes there, he is delivered, with other prisoners, to the <I>captain 
 of the guard,</I> and can see no more of Rome than he will permit him. 
 How many great men had made their entry into Rome, crowned and in 
 triumph, who really were the plagues of their generation! But here a 
 good man makes his entry into Rome, chained and triumphed over as a 
 poor captive, who was really the greatest blessing to his generation. 
 This thought is enough to put one for ever out of conceit with this 
 world. 

 2. Yet he has some favour shown him. He is a prisoner, but not a close 
 prisoner, not in the common jail: <I>Paul was suffered to dwell by 
 himself,</I> in some convenient private lodgings which his friends 
 there provided for him, and a soldier was appointed to be his guard, 
 who, we hope, was civil to him, and let him take all the liberty that 
 could be allowed to a prisoner, for he must be very ill-natured indeed 
 that could be so to such a courteous obliging man as Paul. Paul, being 
 suffered to dwell by himself, could the better enjoy himself, and his 
 friends, and his God, than if he had been lodged with the other 
 prisoners. Note, This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give 
 them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>),
 
 as Joseph in the eyes of his keeper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:21">Gen. xxxix. 21</A>),

 and Jehoiachin in the eyes of the king of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:27,28">2 Kings xxv. 27, 28</A>.
 
 When God does not deliver his people presently out of bondage, yet, if 
 he either make it easy to them or them easy under it, they have reason 
 to be thankful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
 chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he
 said unto them, Men <I>and</I> brethren, though I have committed
 nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I
 delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
 &nbsp; 18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let <I>me</I> go,
 because there was no cause of death in me.
 &nbsp; 19 But when the Jews spake against <I>it,</I> I was constrained to
 appeal unto C&aelig;sar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
 &nbsp; 20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see
 <I>you,</I> and to speak with <I>you:</I> because that for the hope of
 Israel I am bound with this chain.
 &nbsp; 21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
 Jud&aelig;a concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came
 showed or spake any harm of thee.
 &nbsp; 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
 concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken
 against.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul, with a great deal of expense and hazard, is brought a prisoner to 
 Rome, and when he has come nobody appears to prosecute him or lay any 
 thing to his charge; but he must call his own cause; and here he 
 represents it to the chief of the Jews at Rome. It was not long since, 
 by an edict of Claudius, all the Jews were banished from Rome, and kept 
 out till his death; but, in the five years since then, many Jews had 
 come thither, for the advantage of trade, though it does not appear 
 that they were allowed any synagogue there or place of public worship; 
 but these <I>chief of the Jews</I> were those of best figure among 
 them, the most distinguished men of that religion, who had the best 
 estates and interests. <I>Paul called them together,</I> being desirous 
 to stand right in their opinion, and that there might be a good 
 understanding between him and them. And here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What he said to them, and what account he gave them of his cause. He 
 speaks respectfully to them, calls them men and brethren, and thereby 
 intimates that he expects to be treated by them both as a man and as a 
 brother, and engages to treat them as such and to tell them nothing but 
 the truth; for <I>we are members one of another--all we are
 brethren.</I> Now, 

 1. He professes his own innocency, and that he had not given any just
 occasion to the Jews to bear him such an ill will as generally they 
 did: "I have <I>committed nothing against the people</I> of the Jews, 
 have done nothing to the prejudice of their religion or civil 
 liberties, have added no affliction to their present miseries, they 
 know I have not; nor have I committed any thing <I>against the customs 
 of our fathers,</I> either by abrogating or by innovating in religion." 
 It is true Paul did not impose the customs of the fathers upon the 
 Gentiles: they were never intended for them. But it is as true that he 
 never opposed them in the Jews, but did himself, when he was among 
 them, conform to them. He never quarrelled with them for practising 
 according to the usages of their own religion, but only for their 
 enmity to the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:12">Gal. ii. 12</A>.

 Paul had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had done his
 duty to the Jews. 

 2. He modestly complains of the hard usage he had met with--that,
 though he had given them no offence, yet <I>he was delivered prisoner 
 from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</I> If he had spoken the 
 whole truth in this matter, it would have looked worse than it did upon 
 the Jews, for they would have murdered him without any colour of law or 
 justice if the Romans had not protected him; but, however, they accused 
 him as a criminal, before Felix the governor, and, demanding judgment 
 against him, were, in effect delivering him prisoner into the hands of 
 the Romans, when he desired no more than a fair and impartial trial by 
 their own law.

 3. He declares the judgment of the Roman governors concerning him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They examined him, enquired into his case, heard what was to be said 
 against him, and what he had to say for himself. The chief captain
 examined him, so did Felix, and Festus, and Agrippa, and they could 
 find no cause of death in him; nothing appeared to the contrary but 
 that he was an honest, quiet, conscientious, good man, and therefore 
 they would never gratify the Jews with a sentence of death upon him; 
 but, on the contrary, would have let him go, and have let him go on in 
 his work too, and have given him no interruption, for they all heard 
 him and liked his doctrine well enough. It was for the honour of Paul 
 that those who most carefully examined his case acquitted him, and none 
 condemned him but unheard, and such as were prejudiced against him.

 4. He pleads the necessity he was under to remove himself and his cause
 to Rome; and that it was only in his own defence, and not with any 
 design to recriminate, or exhibit a cross bill against the 
 complainants,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>When the Jews spoke against it,</I> and entered a caveat against his
 discharge, designing, if they could not have him condemned to die, yet 
 to have him made a prisoner for life, he was <I>constrained to appeal 
 unto C&aelig;sar,</I> finding that the governors, one after another, 
 stood so much in awe of the Jews that they could not discharge him, for 
 fear of making him their enemies, which made it necessary for him to 
 pray the assistance of the higher powers. This was all he aimed at in 
 this appeal; not to accuse his nation, but only to vindicate himself.
 Every man has a right to plead in his own defence, who yet ought not to 
 find fault with his neighbours. It is an invidious thing to accuse, 
 especially to accuse a nation, such a nation. Paul made intercession 
 for them, but never against them. The Roman government had at this time 
 an ill opinion of the Jewish nation, as factious, turbulent, 
 disaffected, and dangerous; and it had been an easy thing for a man 
 with such a fluent tongue as Paul had, a citizen of Rome, and so 
 injured as he was, to have exasperated the emperor against the Jewish 
 nation. But Paul would not for ever so much do such a thing; he was for 
 making the best of every body, and not making bad worse. 

 5. He puts his sufferings upon the true footing, and gives them such an
 account of the reason of them as should engage them not only not to 
 join with his persecutors against him, but to concern themselves for 
 him, and to do what they could on his behalf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>For this cause I have called for you,</I> not to quarrel with you, 
 for I have no design to incense the government against you, but to 
 <I>see you and speak with you</I> as my countrymen, and men that I 
 would keep up a correspondence with, because<I> for the hope of Israel 
 I am bound with this chain.</I>" He carried the mark of his 
 imprisonment about with him, and probably was chained to the soldier 
 that kept him; and it was, 

 (1.) Because he preached that the Messiah was come, who was the hope of 
 Israel, he whom Israel hoped for. "Do not all the Jews agree in this, 
 that the Messiah will be the glory of his people Israel? And therefore 
 he is to be hoped for, and this Messiah I preach, and prove he is come. 
 They would keep up such a hope of a Messiah yet to come as must end in 
 a despair of him; I preach such a hope in a Messiah already come as 
 must produce a joy in him." 

 (2.) Because he preached that the resurrection of the dead would come. 
 This also was the hope of Israel; so he had called it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6,24:15,26:6,7"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 6; xxiv. 15; xxvi. 6, 7</A>.

 "They would have you still expect a Messiah that would free you from
 the Roman yoke, and make you great and prosperous upon earth, and it is 
 this that occupies their thoughts; and they are angry at me for 
 directing their expectations to the great things of another world, and 
 persuading them to embrace a Messiah who will secure those to them, and 
 not external power and grandeur. I am for bringing you to the spiritual 
 and eternal blessedness upon which our fathers by faith had their eye, 
 and this is what they hate me for,--because I would take you off from 
 that which is the cheat of Israel, and will be its shame and ruin, the 
 notion of a temporal Messiah, and lead you to that which is the true 
 and real hope of Israel, and the genuine sense of all the promises made 
 to the fathers, a spiritual kingdom of holiness and love set up in the 
 hearts of men, to be the pledge of, and preparative for, the joyful 
 resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was their reply. They own, 

 1. That they had nothing to say in particular against him; nor had any
 instructions to appear as his prosecutors before the emperor, either by 
 letter or word of mouth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>We have neither received letters out of Judea concerning thee</I> 
 (have no orders to prosecute thee) <I>nor have any of the brethren</I> 
 of the Jewish nation that have lately come up to Rome (as many 
 occasions drew the Jews thither now that their nation was a province of 
 that empire) <I>shown or spoken any harm of thee.</I>" This was very 
 strange, that that restless and inveterate rage of the Jews which had 
 followed Paul wherever he went should not follow him to Rome, to get 
 him condemned there. Some think they told a lie here, and had orders to 
 prosecute him, but durst not own it, being themselves obnoxious to the 
 emperor's displeasure, who though he had not, like his predecessors, 
 banished them all from Rome, yet gave them no countenance there. But I 
 am apt to think that what they said was true, and Paul now found he had 
 gained the point he aimed at in appealing to C&aelig;sar, which was to 
 remove his cause into a court to which they durst not follow it. This
 was David's policy, and it was his security 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:1">1 Sam. xxvii. 1</A>):

 <I>There is nothing better for me than to escape into the land of the 
 Philistines, and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any 
 coasts of Israel; so shall I escape out of his hands:</I> and it proved 
 so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he sought no more again 
 for him.</I> Thus did Paul by his appeal: he fled to Rome, where he was 
 out of their reach; and they said, "Even let him go."

 2. That they desired to know particularly concerning the doctrine he
 preached, and the religion he took so much pains to propagate in the
 face of so much opposition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>We desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest</I>--<B><I>ha 
 phroneis</I></B> what thy opinions or sentiments are, what are those 
 things which thou art so wise about, and hast such a relish of and such 
 a zeal for; for, though we know little else of Christianity, we know 
 <I>it is a sect every where spoken against.</I>" Those who said this 
 scornful spiteful word of the Christian religion were Jews, <I>the 
 chief of the Jews at Rome,</I> who boasted of their knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17">Rom. ii. 17</A>),

 and yet this was all they knew concerning the Christian religion, that
 it was a <I>sect every where spoken against.</I> They put it into an 
 ill name, and then ran it down.

 (1.) They looked upon it to be a sect, and this was false. True
 Christianity establishes that which is of common concern to all
 mankind, and is not built upon such narrow opinions and private 
 interests as sects commonly owe their original to. It aims at no 
 worldly benefit or advantage as sects do; but all its gains are 
 spiritual and eternal. And, besides, it has a direct tendency to the 
 uniting of the children of men, and not the dividing of them, and 
 setting them at variance, as sects have. 

 (2.) They said it was every where spoken against, and this was too 
 true. All that they conversed with spoke against it, and therefore they 
 concluded every body did: most indeed did. It is, and always has been, 
 the lot of Christ's holy religion to be every where spoken against.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to
 him into <I>his</I> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the
 kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the
 law of Moses, and <I>out of</I> the prophets, from morning till
 evening.
 &nbsp; 24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
 believed not.
 &nbsp; 25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed,
 after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by
 Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
 &nbsp; 26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
 and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
 perceive:
 &nbsp; 27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears
 are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they
 should see with <I>their</I> eyes, and hear with <I>their</I> ears, and
 understand with <I>their</I> heart, and should be converted, and I
 should heal them.
 &nbsp; 28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
 sent unto the Gentiles, and <I>that</I> they will hear it.
 &nbsp; 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
 great reasoning among themselves.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of a long conference which Paul had with 
 the Jews at Rome about the Christian religion. Though they were so far 
 prejudiced against it, because it was every where spoken against, as to 
 call it <I>a sect,</I> yet they were willing to give it a hearing, 
 which was more than the Jews at Jerusalem would do. It is probable that 
 these Jews at Rome, being men of larger acquaintance with the world and 
 more general conversation, were more free in their enquiries than the 
 bigoted Jews at Jerusalem were, and would not answer this matter before 
 they heard it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here told how Paul managed this conference in defence of the 
 Christian religion. The Jews appointed the time, a day was set for this 
 dispute, that all parties concerned might have sufficient notice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Those Jews seemed well disposed to receive conviction, and yet it did 
 not prove that they all were so. Now when the day came,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There were <I>many got together to Paul.</I> Though he was a 
 prisoner and could not come out to them, yet they were willing to come 
 to him to his lodging. And the confinement he was now under, if duly 
 considered, instead of prejudicing them against his doctrine, ought to 
 confirm it to them; for it was a sign not only that he believed it, but 
 that he thought it worth suffering for. One would visit such a man as 
 Paul in his prison rather than not have instruction from him. And he 
 made room for them in his lodging, not fearing to give offence to the 
 government, so that he might do good to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was very large and full in his discourse with them, seeking their 
 conviction more than his own vindication. 

 (1.) He expounded, or explained, the kingdom of God to them,--showed 
 them the nature of that kingdom and the glorious purposes and designs 
 of it, that it is heavenly and spiritual, seated in the minds of men, 
 and shines not in external pomp, but in purity of heart and life. That 
 which kept the Jews in their unbelief was a misunderstanding of the 
 kingdom of God, as if it came with observation; let but that be 
 expounded to them, and set in a true light, and they will be brought 
 into obedience to it. 

 (2.) He not only expounded the kingdom of God, but he testified 
 it,--plainly declared it to them, and confirmed it by incontestable 
 proofs, that the kingdom of God by the Messiah's administration was 
 come, and was now set up in the world. He attested the extraordinary 
 powers in the kingdom of grace by which bore his testimony to it from 
 his own experience of its power and influence upon him, and the manner 
 of his being brought into subjection to it. 

 (3.) He not only expounded and testified the kingdom of God, but he 
 persuaded them, urged it upon their consciences and pressed them with 
 all earnestness to embrace the kingdom of God, and submit to it, and 
 not to persist in an opposition to it. He followed his doctrine (the 
 explication and confirmation of it) with a warm and lively application 
 to his hearers, which is the most proper and profitable method of 
 preaching. 

 (4.) He persuaded them concerning Jesus. The design and tendency of his 
 whole discourse were to bring them to Christ, to convince them of his 
 being the Messiah, and to engage them to believe in him as he is 
 offered in the gospel. He urged upon them, <B><I>ta peri tou 
 Iesou</I></B>--<I>the things concerning Jesus,</I> the prophecies of 
 him, which he read to them <I>out of the law of Moses and out of the 
 prophets,</I> as pointing at the Messiah, and showed how they had all 
 had their accomplishment in this Jesus. They being Jews, he dealt with
 them out of the scriptures of the Old Testament, and demonstrated that 
 these were so far from making against Christianity that they were the 
 great proofs of it; so that, if we compare the history of the New 
 Testament with the prophecy of the Old, we must conclude that this 
 Jesus is he that should come, and we are to look for no other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was very long; for he continued his discourse, and it should seem 
 to have been a continued discourse, from <I>morning till evening;</I> 
 perhaps it was a discourse eight or ten hours long. The subject was 
 curious--he was full of it--it was of vast importance--he was in good
 earnest, and his heart was upon it--he knew not when he should have such
 another opportunity, and therefore, without begging pardon for tiring 
 their patience, he kept them all day; but it is probable that he spent 
 some of the time in prayer with them and for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was the effect of this discourse. One would have thought that 
 so good a cause as that of Christianity, and managed by such a skilful 
 hand as Paul's, could not but carry the day, and that all the hearers 
 would have yielded to it presently; but it did not prove so: the child 
 Jesus is set for the fall of some and the rising again of others, a 
 foundation stone to some and a stone of stumbling to others. 

 1. <I>They did not agree among themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Some of them thought Paul was in the right, others would not admit it. 
 This is that division which Christ came to send, that fire which he
 came to kindle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49,51">Luke xii. 49, 51</A>.

 Paul preached with a great deal of plainness and clearness, and yet his
 hearers could not agree about the sense and evidence of what he 
 preached. 

 2. <I>Some believed the things that were spoken, and some believed 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 There was the disagreement. Such as this has always been the success of 
 the gospel; to some it has been <I>a savour of life unto life,</I> to 
 others <I>a savour of death unto death.</I> Some are wrought upon by 
 the word, and others hardened; some receive the light, and others shut 
 their eyes against it. So it was among Christ's hearers, and the 
 spectators of his miracles, some believed and some blasphemed. If all 
 had believed, there had been no disagreement; so that all the blame of 
 the division lay upon those who would not believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The awakening word which Paul said to them at parting. He 
 perceived by what they muttered that there were many among them, and 
 perhaps the greater part, that were obstinate, and would not yield to 
 the conviction of what he said; and they were getting up to be gone, 
 they had had enough of it: "Hold," says Paul, "take one word with you 
 before you go, and consider of it when you come home: what do you think 
 will be the effect of your obstinate infidelity? What will you do in 
 the end hereof? What will it come to?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "You will by the righteous judgment of God be sealed up under 
 unbelief. You harden your own hearts, and God will harden them as he 
 did Pharaoh's'; and this is what was prophesied of concerning you. Turn 
 to that scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9,10">Isa. vi. 9, 10</A>),

 and read it seriously, and tremble lest the case there described should 
 prove to be your case." As there are in the Old Testament gospel 
 promises, which will be accomplished in all that believe, so there are 
 gospel threatenings of spiritual judgments, which will be fulfilled in 
 those that believe not; and this is one. It is part of the commission
 given to Isaiah the prophet; he is sent to make those worse that would 
 not be made better. <I>Well spoke the Holy Ghost by</I> Esaias <I>the 
 prophet unto our fathers.</I> What was spoken by J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT> is here said to be spoken by the Holy Ghost, 
 which proves that the Holy Ghost is God; and what was spoken to Isaiah 
 is here said to be spoken by him to their fathers, for he was ordered 
 to tell the people what God said to him; and, though what is there said 
 had in it much of terror to the people and of grief to the prophet, yet 
 it is here said to be well spoken. Hezekiah said concerning a message 
 of wrath, <I>Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:8">Isa. xxxix. 8</A>.

 And <I>he that believes not shall be damned</I> is gospel, as well as,
 <I>He that believes shall be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.

 Or this may be explained by that of our Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:7">Matt. xv. 7</A>),

 "<I>Well did Esaias prophesy of you.</I> The Holy Ghost said to your
 fathers, that which would be fulfilled in you, <I>Hearing you shall 
 hear, and shall not understand.</I>" 

 (1.) "That which was their great sin against God is yours; and that is 
 this, you will not see. You shut your eyes against the most convincing 
 evidence possible, and will not admit the conclusion, though you cannot 
 deny the premises: <I>Your eyes you have closed,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 This intimates an obstinate infidelity, and a willing slavery to 
 prejudice. "As your fathers would not see God's hand lifted up against
 them in his judgments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>),

 so you will not see God's hand stretched out to you in gospel grace." 
 It was true of these unbelieving Jews that they were prejudiced against 
 the gospel; they did not see, because they were resolved they would 
 not, and none so blind as those that will not see. They would not 
 prosecute their convictions, and for this reason would not admit them.
 They have purposely <I>closed their eyes, lest they should see with 
 their eyes</I> the great things which belong to their everlasting 
 peace, should see the glory of God, the amiableness of Christ, the 
 deformity of sin, the beauty of holiness, the vanity of this world, and 
 the reality of another. They will not be changed and governed by these 
 truths, and therefore will not receive the evidence of them, <I>lest 
 they should hear with their ears</I> that which they are loth to hear, 
 the wrath of God revealed from heaven against them, and the will of God 
 revealed from heaven to them. They stop their ears, like the deaf 
 adder, that <I>will not hearken to the voice of the charmer, charm he 
 ever so wisely.</I> Thus their fathers did; they <I>would not hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:11,12">Zech. vii. 11, 12</A>.

 And that which they are afraid of in shutting up their eyes and ears, 
 and barricading (as it were) both their learning senses against him 
 that made both the hearing ear and the seeing eye, is, <I>lest they 
 should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I 
 should heal them.</I> They kept their mind in the dark, or at least in 
 a constant confusion and tumult, lest, if they should admit a 
 considerate sober thought, they should understand with their heart how 
 much it is both their duty and their interest to be religious, and so 
 by degrees the truth should be too hard for them, and they should be 
 converted from the evil ways which they take pleasure in, to those 
 exercises to which they have now an aversion. Observe, God's method is 
 to bring people first to see and he and so to understand with their 
 hearts, and then to convert them, and bow their wills, and so heal 
 them, which is the regular way of dealing with a rational soul; and 
 therefore Satan prevents the conversion of souls to God by blinding the 
 mind and darkening the understanding,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2 Cor. iv. 4</A>.
 
 And the case is very sad when the sinner joins with him herein, and
 puts out his own eyes. <I>Ut liberius peccent, libenter ignorant--They
 plunge into ignorance, that they may sin the more freely.</I> They are 
 in love with their disease, and are afraid lest God should heal them; 
 like Babylon of old, We would have healed her, and she would not be 
 healed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9">Jer. li. 9</A>.
 
 This was the sin.

 (2.) "That which was the great judgment of God upon them for this sin
 is his judgment upon you, and that is, you shall be blind. God will 
 give you up to a judicial infatuation: <I>Hearing you shall 
 hear</I>--you shall have the word of God preached to you over and 
 over--<I>but you shall not understand</I> it; because you will not give 
 your minds to understand it, God will not give you strength and grace 
 to understand it. <I>Seeing you shall see</I>--you shall have abundance 
 of miracles and signs done before your eyes--<I>but you shall not 
 perceive</I> the convincing evidence of them. Take heed lest what
 Moses said to your fathers should be true of you 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:4">Deut. xxix. 4</A>),

 <I>The Lord has not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and 
 ears to hear, unto this day;</I> and what Isaiah said to the men of his 
 generation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:10-12">Isa. xxix. 10-12</A>),

 <I>The Lord has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has
 closed your eyes.</I>" What with their resisting the grace of God and 
 rebelling against the light, and God's withdrawing and withholding his 
 grace and light from them,--what with their not receiving the love of
 the truth, and God's giving them up for that to strong delusions, to 
 believe a lie,--what with their wilful and what with their judicial
 hardness, <I>the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears 
 are dull of hearing.</I> They are stupid and senseless, and not wrought 
 upon by all that can be said to them. No physic that can be given them 
 operates upon them, nor will reach them, and therefore their disease 
 must be adjudged incurable, and their case desperate. How should those 
 be happy that will not be healed of a disease that makes them 
 miserable? And how should those be healed that will not be converted to 
 the use of the methods of cure? And how should those be converted that 
 will not be convinced either of their disease or of their remedy? And 
 how should those be convinced that <I>shut their eyes and stop their 
 ears?</I> Let all that hear the gospel, and do not heed it, tremble at 
 this doom; for, when once they are thus given up to hardness of heart, 
 they are already in the suburbs of hell; for who shall heal them, if 
 God do not?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "Your unbelief will justify God in sending the gospel to the Gentile 
 world, which is the thing you look upon with such a jealous eye 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 therefore seeing you put the grace of God away from you, and will not 
 submit to the power of divine truth and love, seeing you will not be 
 converted and healed in the methods which divine wisdom has appointed, 
 <I>therefore be it known unto you that the salvation of God is sent 
 unto the Gentiles,</I> that salvation which was of the Jews only 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22">John iv. 22</A>),

 the offer of it is made to them, the means of it afforded to them, and 
 they stand fairer for it than you do; it is sent to them, and they will 
 hear it, and receive it, and be happy in it." Now Paul designs hereby, 
 
 (1.) To abate their displeasure at the preaching of the gospel to the 
 Gentiles, by showing them the absurdity of it. They were angry that the 
 salvation of God was sent to the Gentiles, and thought it was too great 
 a favour done to them; but, if they thought that salvation of so small 
 a value as not to be worthy of their acceptance, surely they could not 
 grudge it to the Gentiles as too good for them, nor envy them for it. 
 The salvation of God was sent into the world, the Jews had the first 
 offer of it, it was fairly proposed to them, it was earnestly pressed 
 upon them, but they refused it; they would not accept the invitation 
 which was given to them first to the wedding-feast and therefore must 
 thank themselves if other guests be invited. If they will not strike 
 the bargain, nor come up to the terms, they ought not to be angry at 
 those that will. They cannot complain that the Gentiles took it over 
 their heads, or out of their hands, for they had quite taken their 
 hands off it, nay, <I>they had lifted up the heel against it;</I> and 
 therefore it is their fault, for <I>it is through their fall that 
 salvation is come to the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11">Rom. xi. 11</A>.

 (2.) To improve their displeasure at the favour done to the Gentiles to 
 their advantage, and to bring good out of that evil; for when he had 
 spoken of this very thing in his epistle to the Romans, the benefit 
 which the Gentiles had by the unbelief and rejection of the Jews, he 
 says, he took notice of it on purpose that he might provoke his dear 
 countrymen the Jews <I>to a holy emulation, and might save some of 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.

 The Jews have rejected the gospel of Christ, and pushed it off to the
 Gentiles, but it is not yet too late to repent of their refusal, and to 
 accept of the salvation which they did make light of; they may say No, 
 and take it, as the elder brother in the parable, who, when he was 
 bidden to <I>go work in the vineyard,</I> first said, <I>I will 
 not,</I> and yet <I>afterwards repented and went,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:29">Matt. xxi. 29</A>.

 Is the gospel sent to the Gentiles? Let us go after it rather than come
 short of it. And will they hear it, who are thought to be out of 
 hearing, and have been so long like the idols they worshipped, <I>that 
 have ears and hear not?</I> And shall not we hear it, whose privilege 
 it is to have God so nigh to us in all that we call upon him for? Thus 
 he would have them to argue, and to be shamed into the belief of the 
 gospel by the welcome it met with among the Gentiles. And, if it had 
 not that effect upon them, it would aggravate their condemnation, as it 
 did that of the scribes and Pharisees, who, when they saw the publicans 
 and harlots submit to John's baptism, did not afterwards thereupon 
 repent of their folly, <I>that they might believe him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:32">Matt. xxi. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The breaking up of the assembly, as it should seem, in some 
 disorder. 

 1. They turned their backs upon Paul. Those of them that believed not 
 were extremely nettled at that last word which he said, that they 
 should be judicially blinded, and that the light of the gospel should 
 shine among those that sat in darkness. <I>When Paul had said these 
 words,</I> he had said enough for them, and <I>they departed,</I> 
 perhaps not so much enraged as some others of their nation had been 
 upon the like occasion, but stupid and unconcerned, no more affected, 
 either with those terrible words in the close of his discourse or all 
 the comfortable words he had spoken before, than the seats they sat on. 
 They departed, many of them with a resolution never to hear Paul preach 
 again, nor trouble themselves with further enquiries about this matter. 
 
 2. They set their faces one against another; for they had great
 disputes among themselves. There was not only a quarrel between those 
 who believed and those who believed not, but even among those who 
 believed not there were debates. Those that agreed to depart from Paul, 
 yet agreed not in the reasons why they departed, but had <I>great 
 reasoning among themselves.</I> Many have great reasoning who yet do 
 not reason right, can find fault with one another's opinions, and yet 
 not yield to truth. Nor will men's reasoning among themselves convince 
 them, without the grace of God to open their understandings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
 received all that came in unto him,
 &nbsp; 31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things
 which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man
 forbidding him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taking our leave of the history of blessed Paul; and 
 therefore, since God saw it not fit that we should know any more of 
 him, we should carefully take notice of every particular of the 
 circumstances in which we must here leave him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It cannot but be a trouble to us that we must leave him in bonds for 
 Christ, nay, and that we have no prospect given us of his being set at 
 liberty. <I>Two whole years</I> of that good man's life are here spent 
 in confinement, and, for aught that appears, he was never enquired 
 after, all that time, by those whose prisoner he was. He appealed to 
 C&aelig;sar, in hope of a speedy discharge from his imprisonment, the
 governors having signified to his imperial majesty concerning the 
 prisoner <I>that he had done nothing worthy of death or bonds,</I> and 
 yet he is detained a prisoner. So little reason have we to trust in 
 men, especially despised prisoners in great men; witness the case of 
 Joseph, whom <I>the chief butler remembered not, but forgot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:23">Gen. xl. 23</A>.

 Yet some think that though it be not mentioned here, yet it was in the
 former of these two years, and early too in that year, that he was 
 first brought before Nero, and then his bonds in Christ were manifest 
 in C&aelig;sar's court, as he says,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13">Phil. i. 13</A>.

 And at this first answer it was that <I>no man stood by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2 Tim. iv. 16</A>.

 But it seems, instead of being set at liberty upon this appeal, as he
 expected, he hardly escaped out of the emperor's hands with his life;
 he calls it a deliverance out of the mouth of the lion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17">2 Tim. iv. 17</A>,

 and his speaking there of his first answer intimates that since that he 
 had a second, in which he had come off better, and yet was not 
 discharged. During these two years' imprisonment he wrote his epistle 
 to the Galatians, then his second epistle to Timothy, then those to the 
 Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and to Philemon, in which he 
 mentions several things particularly concerning his imprisonment; and, 
 lastly, his epistle to the Hebrews just after he was set at liberty, as 
 Timothy also was, who, coming to visit him, was upon some account or 
 other made his fellow-prisoner (<I>with whom,</I> writes Paul to the
 Hebrews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23">xiii. 23</A>,

 <I>if he come shortly, I will see you</I>), but how or by what means he
 obtained his liberty we are not told, only that two years he was a 
 prisoner. Tradition says that after his discharge he went from Italy to 
 Spain, thence to Crete, and so with Timothy into Judea, and thence went 
 to visit the churches in Asia, and at length came a second time to 
 Rome, and there was beheaded in the last year of Nero. But Baronius 
 himself owns that there is no certainty of any thing concerning him 
 betwixt his release from this imprisonment and his martyrdom; but it is 
 said by some that Nero, having, when he began to play the tyrant, set 
 himself against the Christians, and persecuted them (and he was the 
 first of the emperors that made a law against them, as Tertullian says, 
 <I>Apol.</I> cap. 5), the church at Rome was much weakened by that 
 persecution, and this brought Paul the second time to Rome, to 
 re-establish the church there, and to comfort the souls of the 
 disciples that were left, and so he fell a second time into Nero's 
 hand. And Chrysostom relates that a young woman that was one of Nero's 
 misses (to speak modishly) being converted, by Paul's preaching, to the 
 Christian faith, and so brought off from the lewd course of life she 
 had lived, Nero was incensed against Paul for it, and ordered him first 
 to be imprisoned, and then put to death. But to keep to this short 
 account here given of it, 

 1. It would grieve one to think that such a useful man as Paul was 
 should be so long in restraint. Two years he was a prisoner under Felix

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:27"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 27</A>),

 and, besides all the time that passed between that and his coming to
 Rome, he is here two years more a prisoner under Nero. How many 
 churches might Paul have planted, how many cities and nations might he 
 have brought over to Christ, in these five years' time (for so much it 
 was at least), if he had been at liberty! But God is wise, and will 
 show that he is not debtor to the most useful instruments he employs, 
 but can and will carry on his own interest, both without their services 
 and by their sufferings. Even Paul's bonds fell out <I>to the 
 furtherance of the gospel,</I>

 2. Yet even Paul's imprisonment was in some respects a kindness to him,
 for these <I>two years he dwelt in his own hired house,</I> and that 
 was more, for aught I know, than ever he had done before. He had always 
 been accustomed to sojourn in the houses of others, now he has a house 
 of his own--his own while he pays the rent of it; and such a retirement 
 as this would be a refreshment to one who had been all his days an 
 itinerant. He had been accustomed to be always upon the remove, seldom 
 staid long at a place, but now he lived for two years in the same 
 house; so that the bringing of him into this prison was like Christ's 
 call to his disciples <I>to come into a desert place, and rest 
 awhile,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:31">Mark vi. 31</A>.

 When he was at liberty, he was in continual fear by reason of <I>the
 lying in wait of the Jews</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:19"><I>ch.</I> xx. 19</A>),

 but now his prison was his castle. Thus <I>out of the eater came forth
 meat, and out of the strong sweetness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet it is a pleasure to us (for we are sure it was to him) that,
 though we leave him in bonds for Christ, yet we leave him at work for 
 Christ, and this made his bonds easy that he was not by them bound out 
 from serving God and doing good. His prison becomes a temple, a church, 
 and then it is to him a palace. His hands are tied, but, thanks be to 
 God, his mouth is not stopped; a faithful zealous minister can better 
 bear any hardship than being silenced. Here is Paul a prisoner, and yet 
 a preacher; he is bound, but the word of the Lord is not bound. When he 
 wrote his epistle to the Romans, he said <I>he longed to see them, that 
 he might impart unto them some spiritual gift</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11">Rom. i. 11</A>);

 he was glad <I>to see some of them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 but it would not be half his joy unless he could impart to them some 
 spiritual gift, which here he has an opportunity to do, and then he 
 will not complain of his confinement. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To whom he preached: to all that had a mind to hear him, whether 
 Jews or Gentiles. Whether he had liberty to go to other houses to 
 preach does not appear; it is likely not; but whoever would had liberty 
 to come to his house to hear, and they were welcome: <I>He received all 
 that came to him.</I> Note, Ministers' doors should be open to such as 
 desire to receive instruction from them, and they should be glad of an 
 opportunity to advise those that are in care about their souls. Paul 
 could not preach in a synagogue, or any public place of meeting that 
 was sumptuous and capacious, but he preached in a poor cottage of his 
 own. Note, When we cannot do what we would in the service of God we 
 must do what we can. Those ministers that have but little hired houses 
 should rather preach in them, if they may be allowed to do that, than 
 be silent. <I>He received all that came to him,</I> and was not afraid 
 of the greatest, nor ashamed of the meanest. He was ready to preach on 
 the first day of the week to Christians, on the seventh day to Jews, 
 and to all who would come on any day of the week; and he might hope the 
 better to speed because <I>they came in unto him,</I> which supposed a 
 desire to be instructed and a willingness to learn, and where these are 
 it is probable that some good may be done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he preached. He does not fill their heads with curious 
 speculations, nor with matters of state and politics, but he keeps to 
 his text, minds his business as an apostle. 

 (1.) He is God's ambassador, and therefore <I>preaches the kingdom of 
 God,</I> does all he can to preach it up, negotiates the affairs of it, 
 in order to the advancing of all its true interests. He meddles not 
 with the affairs of the kingdoms of men; let those treat of them whose 
 work it is. He preaches the kingdom of God among men, and the word of 
 that kingdom; the same that he defended in his public disputes, 
 <I>testifying the kingdom of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 he enforced in his public preaching, as that which, if received aright, 
 will make us all wise and good, wiser and better, which is the end of 
 preaching. 

 (2.) He is an agent for Christ, a friend of the bridegroom, and 
 therefore <I>teaches those things which concern the Lord Jesus 
 Christ</I>--the whole history of Christ, his incarnation, doctrine, 
 life, miracles, death, resurrection, ascension; all that relates to the 
 mystery of godliness. Paul stuck still to his principle--to know and
 preach <I>nothing but Christ, and him crucified.</I> Ministers, when in 
 their preaching they are tempted to diverge from that which is their 
 main business, should reduce themselves with this question, What does 
 this concern the Lord Jesus Christ? What tendency has it to bring us to 
 him, and to keep us walking in him? <I>For we preach not ourselves, but 
 Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. With what liberty he preached. 

 (1.) Divine grace gave him a liberty of spirit. He preached <I>with all 
 confidence,</I> as one that was himself well assured of the truth of 
 what he preached--that it was what he durst stand by; and of the worth 
 of it--that it was what he durst suffer for. He was <I>not ashamed of 
 the gospel of Christ.</I> 

 (2.) Divine Providence gave him a liberty of speech: <I>No man 
 forbidding him,</I> giving him any check for what he did or laying any 
 restraint upon him. The Jews that used to forbid him to speak to the 
 Gentiles had no authority here; and the Roman government as yet took no 
 cognizance of the profession of Christianity as a crime. Herein we must 
 acknowledge the hand of God, 

 [1.] Setting bounds to the rage of persecutors; where he does not turn 
 the heart, yet he can tie the hand and bridle the tongue. Nero was a 
 bloody man, and there were many, both Jews and Gentiles, in Rome, that 
 hated Christianity; and yet so it was, unaccountably, that Paul though 
 a prisoner was connived at in preaching the gospel, and it was not 
 construed a breach of the peace. Thus God makes <I>the wrath of men to 
 praise him, and restrains the remainder of it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 Though there were so many that had it in their power to forbid Paul's 
 preaching (even the common soldier that kept him might have done it), 
 yet God so ordered it, <I>that no man did forbid him.</I> 

 [2.] See God here providing comfort for the relief of the persecuted. 
 Though it was a very low and narrow sphere of opportunity that Paul was 
 here placed in, compared with what he had been in, yet, such as it was, 
 he was not molested nor disturbed in it. Though it was not a wide door 
 that was opened to him, yet it was kept open, and no man was suffered 
 to shut it; and it was to many an effectual door, so that there were 
 saints even in C&aelig;sar's household,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:22">Phil. iv. 22</A>.

 When the city of our solemnities is thus made a quiet habitation at any
 time, and we are fed from day to day with the bread of life, no man 
 forbidding us, we must give thanks to God for it and prepare for 
 changes, still longing for that holy mountain in which there shall 
 never be any pricking brier nor grieving thorn.</P>
