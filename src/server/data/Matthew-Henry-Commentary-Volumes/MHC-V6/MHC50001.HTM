 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
 saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops
 and deacons:
 &nbsp; 2  Grace <I>be</I> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and
 <I>from</I> the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the inscription and benediction. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persons writing the epistle--<I>Paul and Timotheus.</I> Though
 Paul was alone divinely inspired, he joins Timothy with himself, to 
 express his own humility, and put honour upon Timothy. Those who are 
 aged, and strong, and eminent, should pay respect to, and support the 
 reputation of, those who are younger, and weaker, and of less note. 
 <I>The servants of Jesus Christ;</I> not only in the common relation of 
 his disciples, but in the peculiar work of the ministry, the high 
 office of an apostle and an evangelist. Observe, The highest honour of 
 the greatest apostle, and most eminent ministers, is to be the servants 
 of Jesus Christ; not the masters of the churches, but the servants of 
 Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons to whom it is directed. 

 1. To <I>all the saints in Christ who are at Philippi.</I> He mentions
 the church before the ministers, because the ministers are for the 
 church, for their edification and benefit, not the churches for the 
 ministers, for their dignity, dominion, and wealth. <I>Not for that we 
 have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:24">2 Cor. i. 24</A>.

 They are not only the servants of Christ, but the servants of the
 church for his sake. <I>Ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:5">2 Cor. iv. 5</A>.
 
 Observe, The Christians here are called saints; set apart for God, or
 sanctified by his Spirit, either by visible profession or real
 holiness. And those who are not really saints on earth will never be 
 saints in heaven. Observe, It is directed to <I>all the saints,</I>
 one as well as another, even the meanest, the poorest, and those of the 
 least gifts. Christ makes no difference; the rich and the poor meet 
 together in him: and the ministers must not make a difference in their 
 care and tenderness upon these accounts. We must not <I>have the faith 
 of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1">James ii. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Saints in Christ Jesus;</I> saints are accepted only by virtue of
 their being in Christ Jesus, or as they are Christians. Out of Christ 
 the best saints will appear sinners, and unable to stand before God. 

 2. It is directed to the ministers, or church-officers--<I>with the
 bishops and deacons,</I> the bishops or elders, in the first place, 
 whose office it was to teach and rule, and the deacons, or overseers of 
 the poor, who took care of the outward business of the house of God: 
 the place, the furniture, the maintenance of the ministers, and 
 provision for the poor. These were all the offices which were then 
 known in the church, and which were of divine appointment. The apostle, 
 in the direction of his epistle to a Christian church, acknowledges but 
 two orders, which he calls bishops and deacons. And whosoever shall 
 consider that the same characters and titles, the same qualifications, 
 the same acts of office, and the same honour and respect, are every 
 where ascribed throughout the New Testament to those who are called 
 bishops and presbyters (as Dr. Hammond and other learned men allow), 
 will find it difficult to make them a different office or distinct 
 order of ministry in the scripture times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the apostolical benediction: <I>Grace be unto you, and 
 peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 This is the same, almost word for word, in all the epistles, to teach 
 us that we must not be shy of forms, though we are not to be tied down 
 to them, especially such as are not scriptural. The only form in the 
 Old Testament is that of a benediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:23-26">Num. vi. 23-26</A>),

 <I>On this wise you shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto 
 them, The Lord bless thee and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine 
 upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up the light of his 
 countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</I> So in the New 
 Testament, the good which is wished is spiritual good, <I>grace and 
 peace</I>--the free favour and good-will of God, and all the blessed 
 fruits and effects of it, and that <I>from God our Father, and from the 
 Lord Jesus Christ,</I> jointly from them both, though in a different 
 way. Observe, 

 1. No peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of divine
 favour. 

 2. No grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and
 original of all blessings, the <I>Father of lights, from whom cometh 
 down every good and perfect gift,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">James i. 17</A>.

 3. No grace and peace from God our Father, but in and through our Lord
 Jesus Christ. Christ, as Mediator, is the channel of conveyance of all
 spiritual blessings to the church, and directs the disposal of them to 
 all his members.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
 &nbsp; 4  Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request
 with joy,
 &nbsp; 5  For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until
 now;
 &nbsp; 6  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun
 a good work in you will perform <I>it</I> until the day of Jesus
 Christ:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds after the inscription and benediction to 
 thanksgiving for the saints at Philippi. He tells them what it was he 
 thanked God for, upon their account. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul remembered them: he bore them much in his thoughts; and though 
 they were out of sight, and he was at a distance from them, yet they 
 were not out of his mind: or, <I>Upon every mention of 
 you</I>--<B><I>epi pase te mneia.</I></B> As he often thought of them,
 so he often spoke of them, and delighted to hear them spoken of. The 
 very mention of them was grateful to him: it is a pleasure to hear of 
 the welfare of an absent friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He remembered them with joy. At Philippi he was maltreated; there 
 he was scourged and put into the stocks, and for the present saw little 
 of the fruit of his labour; and yet he remembers Philippi with joy. He 
 looked upon his sufferings for Christ as his credit, his comfort, his 
 crown, and was pleased at every mention of the place where he suffered. 
 So far was he from being ashamed of them, or loth to hear of the scene 
 of his sufferings, that he remembered it with joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He remembered them in prayer: <I>Always in every prayer of mine 
 for you all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The best remembrance of our friends is to remember them at the throne 
 of grace. Paul was much in prayer for his friends, for all his friends, 
 for these particularly. It should seem, by this manner of expression, 
 that he mentioned at the throne of grace the several churches he was 
 interested in and concerned for particularly and by name. He had 
 seasons of prayer for the church at Philippi. God gives us leave to be 
 thus free with him, though, for our comfort, he knows whom we mean when 
 we do not name them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He thanked God upon every joyful remembrance of them. Observe, 
 Thanksgiving must have a part in every prayer; and whatsoever is the 
 matter of our rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving. 
 What we have the comfort of, God must have the glory of. He thanked 
 God, as well as made requests with joy. As holy joy is the heart and 
 soul of thankful praise, so thankful praise is the lip and language of 
 holy joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. As in our prayers, so in our thanksgiving, we must eye God as our 
 God: <I>I thank my God.</I> It encourages us in prayer, and enlarges 
 the heart in praise, to see every mercy coming from the hand of God as 
 our God.--<I>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you.</I> We must
 thank our God for others' graces and comforts, and gifts and 
 usefulness, as we receive the benefit of them, and God receives glory 
 by them. But what is the matter of this thanksgiving? 

 1. He gives thanks to God for the comfort he had in them: for <I>your
 fellowship in the gospel, from the first day until now,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Observe, Gospel fellowship is a good fellowship; and the meanest 
 Christians have fellowship in the gospel with the greatest apostles, 
 for the gospel salvation is a <I>common salvation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">
 Jude 3</A>),

 and they <I>obtain like precious faith</I> with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:1">2 Pet. i. 1</A>.

 Those who sincerely receive and embrace the gospel have fellowship in
 it <I>from the very first day:</I> a new-born Christian, if he is 
 true-born, is interested in all the promises and privileges of the 
 gospel from the first day of his becoming such.--<I>Until now.</I> 
 Observe, It is a great comfort to ministers when those who begin well 
 hold on and persevere. Some, by their <I>fellowship in the gospel,</I> 
 understand their liberality towards propagating the gospel, and 
 translate <B><I>koinonia,</I></B> not <I>communion,</I> but 
 <I>communication.</I> But, comparing it with Paul's thanksgiving on the 
 account of other churches, it rather seems to be taken more generally 
 for the fellowship which they had, in faith, and hope, and holy love, 
 with all good Christians--a fellowship in gospel promises, ordinances, 
 privileges, and hopes; and this from the <I>first day until now.</I> 

 2. For the confidence he had concerning them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Being confident of this very thing,</I> &c. Observe, The confidence 
 of Christians is the great comfort of Christians, and we may fetch 
 matter of praise from our hopes as well as from our joys; we must give 
 thanks not only for what we have the present possession and evidence 
 of, but for what we have the future prospect of. Paul speaks with much 
 confidence concerning the good estate of others, hoping well concerning 
 them in the judgment of charity, and being confident in the judgment of 
 faith that if they were sincere they would be happy: <I>That he who has 
 begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Jesus 
 Christ.</I> A good work <I>among you</I>--<B><I>en hymin,</I></B> so it 
 may be read: understand it, in the general, of the planting of the 
 church among them. He who hath planted Christianity in the world will 
 preserve it as long as the world stands. Christ will have a church till 
 the mystery of God shall be finished and the mystical body completed. 
 The church is built upon a rock, and the <I>gates of hell shall not 
 prevail against it.</I> But it is rather to be applied to particular 
 persons, and then it speaks of the certain accomplishment of the work 
 of grace wherever it is begun. Observe here,

 (1.) The work of grace is a good work, a blessed work; for it makes us 
 good, and is an earnest of good to us. It makes us like God, and fits 
 us for the enjoyment of God. That may well be called a good work which
 does us the greatest good.

 (2.) Wherever this good work is begun it is of God's beginning: <I>He 
 has begun a good work in you.</I> We could not begin it ourselves, for 
 we are by nature <I>dead in trespasses and sins:</I> and what can dead 
 men do towards raising themselves to life; or how can they begin to act 
 till they are enlivened in the same respect in which they are said to 
 be dead? It is God who quickens those who are thus dead, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:1,Col+2:13">Eph. ii. 1; Col. ii. 13</A>.

 (3.) The work of grace is but begun in this life; it is not finished
 here; as long as we are in this imperfect state there is something more 
 to be done. 

 (4.) If the same God who begins the good work did not undertake the 
 carrying on and finishing of it, it would lie for ever unfinished. He
 must perform it who began it.

 (5.) We may be confident, or well persuaded, that God not only will not 
 forsake, but that he will finish and crown the work of his own hands. 
 For, <I>as for God, his work is perfect.</I> 

 (6.) The work of grace will never be perfected <I>till the day of Jesus 
 Christ,</I> the day of his appearance. When he shall come to judge the 
 world, and finish his mediation, then this work will be complete, and
 the top-stone will be brought forth with shouting. We have the same 
 expression,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I
 have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the
 defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of
 my grace.
 &nbsp; 8  For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
 bowels of Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle expresses the ardent affection he had for them, and his 
 concern for their spiritual welfare: <I>I have you in my heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He loved them as his own soul, and they lay near his heart. He thought 
 much of them, and was in care about them. Observe, 

 1. Why he had them in his heart: <I>Inasmuch as both in my bonds, and
 in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of 
 my grace;</I> that is, they had received benefit by him and by his 
 ministry; they were partakers of that grace of God which by him, and 
 through his hands, was communicated to them. This makes people dear to 
 their ministers--their receiving benefit by their ministry. Or, "<I>You 
 are partakers of my grace,</I> you have joined with me in doing and 
 suffering." They were partakers of his affliction by sympathy and 
 concern, and readiness to assist him. Thus he calls being partakers of 
 his grace; for those who suffer with the saints are and shall be 
 comforted with them; and those shall share in the reward, who bear 
 their part of the burden. He loved them because they adhered to him in 
 his bonds, and in the <I>defence and confirmation of the gospel:</I> 
 they were as ready to appear in their places, and according to their 
 capacity, for the defence of the gospel, as the apostle was in his; and 
 therefore he had them in his heart. Fellow sufferers should be dear one 
 to another; those who have ventured and suffered in the same good cause 
 of God and religion should for that reason love one another dearly: or, 
 because <I>you have me at heart</I>--<B><I>dia to echein me en te 
 kardia hymas.</I></B> They manifested their respect for him by adhering 
 firmly to the doctrine he preached, and readily suffering for it along 
 with him. The truest mark of respect towards our ministers is receiving 
 and abiding by the doctrine they preach. 

 2. The evidence of it: <I>It is meet for me to think this of you all,
 because I have you in my heart.</I> By this it appeared that he had 
 them in his heart, because he had a good opinion of them and good hopes 
 concerning them. Observe, It is very proper to think the best of other 
 people, and as well as we can of them--to suppose as well of them as 
 the matter will admit in all cases.

 3. An appeal to God concerning the truth of this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>For God is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bowels
 of Jesus Christ.</I> Having them in his heart, he longed after them; 
 either he longed to see them, longed to hear from them, or he longed 
 for their spiritual welfare and their increase and improvement in 
 knowledge and grace. He had <I>joy in them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 because of the good he saw and heard of among them; yet still he longed 
 after them, to hear of more of it among them; and he <I>longed after 
 them all,</I> not only those among them who were witty and wealthy, but 
 even the meanest and poorest; and he <I>longed greatly</I> after them, 
 or with strong affection and great good-will; and this <I>in the bowels 
 of Jesus Christ,</I> with that tender concern which Christ himself has 
 and has shown to precious souls. Paul was herein a follower of Christ, 
 and all good ministers should aim to be so. O the bowels of compassion 
 which are in Jesus Christ to poor souls! It was in compassion to them 
 that he undertook their salvation, and put himself to so vast an 
 expense to compass it. Now, in conformity to the example of Christ, 
 Paul had a compassion for them, and longed after them all <I>in the 
 bowels of Jesus Christ.</I> Shall not we pity and love those souls whom 
 Christ had such a love and pity for? For this he appeals to God: <I>God 
 is my record.</I> It was an inward disposition of mind that he 
 expressed towards them, to the sincerity of which God only was witness, 
 and therefore to him he appeals. "Whether you know it or not, or are 
 sensible of it, God, who knows the heart, knows it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses contain the prayers he put up for them. Paul often let his 
 friends know what it was he begged of God for them, that they might 
 know what to beg for themselves and be directed in their own prayers, 
 and that they might be encouraged to hope they should receive from God 
 the quickening, strengthening, everlasting, comforting grace, which so 
 powerful an intercessor as Paul asked of God for them. It is an 
 encouragement to us to know that we are prayed for by our friends, who, 
 we have reason to think, have an interest at the throne of grace. It 
 was intended likewise for their direction in their walk, and that they 
 might labour to answer his prayers for them; for by this it would 
 appear that God had answered them. Paul, in praying thus for them, 
 expected good concerning them. It is an inducement to us to do our 
 duty, that we may not disappoint the expectations of praying friends 
 and ministers. He prayed, 

 1. That they might be a loving people, and that good affections might
 abound among them; <I>That your love might abound yet more and 
 more.</I> He means it of their love to God, and one another, and all 
 men. Love is the fulfilling both of the law and of the gospel. Observe, 
 Those who abound much in any grace have still need to abound more and 
 more, because there is still something wanting in it and we are 
 imperfect in our best attainments. 

 2. That they might be a knowing and judicious people: that love might
 abound <I>in knowledge and in all judgment.</I> It is not a blind love 
 that will recommend us to God, but a love grounded upon knowledge and 
 judgment. We must love God because of his infinite excellence and 
 loveliness, and love our brethren because of what we see of the image 
 of God upon them. Strong passions, without knowledge and a settled 
 judgment, will not make us complete in the will of God, and sometimes 
 do more hurt than good. The Jews had a zeal of God, but not according 
 to knowledge, and were transported by it to violence and rage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:2,Joh+16:2">Rom. x. 2; John xvi. 2</A>.

 3. That they might be a discerning people. This would be the effect of
 their knowledge and judgment: <I>That you may approve the things which 
 are excellent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 or, as it is in the margin, <I>Try the things which differ;</I> 
 <B><I>eis to dokimazein humas ta diapheronta,</I></B> that we may 
 approve the things which are excellent upon the trial of them, and 
 discern their difference from other things. Observe, The truths and
 laws of Christ are excellent things; and it is necessary that we every 
 one approve them, and esteem them such. We only need to try them, to 
 approve of them; and they will easily recommend themselves to any 
 searching and discerning mind. 

 4. That they might be an honest upright-hearted people: <I>That you may
 be sincere.</I> Sincerity is our gospel perfection, that in which we 
 should have our conversation in the world, and which is the glory of 
 all our graces. When the eye is single, when we are inward with God in 
 what we do, are really what we appear to be, and mean honestly, then we 
 are sincere. 

 5. That they might be an inoffensive people: that you may be <I>without
 offence until the day of Christ;</I> not apt to take offence; and very 
 careful not to give offence to God or their brethren, to <I>live in all 
 good conscience before God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:1">Acts xxiii. 1</A>),

 and to <I>exercise ourselves to have always a conscience void of 
 offence towards God and towards men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Acts xxiv. 16</A>.

 And we must continue to the end <I>blameless,</I> that we may be 
 presented so at the <I>day of Christ.</I> He will present the church 
 <I>without spot or wrinkle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27">Eph. v. 27</A>),

 and <I>present</I> believers <I>faultless before the presence of his 
 glory with exceeding joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24">Jude 24</A>.

 6. That they might be a fruitful useful people

 <I>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness,</I> &c. From God is 
 our fruit found, and therefore from him it must be asked. The <I>fruits 
 of righteousness</I> are the evidences and effects of our 
 sanctification, the duties of holiness springing from a renewed heart, 
 the <I>root of the matter in us. Being filled</I> with them. Observe, 
 Those who do much good should still endeavour to do more. The fruits of 
 righteousness, brought forth for the glory of God and edification of 
 his church, should really fill us, and wholly take us up. Fear not 
 being emptied by bringing forth the fruits of righteousness, for you 
 will be filled with them. These fruits are <I>by Jesus Christ,</I> by 
 his strength and grace, for <I>without him we can do nothing.</I> He is 
 the root of the good olive, from which it derives its fatness. We are 
 <I>strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus</I>

 God,</I> that <I>God may be glorified in all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11">1 Peter iv. 11</A>),

 but do good, and <I>abound in good works.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things
 <I>which happened</I> unto me have fallen out rather unto the
 furtherance of the gospel;
 &nbsp; 13  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace,
 and in all other <I>places;</I>
 &nbsp; 14  And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my
 bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
 &nbsp; 15  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some
 also of good will:
 &nbsp; 16  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely,
 supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
 &nbsp; 17  But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence
 of the gospel.
 &nbsp; 18  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence,
 or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
 and will rejoice.
 &nbsp; 19  For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your

 whether <I>it be</I> by life, or by death.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We see here the care the apostle takes to prevent their being offended 
 at his sufferings. He was now a prisoner at Rome; this might be a 
 stumbling-block to those who had received the gospel by his ministry. 
 They might be tempted to think, If this doctrine were indeed of God, 
 God would not suffer one who was so active and instrumental in 
 preaching and propagating it to be thrown by as a despised broken 
 vessel. They might be shy of owning this doctrine, lest they should be 
 involved in the same trouble themselves. Now to take off the offence of 
 the cross, he expounds this dark and hard chapter of his sufferings, 
 and makes it very easy and intelligible, and reconcilable to the wisdom 
 and goodness of God who employed him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He suffered by the sworn enemies of the gospel, who laid him in 
 prison, and aimed at taking away his life; but they should not be 
 stumbled at this, for good was brought out of it, and it tended to the 
 furtherance of the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the 
 furtherance of the gospel.</I> A strange chemistry of Providence this, 
 to extract so great a good as the enlargement of the gospel out of so 
 great an evil as the confinement of the apostle. "<I>I suffer trouble 
 as an evil-doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:9">2 Tim. ii. 9</A>.

 They cannot imprison the word of God; that has its free course, though
 I am confined." But how was this?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It alarmed those who were without 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>My bonds in Christ,</I> or for Christ, <I>are manifest in all the 
 palace and in all other places.</I> The emperor, the courtiers, the 
 magistrates, are convinced that I do not suffer as an evil-doer, but as 
 an honest man, with a good conscience. They know that I suffer for 
 Christ, and not for any wickedness." Observe, 

 (1.) Paul's sufferings made him known at court, where perhaps he would 
 never have otherwise been known; and this might lead some of them to 
 enquire after the gospel for which he suffered, which they might 
 otherwise have never heard of. 

 (2.) When his bonds were manifest in the palace, they were manifest in 
 all other places. <I>The sentiments of the court have a great influence 
 on the sentiments of all people--Regis ad exemplum totus componitur 
 orbis.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It emboldened those who were within. As his enemies were startled at 
 his sufferings, so his friends were encouraged by them. <I>Upright men 
 shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself 
 against the hypocrite. The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he 
 who has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:8,9">Job xvii. 8, 9</A>.

 So it was here: <I>Many of the brethren in the Lord waxing confident by
 my bonds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The expectation of trouble for their religion, in general, perhaps 
 disheartened and discouraged them; but, when they saw Paul imprisoned 
 for Christ, they were so far from being deterred from preaching Christ 
 and praising his name, that it made them the more bold; for they could 
 gladly suffer in Paul's company. If they should be hurried from the 
 pulpit to the prison, they could be reconciled to it, because they 
 would be there in such good company. Besides, the comfort which Paul 
 had in his sufferings, his extraordinary consolations received from 
 Christ in a suffering state, greatly encouraged them. They saw that
 those who served Christ served a good Master, who could both bear them 
 up and bear them out, in their sufferings for him. <I>Waxing confident
 by my bonds.</I> <B><I>Pepoithotas.</I></B> They were more fully 
 satisfied and persuaded by what they saw. Observe the power of divine 
 grace; that which was intended by the enemy to discourage the preachers 
 of the gospel was overruled for their encouragement. And <I>are much 
 more bold to speak the word without fear;</I> they see the worst of it, 
 and therefore are not afraid to venture. Their confidence gave them 
 courage, and their courage preserved them from the power of fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He suffered from false friends as well as from enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):
 
 <I>Some preach Christ even of envy and strife. The one preach Christ of 
 contention, not sincerely.</I> Now this would be a stumbling-block and 
 discouragement to some, that there were those who envied Paul's 
 reputation in the churches, and the interest he had among the 
 Christians, and endeavoured to supplant and undermine him. They were 
 secretly pleased when he was laid up in prison, that they might have 
 the better opportunity to steal away the people's affections; and they 
 laid themselves out the more in preaching, that they might gain to 
 themselves the reputation they envied him: <I>Supposing to add 
 affliction to my bonds.</I> They thought hereby to grieve his spirit, 
 and make him afraid of losing his interest, uneasy under his 
 confinement, and impatient for release. It is sad that there should be 
 men who profess the gospel, especially who preach it, who are governed 
 by such principles as these, who should preach Christ in spite to Paul, 
 and to increase the affliction of his bonds. Let us not think it 
 strange if in these later and more degenerate ages of the church there 
 should be any such. However, there were others who were animated by 
 Paul's sufferings to preach Christ the more vigorously: <I>Some also of 
 good will, and love:</I> from sincere affection to the gospel, that the 
 work might not stand while the workman was laid up.--<I>Knowing that I
 am set for the defence of the gospel.</I> They knew that he was 
 appointed to support and propagate the gospel in the world, against all 
 the violence and opposition of its enemies, and were afraid lest the 
 gospel should suffer by his confinement. This made them the more bold 
 to preach the word and <I>supply his lack of service</I> to the 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is very affecting to see how easy he was in the midst of all: 
 <I>Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ 
 is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, The preaching of Christ is the joy of all who wish well to his 
 kingdom among men. Since it may tend to the good of many, we ought to 
 rejoice in it, though it be done in pretence, and not in reality. It is 
 God's prerogative to judge of the principles men act upon; this is out 
 of our line. Paul was so far from envying those who had liberty to 
 preach the gospel while he was under confinement that he rejoiced in 
 the preaching of it even by those who do it in pretence, and not in 
 truth. How much more then should we rejoice in the preaching of the 
 gospel by those who do it in truth, yea, though it should be with much 
 weakness and some mistake! Two things made the apostle rejoice in the 
 preaching of the gospel:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because it tended to the salvation of the souls of men: <I>I know 
 that this shall turn to my salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Observe, God can bring good out of evil; and what does not turn to the 
 salvation of the ministers may yet, by the grace of God, be made to 
 turn to the salvation of the people. What reward can those expect who 
 preach Christ out <I>of strife, and envy, and contention,</I> and to 
 add affliction to a faithful minister's bonds? who preach in pretence, 
 and not in truth? And yet even this may turn to the salvation of 
 others; and Paul's rejoicing in it turned to his salvation too. This is 
 one of the things which <I>accompany salvation</I>--to be able to 
 rejoice that Christ is preached, though it be to the diminution of us 
 and our reputation. This noble spirit appeared in John the Baptist, at
 the first public preaching of Christ: "<I>This my joy therefore is 
 fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29,30">John iii. 29, 30</A>.

 Let him shine, though I be obscured; and his glory be exalted, though
 upon my ruins." Others understand this expression of the malice of his 
 enemies being defeated, and contributing towards his deliverance from 
 his confinement. <I>Through your prayers, and the supply of the Spirit 
 of Christ.</I> Note, Whatever turns to our salvation is by the supply 
 or the aids and assistance of the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the 
 appointed means of fetching in that supply. The prayers of the people 
 may bring a supply of the Spirit to their ministers, to support them in 
 suffering, as well as in preaching the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because it would turn to the glory of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 where he takes occasion to mention his own entire devotedness to the 
 service and honour of Christ: <I>According to my earnest expectation 
 and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed,</I> &c. Here observe,

 (1.) The great desire of every true Christian is that Christ may be 
 magnified and glorified, that his name may be great, and his kingdom 
 come. 

 (2.) Those who truly desire that Christ may be magnified desire that he
 may be <I>magnified in their body.</I> They present their <I>bodies a 
 living sacrifice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>),

 and <I>yield their members as instruments of righteousness unto 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:13">Rom. vi. 13</A>.

 They are willing to serve his designs, and be instrumental to his 
 glory, with every member of their body, as well as faculty of their 
 soul. 

 (3.) It is much for the glory of Christ that we should serve him boldly 
 and not be ashamed of him, with freedom and liberty of mind, and 
 without discouragement: <I>That in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that 
 with all boldness Christ may be magnified.</I> The boldness of 
 Christians is the honour of Christ. 

 (4.) Those who make Christ's glory their desire and design may make it 
 their expectation and hope. If it be truly aimed at, it shall certainly 
 be attained. If in sincerity we pray, <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I>
 we may be sure of the same answer to that prayer which Christ had: <I>I 
 have glorified it, and I will glorify it again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28">John xii. 28</A>.

 (5.) Those who desire that Christ may be magnified in their bodies have
 a holy indifference <I>whether it be by life or by death.</I> They 
 refer it to him which way he will make them serviceable to his glory, 
 whether by their labours or sufferings, by their diligence or patience, 
 by their living to his honour in working for him or dying to his honour 
 in suffering for him.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the life and death of blessed Paul: his life 
 was Christ, and his death was gain. Observe, 

 1. It is the undoubted character of every good Christian that to him to
 live is Christ. The glory of Christ ought to be the end of our life, 
 the grace of Christ the principle of our life, and the word of Christ 
 the rule of it. The Christian life is derived from Christ, and directed 
 to him. He is the principle, rule, and end of it. 

 2. All those to whom to live is Christ to them to die <I>will be
 gain:</I> it is great gain, a present gain, everlasting gain. Death is 
 a great loss to a carnal worldly man; for he loses all his comforts and 
 all his hopes: but to a good Christian it is gain, for it is the end of 
 all his weakness and misery and the perfection of his comforts and 
 accomplishment of his hopes; it delivers him from all the evils of 
 life, and brings him to the possession of the chief good. Or, <I>To me 
 to die is gain;</I> that is, "to the gospel as well as to myself, which 
 will receive a further confirmation by the seal of my blood, as it had 
 before by the labours of my life." So Christ would be <I>magnified by 
 his death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Some read the whole expression thus: <I>To me, living and dying, Christ 
 is gain;</I> that is, "I desire no more, neither while I live nor when 
 I die, but to win Christ and be found in him." It might be thought, if 
 death were gain to him, he would be weary of life, and impatient for 
 death. No, says he,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>If I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 that is, Christ is. He reckoned his labour well bestowed, if he could 
 be instrumental to advance the honour and interest of the kingdom of 
 Christ in the world. It is <I>the fruit of my labour</I>--<B><I>karpos 
 ergou</I></B>--<I>oper&aelig; pretium.</I> It is worth while for a good 
 Christian and a good minister to live in the world as long as he can 
 glorify God and do good to his church. <I>Yet what I shall choose I wot 
 not; for I am in a strait betwixt two.</I> It was a blessed strait 
 which Paul was in, not between two evil things, but between two good 
 things. David was in a strait by three judgments--sword, famine, and 
 pestilence: Paul was in a strait between two blessings--living to 
 Christ, and being with him. Here we have him reasoning with himself 
 upon the matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His inclination was for death. See the power of faith and of divine 
 grace; it can reconcile the mind to death, and make us willing to die, 
 though death is the destruction of our present nature and the greatest 
 natural evil. We have naturally an aversion to death, but he had an 
 inclination to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>Having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ,</I> Observe, 

 (1.) It is being with Christ which makes a departure desirable to a 
 good man. It is not simply dying, or putting off the body, it is not of 
 itself and for its own sake a desirable thing; but it may be 
 necessarily connected with something else which may make it truly so.
 If I cannot be with Christ without departing, I shall reckon it 
 desirable on that account to depart. 

 (2.) As soon as ever the soul departs, it is immediately with Christ. 
 <I>This day shalt thou be with me in paradise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:43">Luke xxiii. 43</A>.

 <I>Absent from the body and present with the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:8">2 Cor. v. 8</A>),

 without any interval between. <I>Which is far better,</I> <B><I>pollo
 gar mallon kreisson</I></B>--<I>very much exceeding,</I> or <I>vastly
 preferable.</I> Those who know the value of Christ and heaven will
 readily acknowledge it far better to be in heaven than to be in this
 world, to be with Christ than to be with any creature; for in this
 world we are compassed about with sin, born to trouble, born again to
 it; but, if we come to be with Christ, farewell sin and temptation,
 farewell sorrow and death, for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His judgment was rather to live awhile longer in this world, for the 
 service of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</I> It 
 is needful for the church to have ministers; and faithful ministers can 
 ill be spared when the <I>harvest is plenteous and the labourers are 
 few.</I> Observe, Those who have most reason to desire to depart should 
 be willing to continue in the world as long as God has any work for 
 them to do. Paul's strait was not between living in this world and 
 living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison: but his 
 strait was between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in 
 another. Still it was Christ that his heart was upon: though, to 
 advance the interest of Christ and his church, he chose rather to tarry 
 here, where he met with oppositions and difficulties, and to deny 
 himself for awhile the satisfaction of his reward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>And, having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and 
 continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Observe here, 

 1. What a great confidence Paul had in the divine Providence, that it 
 would order all for the best to him. "Having this confidence that it 
 will be needful for you that I should abide in the flesh, I know that I 
 shall abide." 

 2. Whatsoever is best for the church, we may be sure God will do. If we
 know what is needful for building up the body of Christ, we may 
 certainly know what will be; for he will take care of its interests, 
 and do what is best, all things considered, in every condition it is 
 in. 

 3. Observe what ministers are continued for: <I>For our furtherance and
 joy of faith,</I> our further advancement in holiness and comfort.

 4. What promotes our <I>faith and joy of faith</I> is very much for our
 furtherance in the way to heaven. The more faith the more joy, and the
 more faith and joy the more we are furthered in our Christian course.

 5. There is need of a settled ministry, not only for the conviction and
 conversion of sinners, but for the edification of saints, and their 
 furtherance in spiritual attainments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for 
 me, by my coming to you again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They rejoiced in the hope of seeing him, and enjoying his further 
 labours among them. Observe, 

 1. The continuance of ministers with the church ought to be the
 rejoicing of all who wish well to the church, and to its interests. 

 2. All our joys should terminate in Christ. Our joy in good ministers
 should be our joy <I>in Christ Jesus for them;</I> for they are but the 
 <I>friends of the bridegroom,</I> and are to be received in his name, 
 and for his sake.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
 Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may
 hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one
 mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
 &nbsp; 28  And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to
 them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and
 that of God.
 &nbsp; 29  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only
 to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
 &nbsp; 30  Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear
 <I>to be</I> in me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle concludes the chapter with two exhortations:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He exhorts them to strictness of conversation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Only let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ.</I> 
 Observe, Those who profess the gospel of Christ should have their 
 conversation as becomes the gospel, or in a suitableness and 
 agreeableness to it. Let it be as becomes those who believe gospel
 truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel promises; and 
 with an answerable faith, holiness, and comfort. Let it be in all 
 respects as those who belong to the kingdom of God among men, and are 
 members and subjects of it. It is an ornament to our profession when 
 our conversation is of a piece with it.--<I>That whether I come and see 
 you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs.</I> He had spoken 
 in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>

 of his coming to them again, and had spoken it with some assurance, 
 though he was now a prisoner; but he would not have them build upon 
 that. Our religion must not be bound up in the hands of our ministers: 
 "Whether I come or no, let me hear well of you, and do you stand fast." 
 Whether ministers come or no, Christ is always at hand. He is nigh to 
 us, never far from us; and hastens his second coming. <I>The coming of 
 the Lord draws nigh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:8">James v. 8</A>.

 Let me hear of you <I>that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind
 striving together for the faith of the gospel.</I> Three things he 
 desired to hear of them; and they are all such as become the gospel:--

 1. It becomes those who profess the gospel to strive for it, to use a
 holy violence in taking the kingdom of heaven. The <I>faith of the
 gospel</I> is the doctrine of faith, <I>or</I> the religion of the 
 gospel. There is that in the faith of the gospel which is worth 
 striving for. If religion is worth any thing, it is worth every thing. 
 There is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may 
 sleep and go to hell; but he who will go to heaven must look about him 
 and be diligent. 

 2. The unity and unanimity of Christians become the gospel: <I>Strive
 together,</I> not strive one with another; all of you must strive 
 against the common adversary. One spirit and one mind become the 
 gospel; for <I>there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism.</I> There may 
 be a oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is 
 diversity of judgment and apprehensions about many things. 

 3. Stedfastness becomes the gospel: <I>Stand fast in one spirit, with
 one mind.</I> Be <I>stedfast and immovable</I> by any opposition. It is 
 a shame to religion when the professors of it are off and on, unfixed 
 in their minds, and unstable as water; for they will never excel. Those 
 who would strive for the faith of the gospel must stand firm to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He exhorts them to courage and constancy in suffering: <I>And in 
 nothing terrified by your adversaries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The professors of the gospel have all along met with adversaries, 
 especially at the first planting of Christianity. Our great care must 
 be to keep close to our profession, and be constant to it: whatever 
 oppositions we meet with, we must not be frightened at them, 
 considering that the condition of the persecuted is much better and 
 more desirable than the condition of the persecutors; for persecuting 
 is an <I>evident token of perdition.</I> Those who oppose the gospel of 
 Christ, and injure the professors of it, are marked out for ruin. But 
 being persecuted is a token of salvation. Not that it is a certain 
 mark; many hypocrites have suffered for their religion; but it is a 
 good sign that we are in good earnest in religion, and designed for 
 salvation, when we are enabled in a right manner to suffer for the 
 cause of Christ.--<I>For to you it is given on the behalf of Christ not 
 only to believe, but also to suffer for his name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Here are two precious gifts given, and both on the behalf of Christ:--

 1. To believe in him. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ, who
 purchased for us not only the blessedness which is the object of faith, 
 but the grace of faith itself: the ability or disposition to believe is 
 from God. 

 2. To suffer for the sake of Christ is a valuable gift too: it is a
 great honour and a great advantage; for we may be very serviceable to 
 the glory of God, which is the end of our creation, and encourage and 
 confirm the faith of others. And there is a great reward attending it 
 too: <I>Blessed are you when men shall persecute you, for great is your 
 reward in heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:11,12">Matt. v. 11, 12</A>.

 And, if <I>we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:12">2 Tim. ii. 12</A>.

 If we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon it a great
 gift, and prize it accordingly, always provided we behave under our 
 sufferings with the genuine temper of martyrs and confessors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 "<I>Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in 
 me;</I> that is, suffering in the same manner as you saw and now hear 
 of me that I suffer." It is not simply the suffering, but the cause, 
 and not only the cause, but the spirit, which makes the martyr. A man
 may suffer in a bad cause, and then he suffers justly; or in a good 
 cause, but with a wrong mind, and then his sufferings lose their 
 value.</P>
