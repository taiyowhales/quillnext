 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having at large cleared and confirmed the prime 
 fundamental doctrines of Christianity, comes in the next place to press 
 the principal duties. We mistake our religion if we look upon it only 
 as a system of notions and a guide to speculation. No, it is a 
 practical religion, that tends to the right ordering of the 
 conversation. It is designed not only to inform our judgments, but to 
 reform our hearts and lives. From the method of the apostle's writing 
 in this, as in some other of the epistles (as from the management of 
 the principal ministers of state in Christ's kingdom) the stewards of 
 the mysteries of God may take direction how to divide the word of 
 truth: not to press duty abstracted from privilege, nor privilege
 abstracted from duty; but let both go together, with a complicated 
 design, they will greatly promote and befriend each other. The duties 
 are drawn from the privileges, by way of inference. The foundation of 
 Christian practice must be laid in Christian knowledge and faith. We 
 must first understand how we receive Christ Jesus the Lord, and then we 
 shall know the better how to walk in him. There is a great deal of duty 
 prescribed in this chapter. The exhortations are short and pithy, 
 briefly summing up what is good, and what the Lord our God in Christ 
 requires of us. It is an abridgment of the Christian directory, an 
 excellent collection of rules for the right ordering of the
 conversation, as becomes the gospel. It is joined to the foregoing 
 discourse by the word "therefore." It is the practical application of 
 doctrinal truths that is the life of preaching. He had been discoursing 
 at large of justification by faith, and of the riches of free grace, 
 and the pledges and assurances we have of the glory that is to be 
 revealed. Hence carnal libertines would be apt to infer."Therefore we 
 may live as we list, and walk in the way of our hearts and the sight of 
 our eyes." Now this does not follow; the faith that justifies is a 
 faith that "works by love." And there is no other way to heaven but the 
 way of holiness and obedience. Therefore what God hath joined together 
 let no man put asunder. The particular exhortations of this chapter are 
 reducible to the three principal heads of Christian duty: our duty to 
 God t ourselves, and to our brother. The grace of God teaches us, in 
 general, to live "godly, soberly, and righteously;" and to deny all 
 that which is contrary hereunto. Now this chapter will give us to 
 understand what godliness, sobriety, and righteousness, are though 
 somewhat intermixed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
 that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
 unto God, <I>which is</I> your reasonable service.
 &nbsp; 2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
 the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <I>is</I> that good,
 and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
 &nbsp; 3  For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that
 is among you, not to think <I>of himself</I> more highly than he ought
 to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
 every man the measure of faith.
 &nbsp; 4  For as we have many members in one body, and all members have
 not the same office:
 &nbsp; 5  So we, <I>being</I> many, are one body in Christ, and every one
 members one of another.
 &nbsp; 6  Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
 given to us, whether prophecy, <I>let us prophesy</I> according to the
 proportion of faith;
 &nbsp; 7  Or ministry, <I>let us wait</I> on <I>our</I> ministering: or he that
 teacheth, on teaching;
 &nbsp; 8  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <I>let
 him do it</I> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he
 that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Let</I> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is
 evil; cleave to that which is good.
 &nbsp; 10  <I>Be</I> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;
 in honour preferring one another;
 &nbsp; 11  Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
 Lord;
 &nbsp; 12  Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing
 instant in prayer;
 &nbsp; 13  Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to
 hospitality.
 &nbsp; 14  Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
 &nbsp; 15  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that
 weep.
 &nbsp; 16  <I>Be</I> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high
 things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your
 own conceits.
 &nbsp; 17  Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in
 the sight of all men.
 &nbsp; 18  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
 with all men.
 &nbsp; 19  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <I>rather</I> give
 place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <I>is</I> mine; I will
 repay, saith the Lord.
 &nbsp; 20  Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
 give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on
 his head.
 &nbsp; 21  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, according to the scheme mentioned in the contents, 
 the apostle's exhortations,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning our duty to God, We see what is godliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is to surrender ourselves to God, and so to lay a good 
 foundation. We must first give our own selves unto the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2 Cor. viii. 5</A>.
 
 This is here pressed as the spring of all duty and obedience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Man consists of body and soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7,Ec+12:7">Gen. ii. 7; Eccl. xii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The body must be presented to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>The body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13,14">1 Cor. vi. 13, 14</A>.

 The exhortation is here introduced very pathetically: <I>I beseech you,
 brethren.</I> Though he was a great apostle, yet he calls the meanest
 Christians <I>brethren,</I> a term of affection and concern. He uses
 entreaty; this is the gospel way: <I>As though God did beseech you by
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:20">2 Cor. v. 20</A>.

 Though he might with authority command, yet for love's sake he rather 
 beseeches,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:8,9">Philem. 8, 9</A>.

 The <I>poor useth entreaty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:23">Prov. xviii. 23</A>.

 This is to insinuate the exhortation, that it might come with the more 
 pleasing power. Many are sooner wrought upon if they be accosted 
 kindly, are more easily led than driven. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The duty pressed--to present our <I>bodies a living sacrifice,</I>
 alluding to the sacrifices under the law, which were presented or set 
 before God at the altar, ready to be offered to him. <I>Your 
 bodies</I>--your whole selves; so expressed because under the law the
 bodies of beasts were offered in sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:20">1 Cor. vi. 20</A>.

 Our bodies and spirits are intended. The offering was sacrificed by the
 priest, but presented by the offerer, who transferred to God all his 
 right, title, and interest in it, by laying his hand on the head of it. 
 Sacrifice is here taken for whatsoever is by God's own appointment 
 dedicated to himself; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 We are temple, priest, and sacrifice, as Christ was in his peculiar
 sacrificing. There were sacrifices of atonement and sacrifices of 
 acknowledgment. Christ, who was once offered to bear the sins of many, 
 is the only sacrifice of atonement; but our persons and performances, 
 tendered to God through Christ our priest, are as sacrifices of 
 acknowledgment to the honour of God. Presenting them denotes a 
 voluntary act, done by virtue of that absolute despotic power which the 
 will has over the body and all the members of it. It must be a 
 free-will offering. Your bodies; not your beasts. Those legal 
 offerings, as they had their power from Christ, so they had their 
 period in Christ. The presenting of the body to God implies not only 
 the avoiding of the sins that are committed with or against the body, 
 but the using of the body as a servant of the soul in the service of 
 God. It is to <I>glorify God with our bodies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:20">1 Cor. vi. 20</A>),

 to engage our bodies in the duties of immediate worship, and in a 
 diligent attendance to our particular callings, and be willing to 
 suffer for God with our bodies, when we are called to it. It is to 
 yield the members of our bodies as instruments of righteousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>.

 Though bodily exercise alone profits little, yet in its place it is a
 proof and product of the dedication of our souls to God. <I>First,</I> 
 Present them a living sacrifice; not killed, as the sacrifices under 
 the law. A Christian makes his body a sacrifice to God, though he does 
 not give it to be burned. A body sincerely devoted to God is a living 
 sacrifice. A living sacrifice, by way of allusion--that which was dead 
 of itself might not be eaten, much less sacrificed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:21">Deut. xiv. 21</A>;

 and by ways of opposition--"The sacrifice was to be slain, but you may
 be sacrificed, and yet live on"--an unbloody sacrifice. The barbarous 
 heathen sacrificed their children to their idol-gods, not living, but 
 slain sacrifices: but God will have mercy, and not such sacrifice, 
 though life is forfeited to him. A <I>living</I> sacrifice, that is, 
 inspired with the spiritual life of the soul. It is Christ living in 
 the soul by faith that makes the body a living sacrifice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:20">Gal. ii. 20</A>.

 Holy love kindles the sacrifices, puts life into the duties; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>.

 <I>Alive,</I> that is, to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> They must be holy. There is a relative holiness in 
 every sacrifice, as dedicated to God. But, besides this, there must be 
 that real holiness which consists in an entire rectitude of heart and 
 life, by which we are conformed in both to the nature and will of God: 
 even our bodies must not be made the instruments of sin and 
 uncleanness, but set apart for God, and put to holy uses, as the 
 vessels of the tabernacle were holy, being devoted to God's service. It 
 is the soul that is the proper subject of holiness; but a sanctified 
 soul communicates a holiness to the body it actuates and animates. That 
 is holy which is according to the will of God; when the bodily actions 
 are no, the body is holy. They are the <I>temples of the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19">1 Cor. vi. 19</A>.

 <I>Possess the body in sanctification,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:4,5">1 Thess. iv. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The arguments to enforce this, which are three:--<I>First,</I>
 Consider the mercies of God: <I>I beseech you by the mercies of 
 God.</I> An affectionate obtestation, and which should melt us into a 
 compliance: <B><I>dia ton oiktirmon tou Theou.</I></B> This is an 
 argument most sweetly cogent. There is the mercy that is in God and the 
 mercy that is from God--mercy in the spring and mercy in the streams:
 both are included here; but especially gospel-mercies (mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-36"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>),

 the transferring of what the Jews forfeited and lost by their unbelief
 unto us Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:4-6">Eph. iii. 4-6</A>):
 
 the sure mercies of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>.

 God is a merciful God, therefore let us present our bodies to him; he
 will be sure to use them kindly, and knows how to consider the frames 
 of them, for he is of infinite compassion. We receive from him every 
 day the fruits of his mercy, particularly mercy to our bodies: he made 
 them, he maintains them, he bought them, he has put a great dignity 
 upon them. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, that
 our souls are held in life; and the greatest mercy of all is that 
 Christ hath made not his body only, but his soul, an offering for sin, 
 that he gave himself for us and gives himself to us. Now surely we
 cannot but be studying what we shall render to the Lord for all this. 
 And what shall we render? Let us render ourselves as an acknowledgment 
 of all these favours--all we are, all we have, all we can do; and, 
 after all, it is but very poor returns for very rich receivings: and 
 yet, because it is what we have, <I>Secondly,</I> It is <I>acceptable 
 to God.</I> The great end we should all labour after is to be accepted 
 of the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:9">2 Cor. v. 9</A>),

 to have him well-pleased with our persons and performances. Now these
 living sacrifices are acceptable to God; while the sacrifices of the 
 wicked, though fat and costly, are an abomination to the Lord. It is 
 God's great condescension that he will vouchsafe to accept of any thing 
 in us; and we can desire no more to make us happy; and, if the 
 presenting of ourselves will but please him, we may easily conclude 
 that we cannot bestow ourselves better. <I>Thirdly,</I> It is our 
 <I>reasonable service.</I> There is an act of reason in it; for it is 
 the soul that presents the body. Blind devotion, that has ignorance
 for the mother and nurse of it, is fit to be paid only to those 
 dunghill-gods that have eyes and see not. Our God must be served in
 the spirit and with the understanding. There is all the reason in the 
 world for it, and no good reason can possibly be produced against it.
 <I>Come now, and let us reason together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>.

 God does not impose upon us any thing hard or unreasonable, but that
 which is altogether agreeable to the principles of right reason.
 <B><I>Ten logiken latreian hymon</I></B>--<I>your service according to 
 the word;</I> so it may be read. The word of God does not leave out the 
 body in holy worship. That service only is acceptable to God which is 
 according to the written word. It must be gospel worship, spiritual 
 worship. That is a reasonable service which we are able and ready to 
 give a reason for, in which we understand ourselves. God deals with us 
 as with rational creatures, and will have us so to deal with him. Thus
 must the body be presented to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The mind must be renewed for him. This is pressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Be you transformed by the renewing of your mind;</I> see to it that 
 there be a saving change wrought in you, and that it be carried on." 
 Conversion and sanctification are the renewing of the mind, a change 
 not of the substance, but of the qualities of the soul. It is the same 
 with making a new heart and a new spirit--new dispositions and 
 inclinations, new sympathies and antipathies; the understanding 
 enlightened, the conscience softened, the thoughts rectified; the will 
 bowed to the will of God, and the affections made spiritual and 
 heavenly: so that the man is not what he was--old things are passed 
 away, all things are become new; he acts from new principles, by new 
 rules, with new designs. The mind is the acting ruling part of us; so 
 that the renewing of the mind is the renewing of the whole man, for out 
 of it are the <I>issues of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:23">Prov. iv. 23</A>.

 The progress of sanctification, dying to sin more and more and living 
 to righteousness more and more, is the carrying on of this renewing 
 work, till it be perfected in glory. This is called the 
 <I>transforming</I> of us; it is like putting on a new shape and 
 figure. <B><I>Metamorphousthe</I></B>--<I>Be you metamorphosed.</I>
 The transfiguration of Christ is expressed by this word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:2">Matt. xvii. 2</A>),

 when he put on a heavenly glory, which made his face to shine like the 
 sun; and the same word is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>,

 where we are said to be <I>changed into the same image from glory to 
 glory.</I> This transformation is here pressed as a duty; not that we
 can work such a change ourselves: we could as soon make a new world as
 make a new heart by any power of our own; it is God's work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:19,36:26,27">Ezek. xi. 19; xxxvi. 26, 27</A>.

 But <I>be you transformed,</I> that is, "use the means which God hath 
 appointed and ordained for it." It is God that turns us, and then we 
 are turned; but we must <I>frame our doings to turn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:4">Hos. v. 4</A>.

 "Lay your souls under the changing transforming influences of the
 blessed Spirit; seek unto God for grace in the use of all the means of 
 grace." Though the new man be created of God, yet we must put it on

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:24">Eph. iv. 24</A>),

 and be pressing forward towards perfection. Now in this verse we may
 further observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What is the great enemy to this renewing, which we must avoid; and 
 that is, conformity to this world: <I>Be not conformed to this 
 world.</I> All the disciples and followers of the Lord Jesus must be 
 nonconformists to this world. <B><I>Me syschematizesthe</I></B>--<I>Do
 not fashion yourselves</I> according to the world. We must not conform 
 to the things of the world; they are mutable, and the fashion of them 
 is passing away. Do not conform either to the lusts of the flesh or the 
 lusts of the eye. We must not conform to the men of the world, of that 
 world which lies in wickedness, not walk according <I>to the course of 
 this world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>);

 that is, we must not follow a multitude to do evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:2">Exod. xxiii. 2</A>.

 If sinners entice us, we must not consent to them, but in our places 
 witness against them. Nay, even in things indifferent, and which are 
 not in themselves sinful, we must so far not conform to the custom and 
 way of the world as not to act by the world's dictates as our chief 
 rule, nor to aim at the world's favours as our highest end. True 
 Christianity consists much in a sober singularity. Yet we must take
 heed of the extreme of affected rudeness and moroseness, which some run 
 into. In civil things, the light of nature and the custom of nations 
 are intended for our guidance; and the rule of the gospel in those 
 cases is a rule of direction, not a rule of contrariety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What is the great effect of this renewing, which we must labour 
 after: <I>That you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and 
 perfect will of God.</I> by the will of God here we are to understand 
 his revealed will concerning our duty, what the Lord our God requires 
 of us. This is the will of God in general, even our sanctification, 
 that will which we pray may be done by us as it is done by the angels; 
 especially his will as it is revealed in the New Testament, where he 
 hath in these last days spoken to us by his Son. <I>First,</I> The will 
 of God is <I>good, and acceptable, and perfect;</I> three excellent 
 properties of a law. It is good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:8">Mic. vi. 8</A>);

 it is exactly consonant to the eternal reason of good and evil. It is 
 good in itself. It is good for us. Some think the evangelical law is 
 here called good, in distinction from the ceremonial law, which 
 consisted of <I>statutes that were not good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:25">Ezek. xx. 25</A>.

 It is acceptable, it is pleasing to God; that and that only is so which
 is prescribed by him. The only way to attain his favour as the end is
 to conform to his will as the rule. It is perfect, to which nothing
 can be added. The revealed will of God is a sufficient rule of faith
 and practice, containing all things which tend to the perfection of the
 man of God, to furnish us thoroughly to every good work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16,17">2 Tim. iii. 16, 17</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That it concerns Christians to prove what is that will
 of God which is good, and acceptable, and perfect; that is, to know it 
 with judgment and approbation, to know it experimentally, to know the 
 excellency of the will of God by the experience of a conformity to it.
 It is to approve <I>things that are excellent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:10">Phil. i. 10</A>);

 it is <B><I>dokimazein</I></B> (the same word that is used here) <I>to
 try</I> things that differ, in doubtful cases readily to apprehend what 
 the will of God is and to close in with it. It is to be <I>of quick 
 understanding in the fear of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3">Isa. xi. 3</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That those are best able to prove what is the good, and
 acceptable, and perfect will of God, who are transformed by the 
 renewing of their mind. A living principle of grace is in the soul, as
 far as it prevails, an unbiassed unprejudiced judgment concerning the 
 things of God. It disposes the soul to receive and entertain the 
 revelations of the divine will. The promise is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>),

 <I>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine.</I> A 
 good wit can dispute and distinguish about the will of God; while an 
 honest, humble heart, that has spiritual senses exercised, and is 
 delivered into the mould of the word, loves it, and practises it, and 
 has the relish and savour of it. Thus to be godly is to surrender
 ourselves to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When this is done, to serve him in all manner of gospel obedience. 
 Some hints of this we have here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 <I>Serving the Lord.</I> Wherefore do we present ourselves to him, but 
 that we may serve him?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:23">Acts xxvii. 23</A>,

 <I>Whose I am;</I> and then it follows, <I>whom I serve.</I> To be
 religious is to serve God. How? 

 (1.) We must make a business of it, and not be slothful in that 
 business. <I>Not slothful in business.</I> There is the business of the 
 world, that of our particular calling, in which we must not be 
 slothful,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:11">1 Thess. iv. 11</A>.

 But this seems to be meant of the business of serving the Lord, our
 Father's business,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:49">Luke ii. 49</A>.

 Those that would approve themselves Christians indeed must make
 religion their business--must choose it, and learn it, and give 
 themselves to it; they must love it, and employ themselves in it, and 
 abide by it, as their great and main business. And, having made it our
 business, we must not be slothful in it: not desire our own ease, and 
 consult that, when it comes in competition with our duty. We must not 
 drive on slowly in religion. Slothful servants will be reckoned with us 
 wicked servants. 

 (2.) We must be <I>fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.</I> God must be 
 served with the spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9,Joh+4:24"><I>ch.</I> i. 9; John iv. 24</A>),

 under the influences of the Holy Spirit. Whatever we do in religion it
 is pleasing to God no further than it is done with our spirits wrought 
 upon by the Spirit of God. And there must be fervency in the spirit--a 
 holy zeal, and warmth, and ardency of affection in all we do, as those 
 that love God not only with the heart and soul, but with all our 
 hearts, and with all our souls. This is the holy fire that kindles the 
 sacrifice, and carries it up to heaven, an offering of a sweet-smelling 
 savour.--<I>Serving the Lord.</I> <B><I>To kairo douleuontes</I></B> 
 (so some copies read it), <I>serving the time,</I> that is, improving 
 your opportunities and making the best of them, complying with the 
 present seasons of grace. 

 (3.) <I>Rejoicing in hope.</I> God is worshipped and honoured by our 
 hope and trust in him, especially when we rejoice in that hope, take a 
 complacency in that confidence, which argues a great assurance of the 
 reality and a great esteem of the excellency of the good hoped for. 
 
 (4.) <I>Patient in tribulation.</I> Thus also God is served, not only 
 by working for him when he calls us to work, but by sitting still 
 quietly when he calls us to suffer. Patience for God's sake, and with
 an eye to his will and glory, is true piety. Observe, Those that 
 rejoice in hope are likely to be patient in tribulation. It is a 
 believing prospect of the joy set before us that bears up the spirit 
 under all outward pressure. 

 (5.) <I>Continuing instant in prayer.</I> Prayer is a friend to hope 
 and patience, and we do in it serve the Lord.
 <B><I>Proskarterountes.</I></B> It signifies both fervency and 
 perseverance in prayer. We should not be cold in the duty, nor soon 
 weary of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1,1Th+5:17,Eph+6:18,Col+4:2">Luke xviii. 1;
 1 Thess. v. 17; Eph. vi. 18; Col. iv. 2</A>.

 This is our duty which immediately respects God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning our duty which respects ourselves; this is sobriety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A sober opinion of ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is ushered in with a solemn preface: <I>I say, through the grace 
 given unto me:</I> the grace f wisdom, by which he understood the 
 necessity and excellency of this duty; the grace of apostleship, by 
 which he had authority to press and enjoin it. "I say it, who am 
 commissioned to say it, in God's name. I say it, and it is not for you 
 to gainsay it." It is said to every one of us, one as well as another. 
 Pride is a sin that is bred in the bone of all of us, and we have 
 therefore each of us need to be cautioned and armed against it.--<I>Not 
 to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.</I> We must 
 take heed of having too great an opinion of ourselves, or putting too 
 high a valuation upon our own judgments, abilities, persons, 
 performances. We must not be self-conceited, nor esteem too much our 
 own wisdom and other attainments, not think ourselves to be something, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:3">Gal. vi. 3</A>.

 There is a high thought of ourselves which we may and must have to
 think ourselves too good to be the slaves of sin and drudges to this 
 world. But, on the other hand, we should think soberly, that is, we 
 must have a low and modest opinion of ourselves and our own abilities, 
 our gifts and graces, according to what we have received from God, and 
 not otherwise. We must not be confident and hot in matters of doubtful 
 disputation; not stretch ourselves beyond our line; not judge and 
 censure those that differ from us; not desire to make a fair show in 
 the flesh. These and the like are the fruits of a sober opinion of 
 ourselves. The words will bear yet another sense agreeable enough. 
 <I>Of himself</I> is not in the original; therefore it may be read, 
 <I>That no man be wise above what he ought to be wise, but be wise unto 
 sobriety.</I> We must not exercise ourselves in things too high for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+131:1,2">Ps. cxxxi. 1, 2</A>),

 not intrude into those things which we have not seen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col. ii. 18</A>),

 those secret things which belong not to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29">Deut. xxix. 29</A>),

 not covet to be wise above what is written. There is a knowledge that 
 puffs up, which reaches after forbidden fruit. We must take heed of 
 this, and labour after that knowledge which tends to sobriety, to the 
 rectifying of the heart and the reforming of the life. Some understand 
 it of the sobriety which keeps us in our own place and station, from 
 intruding into the gifts and offices of others. See an instance of this 
 sober modest care in the exercise of the greatest spiritual gifts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:13-15">2 Cor. x. 13-15</A>.

 To this head refers also that exhortation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>Be not wise in your own conceits.</I> It is good to be wise, but it 
 is bad to think ourselves so; for there is more hope of a fool than of 
 him that is wise in his own eyes. It was an excellent thing for Moses 
 to have his face shine and not know it. Now the reasons why we must 
 have such a sober opinion of ourselves, our own abilities and 
 attainments, are these:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because whatever we have that is good, <I>God hath dealt</I> it to 
 us; every good and perfect gift <I>comes from above,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">James i. 17</A>.
 
 What have we that we have not received? And, if we have received it,
 why then do we boast? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:7">1 Cor. iv. 7</A>.

 The best and most useful man in the world is no more, no better, than
 what the free grace of God makes him every day. When we are thinking of 
 ourselves, we must remember to think not how we attained, as though our 
 might and the power of our hand had gotten us these gifts; but think 
 how kind God hath been to us, for it is he that gives us power to do 
 any thing that is good, and in him is all our sufficiency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because God deals out his gifts in a certain measure: According to 
 <I>the measure of faith.</I> Observe, The measure of spiritual gifts he 
 calls the measure of faith, for this is the radical grace. What we have 
 and do that is good is so far right and acceptable as it is founded in 
 faith, and flows from faith, and no further. Now faith, and other 
 spiritual gifts with it, are dealt by measure, according as Infinite 
 Wisdom sees meet for us. Christ had the Spirit given him without 
 measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">John iii. 34</A>.

 But the saints have it by measure; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:7">Eph. iv. 7</A>.

 Christ, who had gifts without measure, was meek and lowly; and shall
 we, that are stinted, be proud and self-conceited?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Because God has dealt out gifts to others as well as to us: 
 <I>Dealt to every man.</I> Had we the monopoly of the Spirit, or a 
 patent to be sole proprietors of spiritual gifts, there might be some 
 pretence for this conceitedness of ourselves; but others have their 
 share as well as we. God is a common Father, and Christ a common root, 
 to all the saints, who all drive virtue from him; and therefore it ill 
 becomes us to lift up ourselves, and to despise others, as if we only 
 were the people in favour with heaven, and wisdom should die with us. 
 This reasoning he illustrates by a comparison taken from the members of
 the natural body (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:12,Eph+4:16">1 Cor. xii. 12; Eph. iv. 16</A>):

 <I>As we have many members in one body,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Here observe, 

 [1.] All the saints make up one body in Christ, who is the head of the 
 body, and the common centre of their unity. Believers lie not in the 
 world as a confused disorderly heap, but are organized and knit 
 together, as they are united to one common head, and actuated and 
 animated by one common Spirit. 

 [2.] Particular believers are members of this body, constituent parts, 
 which speak them less than the whole, and in relation to the whole, 
 deriving life and spirits from the head. Some members in the body are 
 bigger and more useful than others, and each receives spirits from the 
 head according to its proportion. If the little finger should receive
 as much nourishment as the leg, how unseemly and prejudicial would it 
 be! We must remember that we are not the whole; we think above what is 
 meet if we think so; we are but parts and members. 

 [3.] All <I>the members have not the same office</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but each hath its respective place and work assigned it. The office of 
 the eye is to see, the office of the hand is to work, &c. So in the 
 mystical body, some are qualified for, and called to, one sort of work; 
 others are, in like manner, fitted for, and called to, another sort of 
 work. Magistrates, ministers, people, in a Christian commonwealth, have 
 their several offices, and must not intrude one upon another, nor clash 
 in the discharge of their several offices. 

 [4.] Each member hath its place and office, for the good and benefit of 
 the whole, and of every other member. We are not only members of 
 Christ, but we are <I>members one of another,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 We stand in relation one to another; we are engaged to do all the good 
 we can one to another, and to act in conjunction for the common 
 benefit. See this illustrated at large,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:14">1 Cor. xii. 14</A>,

 &c. Therefore we must not be puffed up with a conceit of our own
 attainments, because, whatever we have, as we received it, so we 
 received it not for ourselves, but for the good of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A sober use of the gifts that God hath given us. As we must not on 
 the one hand be proud of our talents, so on the other hand we must not 
 bury them. Take heed lest, under a pretence of humility and 
 self-denial, we be slothful in laying out ourselves for the good of 
 others. We must not say, "I am nothing, therefore I will sit still, and 
 do nothing;" but, "I am nothing in myself, and therefore I will lay out 
 myself to the utmost in the strength of the grace of Christ." He 
 specifies the ecclesiastical offices appointed in particular churches, 
 in the discharge of which each must study to do his own duty, for the 
 preserving of order and the promotion of edification in the church, 
 each knowing his place and fulfilling it. <I>Having then gifts.</I> The 
 following induction of particulars supplies the sense of this general. 
 <I>Having gifts,</I> let us use them. Authority and ability for the 
 ministerial work are the gift of God.--<I>Gifts differing.</I> The
 immediate design is different, though the ultimate tendency of all is 
 the same. <I>According to the grace,</I> <B><I>charismata kata ten 
 charin.</I></B> The free grace of God is the spring and original of all 
 the gifts that are given to men. It is grace that appoints the office, 
 qualifies and inclines the person, works both to will and to do. There 
 were in the primitive church extraordinary gifts of tongues, of 
 discerning, of healing; but he speaks here of those that are ordinary. 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4,1Ti+4:14,1Pe+4:10">1 Cor. xii. 4; 
 1 Tim. iv. 14; 1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 Seven particular gifts he specifies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>),

 which seem to be meant of so many distinct offices, used by the
 prudential constitution of many of the primitive churches, especially 
 the larger. There are two general ones here expressed by prophesying 
 and ministering, the former the work of the bishops, the latter the 
 work of the deacons, which were the only two standing officers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:1">Phil. i. 1</A>.

 But the particular work belonging to each of these might be, and it 
 should seem was, divided and allotted by common consent and agreement, 
 that it might be done the more effectually, because that which is every 
 body's work is nobody's work, and he despatches his business best that 
 is <I>vir unius negotii--a man of one business.</I> Thus David sorted 
 the Levites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:4,5">1 Chron. xxiii. 4, 5</A>),

 and in this wisdom is profitable to direct. The five latter will
 therefore be reduced to the two former.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Prophecy. Whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the 
 proportion of faith.</I> It is not meant of the extraordinary gifts of 
 foretelling things to come, but the ordinary office of preaching the 
 word: so <I>prophesying</I> is taken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:1-3,11:4,1Th+5:20">1 Cor. xiv. 1-3, &c.; xi. 4;
 1 Thess. v. 20</A>.

 The work of the Old-Testament prophets was not only to foretel future
 things, but to warn the people concerning sin and duty, and to be their 
 remembrancers concerning that which they knew before. And thus gospel 
 preachers are prophets, and do indeed, as far as the revelation of the 
 word goes, foretel things to come. Preaching refers to the eternal 
 condition of the children of men, points directly at a future state. 
 Now those that preach the word must do it <I>according to the 
 proportion of faith</I>--<B><I>kata ten analogian tes pisteos,</I></B>
 that is, 

 [1.] As to the manner of our prophesying, it must be according to the 
 proportion of the grace of faith. He had spoken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 of the measure of faith dealt to every man. Let him that preaches set 
 all the faith he hath on work, to impress the truths he preaches upon 
 his own heart in the first place. As people cannot hear well, so 
 ministers cannot preach well, without faith. First believe and then
 speak, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:10,2Co+4:13">Ps. cxvi. 10; 2 Cor. iv. 13</A>.

 And we must remember the proportion of faith--that, though all men have 
 not faith, yet a great many have besides ourselves; and therefore we 
 must allow others to have a share of knowledge and ability to instruct, 
 as well as we, even those that in less things differ from us. "<I>Hast 
 thou faith? Have it to thyself;</I> and do not make it a ruling rule to 
 others, remembering that thou hast but thy proportion." 

 [2.] As to the matter of our prophesying, it must be according to the 
 proportion of the doctrine of faith, as it is revealed in the holy 
 scriptures of the Old and New Testament. By this rule of faith the 
 Bereans tried Paul's preaching,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:11">Acts xvii. 11</A>.

 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22,Ga+1:9">Acts xxvi. 22; Gal. i. 9</A>.

 There are some staple-truths, as I may call them, some <I>prima
 axiomata--first axioms,</I> plainly and uniformly taught in the 
 scripture, which are the touchstone of preaching, by which (though we 
 must not despise prophesying) we must <I>prove all things,</I> and then 
 <I>hold fast that which is good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:20,21">1 Thess. v. 20, 21</A>.

 Truths that are more dark must be examined by those that are more
 clear; and then entertained when they are found to agree and comport 
 with the analogy of faith; for it is certain one truth can never 
 contradict another. See here what ought to be the great care of 
 preachers--to preach sound doctrine, according to the form of wholesome 
 words,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:8,2Ti+1:13">Tit. ii. 8; 2 Tim. i. 13</A>.

 It is not so necessary that the prophesying be according to the
 proportion of art, the rules of logic and rhetoric; but it is necessary 
 that it be according to the proportion of faith: for it is the word of 
 faith that we preach. Now there are two particular works which he that 
 prophesieth hath to mind--teaching and exhorting, proper enough to be 
 done by the same person at the same time, and when he does the one let 
 him mind that, when he does the other let him do that too as well as he 
 can. If, by agreement between the ministers of a congregation, this 
 work be divided, either constantly or interchangeably, so that one 
 teaches and the other exhorts (that is, in our modern dialect, one 
 expounds and the other preaches), let each do his work according to the 
 proportion of faith. <I>First,</I> let him that teacheth wait on 
 teaching. Teaching is the bare explaining and proving of gospel truths, 
 without practical application, as in the expounding of the scripture.
 <I>Pastors and teachers</I> are the same office 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>),

 but the particular work is somewhat different. Now he that has a 
 faculty of teaching, and has undertaken that province, let him stick to 
 it. It is a good gift, let him use it, and give his mind to it. <I>He 
 that teacheth, let him be in his teaching;</I> so some supply it, 
 <B><I>Ho didaskon, en te didaskalia.</I></B> Let him be frequent and 
 constant, and diligent in it; let him abide in that which is his proper 
 work, and be in it as his element. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:15,16">1 Tim. iv. 15, 16</A>,

 where it is explained by two words, <B><I>en toutois isthi,</I></B> and
 <B><I>epimene autois,</I></B> <I>be in these things</I> and <I>continue 
 in them. Secondly,</I> Let him that <I>exhorteth</I> wait <I>on
 exhortation.</I> Let him give himself to that. This is the work of the 
 pastor, as the former of the teacher; to apply gospel truths and rules 
 more closely to the case and condition of the people, and to press upon 
 them that which is more practical. Many that are very accurate in 
 teaching may yet be very cold and unskilful in exhorting; and on the 
 contrary. The one requires a clearer head, the other a warmer heart.
 Now where these gifts are evidently separated (that the one excels in 
 the one and the other in the other) it conduces to edification to 
 divide the work accordingly; and, whatsoever the work is that we 
 undertake, let us mind it. To wait on our work is to bestow the best of 
 our time and thoughts upon it, to lay hold of all opportunities for it, 
 and to study not only to do it, but to do it well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Ministry.</I> If a man hath <B><I>diakonian</I></B>--<I>the
 office of a deacon,</I> or assistant to the pastor and teacher, let him 
 use that office well--a churchwarden (suppose), an elder, or an overseer
 of the poor; and perhaps there were more put into these offices, and 
 there was more solemnity in them, and a greater stress of care and 
 business lay upon them in the primitive churches, than we are now well 
 aware of. It includes all those offices which concern the <B><I>ta 
 exo</I></B> of the church, <I>the outward business of the house of 
 God.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:16">Neh. xi. 16</A>.
 
 <I>Serving tables,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:2">Acts vi. 2</A>.

 Now let him on whom this care of ministering is devolved attend to it
 with faithfulness and diligence; particularly,

 [1.] <I>He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity.</I> Those 
 church-officers that were the stewards of the church's alms, collected 
 money, and distributed it according as the necessities of the poor 
 were. Let them do it <B><I>en aploteti</I></B>--<I>liberally</I> and 
 faithfully; not converting what they receive to their own use, nor 
 distributing it with any sinister design, or with respect of person: 
 not froward and peevish with the poor, nor seeking pretences to put 
 them by; but with all sincerity and integrity, having no other 
 intention in it than to glorify God and do good. Some understand it in 
 general of all almsgiving: He that hath wherewithal, let him give, and 
 give plentifully and liberally; so the word is translated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:2,9:13">2 Cor. viii. 2; ix. 13</A>.
 
 God loves a cheerful bountiful giver.

 [2.] <I>He that ruleth with diligence.</I> It should seem, he means
 those that were assistants to the pastors in exercising 
 church-discipline, as their eyes, and hands, and mouth, in the 
 government of the church, or those ministers that in the congregation 
 did chiefly undertake and apply themselves to this ruling work; for we 
 find those ruling that laboured in the word and doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17">1 Tim. v. 17</A>.
 
 Now such must do it with diligence. The word denotes both care and
 industry to discover what is amiss, to reduce those that go astray, to 
 reprove and admonish those that have fallen, to keep the church pure.
 Those must take a great deal of pains that will approve themselves 
 faithful in the discharge of this trust, and not let slip any 
 opportunity that may facilitate and advance that work.

 [3.] <I>He that showeth mercy with cheerfulness.</I> Some think it is 
 meant in general of all that in any thing show mercy: Let them be 
 willing to do it, and take a pleasure in it; God loves a cheerful 
 giver. But it seems to be meant of some particular church-officers, 
 whose work it was to take care of the sick and strangers; and those 
 were generally widows that were in this matter servants to the 
 church-deaconesses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:9,10">1 Tim. v. 9, 10</A>),

 though others, it is likely, might be employed. Now this must be done 
 with cheerfulness. A pleasing countenance in acts of mercy is a great 
 relief and comfort to the miserable; when they see it is not done 
 grudgingly and unwillingly, but with pleasant looks and gentle words, 
 and all possible indications of readiness and alacrity. Those that have 
 to do with such as are sick and sore, and commonly cross and peevish, 
 have need to put on not only patience, but cheerfulness, to make the 
 work the more easy and pleasant to them, and the more acceptable to 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning that part of our duty which respects our brethren, of 
 which we have many instances, in brief exhortations. Now all our duty 
 towards one another is summer up in one word, and that a sweet work, 
 <I>love.</I> In that is laid the foundation of all our mutual duty; and 
 therefore the apostle mentions this first, which is the livery of 
 Christ's disciples, and the great law of our religion: <I>Let love be 
 without dissimulation;</I> not in compliment and pretence, but in 
 reality; <I>not in word and tongue only,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:18">1 John iii. 18</A>.

 The right love is love unfeigned; not as the kisses of an enemy, which
 are deceitful. We should be glad of an opportunity to <I>prove the
 sincerity of our love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:8">2 Cor. viii. 8</A>.

 More particularly, there is a love owing to our friends, and to our
 enemies. He specifies both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To our friends. He that hath friends must show himself friendly. 
 There is a mutual love that Christians owe, and must pay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) An affectionate love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love,</I> 
 <B><I>philostorgoi</I></B>--it signifies not only love, but a readiness 
 and inclination to love, the most genuine and free affection, kindness 
 flowing out as from a spring. It properly denotes the love of parents
 to their children, which, as it is the most tender, so it is the most 
 natural, of any, unforced, unconstrained; such must our love be to one 
 another, and such it will be where there is a new nature and the law of 
 love is written in the heart. This kind affection puts us on to express 
 ourselves both in word and action with the greatest courtesy and 
 obligingness that may be.--<I>One to another.</I> This may recommend 
 the grace of love to us, that, as it is made our duty to love others, 
 so it is as much their duty to love us. And what can be sweeter on this 
 side heaven than to love and be beloved? He that thus watereth shall be 
 watered also himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A respectful love: <I>In honour preferring one another.</I> 
 Instead of contending for superiority, let us be forward to give to 
 others the pre-eminence. This is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:3">Phil. ii. 3</A>,

 <I>Let each esteem other better than themselves.</I> And there is this
 good reason for it, because, if we know our own hearts, we know more 
 evil by ourselves than we do by any one else in the world. We should be 
 forward to take notice of the gifts, and graces, and performances of 
 our brethren, and value them accordingly, be more forward to praise 
 another, and more pleased to hear another praised, than ourselves; 
 <B><I>te time allelous proegoumenoi</I></B>--<I>going before,</I> or 
 <I>leading one another in honour;</I> so some read it: not in taking 
 honour, but in giving honour. "Strive which of you shall be most 
 forward to pay respect to those to whom it is due, and to perform all 
 Christian offices of love (which are all included in the word honour) 
 to your brethren, as there is occasion. Let all your contention be
 which shall be most humble, and useful, and condescending." So the 
 sense is the same with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:14">Tit. iii. 14</A>,

 <I>Let them learn,</I> <B><I>proistasthai</I></B>--<I>to go before in
 good works.</I> For though we must prefer others (as our translation 
 reads it), and put on others, as more capable and deserving than 
 ourselves, yet we must not make that an excuse for our lying by and 
 doing nothing, nor under a pretence of honouring others, and their 
 serviceableness and performances, indulge ourselves in ease and 
 slothfulness. Therefore he immediately adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>Not slothful in business.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) A liberal love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Distributing to the necessities of saints.</I> It is but a mock love 
 which rests in the verbal expressions of kindness and respect, while 
 the wants of our brethren call for real supplies, and it is in the 
 power of our hands to furnish them. 

 [1.] It is no strange thing for saints in this world to want 
 necessaries for the support of their natural live. In those primitive 
 times prevailing persecutions must needs reduce many of the suffering 
 saints to great extremities; and still the poor, even the poor saints, 
 we have always with us. Surely the things of this world are not the 
 best things; if they were, the saints, who are the favourites of 
 heaven, would not be put off with so little of them. 

 [2.] It is the duty of those who have wherewithal to <I>distribute,</I> 
 or (as it might better be read) to <I>communicate</I> to those 
 necessities. It is not enough to draw out the soul, but we must draw 
 out the purse, to the hungry. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16,1Jo+3:17">Jam. ii. 15, 16; 1 John iii. 17</A>.

 <I>Communicating</I>--<B><I>koinonountes.</I></B> It intimates that our
 poor brethren have a kind of interest in that which God hath given us; 
 and that our reliving them should come from a sense and fellow-feeling 
 of their wants, as though we suffered with them. The charitable 
 benevolence of the Philippians to Paul is called their communicating 
 with his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:14">Phil. iv. 14</A>.

 We must be ready, as we have ability and opportunity, to relieve any
 that are in want; but we are in a special manner bound to communicate 
 to the saints. There is a common love owing to our fellow-creatures, 
 but a special love owing to our fellow-christians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:10">Gal. vi. 10</A>),

 <I>Especially to those who are of the household of faith. 
 Communicating,</I> <B><I>tais mneiais</I></B>--<I>to the memories</I> 
 of the saints; so some of the ancients read it, instead of <B><I>tais 
 chreiais.</I></B> There is a debt owing to the memory of those who 
 through faith and patience inherit the promises--to value it, to 
 vindicate it, to embalm it. Let the memory of the just be blessed; so 
 some read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:7">Prov. x. 7</A>.

 He mentions another branch of this bountiful love: <I>Given to 
 hospitality.</I> Those who have houses of their own should be ready to 
 entertain those who go about doing good, or who, for fear of 
 persecution, are forced to wander for shelter. They had not then so 
 much of the convenience of common inns as we have; or the wandering 
 Christians durst not frequent them; or they had not wherewithal to bear 
 the charges, and therefore it was a special kindness to bid them 
 welcome on free-cost. Nor is it yet an antiquated superseded duty; as 
 there is occasion, we must welcome strangers, for we know not the heart 
 of a stranger. <I>I was a stranger, and you took me in,</I> is 
 mentioned as one instance of the mercifulness of those that shall 
 obtain mercy: <B><I>ten philoxenian diokontes</I></B>--<I>following</I> 
 or <I>pursuing</I> hospitality. It intimates, not only that we must 
 take opportunity, but that we must seek opportunity, thus to show 
 mercy. As Abraham, who sat at the tent-door

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:1">Gen. xviii. 1</A>),

 and Lot, who sat in the gate of Sodom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:1">Gen. xix. 1</A>),

 expecting travellers, whom they might meet and prevent with a kind 
 invitation, and so they entertained angels unawares, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:2">Heb. xiii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) A sympathizing love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Rejoice with those that do rejoice, and weep with those that 
 weep.</I> Where there is a mutual love between the members of the 
 mystical body, there will be such a fellow-feeling. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:26">1 Cor. xii. 26</A>.

 True love will interest us in the sorrows and joys of one another, and
 teach us to make them our own. Observe the common mixture in this
 world, some rejoicing, and others weeping (as the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:12,13">Ezra iii. 12, 13</A>),

 for the trial, as of other graces, so of brotherly love and Christian
 sympathy. Not that we must participate in the sinful mirths or
 mournings of any, but only in just and reasonable joys and sorrows: not
 envying those that prosper, but rejoicing with them; truly glad that
 others have the success and comfort which we have not; not despising
 those that are in trouble, but concerned for them, and ready to help
 them, as being ourselves in the body. This is to do as God does, who
 not only has <I>pleasure in the prosperity of his servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:27">Ps. xxxv. 27</A>),
 
 but is likewise <I>afflicted in all their afflictions,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) A united love: "<I>Be of the same mind one towards another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that is, labour, as much as you can, to agree in apprehension; and, 
 wherein you come short of this, yet agree in affection; endeavour to be 
 all one, not affecting to clash, and contradict, and thwart one 
 another; but keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:2;3:15,16;1Co+1:10">Phil. ii. 2; iii. 15, 16;
 1 Cor. i. 10</A>;

 <B><I>to auto eis allelous phronountes</I></B>--<I>wishing the same
 good</I> to others that you do to yourselves;" so some understand it. 
 This is to love our brethren as ourselves, desiring their welfare as 
 our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) A condescending love: <I>Mind not high things, but condescend to 
 men of low estate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 True love cannot be without lowliness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1,2.Php+2:3">Eph. iv. 1, 2; Phil. ii. 3</A>.

 When our Lord Jesus washed his disciples' feet, to teach us brotherly 
 love

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:5,14:34">John xiii. 5; xiv. 34</A>),

 it was designed especially to intimate to us that to love one another
 aright is to be willing to stoop to the meanest offices of kindness for 
 the good of one another. Love is a condescending grace: <I>Non bene 
 conveniunt--majestas et amor--Majesty and love do but ill assort with 
 each other.</I> Observe how it is pressed here. 

 [1.] <I>Mind not high things.</I> We must not be ambitious of honour 
 and preferment, nor look upon worldly pomp and dignity with any 
 inordinate value or desire but rather with a holy contempt. When 
 David's advancements were high, his spirit was humble

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+131:1">Ps. cxxxi. 1</A>):

 <I>I do not exercise myself in great matters.</I> The Romans, living in 
 the imperial city, which reigned over the kings of the earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:18">Rev. xvii. 18</A>),

 and was at that time in the meridian of its splendour, were perhaps 
 ready to take occasion thence to think the better of themselves. Even 
 the holy seed were tainted with this leaven. Roman Christians, as some
 citizens do upon the country; and therefore the apostle so often 
 cautions them against high-mindedness; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 20</A>.

 They lived near the court, and conversed daily with the gaiety and
 grandeur of it: "Well," saith he, "do not mind it, be not in love with 
 it." 

 [2.] <I>Condescend to men of low estate</I>--<B><I>Tois tapeinois 
 synapagomenoi.</I></B> <I>First,</I> It may be meant of <I>mean 
 things,</I> to which we must condescend. If our condition in the world 
 be poor and low, our enjoyments coarse and scanty, our employments 
 despicable and contemptible, yet we must bring our minds to it, and 
 acquiesce in it. So the margin: <I>Be contented with mean things.</I> 
 Be reconciled to the place which God in his providence hath put us in, 
 whatever it be. We must account nothing below us but sin: stoop to mean 
 habitations, mean fare, mean clothing, mean accommodations when they 
 are our lot, and not grudge. Nay, we must be carried with a kind of 
 impetus, by the force of the new nature (so the word 
 <B><I>synapagomai</I></B> properly signifies, and it is very 
 significant), towards mean things, when God appoints us to them; as the 
 old corrupt nature is carried out towards high things. We must 
 accommodate ourselves to mean things. We should make a low condition 
 and mean circumstances more the centre of our desires than a high 
 condition. <I>Secondly,</I> It may be meant of <I>mean persons;</I> so 
 we read it (I think both are to be included) <I>Condescend to men of 
 low estate.</I> We must associate with, and accommodate ourselves to, 
 those that are poor and mean in the world, if they be such as fear God.
 David, though a king upon the throne, was a companion for all such,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:63">Ps. cxix. 63</A>.

 We need not be ashamed to converse with the lowly, while the great God
 overlooks heaven and earth to look at such. True love values grace in 
 rags as well as in scarlet. A jewel is a jewel, though it lie in the 
 dirt. The contrary to this condescension is reproved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1-4">Jam. ii. 1-4</A>.

 <I>Condescend;</I> that is, suit yourselves to them, stoop to them for
 their good; as Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>,

 &c. Some think the original word is a metaphor taken from travellers,
 when those that are stronger and swifter of foot stay for those that 
 are weak and slow, make a halt, and take them with them; thus must
 Christians be tender towards their fellow travellers. As a means to 
 promote this, he adds, <I>Be not wise in your own conceits;</I> to the 
 same purport with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We shall never find in our hearts to condescend to others while we find 
 there so great a conceit of ourselves: and therefore this must needs be 
 mortified. <B><I>Me ginesthe phronimoi par heautois</I></B>--"<I>Be
 not wise by yourselves,</I> be not confident of the sufficiency of your 
 own wisdom, so as to despise others, or think you have no need of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:7">Prov. iii. 7</A>),

 nor be shy of communicating what you have to others. We are members one 
 of another, depend upon one another, are obliged to one another; and 
 therefore, <I>Be not wise by yourselves,</I> remembering it is the 
 merchandise of wisdom that we profess; now merchandise consists in 
 commerce, receiving and returning."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) A love that engages us, as much as lies in us, <I>to live 
 peaceably with all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Even those with whom we cannot live intimately and familiarly, by 
 reason of distance in degree or profession, yet we must with such live 
 peaceably; that is, we must be harmless and inoffensive, not giving 
 others occasion to quarrel with us; and we must be gall-less and 
 unrevengeful, not taking occasion to quarrel with them. Thus must we 
 labour to preserve the peace, that it be not broken, and to piece it 
 again when it is broken. The wisdom from above is pure and peaceable. 
 Observe how the exhortation is limited. It is not expressed so as to 
 oblige us to impossibilities: <I>If it be possible, as much as lies in 
 you.</I> Thus 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:14">Heb. xii. 14</A>,

 <I>Follow peace.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:3">Eph. iv. 3</A>,

 <I>Endeavouring to keep.</I> Study the things that make for 
 peace.--<I>If it be possible.</I> It is not possible to preserve the 
 peace when we cannot do it without offending God and wounding 
 conscience: <I>Id possumus quod jure possumus--That is possible which 
 is possible without incurring blame.</I> The wisdom that is from above 
 is first pure and then peaceable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:17">Jam. iii. 17</A>.

 Peace without purity is the peace of the devil's palace.--<I>As much as
 lieth in you.</I> There must be two words to the bargain of peace. We 
 can but speak for ourselves. We may be unavoidably striven with; as 
 Jeremiah, who was a <I>man of contention</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10">Jer. xv. 10</A>),

 and this we cannot help; our care must be that nothing be wanting on
 our parts to preserve the peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>.

 I am for peace, though, when I speak, they are for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To our enemies. Since men became enemies to God, they have been 
 found very apt to be enemies one to another. Let but the centre of love 
 be once forsaken, and the lines will either clash and interfere, or be 
 at an uncomfortable distance. And, of all men, those that embrace 
 religion have reason to expect to meet with enemies in a world whose 
 smiles seldom concur with Christ's. Now Christianity teaches us how to 
 behave towards our enemies; and in this instruction it quite differs 
 from all other rules and methods, which generally aim at victory and 
 dominion; but this at inward peace and satisfaction. Whoever are our 
 enemies, that wish us ill and seek to do us ill, our rule is to do them 
 no hurt, but all the good we can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To do them no hurt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Recompense to no man evil for evil,</I> for that is a brutish 
 recompence, and befitting only those animals which are not conscious 
 either of any being above them or of any state before them. Or, if 
 mankind were made (as some dream) in a state of war, such recompences 
 as these were agreeable enough; but we have not so learned God, who 
 does so much for his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45">Matt. v. 45</A>),

 much less have we so learned Christ, who died for us when we were 
 enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:8,10"><I>ch.</I> v. 8, 10</A>),

 so loved that world which hated him without a cause.--"<I>To no
 man;</I> neither to Jew nor Greek; not to one that has been thy friend,
 for by recompensing evil for evil thou wilt certainly lose him; not to
 one that has been thine enemy, for by not recompensing evil for evil
 thou mayest perhaps gain him." To the same purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 <I>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves.</I> And why must this be 
 ushered in with such an affectionate compellation, rather than any 
 other of the exhortations of this chapter? Surely because this is
 intended for the composing of angry spirits, that are hot in the 
 resentment of a provocation. He addresses himself to such in this 
 endearing language, to mollify and qualify them. Any thing that 
 breathes love sweetens the blood, lays the storm, and cools the 
 intemperate heat. Would you pacify a brother offended? Call him dearly 
 beloved. Such a soft word, fitly spoken, may be effectual to turn away 
 wrath. <I>Avenge not yourselves;</I> that is, when any body has done 
 you any ill turn, do not desire nor endeavour to bring the like 
 mischief or inconvenience upon him. It is not forbidden to the
 magistrate to do justice to those that are wronged, by punishing the 
 wrong-doer; nor to make and execute just and wholesome laws against 
 malefactors; but it forbids private revenge, which flows from anger and 
 ill-will; and this is fitly forbidden, for it is presumed that we are 
 incompetent judges in our own case. Nay, if persons wronged in seeking 
 the defence of the law, and magistrates in granting it, act from any 
 particular personal pique or quarrel, and not from a concern that 
 public peace and order be maintained and right done, even such 
 proceedings, though seemingly regular, will fall under this prohibited 
 self-revenging. See how strict the law of Christ is in this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:38-40">Matt. v. 38-40</A>.

 It is forbidden not only to take it into our own hands to avenge
 ourselves, but to desire and thirst after event that judgment in our 
 case which the law affords, for the satisfying of a revengeful humour.
 This is a hard lesson to corrupt nature; and therefore he subjoins, 
 
 [1.] A remedy against it: <I>Rather give place unto wrath.</I> Not to 
 our own wrath; to give place to this is to give place to the devil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:26,27">Eph. iv. 26, 27</A>.

 We must resist, and stifle, and smother, and suppress this; but,
 <I>First,</I> To the wrath of our enemy. "Give place to it, that is, be
 of a yielding temper; do not answer wrath with wrath, but with love
 rather. <I>Yielding pacifies great offences,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4">Eccl. x. 4</A>.

 Receive affronts and injuries, as a stone is received into a heap of
 wool, which gives way to it, and so it does not rebound back, nor go 
 any further." So it explains that of our Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39">Matt. v. 39</A>),

 <I>Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
 also.</I> Instead of meditating how to revenge one wrong, prepare to 
 receive another. When men's passions are up, and the stream is strong, 
 let it have its course, lest by an unseasonable opposition it be made 
 to rage and swell the more. When others are angry, let us be calm; this 
 is a remedy against revenge, and seems to be the genuine sense. But, 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Many apply it to the wrath of God: "Give place to 
 this, make room for him to take the throne of judgment, and let him 
 alone to deal with thine adversary." 

 [2.] A reason against it: <I>For it is written, Vengeance is mine.</I> 
 We find it written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:35">Deut. xxxii. 35</A>.

 God is the sovereign King, the righteous Judge, and to him it belongs 
 to administer justice; for, being a God of infinite knowledge, by him 
 actions are weighed in unerring balances; and, being a God of infinite 
 purity, he hates sin and cannot endure to look upon iniquity. Some of 
 this power he hath trusted in the hands of the civil magistrates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6,Ro+13:4">Gen. ix. 6; <I>ch.</I> xiii. 4</A>);

 their legal punishments therefore are to be looked upon as a branch of
 God's revengings. This is a good reason why we should not avenge 
 ourselves; for, if vengeance be God's, then, <I>First,</I> We may not 
 do it. We step into the throne of God if we do and take his work out of 
 his hand. <I>Secondly,</I> We need not do it. For God will, if we
 meekly leave the matter with him; he will avenge us as far as there is 
 reason or justice for it, and further we cannot desire it. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:14,15">Ps. xxxviii. 14, 15</A>,

 <I>I heard not, for thou wilt hear;</I> and if God hears what need is
 there for me to hear?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We must not only not to hurt to our enemies, but our religion goes 
 higher, and teaches us to do them all the good we can. It is a command 
 peculiar to Christianity, and which does highly commend it: <I>Love 
 your enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44">Matt. v. 44</A>.

 We are here taught to show that love to them both in word and deed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In word: <I>Bless those who persecute you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It has been the common lot of God's people to be persecuted, either 
 with a powerful hand or with a spiteful tongue. Now we are here taught 
 to bless those that so persecute us. <I>Bless</I> them; that is, 
 <I>First,</I> "Speak well of them. If there be any thing in them that 
 is commendable and praiseworthy, take notice of it, and mention it to 
 their honour." <I>Secondly,</I> "Speak respectfully to them, according 
 as their place is, not rendering railing for railing, and bitterness 
 for bitterness." And, <I>Thirdly,</I> We must wish well to them, and 
 desire their good, so far from seeking any revenge. Nay, 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> We must offer up that desire to God, by prayer for 
 them. If it be not in the power of our hand to do any thing else for 
 them, yet we can testify our good-will by praying for them, for which 
 our master hath given us not only a rule, but an example to back that 
 rule,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:34">Luke xxiii. 34</A>--

 <I>Bless, and curse not.</I> It denotes a thorough good-will in all the
 instances and expressions of it; not, "bless them when you are at 
 prayer, and curse them at other times;" but, "bless them always, and 
 curse not at all." Cursing ill becomes the mouths of those whose work 
 it is to bless God, and whose happiness it is to be blessed of him.</P>

 [2.] In deed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>If thine enemy hunger,</I> as thou hast ability and opportunity, be 
 ready and forward to show him any kindness, and do him any office of 
 love for his good; and be never the less forward for his having been 
 thine enemy, but rather the more, that thou mayest thereby testify the 
 sincerity of thy forgiveness of him." It is said of archbishop Cranmer 
 that the way for a man to make him his friend was to do him an ill
 turn. The precept is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:21,22">Prov. xxv. 21, 22</A>;

 so that, high as it seems to be, the Old Testament was not a stranger 
 to it. Observe here, <I>First,</I> What we must do. We must do good to 
 our enemies. "<I>If he hunger,</I> do not insult over him, and say, Now 
 God is avenging me of him, and pleading my cause; do not make such a 
 construction of his wants. But <I>feed him." Then,</I> when he has need 
 of thy help, and thou hast an opportunity of starving him and trampling 
 upon him, then <I>feed him</I> (<B><I>psomize auton,</I></B> a 
 significant word)--"feed him abundantly, nay, feed him carefully and 
 indulgently:" <I>frustulatim pasce</I>--<I>feed him with small 
 pieces,</I> "feed him, as we do children and sick people, with much 
 tenderness. Contrive to do it so as to express thy love. <I>If he 
 thirst, give him drink:</I> <B><I>potize auton</I></B>--<I>drink to 
 him,</I> in token of reconciliation and friendship. So confirm your 
 love to him." <I>Secondly,</I> Why we must do this. Because in so doing 
 thou shalt heap <I>coals of fire on his head.</I> Two senses are given 
 of this, which I think are both to be taken in disjunctively. <I>Thou 
 shalt heap coals of fire on his head;</I> that is, "Thou shalt either," 
 
 1. "Melt him into repentance and friendship, and mollify his spirit
 towards thee" (alluding to those who melt metals; they not only put 
 fire under them, but heap fire upon them; thus Saul was melted and 
 conquered with the kindness of David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:16,26:21">1 Sam. xxiv. 16; xxvi. 21</A>)--

 "thou wilt win a friend by it, and if thy kindness have not that effect
 then," 

 2. "It will aggravate his condemnation, and make his malice against
 thee the more inexcusable. Thou wilt hereby hasten upon him the tokens 
 of God's wrath and vengeance." Not that this must be our intention in 
 showing him kindness, but, for our encouragement, such will be the 
 effect. To this purpose is the exhortation in the last verse, which 
 suggests a paradox not easily understood by the world, that in all 
 matters of strife and contention those that revenge are the conquered, 
 and those that forgive are the conquerors.

 (1.) "<I>Be not overcome of evil.</I> Let not the evil of any 
 provocation that is given you have such a power over you, or make such 
 an impression upon you, as to dispossess you of yourselves, to disturb 
 your peace, to destroy your love, to ruffle and discompose your 
 spirits, to transport you to any indecencies, or to bring you to study 
 or attempt any revenge." He that cannot quietly bear an injury is 
 perfectly conquered by it. 

 (2.) "<I>But overcome evil with good,</I> with the good of patience and 
 forbearance, nay, and of kindness and beneficence to those that wrong 
 you. Learn to defeat their ill designs against you, and either to 
 change them, or at least to preserve your own peace." He that hath this 
 rule over his spirit is better than the mighty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To conclude, there remain two exhortations yet untouched, which are 
 general, and which recommend all the rest as good in themselves, and of 
 good report.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As good in themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.</I> God hath 
 shown us what is good: these Christian duties are enjoined; and that is 
 evil which is opposite to them. Now observe, 

 [1.] We must not only not do evil, but we must <I>abhor that which is 
 evil.</I> We must hate sin with an utter and irreconcilable hatred, 
 have an antipathy to it as the worst of evils, contrary to our new 
 nature, and to our true interest--hating all the appearances of sin, 
 even the garment spotted with the flesh. 

 [2.] We must not only do that which is good, but we must cleave to it. 
 It denotes a deliberate choice of, a sincere affection for, and a 
 constant perseverance in, that which is good. "So cleave to it as not 
 to be allured nor affrighted from it, cleave <I>to him that is 
 good,</I> even to the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:23">Acts xi. 23</A>),

 with a dependence and acquiescence." It is subjoined to the precept of 
 brotherly love, as directive of it; we must love our brethren, but not 
 love them so much as for their sakes to commit any sin, or omit any 
 duty; not think the better of any sin for the sake of the person that 
 commits it, but forsake all the friends in the world, to cleave to God
 and duty.</P>
