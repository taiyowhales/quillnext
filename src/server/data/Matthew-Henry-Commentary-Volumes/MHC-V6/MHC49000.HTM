 think that this epistle to the Ephesians was a circular letter sent to 
 several churches, and that the copy directed to the Ephesians happened 
 to be taken into the canon, and so it came to bear that particular 
 inscription. And they have been induced the rather to think this 
 because it is the only one of all Paul's epistles that has nothing in 
 it peculiarly adapted to the state or case of that particular church; 
 but it has much of common concernment to all Christians, and especially 
 to all who, having been Gentiles in times past, were converted to 
 Christianity. But then it may be observed, on the other hand, that the 
 epistle is expressly inscribed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:1">1:1</A>)

 <I>to the saints which are at Ephesus;</I> and in the close of it he 
 tells them that he had sent Tychicus unto them, whom, in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:12">2 Tim. iv. 12</A>,

 he says he had sent to Ephesus. It is an epistle that bears date out of 
 a prison: and some have observed that what this apostle wrote when he 
 was a prisoner had the greatest relish and savour in it of the things 
 of God. When his tribulations did abound, his consolations and 
 experiences did much more abound, whence we may observe that the 
 afflictive exercises of God's people, and particularly of his 
 ministers, often tend to the advantage of others as well as to their 
 own. The apostle's design is to settle and establish the Ephesians in 
 the truth, and further to acquaint them with the mystery of the gospel, 
 in order to it. In the former part he represents the great privilege of 
 the Ephesians, who, having been in time past idolatrous heathens, were 
 now converted to Christianity and received into covenant with God, 
 which he illustrates from a view of their deplorable state before their 
 conversion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:1-3:21"><I>ch.</I> 1-3</A>.

 In the latter part (which we have in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1-6:24">4th, 5th, and 6th chapters</A>)

 he instructs them in the principal duties of religion, both personal
 and relative, and exhorts and quickens them to the faithful discharge 
 of them. Zanchy observes that we have here an epitome of the whole 
 Christian doctrine, and of almost all the chief heads of divinity.</P>
