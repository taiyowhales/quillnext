 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In going over the last two chapters, where we met with so many good 
 things that the apostles did, I wondered what was become of the scribes 
 and Pharisees, and chief priests, that they did not appear to 
 contradict and oppose them, as they had used to treat Christ himself; 
 surely they were so confounded at first with the pouring out of the 
 Spirit that they were for a time struck dumb! But I find we have not 
 lost them; their forces rally again, and here we have an encounter 
 between them and the apostles; for from the beginning the gospel met 
 with opposition. Here, 

 I. Peter and John are taken up, upon a warrant from the priests, and
 committed to jail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. They are examined by a committee of the great sanhedrim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.
 
 III. They bravely avow what they have done, and preach Christ to their
 persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 IV. Their persecutors, being unable to answer them, enjoin them
 silence, threatening them if they go on to preach the gospel, and so 
 dismiss them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13-22">ver. 13-22</A>.

 V. They apply to God by prayer, for the further operations of that 
 grace which they had already experienced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:23-30">ver. 23-30</A>.

 VI. God owns them, both outwardly and inwardly, by manifest tokens of
 his presence with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:31-33">ver. 31-33</A>.

 VII. The believers had their hearts knit together in holy love, and
 enlarged their charity to the poor, and the church flourished more than 
 ever, to the glory of Christ,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the
 captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
 &nbsp; 2 Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached
 through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
 &nbsp; 3 And they laid hands on them, and put <I>them</I> in hold unto the
 next day: for it was now eventide.
 &nbsp; 4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the
 number of the men was about five thousand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the interests of the kingdom of heaven successfully 
 carried on, and the powers of darkness appearing against them to put a 
 stop to them. let Christ's servants be ever so resolute, Satan's agents 
 will be spiteful; and therefore, let Satan's agents be ever so 
 spiteful, Christ's servants ought to be resolute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostles, Peter and John, went on in their work, and did not 
 labour in vain. The Spirit enabled the ministers to do their part, and 
 the people theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The preachers faithfully deliver the doctrine of Christ: <I>They 
 spoke unto the people,</I> to all that were within hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 What they said concerned them all, and they spoke it openly and 
 publicly. <I>They taught the people,</I> still <I>taught the people
 knowledge;</I> taught those that as yet did not believe, for their 
 conviction and conversion; and taught those that did believe, for their 
 comfort and establishment. <I>They preached through Jesus the 
 resurrection from the dead.</I> The doctrine of the resurrection of the 
 dead,

 (1.) Was verified in Jesus; this they proved, that Jesus Christ had 
 risen from the dead, as the first, the chief, that should rise from the 
 dead,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:23"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 23</A>.

 They preached the resurrection of Christ as their warrant for what they
 did. Or, 

 (2.) It is secured by him to all believers. The resurrection of the 
 dead includes all the happiness of the future state. This <I>they 
 preached through Jesus Christ,</I> attainable through him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:10,11">Phil. iii. 10, 11</A>),

 and through him only. They meddled not with matters of state, but kept
 to their business, and preached to the people heaven as their end and 
 Christ as their way. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:18"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The hearers cheerfully receive it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Many of those who heard the word believed;</I> not all--perhaps not
 the most, yet many, <I>to the number of about five thousand,</I> over 
 and above the three thousand we read of before. See how the gospel got 
 ground, and it was the effect of the pouring out of the Spirit. Though 
 the preachers were persecuted, the word prevailed; for sometimes the 
 church's suffering days have been her growing days: the days of her 
 infancy were so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The chief priests and their party now made head against them, and 
 did what they could to crush them; their hands were tied awhile, but 
 their hearts were not in the least changed. Now here observe, 

 1. Who they were that appeared against the apostles. They were <I>the
 priests;</I> you may be sure, in the first place, they were always 
 sworn enemies to Christ and his gospel; they were as jealous for their 
 priesthood as C&aelig;sar for his monarchy, and would not bear one they 
 thought their rival now, when he was preached as a priest, as much as 
 when he himself preached as a prophet. With them was joined <I>the 
 captain of the temple,</I> who, it is supposed, was a Roman officer, 
 governor of the garrison placed in the tower of Antonia, for the guard 
 of the temple: so that still here were both Jews and Gentiles 
 confederate against Christ. <I>The Sadducees</I> also, who denied 
 <I>the being of spirits</I> and <I>the future state,</I> were zealous 
 against them. "One would wonder" (saith Mr. Baxter) "what should make 
 such brutists as the Sadducees were to be such furious silencers and 
 persecutors. If there is no life to come, what harm can other men's 
 hopes of it do them? But in depraved souls all faculties are vitiated.
 A blind man has a malignant heart and a cruel hand, to this day." 

 2. How they stood affected to the apostles' preaching: <I>They were
 grieved that they taught the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It grieved them, both that the gospel doctrine was preached (was so
 preached, so publicly, so boldly,), and that the people were so ready
 to hear it. They thought, when they had put Christ to such an
 ignominious death, his disciples would ever after be ashamed and afraid
 to own him, and the people would have invincible prejudices against his
 doctrine; and now it vexed them to see themselves disappointed, and
 that his gospel got ground, instead of losing it. <I>The wicked shall
 see it, and be grieved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.

 They were grieved at that which they should have rejoiced in, at that 
 which angels rejoice in. Miserable is their case to whom the glory of
 Christ's kingdom is a grief; for, since the glory of that kingdom is 
 everlasting, it follows of course that their grief will be everlasting 
 too. It grieved them that the apostles <I>preached through Jesus the 
 resurrection from the dead.</I> The Sadducees were grieved that the 
 resurrection from the dead was preached; for they opposed that 
 doctrine, and could not bear to hear of a future state, to hear it so 
 well attested. The chief priests were grieved that they preached the 
 resurrection of the dead through Jesus, that he should have the honour 
 of it; and, though they professed to believe the resurrection of the 
 dead against the Sadducees, yet they would rather give up that 
 important article than have it preached and proved to be through Jesus.

 3. How far they proceeded against the apostles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They laid hands on them</I> (that is, their servants and officers
 did at their command), and <I>put them in hold,</I> committed them to 
 the custody of the proper officer until the next day; they could not 
 examine them now, for it was even-tide, and yet would defer it no 
 longer than <I>till next day.</I> See how God trains up his servants 
 for sufferings by degrees, and by less trials prepares them for 
 greater; now they resist unto bonds only, but afterwards to blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and
 elders, and scribes,
 &nbsp; 6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and
 Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest,
 were gathered together at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
 power, or by what name, have ye done this?
 &nbsp; 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye
 rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
 &nbsp; 9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the
 impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
 &nbsp; 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel,
 that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,
 whom God raised from the dead, <I>even</I> by him doth this man stand
 here before you whole.
 &nbsp; 11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
 which is become the head of the corner.
 &nbsp; 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
 other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
 saved.
 &nbsp; 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and
 perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they
 marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been
 with Jesus.
 &nbsp; 14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them,
 they could say nothing against it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the trial of Peter and John before the judges of the 
 ecclesiastical court, for preaching a sermon concerning Jesus Christ, 
 and working a miracle in his name. This is charged upon them as a 
 crime, which was the best service they could do to God or men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the court set. An extraordinary court, it should seem, was 
 called on purpose upon this occasion. Observe, 

 1. The time when the court sat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 
 --<I>on the morrow;</I> not in the night, as when Christ was to be tried
 before them, for they seem not to have been so hot upon this 
 prosecution as they were upon that; it was well if they began to 
 relent. But they adjourned it to the morrow, and no longer; for they 
 were impatient to get them silenced, and would lose no time. 

 2. The place where--in Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 there it was that he told his disciples they must expect to suffer hard 
 things, as he had done before them in that place. This seems to come in 
 here as an aggravation of their sin, that in Jerusalem, where there 
 were so many that looked for redemption before it came, yet there were 
 more that would not look upon it when it did come. How is that faithful 
 city become a harlot! See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 It was in the foresight of Jerusalem's standing in her own light that 
 Christ beheld the city, and wept over it. 
 
 3. The judges of the court.
 
 (1.) Their general character: they were <I>rulers, elders,</I> and 
 <I>scribes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The scribes were men of learning, who came to dispute with the 
 apostles, and hoped to confute them. The rulers and elders were men in 
 power, who, if they could not answer them, thought they could find some 
 cause or other to silence them. If the gospel of Christ had not been of 
 God, it could not have made its way, for it had both the learning and 
 power of the world against it, both the colleges of the scribes and the 
 courts of the elders.

 (2.) The names of some of them, who were most considerable. Here were 
 Annas and Caiaphas, ringleaders in this persecution; Annas the 
 president of the sanhedrim, and Caiaphas the high priest (though Annas 
 is here called so) and <I>father of the house of judgment.</I> It 
 should seem that Annas and Caiaphas executed the high priest's office 
 alternately, year for year. These two were most active against Christ;
 then Caiaphas was high priest, now Annas was; however they were both 
 equally malignant against Christ and his gospel. John is supposed to be 
 the son of Annas; and Alexander is mentioned by Josephus as a man that 
 made a figure at that time. There were others likewise that were <I>of 
 the kindred of the high priest,</I> who having dependence on him, and 
 expectations from him, would be sure to say as he said, and vote with 
 him against the apostles. Great relations, and not good, have been a 
 snare to many.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prisoners are arraigned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. They are brought to the bar; they <I>set them in the midst,</I> for 
 the sanhedrim sat in a circle, and those who had any thing to do in the 
 court stood or sat in the midst of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46">Luke ii. 46</A>),

 so Dr. Lightfoot. Thus the scripture was fulfilled, <I>The assembly of
 the wicked has enclosed me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16">Ps. xxii. 16</A>.

 <I>They compassed me about like bees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:12">Ps. cxviii. 12</A>.
 
 They were seated on every side. 

 2. The question they asked them was, "<I>By what power, or by what 
 name, have you done this?</I> By what authority do you these things?" 
 (the same question that they had asked their Master,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:23">Matt. xxi. 23</A>):

 "Who commissioned you to preach such a doctrine as this, and empowered
 you to work such a miracle as this? You have no warrant nor license
 from us, and therefore are accountable to us whence you have your
 warrant." Some think this question was grounded upon a fond conceit
 that the very naming of some names might do wonders, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>.

 The Jewish exorcists made use of the name of Jesus. Now they would know 
 what name they made use of in their cure, and consequently what name 
 they set themselves to advance in their preaching. They knew very well 
 that they preached Jesus, and the resurrection of the dead, and the 
 healing of the sick, through Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 yet they asked them, to tease them, and try if they could get any thing 
 out of them that looked criminal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The plea they put in, the design of which was not so much to clear 
 and secure themselves as to advance the name and honour of their 
 Master, who had told them that their being brought before governors and
 kings would give them an opportunity of preaching the gospel to those
 to whom otherwise they could not have had access, and it should be <I>a
 testimony against them.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:19">Mark xiii. 19</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By whom this plea was drawn up: it was dictated by the Holy Ghost, 
 who fitted Peter more than before for this occasion. The apostles, with 
 a holy negligence of their own preservation, set themselves to preach 
 Christ as he had directed them to do in such a case, and then Christ 
 made good to them his promise, that the Holy Ghost should <I>give them 
 in that same hour what they should speak.</I> Christ's faithful 
 advocates shall never want instructions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:11">Mark xiii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To whom it was given in: Peter, who is still the chief speaker, 
 addresses himself to the judges of the court, as the <I>rulers of the 
 people, and elders of</I> Israel; for the wickedness of those in power 
 does not divest them of their power, but the consideration of the power 
 they are entrusted with should prevail to divest them of their 
 wickedness. "You are rulers and elders, and should know more than 
 others of the signs of the times, and not oppose that which you are 
 bound by the duty of your place to embrace and advance, that is, the 
 kingdom of the Messiah; you are rulers and elders of Israel, God's 
 people, and if you mislead them, and cause them to err, you will have a 
 great deal to answer for."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What the plea is: it is a solemn declaration,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That what they did was in the name of Jesus Christ, which was a 
 direct answer to the question the court asked them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 "<I>If we this day be examined,</I> be called to an account as 
 criminals, so the word signifies, for <I>a good deed</I> (as any one 
 will own it to be) <I>done to the impotent man,</I>--if this be the
 ground of the commitment, this the matter of the indictment,--if we are
 put to the question, <I>by what means,</I> or by whom, <I>he is made 
 whole,</I> we have an answer ready, and it is the same we gave to the 
 people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16</A>),

 we will repeat it to you, as that which we will stand by. <I>Be it
 known to you all</I> who pretend to be ignorant of this matter, and not 
 to you only, but <I>to all the people of Israel,</I> for they are all 
 concerned to know it, <I>that by the name of Jesus Christ,</I> that 
 precious, powerful, prevailing name, that name above every name, even 
 by him whom you in contempt called Jesus of Nazareth, <I>whom you 
 crucified,</I> both rulers and people, and <I>whom God hath raised from 
 the dead</I> and advanced to the highest dignity and dominion, <I>even 
 by him doth this man stand here before you whole,</I> a monument of the 
 power of the Lord Jesus." Here, 

 [1.] He justifies what he and his colleague had done in curing the lame 
 man. It was a <I>good deed;</I> it was a kindness to the man that had 
 begged, but could not work for his living; a kindness to the temple, 
 and to those that went in to worship, who were now freed from the noise 
 and clamour of this common beggar. "Now, if we be reckoned with for 
 this good deed, we have no reason to be ashamed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1Pe+2:20,Ac+4:14,16">1 Pet. ii. 20; <I>ch.</I> iv. 14, 16</A>.

 Let those be ashamed who bring us into trouble for it." Note, It is no 
 new thing for good men to suffer ill for doing well. <I>Bene agere et 
 male pati vere Christianum est--To do well and to suffer punishment is
 the Christian's lot.</I> 

 [2.] He transfers all the praise and glory of this good deed to Jesus 
 Christ. "It is by him, and not by any power of ours, that this man is 
 cured." The apostles seek not to raise an interest for themselves, nor 
 to recommend themselves by this miracle to the good opinion of the 
 court; but, "Let the Lord alone be exalted, no matter what becomes of
 us." 

 [3.] He charges it upon the judges themselves, that they had been the 
 murderers of this Jesus: "It is he <I>whom you crucified,</I> look how 
 you will answer it;" in order to the bringing of them to believe in 
 Christ (for he aims at no less than this) he endeavours to convince 
 them of sin, of that sin which, one would think, of all others, was 
 most likely to startle conscience--their putting Christ to death. Let
 them take it how they will, Peter will miss no occasion to tell them of 
 it. 

 [4.] He attests the resurrection of Christ as the strongest testimony 
 for him, and against his persecutors: "<I>They crucified him,</I> but 
 God <I>raised him from the dead;</I> they took away his life, but God 
 gave it to him again, and your further opposition to his interest will 
 speed no better." He tells them that God raised him from the dead, and 
 they could not for shame answer him with that foolish suggestion which 
 they palmed upon the people, that <I>his disciples came by night and 
 stole him away.</I> 

 [5.] He preaches this to all the bystanders, to be by them repeated to 
 all their neighbours, and commands all manner of persons, from the 
 highest to the lowest, to take notice of it at their peril: "<I>Be it 
 known to you all</I> that are here present, and it shall be made known 
 to <I>all the people of Israel,</I> wherever they are dispersed, in 
 spite of all your endeavours to stifle and suppress the notice of it: 
 as the Lord God of gods knows, so Israel shall know, all Israel shall 
 know, that wonders are wrought in the name of Jesus, not by repeating 
 it as a charm, but believing in it as a divine revelation of grace and 
 good-will to men."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the name of this Jesus, by the authority of which they acted, 
 is that name alone by which we can be saved. He passes from this 
 particular instance to show that it is not a particular sect or party 
 that is designed to be set up by the doctrine they preached, and the 
 miracle they wrought, which people might either join with or keep off 
 from at their pleasure, as it was with the sects of the philosophers 
 and those among the Jews; but that it is a sacred and divine 
 institution that is hereby ratified and confirmed, and which all people 
 are highly concerned to submit to and come into the measures of. It is 
 not an indifferent thing, but of absolute necessity, that people 
 believe in this name, and call upon it. 

 [1.] We are obliged to it in duty to God, and in compliance with his 
 designs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>This is the stone which was set at nought of your builders,</I> you 
 that are <I>the rulers of the people, and the elders of Israel,</I> 
 that should be the builders of the church, that pretend to be so, for 
 the church is God's building. Here was a stone offered you, to be put 
 in the chief place of the building, to be the main pillar on which the 
 fabric might entirely rest; but you set it at nought, rejected it, 
 would not make use of it, but threw it by as good for nothing but to 
 make a stepping-stone of; but this stone is <I>now become the head of 
 the corner;</I> God has raised up this Jesus whom you rejected, and, by 
 setting him at his right hand, has made him both the corner stone and 
 the head stone, the centre of unity and the fountain of power." 
 Probably St. Peter here chose to make use of this quotation because 
 Christ had himself made use of it, in answer to the demand of the chief 
 priests and the elders concerning his authority, not long before this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:42">Matt. xxi. 42</A>.

 Scripture is a tried weapon in our spiritual conflicts: let us 
 therefore stick to it. 

 [2.] We are obliged to it for our own interest. We are undone if we do
 not take shelter in this name, and make it our refuge and strong tower; 
 for we cannot be saved but by Jesus Christ, and, if we be not eternally 
 saved, we are eternally undone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>Neither is there salvation in any other.</I> As there is no other 
 name by which diseased bodies can be cured, so there is no other by 
 which sinful souls can be saved. "By him, and him only, by receiving 
 and embracing his doctrine, salvation must now be hoped for by all. For 
 there is no other religion in the world, no, not that delivered by 
 Moses, by which salvation can be had for those that do not now come 
 into this, at the preaching of it." So. Dr. Hammond. Observe here, 
 <I>First,</I> Our salvation is our chief concern, and that which ought 
 to lie nearest to our hearts--our rescue from wrath and the curse, and
 our restoration to God's favour and blessing. <I>Secondly,</I> Our 
 salvation is not in ourselves, nor can be obtained by any merit or 
 strength of our own; we can destroy ourselves, but we cannot save 
 ourselves. <I>Thirdly,</I> There are among men many names that pretend 
 to be saving names, but really are not so; many institutions in 
 religion that pretend to settle a reconciliation and correspondence 
 between God and man, but cannot do it. <I>Fourthly,</I> It is only by 
 Christ and his name that those favours can be expected from God which 
 are necessary to our salvation, and that our services can be accepted 
 with God. This is the honour of Christ's name, that it is the only name 
 whereby we must be saved, the only name we have to plead in all our 
 addresses to God. This name is <I>given.</I> God has appointed it, and 
 it is an inestimable benefit freely conferred upon us. It is given 
 <I>under heaven.</I> Christ has not only a great name in heaven, but a 
 great name under heaven; for he has all power both in the upper and in 
 the lower world. It is given <I>among men,</I> who need salvation, men 
 who are ready to perish. We may be saved by his name, that name of his, 
 <I>The Lord our righteousness;</I> and we cannot be saved by any other.
 How far those may find favour with God who have not the knowledge of 
 Christ, nor any actual faith in him, yet live up to the light they 
 have, it is not our business to determine. But this we know, that 
 whatever saving favour such may receive it is upon the account of 
 Christ, and for his sake only; so that still <I>there is no salvation 
 in any other. I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me,</I>

 IV. The stand that the court was put to in the prosecution, by this 
 plea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Now was fulfilled that promise Christ made, that he would give them 
 <I>a mouth and wisdom, such as all their adversaries should not be able 
 to gainsay nor resist.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They could not deny the cure of the lame man to be both a good deed 
 and a miracle. He was there standing with Peter and John, ready to 
 attest the cure, if there were occasion, and they had <I>nothing to say 
 against it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 either to disprove it or to disparage it. It was well that it was not 
 the sabbath day, else they would have had that to say against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They could not, with all their pomp and power, face down Peter and 
 John. This was a miracle not inferior to the cure of the lame man, 
 considering both what cruel bloody enemies these priests had been to 
 the name of Christ (enough to make any one tremble that appeared for 
 him), and considering what cowardly faint-hearted advocates those 
 disciples had lately been for him, Peter particularly, who denied him 
 for fear of a silly maid; yet now they see <I>the boldness of Peter and 
 John,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Probably there was something extraordinary and very surprising in their 
 looks; they appeared not only undaunted by the rulers, but daring and 
 daunting to them; they had something majestic in their foreheads, 
 sparkling in their eyes, and commanding, if not terrifying, in their 
 voice. They <I>set their faces like a flint,</I> as the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7,Eze+3:9">Isa. l. 7; Ezek. iii. 9</A>.

 The courage of Christ's faithful confessors has often been the 
 confusion of their cruel persecutors. Now,

 (1.) We are here told what increased their wonder: They <I>perceived
 that they were unlearned and ignorant men.</I> They enquired either of 
 the apostles or themselves or of others, and found that they were of 
 mean extraction, born in Galilee, that they were bred fishermen, and 
 had no learned education, had never been at any university, were not 
 brought up at the feet of any of the rabbin, had never been conversant 
 in courts, camps, or colleges; nay, perhaps, talk to them at this time 
 upon any point in natural philosophy, mathematics, or politics, and you 
 will find they know nothing of the matter; and yet speak to them of the 
 Messiah and his kingdom, and they speak with so much clearness, 
 evidence, and assurance, so pertinently and so fluently, and are so 
 ready in the scriptures of the Old Testament relating to it, that the 
 most learned judge upon the bench is not able to answer them, nor to 
 enter the lists with them. They were <I>ignorant 
 men</I>--<B><I>idiotai,</I></B> <I>private men,</I> men that had not
 any public character nor employment; and therefore they wondered they 
 should have such high pretensions. They were <I>idiots</I> (so the word 
 signifies): they looked upon them with as much contempt as if they had 
 been <I>mere naturals,</I> and expected no more from them, which made 
 them wonder to see what freedom they took. 

 (2.) We are told what made their wonder in a great measure to cease: 
 they <I>took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus;</I> they, 
 themselves, it is probable, had seen them with him in the temple, and 
 now recollected that they had seen them; or some of their servants or 
 those about them informed them of it, for they would not be thought 
 themselves to have taken notice of such inferior people. But when they 
 understood that <I>they had been with Jesus,</I> had been conversant 
 with him, attendant on him, and trained up under him, they knew what to 
 impute their boldness to; nay, their boldness in divine things was 
 enough to show with whom they had had their education. Note, Those that 
 <I>have been with Jesus,</I> in converse and communion with him, have 
 been attending on his word, praying in his name, and celebrating the 
 memorials of his death and resurrection, should conduct themselves, in 
 every thing, so that those who converse with them may <I>take knowledge 
 of them that they have been with Jesus;</I> and this makes them so 
 holy, and heavenly, and spiritual, and cheerful; this has raised them 
 so much above this world, and filled them with another. One may know 
 that they have been in the mount by the shining of their faces.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the
 council, they conferred among themselves,
 &nbsp; 16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a
 notable miracle hath been done by them <I>is</I> manifest to all them
 that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us
 straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in
 this name.
 &nbsp; 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all
 nor teach in the name of Jesus.
 &nbsp; 19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it
 be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
 God, judge ye.
 &nbsp; 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
 heard.
 &nbsp; 21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
 finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the
 people: for all <I>men</I> glorified God for that which was done.
 &nbsp; 22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle
 of healing was showed.

 We have here the issue of the trial of Peter and John before the 
 council. They came off now with flying colours, because they must be 
 trained up to sufferings by degrees, and by less trials be prepared for 
 greater. They now but <I>run with the footmen;</I> hereafter we shall 
 have them <I>contending with horses,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5">Jer. xii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the consultation and resolution of the court about this 
 matter, and their proceeding thereupon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prisoners were ordered to withdraw 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 They <I>commanded them to go aside out of the council,</I> willing 
 enough to get clear of them (they spoke so home to their consciences), 
 and not willing they should hear the acknowledgements that were 
 extorted from them; but, though they might not hear from them, we have 
 them here upon record. The designs of Christ's enemies are carried on
 in close cabals, and they dig deep, as if they would hide their 
 counsels from the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A debate arose upon this matter: <I>They conferred among 
 themselves;</I> every one is desired to speak his mind freely, and to 
 give advice upon this important affair. <I>Now the scripture was 
 fulfilled</I> that the rulers would <I>take counsel together against 
 the Lord, and against his anointed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>.

 The question proposed was, <I>What shall we do to these men?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 If they would have yielded to the convincing commanding power of truth, 
 it had been easy to say what they should do to these men. They should 
 have placed them at the head of their council, and received their 
 doctrine, and been baptized by them in the name of the Lord Jesus, and 
 joined in fellowship with them. But, when men will not be persuaded to 
 do what they should do, it is no marvel that they are ever and anon at 
 a loss what to do. The truths of Christ, if men would but entertain 
 them as they should, would give them no manner of trouble or 
 uneasiness; but, if they <I>hold them</I> or imprison them <I>in 
 unrighteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>),

 they will find them a burdensome stone that they will not know what to
 do with,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They came at last to a resolution, in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That it was not safe to punish the apostles for what they had 
 done. Very willingly would they have done it, but they had not courage 
 to do it, because the people espoused their cause, and cried up the 
 miracle; and they stood now in as much awe of them as they had done 
 formerly, when they durst not lay hands of Christ <I>for fear of the 
 people.</I> By this it appears that the outcry of the mob against our 
 Saviour was a forced or managed thing, the stream soon returned to its 
 former channel. Now they could not find how they might punish Peter and 
 John, what colour they might have for it, <I>because of the people.</I> 
 They knew it would be an unrighteous thing to punish them, and 
 therefore should have been restrained from it by the fear of God; but 
 they considered it only as a dangerous thing, and therefore were held 
 in from it only by the fear of <I>the people.</I> For, 

 [1.] The people were convinced of the truth of the miracle; it was a 
 <I>notable miracle,</I> <B><I>gnoston semeion</I></B>--<I>a known
 miracle;</I> it was known that they did it in Christ's name, and that 
 Christ himself had often the like before. This was a known instance of 
 the power of Christ, and a proof of his doctrine. That it was a great 
 miracle, and wrought for the confirmation of the doctrine they preached 
 (for it was a sign), was <I>manifest to all that dwelt in 
 Jerusalem:</I> it was an opinion universally received, and, the miracle 
 being wrought at the gate of the temple, universal notice was taken of 
 it; and they themselves, with all the craftiness and all the effrontery 
 they had, <I>could not deny it</I> to be a true miracle; every body 
 would have hooted at them if they had. They could easily deny it to 
 their own consciences, but not to the world. The proofs of the gospel 
 were undeniable. 

 [2.] They went further, and were not only convinced of the truth of the 
 miracle, but all men <I>glorified God for that which was done.</I> Even 
 those that were not persuaded by it to believe in Christ were yet so 
 affected with it, as a mercy to a poor man and an honour to their 
 country, that they could not but give praise to God for it; even 
 natural religion taught them to do this. And, if the priests had 
 punished Peter and John for that for which all men glorified God, they 
 would have lost all their interest in the people, and been abandoned as 
 enemies both to God and man. Thus therefore their wrath shall be made 
 to praise God, and the remainder thereof shall be restrained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That it was nevertheless necessary to silence them for the future,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 They could not prove that they had said or done any thing amiss, and 
 yet they must no more say nor do what they have done. All their care is 
 that the doctrine of Christ <I>spread no further among the people;</I> 
 as if that healing institution were a plague begun, the contagion of 
 which must be stopped. See how the malice of hell fights against the 
 counsels of heaven; God will have the knowledge of Christ to spread all 
 the world over, but the chief priests would have it spread no further, 
 which he that sits in heaven laughs at. Now, to prevent the further 
 spreading of this doctrine, 

 [1.] They charge the apostles never to preach it any more. Be it 
 enacted by their authority (which they think every Israelite is bound 
 in conscience to submit to) that <I>no man speak at all nor teach in 
 the name of Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 We do not find that they give them any reason why the doctrine of 
 Christ must be suppressed; they cannot say it is false or dangerous, or 
 of any ill tendency, and they are ashamed to own the true reason, that 
 it testifies against their hypocrisy and wickedness, and shocks their 
 tyranny. But, <I>Stat pro ratione voluntas--They can assign no reason
 but their will.</I> "We strictly charge and command you, not only that 
 you do not preach this doctrine publicly, but that you <I>speak 
 henceforth to no man,</I> not to any particular person privately, <I>in 
 this name,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There is not a greater service done to the devil's kingdom than the 
 silencing of faithful ministers; and putting those under a bushel that 
 are the lights of the world. 

 [2.] They threaten them if they do, strictly threaten them: it is at 
 their peril. This court will reckon itself highly affronted if they
 do, and they shall fall under its displeasure. Christ had not only 
 charged them to preach the gospel to every creature, but had promised 
 to bear them out in it, and reward them for it. Now these priests not 
 only forbid the preaching of the gospel, but threaten to punish it as a 
 heinous crime; but those who know how to put a just value upon the 
 world's threatenings, though they be threatenings of slaughter that it 
 breathes out,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the courageous resolution of the prisoners to go on in 
 their work, notwithstanding the resolutions of this court, and their 
 declaration of this resolution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Peter and John needed not confer together to know one another's minds 
 (for they were both actuated by one and the same Spirit), but agree 
 presently in the same sentiments, and jointly put in the answer: 
 "<I>Whether it be right in the sight of God,</I> to whom both you and 
 we are accountable, <I>to hearken unto you more than unto God,</I> we 
 appeal to yourselves, <I>judge you; for we cannot forbear speaking</I> 
 to every body <I>the things which we have seen and heard,</I> and are 
 ourselves full of, and are charged to publish." The prudence of the 
 serpent would have directed them to be silent, and, though they could 
 not with a good conscience promise that they would not preach the 
 gospel any more, yet they needed not tell the rulers that they would. 
 But the boldness of the lion directed them thus to set both the 
 authority and the malignity of their persecutors at defiance. They do, 
 in effect, tell them that they are resolved to go on in preaching, and 
 justify themselves in it with two things:--

 1. The command of God: "You charge us not to preach the gospel; he has
 charged us to preach it, has committed it to us as a trust, requiring 
 us upon our allegiance faithfully to dispense it; now whom must we 
 obey, God or you?" Here they appeal to one of the <I>communes 
 notiti&aelig;--to a settled and acknowledged maxim</I> in the law of
 nature, that if men's commands and God's interfere God's commands must 
 take place. It is a rule in the common law of England that if any 
 statute be made contrary to the law of God it is null and void. Nothing 
 can be more absurd than to hearken unto weak and fallible men, that are 
 fellow-creatures and fellow-subjects, more than unto a God that is
 infinitely wise and holy, our Creator and sovereign Lord, and the Judge 
 to whom we are all accountable. The case is so plain, so uncontroverted 
 and self-evident, that we will venture to leave it to yourselves to
 judge of it, though you are biassed and prejudiced. Can you think it 
 <I>right in the sight of God</I> to break a divine command in obedience 
 to a human injunction? That is right indeed which is <I>right in the 
 sight of God;</I> for his judgment, we are sure, is according to truth, 
 and therefore by that we ought to govern ourselves. 

 2. The convictions of their consciences. Even if they had not had such
 an express command from heaven to preach the doctrine of Christ, yet 
 they <I>could not but speak,</I> and speak publicly, <I>those things 
 which they had seen and heard.</I> Like Elihu, they were <I>full of 
 this matter,</I> and <I>the Spirit within them constrained them,</I> 
 they must speak, that they might be refreshed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:18,20">Job xxxii. 18, 20</A>.

 (1.) They felt the influence of it upon themselves, what a blessed 
 change it had wrought upon them, had brought them into a new world, and 
 therefore they could not but speak of it: and those speak the doctrine 
 of Christ best that have felt the power of it, and tasted the sweetness 
 of it, and have themselves been deeply affected with it; it is as a 
 <I>fire in their bones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:9">Jer. xx. 9</A>.

 (2.) They knew the importance of it to others. They look with concern 
 upon perishing souls, and know that they cannot escape eternal ruin but 
 by Jesus Christ, and therefore will be faithful to them in giving them 
 warning, and showing them the right way. They are things <I>which we 
 have seen and heard,</I> and therefore will be faithful to them in 
 giving them warning, and showing them the right way. They are things 
 which we only have seen and heard, and therefore, if we do not publish 
 them, who will? Who can? <I>Knowing the</I> favour, as well as the 
 <I>terror of the Lord, we persuade men; for the love of Christ</I> and 
 the love of souls constrain us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:11,14">2 Cor. v. 11, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the discharge of the prisoners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>They further threatened them,</I> and thought they frightened them, 
 and then <I>let them go.</I> There were many whom they terrified into 
 an obedience to their unrighteous decrees; they knew how to keep men in 
 awe with their excommunication 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:22">John ix. 22</A>),

 and thought they could have the same influence upon the apostles that 
 they had upon other men; but they were deceived, for they had been with 
 Jesus. They threatened them, and that was all they did now: when they
 had done this they <I>let them go,</I> 

 1. Because they durst not contradict the people, who <I>glorified God
 for that which was done,</I> and would have been ready (at least they
 thought so) to pull them out of their seats, if they had punished the
 apostles for doing it. As rulers by the ordinance of God are made a
 terror and restraint to wicked people, so people are sometimes by the
 providence of God made a terror and restrain to wicked rulers. 
 
 2. Because they could not contradict the miracle: <I>For</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)
 
 <I>the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing 
 was shown.</I> And therefore, 

 (1.) The miracle was so much the greater, he having been lame <I>from 
 his mother's womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>.

 The older he grew the more inveterate the disease was, and the more
 hardly cured. If those that are grown into years, and have been long
 accustomed to evil, are cured of their spiritual impotency to good, and 
 thereby of their evil customs, the power of divine grace is therein so 
 much the more magnified. 

 (2.) The truth of it was so much the better attested; for <I>the man 
 being above forty years old,</I> he was able, like the blind man whom 
 Christ healed, when he was asked, to <I>speak for himself,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And being let go, they went to their own company, and
 reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God
 with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <I>art</I> God, which hast made
 heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
 &nbsp; 25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the
 heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?
 &nbsp; 26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were
 gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
 &nbsp; 27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
 anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and
 the people of Israel, were gathered together,
 &nbsp; 28 For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
 before to be done.
 &nbsp; 29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
 servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
 &nbsp; 30 By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and
 wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.
 &nbsp; 31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they
 were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy
 Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We hear no more at present of the chief priests, what they did when 
 they had dismissed Peter and John, but are to attend those <I>two 
 witnesses.</I> And here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their return to their brethren, the apostles and ministers, and 
 perhaps some private Christians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Being let go, they went to their own company,</I> who perhaps at 
 this time were met together in pain for them, and praying for them; as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12"><I>ch.</I> xii. 12</A>.

 As soon as ever they were at liberty, they went to their old friends,
 and returned to their church-fellowship. 

 1. Though God had highly honoured them, in calling them out to be his
 witnesses, and enabling them to acquit themselves so well, yet they 
 were not puffed up with the honour done them, nor thought themselves 
 thereby exalted above their brethren, but <I>went to their own 
 company.</I> No advancement in gifts or usefulness should make us think 
 ourselves above either the duties or the privileges of the communion of 
 saints. 

 2. Though their enemies had severely threatened them, and endeavoured
 to break their knot, and frighten them from the work they were jointly 
 engaged in, yet they <I>went to their own company,</I> and feared not 
 the wrath of their rulers. They might have had comfort, if, being let 
 go, they had retired to their closets, and spent some time in devotion 
 there. But they were men in a public station, and must seek not so much 
 their own personal satisfaction as the public good. Christ's followers
 do best in company, provided it be in their own company.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The account they gave them of what had passed: They <I>reported all 
 that the chief priests and elders had said to them,</I> adding, no 
 doubt, what they were enabled by the grace of God to reply to them, and 
 how their trial issued. They related it to them, 

 1. That they might know what to expect both from men and from God in
 the progress of their work. From men they might expect every thing that 
 was terrifying, but from God every thing that was encouraging; men 
 would do their utmost to run them down, but God would take effectual 
 care to bear them up. Thus the brethren in the Lord would wax confident 
 through their bonds, and their experiences, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:14">Phil. i. 14</A>.

 2. That they might have it recorded in the history of the church, for 
 the benefit of posterity, particularly for the confirmation of our 
 faith touching the resurrection of Christ. The silence of an adversary, 
 in some cases, is next door to the consent and testimony of an 
 adversary. These apostles told the chief priests to their faces that 
 God had <I>raised up Jesus from the dead,</I> and, though they were a 
 body of them together, they had not the confidence to deny it, but, in 
 the silliest and most sneaking manner imaginable, bade the apostles not 
 to tell any body of it. 

 3. That they might now join with them in prayers and praises; and by
 such a concert as this God would be the more glorified, and the church 
 the more edified. We should therefore communicate to our brethren the 
 providences of God that relate to us, and our experience of his 
 presence with us, that they may assist us in our acknowledgment of God 
 therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their address to God upon this occasion: <I>When they heard</I> of 
 the impotent malice of the priests, and the potent courage of the 
 sufferers, they called their company together and went to prayer: 
 <I>They lifted up their voice to God with one accord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Not that it can be supposed that they all said the same words at the 
 same time (though it was possible they might, being all inspired by one 
 and the same Spirit), but one in the name of the rest <I>lifted up his 
 voice to God</I> and the rest joined with him, 
 <B><I>hymothymadon</I></B>--<I>with one mind</I> (so the word
 signifies); their hearts went along with him, and so, though but one 
 spoke, they all prayed; one lifted up his voice, and, in concurrence 
 with him, they all lifted up their hearts, which was, in effect, 
 lifting up their voice to God; for thoughts are as words to God.
 <I>Moses cried unto God,</I> when we find not a word said. Now in this 
 solemn address to God we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their adoration of God as the Creator of the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 With <I>one mind,</I> and so, in effect, with <I>one mouth,</I> they 
 <I>glorified God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6">Rom. xv. 6</A>.

 They <I>said, "O Lord, thou art God,</I> God alone; 
 <B><I>Despota</I></B>, thou art <I>our Master and sovereign Ruler</I>" 
 (so the word signifies), "thou art God; God, and not man; God, and not 
 the work of men's hands; the Creator of all, and not the creature of 
 men's fancies. Thou art the God <I>who hast made heaven, and earth, and 
 the sea,</I> the upper and lower world, and all the creatures that are 
 in both." Thus we Christians distinguish ourselves from the heathen, 
 that, while they worship gods which they have made, we are worshipping 
 the God that made us and all the world. And it is very proper to begin
 our prayers, as well as our creed, with the acknowledgement of this, 
 that God is the <I>Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of 
 all things visible and invisible.</I> Though the apostles were at this 
 time full of the mystery of the world's redemption, yet they did not 
 forget nor overlook the history of the world's creation; for the 
 Christian religion was intended to confirm and improve, not to eclipse 
 nor jostle out, the truths and dictates of natural religion. It is a 
 great encouragement to God's servants, both in doing work and suffering 
 work, that they serve the God that made all things, and therefore has 
 the disposal of their times, and all events concerning them, and is 
 able to strengthen them under all their difficulties. And, if we give 
 him the glory of this, we may take the comfort of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their reconciling themselves to the present dispensations of 
 Providence, by reflecting upon those scriptures in the Old Testament 
 which foretold that the kingdom of the Messiah would meet with such 
 opposition as this at the first setting of it up in the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 God, who <I>made heaven and earth,</I> cannot meet with any [effectual] 
 opposition to his designs, since none dare [at least, can prevailingly]
 dispute or contest with him. Yea, thus it was written, <I>thus he spoke 
 by the mouth,</I> thus he wrote by the pen, <I>of his servant 
 David,</I> who, as appears by this, was the penman of the second psalm, 
 and therefore, most probably, of the first, and other psalms that are 
 not ascribed to any other, though they have not his name in the title.
 Let it not therefore be a surprise to them, nor any discouragement to 
 any in embracing their doctrine, for the <I>scripture must be 
 fulfilled.</I> It was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>,

 (1.) That the heathen would rage at Christ and his kingdom, and be
 angry at the attempts to set it up, because that would be the pulling 
 down of the gods of the heathen, and giving a check to the wickedness 
 of the heathen. 

 (2.) That the people would imagine all the things that could be against 
 it, to silence the teachers of it, to discountenance the subjects of 
 it, and to crush all the interests of it. If they prove vain things in 
 the issue, no thanks to those who imagined them. 

 (3.) That the kings of the earth, particularly, would stand up in 
 opposition to the kingdom of Christ, as if they were jealous (though 
 there is no occasion for their being so) that it would interfere with 
 their powers, and intrench upon their prerogatives. The kings of the 
 earth that are most favoured and honoured by divine Providence, and 
 should do most for God, are strangers and enemies to divine grace, and 
 do most against God. 

 (4.) That the rulers would gather together against God and Christ; not 
 only monarchs, that have the power in their single persons, but where 
 the power is in many rulers, councils, and senates, they <I>gather 
 together,</I> to consult and decree <I>against the Lord and against his 
 Christ</I>--against both natural and revealed religion. What is done
 against Christ, God takes as done against himself. Christianity was
 not only destitute of the advantage of the countenance and support of 
 kings and rulers (it had neither their power nor their purses), but it 
 was opposed and fought against by them, and they combined to run it 
 down and yet it made its way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their representation of the present accomplishment of those 
 predictions in the enmity and malice of the rulers against Christ. What 
 was foretold we see fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 It is <I>of a truth</I>--it is certainly so, it is too plain to be
 denied, and in it appears the truth of the prediction that Herod and 
 Pilate, the two Roman governors, with the Gentiles (the Roman soldiers 
 under their command), and with the <I>people of Israel</I> (the rulers 
 of the Jews and the mob that is under their influence), were 
 <I>gathered together</I> in a confederacy <I>against thy holy child 
 Jesus whom thou has anointed.</I> Some copies add another circumstance, 
 <B><I>en te polei sou taute</I></B>--<I>in this thy holy city,</I>
 where, above any place, he should have been welcomed. But herein they 
 do <I>that which thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be 
 done.</I> See here

 (1.) The wise and holy designs God had concerning Christ. He is here 
 called the <I>child Jesus,</I> as he was called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:27,43">Luke ii. 27, 43</A>)

 in his infancy, to intimate that even in his exalted state he is not 
 ashamed of his condescensions for us, and that he continues meek and 
 lowly in heart. In the height of his glory he is the <I>Lamb of 
 God,</I> and the <I>child Jesus.</I> But he is the <I>holy child 
 Jesus</I> (so he was called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>,

 <I>that holy thing</I>), and <I>thy</I> holy child; the word signifies 
 both a son and a servant, <B><I>paida sou</I></B>. He was the Son of
 God; and yet in the work of redemption he acted as his Father's servant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>),

 <I>My servant whom I uphold.</I> It was he whom God anointed, both 
 qualified for the undertaking and called to it; and thence he was 
 called the Lord's Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 And this comes in as a reason why they set themselves with so much rage 
 and violence against him, because God had anointed him, and they were 
 resolved not to resign, much less to submit to him. David was envied
 by Saul, because he was the Lord's anointed. And the Philistines came 
 up to seek David when they heard he was anointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17">2 Sam. v. 17</A>.

 Now the God that anointed Christ determined what should be done to him,
 pursuant to that anointing. He was anointed to be a Saviour, and
 therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice to make atonement
 for sin. He must die--therefore he must be slain; yet not by his own
 hands--therefore God wisely determined before by what hands it should be
 done. It must be by the hands of those who will treat him as a criminal
 and malefactor, and therefore it cannot be done by the hands either of
 angels or of good men; he must therefore be <I>delivered into the hands
 of sinners</I> as Job was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:11"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 11</A>.

 And as David was delivered to Shimei to be <I>made a curse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:11">2 Sam. xvi. 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord has bidden him. God's hand and his counsel determined 
 it</I>--his will, and his wisdom. God's <I>hand,</I> which properly
 denotes his executive power, is here put for his purpose and decree, 
 because with him saying and doing are not two things, as they are with 
 us. His hand and his counsel always agree; for <I>whatsoever the Lord
 pleased that did he.</I> Dr. Hammon makes this phrase of <I>God's hand 
 determining it</I> to be an allusion to the high priest's casting lots 
 upon the two goats on the day of atonement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:8">Lev. xvi. 8</A>),

 in which he lifted up the hand that he happened to have the lot for the 
 Lord in, and that goat on which it fell was immediately sacrificed; and
 the disposal of this lot was from the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:33">Prov. xvi. 33</A>.

 Thus God's hand determined what should be done, that Christ should be 
 the sacrifice slain. Or, if I may offer a conjecture, when God's hand 
 is here said to determine, it may be meant, not of God's acting hand, 
 but his writing hand, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>,

 <I>Thou writest bitter things against us;</I> and God's decree is said
 to be <I>that which is written in the scriptures of truth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:21">Dan. x. 21</A>),

 and <I>in the volume of the book it was written of Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7">Ps. xl. 7</A>.

 It was <I>God's hand</I> that wrote it, his hand according to his 
 counsel. The commission was given under his hand.

 (2.) The wicked and unholy instruments that were employed in the
 executing of this design, though they <I>meant not so, neither did 
 their hearts think so.</I> Herod and Pilate, Gentiles and Jews, who had 
 been at variance with each other, united against Christ. And God's
 serving his own purposes by what they did was no excuse at all for 
 their malice and wickedness in the doing of it, any more than God's 
 making the blood of the martyrs the seed of the church extenuated the 
 guilt of their bloody persecutors. Sin is not the less evil for God's 
 bringing good out of it, but he is by this the more glorified, and will 
 appear to be so when the mystery of God shall be finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their petition with reference to the case at this time. The enemies 
 <I>were gathered together against Christ,</I> and then no wonder that 
 they were so against his ministers: <I>the disciple is not better than 
 his Master,</I> nor must expect better treatment; but, being thus 
 insulted, they pray,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That God would take cognizance of the malice of their enemies: 
 <I>Now, Lord, behold their threatenings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Behold them, as thou art said to behold them in the psalm before quoted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4">Ps. ii. 4</A>),

 when they thought <I>to break his bands asunder, and cast away his 
 cords from them; he that sits in heaven laughs at them, and has them in 
 derision;</I> and <I>then the virgin, the daughter of Zion, may 
 despise</I> the impotent menaces even of <I>the great king, the king of 
 Assyria,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 And <I>now, Lord;</I> <B><I>ta nyn</I></B> there is an emphasis upon
 the <I>now,</I> to intimate that then is God's time to appear for his
 people, when the power of their enemies is most daring and threatening.
 They do not dictate to God what he shall do, but refer themselves to
 and him, like <I>Hezekiah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:17">Isa. xxxvii. 17</A>):

 "<I>Open thine eyes, O Lord, and see;</I> thou knowest what they say, 
 <I>thou beholdest mischief and spite</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:14">Ps. x. 14</A>);

 to thee we appeal, <I>behold their threatenings,</I> and either tie 
 their hands or turn their hearts; make their wrath, as far as it is let 
 loose, to praise thee, and the remainder thereof do thou restrain,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 It is a comfort to us that if we be unjustly threatened, and bear it 
 patiently, we may make ourselves easy by spreading the case before the 
 Lord, and leaving it with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That God, by his grace, would keep up their spirits, and animate 
 them to go on cheerfully with their work: <I>Grant unto thy servants 
 that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</I> though the priests 
 and rulers have enjoined them silence. Note, In threatening times, our
 care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented as that we 
 may be enabled to go on with cheerfulness and resolution in our work 
 and duty, whatever troubles we may meet with. Their prayer is not, 
 "<I>Lord, behold their threatenings,</I> and frighten them, and stop 
 their mouths, and fill their faces with shame;" but, "<I>Behold their 
 threatenings,</I> and animate us, open our mouths and fill our hearts 
 with courage." They do not pray, "Lord, give us a fair opportunity to 
 retire from our work, now that it is become dangerous;" but, "Lord, 
 give us grace to go on in our work and not to be afraid of the face of 
 man." Observe, 

 [1.] Those that are sent on God's errands ought to deliver their 
 message with boldness, with all boldness, with all liberty of speech, 
 <I>not shunning to declare the whole counsel of God,</I> whoever is 
 offended; not doubting of what they say, nor of being borne out in 
 saying it. 

 [2.] God is to be sought unto for an ability to speak his word with 
 boldness, and those that desire divine aids and encouragements may 
 depend upon them, and ought to go forth and go on <I>in the strength of 
 the Lord God.</I> 

 [3.] The threatenings of our enemies, that are designed to weaken our 
 hands and drive us off from our work, should rather stir us up to so 
 much the more courage and resolution in our work. Are they daring that 
 fight against Christ? For shame, let not us be sneaking that are for 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That God would still give them power to work miracles for the 
 confirmation of the doctrine they preached, which, by <I>the cure of 
 the lame man,</I> they found to contribute very much to their success, 
 and would contribute abundantly to their further progress: <I>Lord, 
 grant us boldness, by stretching forth thy hand to heal.</I> Note, 
 Nothing emboldens faithful ministers more in their work than the tokens 
 of God's presence with them, and a divine power going along with them.
 They pray, 

 [1.] That God would <I>stretch forth his hand to heal</I> both the 
 bodies and souls of men; else in vain do <I>they stretch forth their 
 hands,</I> either in preaching

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:2">Isa. lxv. 2</A>),

 or in curing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17"><I>ch.</I> ix. 17</A>.

 [2.] <I>That signs and wonders might be done by the name of the holy 
 child Jesus,</I> which would be convincing to the people, and 
 confounding to the enemies. Christ had promised them a power to work 
 miracles, for the proof of their commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17,18">Mark xvi. 17, 18</A>);

 yet they must pray for it; and, though they had it, must pray for the 
 continuance of it. Christ himself must ask, and it shall be given him.
 Observe, It is the honour of Christ that they aim at in this request, 
 that the wonders might be done by the name of Jesus, the holy child 
 Jesus, and his name shall have all the glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The gracious answer God gave to this address, not in word, but in 
 power. 
 
 1. God gave them a sign of the acceptance of their prayers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>When they had prayed</I> (perhaps many of them prayed successively),
 one by one, according to the rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:31">1 Cor. xiv. 31</A>),

 and when they had concluded the work of the day, <I>the place was 
 shaken where they were assembled together;</I> there was a <I>strong 
 mighty wind,</I> such as that when the Spirit was poured out upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1,2"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1, 2</A>),

 <I>which shook the house,</I> which was now their house of prayer. This
 shaking of the place was designed to strike an awe upon them, to awaken 
 and raise their expectations, and to give them a sensible token that 
 God was with them of a truth: and perhaps it was to put them in mind of 
 that prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:7">Hag. ii. 7</A>),

 <I>I will shake all nations, and will fill this house with glory.</I>
 This was to show them what reason they had to fear God more, and then 
 they would fear man less. He that shook this place could make the 
 hearts of those who threatened his servants thus to tremble, for he 
 <I>cuts off the spirit of princes, and is terrible to the kings of the 
 earth.</I> The place was shaken, that their faith might be established 
 and unshaken. 

 2. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit, which was what they
 prayed for. Their prayer, without doubt, was accepted, for it was 
 answered: <I>They were all filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> more than 
 ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the 
 word of God with boldness, and not to be afraid of the proud and 
 haughty looks of men. The Holy Ghost taught them not only <I>what</I> 
 to speak, but <I>how</I> to speak. Those that were endued habitually
 with the powers of the Holy Ghost had yet occasion for fresh supplies 
 of the Spirit, according as the various occurrences of their service 
 were. They were <I>filled with the Holy Ghost</I> at the bar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 and now <I>filled with the Holy Ghost</I> in the pulpit, which teaches 
 us to live in an actual dependence upon the grace of God, according as 
 the duty of every day requires; we need to be <I>anointed with fresh 
 oil</I> upon every fresh occasion. As in the providence of God, so in 
 the grace of God, we not only in general <I>live, and have our 
 being,</I> but <I>move</I> in every particular action,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:28"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 28</A>.

 We have here an instance of the performance of that promise, <I>that
 God will give the Holy Spirit to those that ask him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13">Luke xi. 13</A>),
 
 for it was in answer to prayer that <I>they were filled with the Holy 
 Ghost:</I> and we have also an example of the improvement of that gift, 
 which is required of all on whom it is bestowed; have it and use it, 
 use it and have more of it. When <I>they were filled with the Holy
 Ghost, they spoke the word with all boldness;</I> for <I>the 
 ministration of the Spirit is given to every man, to profit withal.</I> 
 Talents must be traded with, not buried. When they find <I>the Lord God 
 help them</I> by his Spirit, they know they shall <I>not be 
 confounded,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart
 and of one soul: neither said any <I>of them</I> that ought of the
 things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things
 common.
 &nbsp; 33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
 resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them
 all.
 &nbsp; 34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as
 were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the
 prices of the things that were sold,
 &nbsp; 35 And laid <I>them</I> down at the apostles' feet: and distribution
 was made unto every man according as he had need.

 of the country of Cyprus,
 &nbsp; 37 Having land, sold <I>it,</I> and brought the money, and laid <I>it</I>
 at the apostles' feet.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have a general idea given us in these verses, and it is a very 
 beautiful one, of the spirit and state of this truly primitive church; 
 it is <I>conspectus s&aelig;culi--a view of that age</I> of infancy and
 innocence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The disciples loved one another dearly. Behold, how good and how 
 pleasant it was to see how <I>the multitude of those that believed were 
 of one heart, and of one soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and there was no such thing as discord nor division among them.
 Observe here, 

 1. There were multitudes that believed; even in Jerusalem, where the
 malignant influence of the chief priests was most strong, <I>there were 
 three thousand</I> converted on one day, and <I>five thousand</I> on 
 another, and, besides these, <I>there were added to the church 
 daily;</I> and no doubt they were all baptized, and made profession of 
 the faith; for the same Spirit that endued the apostles with courage to 
 preach the faith of Christ endued them with courage to confess it. 
 Note, The increase of the church is the glory of it, and the multitude 
 of those that believe, more than their quality. Now the church shines,
 and her light is come, when souls thus fly like a cloud into her bosom, 
 and <I>like doves to their windows,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1,8">Isa. lx. 1, 8</A>.

 2. They <I>were all of one heart, and of one soul.</I> Though there
 were many, very many, of different ages, tempers, and conditions, in 
 the world, who perhaps, before they believed, were perfect strangers to 
 one another, yet, when they met in Christ, they were as intimately 
 acquainted as if they had known one another many years. Perhaps they 
 had been of different sects among the Jews, before their conversion, or 
 had had discords upon civil accounts; but now these were all forgotten 
 and laid aside, and they were unanimous in the faith of Christ, and, 
 being all <I>joined to the Lord, they were joined to one another in 
 holy love.</I> This was the blessed fruit of Christ's dying precept to 
 his disciples, to <I>love one another,</I> and his dying prayer for 
 them, <I>that they all might be one.</I> We have reason to think they 
 divided themselves into several congregations, or worshipping 
 assemblies, according as their dwellings were, under their respective 
 ministers; and yet this occasioned no jealousy or uneasiness; for 
 <I>they were all of one heart, and one soul,</I> notwithstanding; and 
 loved those of other congregations as truly as those of their own. Thus 
 it was then, and we may not despair of seeing it so again, <I>when the 
 Spirit shall be poured out upon us from on high.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ministers went on in their work with great vigour and success 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of 
 the Lord Jesus.</I> The doctrine they preached was, the resurrection of 
 Christ: a matter of fact, which served not only for the confirmation of 
 the truth of Christ's holy religion, but being duly explained and 
 illustrated, with the proper inferences from it, served for a summary 
 of all the duties, privileges, and comforts of Christians. The 
 resurrection of Christ, rightly understood and improved, will let us 
 into the great mysteries of religion. By the great power wherewith the 
 apostles attested the resurrection may be meant, 

 1. The great vigour, spirit, and courage, with which they published and
 avowed this doctrine; they did it not softly and diffidently, but with 
 liveliness and resolution, as those that were themselves abundantly 
 satisfied of the truth of it, and earnestly desired that others should 
 be so too. Or,

 2. The miracles which they wrought to confirm their doctrine. With
 works of great power, they <I>gave witness to the resurrection of 
 Christ,</I> God himself, in them, <I>bearing witness</I> too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The beauty of the Lord our God shone upon them, and all their 
 performances: <I>Great grace was upon them all,</I> not only all the 
 apostles, but all the believers, <B><I>charis 
 megale</I></B>--<I>grace</I> that had something <I>great</I> in it
 (magnificent and very extraordinary) <I>was upon them all.</I> 

 1. Christ poured out abundance of <I>grace upon them,</I> such as
 qualified them for great services, by enduing them with <I>great 
 power;</I> it came <I>upon them</I> from on high, from above. 

 2. There were evident fruits of this grace in all they said and did,
 such as put an honour upon them, and recommended them to the favour of 
 God, as being in his sight <I>of great price.</I> 

 3. Some think it includes the favour they were in with the people.
 Every one saw a beauty and excellency in them, and respected them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They were very liberal to the poor, and dead to this world. This 
 was as great an evidence of the grace of God in them as any other, and 
 recommended them as much to the esteem of the people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They insisted not upon property, which even children seem to have a 
 sense of and a jealousy for, and which worldly people triumph in, as 
 Laban 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:43">Gen. xxxi. 43</A>):

 <I>All that thou seest is mine;</I> and Nabal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:11">1 Sam. xxv. 11</A>):

 <I>My bread and my water.</I> These believers were so taken up with the 
 hopes of an inheritance in the other world that this was as nothing to 
 them. <I>No man said that aught of the things which he possessed was
 his own,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 They did not take away property, but they were indifferent to it. They 
 did not call what they had their own, in a way of pride and vainglory, 
 boasting of it, or trusting in it. They did not call it their own,
 because they had, in affection, forsaken all for Christ, and were 
 continually expecting to be stripped of all for their adherence to him. 
 They did not say that aught was their own; for we can call nothing our 
 own but sin. What we have in the world is more God's than our own; we 
 have it from him, must use it for him, and are accountable for it to 
 him. <I>No man said that what he had was his own,</I>
 <B><I>idion</I></B>--<I>his peculiar;</I> for he was <I>ready to
 distribute, willing to communicate,</I> and desired not to eat his 
 morsel alone, but what he had to spare from himself and family his poor 
 neighbours were welcome to. Those that had estates were not solicitous 
 to lay up, but very willing to lay out, and would straiten themselves 
 to help their brethren. No marvel that <I>they were of one heart and 
 soul,</I> when they sat so loose to the wealth of this world; for 
 <I>meum--mine,</I> and <I>tuum--thine,</I> are the great makebates.
 Men's holding their own, and grasping at more than their own, are the 
 rise of wars and fightings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They abounded in charity, so that, in effect, <I>they had all things 
 common;</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 <I>there was not any among them that lacked,</I> but care was taken for 
 their supply. Those that had been maintained upon the public charity 
 were probably excluded when they turned Christians, and therefore it 
 was fit that the church should take care of them. As there were many 
 poor that received the gospel, so there were some rich that were able 
 to maintain them, and the grace of God made them willing. Those
 <I>that gather much have nothing over,</I> because what they have over 
 they have for those who gather little, that they may have no lack, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:14,15">2 Cor. viii. 14, 15</A>.

 The gospel hath laid <I>all things common,</I> not so that the poor are
 allowed to rob the rich, but so that the rich are appointed to relieve 
 the poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They did many of them sell their estates, to raise a fund for 
 charity: <I>As many as had possession of lands or houses sold them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot computes that this was the year of jubilee in the Jewish 
 nation, the fiftieth year (the twenty-eighth since they settled in 
 Canaan fourteen hundred years ago), so that, what was sold that year 
 being not to return till the next jubilee, lands then took a good 
 price, and so the sale of those lands would raise the more money.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We are here told what they did with the money that was so raised: 
 They <I>laid it at the apostles' feet</I>--the left it to them to be
 disposed of as they thought fit; probably they had their support from 
 it; for whence else could they have it? Observe, The apostles would
 have it laid at their feet, in token of their holy contempt of the 
 wealth of the world; they thought it fitter it should be laid at their 
 feet than lodged in their hands or in their bosoms. Being laid there, 
 it was not hoarded up, but <I>distribution was made,</I> by proper 
 persons, <I>unto every man according as he had need.</I> Great care 
 ought to be taken in the distribution of public charity, 

 [1.] That it be given to such as have need; such as are not able to 
 procure a competent maintenance of themselves, through age, infancy, 
 sickness, or bodily disability, or incapacity of mind, want either of 
 ingenuity or activity, cross providences, losses, oppressions, or a 
 numerous charge. Those who upon any of these accounts, or any other,
 have real need, and have not relations of their own to help them--but,
 above all, those that are reduced to want for well doing, and for 
 <I>the testimony of a good conscience,</I> ought to be taken care of, 
 and provided for, and, with such a prudent application of what is 
 given, as may be most for their benefit. 

 [2.] That it be given <I>to every man</I> for whom it is intended, 
 <I>according as he has need,</I> without partiality or respect of 
 persons. It is a rule in dispensing charity, as well as in 
 administering justice, <I>ut parium par sit ratio--that those who are
 equally needy and equally deserving should be equally helped,</I> and 
 that the charity should be suited and adapted to the necessity, as the 
 word is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is one particular person mentioned that was remarkable for 
 this generous charity: it was <I>Barnabas,</I> afterwards Paul's 
 colleague. Observe, 
 
 [1.] The account here given concerning him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 His name was <I>Joses;</I> he was of <I>the tribe of Levi,</I> for 
 there were Levites among the Jews of the dispersion, who, it is 
 probable, presided in their synagogue--worship, and, according to the
 duty of that tribe, <I>taught them the good knowledge of the Lord.</I> 
 He was born in Cyprus, a great way off from Jerusalem, his parents, 
 though Jews, having a settlement there. Notice is taken of the 
 apostles' changing his name after he associated with them. It is 
 probable that he was one of the seventy disciples, and, as he increased 
 in gifts and graces, grew eminent, and was respected by the apostles, 
 who, in token of their value for him, gave him a name, <I>Barnabas--the
 son of prophecy</I> (so it properly signifies), he being endued with 
 extraordinary gifts of prophecy. But the Hellenist Jews (saith Grotius) 
 called <I>praying</I> <B><I>paraklesis,</I></B> and therefore by that 
 word it is rendered here: <I>A son of exhortation</I> (so some), one 
 that had an excellent faculty of healing and persuading; we have an 
 instance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:22-24"><I>ch.</I> xi. 22-24</A>.

 <I>A son of consolation</I> (so we read it); one that did himself walk
 very much in <I>the comforts of the Holy Ghost</I>--a cheerful
 Christian, and this enlarged his heart in charity to the poor; or one 
 that was eminent for comforting the Lord's people, and speaking peace 
 to wounded troubled consciences; he had an admirable facility that way. 
 There were two among the apostles that were called <I>Boanerges--sons
 of thunder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:17">Mark iii. 17</A>);

 but here was a <I>son of consolation</I> with them. Each had his
 several gift. Neither must censure the other, but both case one 
 another; let the one search the wound, and then let the other heal it 
 and bind it up. 

 [2.] Here is an account of his charity, and great generosity to the 
 public fund. This is particularly taken notice of, because of the 
 eminency of his services afterwards in the church of God, especially in 
 carrying the gospel to the Gentiles; and, that this might not appear to 
 come from any ill-will to his own nation, we have here his benevolence 
 to the Jewish converts. Or perhaps this is mentioned because it was a 
 leading card, and an example to others: <I>He having land,</I> whether 
 in Cyprus, where he was born, or in Judea, where he now lived, or 
 elsewhere, is not certain, but <I>he sold it,</I> not to buy elsewhere 
 to advantage, but, as a Levite indeed, who knew he had the Lord God of
 Israel for his inheritance, he despised earthly inheritances, would be 
 encumbered no more with them, but <I>brought the money, and laid it at 
 the apostles' feet,</I> to be given in charity. Thus, as one that was 
 designed to be a preacher of the gospel, he disentangled himself from 
 the affairs of this life: and he lost nothing upon the balance of the 
 account, by laying the purchase-money at the apostles' feet, when he 
 himself was, in effect, numbered among the apostles, by that word of 
 the Holy Ghost, <I>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto 
 I have called them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 2</A>.

 Thus, for the respect he showed to the apostles as apostles, he had an
 apostle's reward.</P>
