 In the close of the foregoing chapter, the apostle had prayed earnestly
 for the Thessalonians, and now he desires their prayers, encouraging
 them to trust in God, to which he subjoins another petition for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 He then proceeds to give them commands and directions for correcting
 some things he was informed were amiss among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6-15">ver. 6-15</A>)

 and concludes with benedictions and prayers,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may
 have <I>free</I> course, and be glorified, even as <I>it is</I> with you:
 &nbsp; 2  And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked
 men: for all <I>men</I> have not faith.
 &nbsp; 3  But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep
 <I>you</I> from evil.
 &nbsp; 4  And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both
 do and will do the things which we command you.
 &nbsp; 5  And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and
 into the patient waiting for Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle desires the prayers of his friends: <I>Finally, 
 brethren, pray for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He always remembered them in his prayers, and would not have them 
 forget him and his fellow-labourers, but bear them on their hearts at 
 the throne of grace. Note,

 1. This is one way by which the communion of saints is kept us, not
 only by their praying together, or with one another, but by their 
 praying for one another when they are absent one from another. And thus 
 those who are at great distance may meet together at the throne of 
 grace; and thus those who are not capable of doing or receiving any 
 other kindness may yet this way do and receive real and very great 
 kindness. 

 2. It is the duty of people to pray for their ministers; and not only
 for their own pastors, but also for all good and faithful ministers. 
 And, 

 3. Ministers need, and therefore should desire, the prayers of their
 people. How remarkable is the humility, and how engaging the example, 
 of this great apostle, who was so mighty in prayer himself, and yet 
 despised not the prayers of the meanest Christian, but desired an 
 interest in them. Observe, further, what they are desired and directed 
 to pray for; namely,

 (1.) For the success of the gospel ministry: <I>That the word of the
 Lord may have free course, and be glorified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This was the great thing that Paul was most solicitous about. He was 
 more solicitous that God's name might be sanctified, his kingdom 
 advanced, and his will done, than he was about his own daily bread. He 
 desired that the word of the Lord might run (so it is in the original), 
 that it might get ground, that the interest of religion in the world 
 might go forward and not backward, and not only go forward, but go 
 apace. All the forces of hell were then, and still are, more or less, 
 raised and mustered to oppose the word of the Lord, to hinder its 
 publication and success. We should pray, therefore, that oppositions 
 may be removed, that so the gospel, may have free course to the ears, 
 the hearts, and the consciences of men, that it may be glorified in the 
 conviction and conversion of sinners, the confutation, of gainsayers, 
 and the holy conversation of the saints. God, who magnified the law, 
 and made it honourable, will glorify the gospel, and make that 
 honourable, and so will glorify his own name; and good ministers and 
 good Christians may very well be contented to be little, to be any 
 thing, to be nothing, if Christ be magnified and his gospel be 
 glorified. Paul was now at Athens, or, as some think, at Corinth, and 
 would have the Thessalonians pray that he might have as good success 
 there as he had at Thessalonica, that it might be as well with others 
 even as it was with them. Note, If ministers have been successful in 
 one place, they should desire to be successful in every place where 
 they may preach the gospel.

 (2.) For the safety of gospel ministers. He asks their prayers, nor for 
 preferment, but for preservation: <I>That we may be delivered from 
 unreasonable and wicked men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, Those who are enemies to the preaching of the gospel, and 
 persecutors of the faithful preachers of it, are unreasonable and 
 wicked men. They act against all the rules and laws of reason and 
 religion, and are guilty of the greatest absurdity and impiety. Not 
 only in the principles of atheism and infidelity, but also in the 
 practice of the vice and immorality, and especially in persecution, 
 there is the greatest absurdity in the world, as well as impiety. There 
 is need of the spiritual protection, as well as the assistance, of 
 godly and faithful ministers, for these are as the standard-bearers, 
 who are most struck at; and therefore all who wish well to the interest 
 of Christ in the world should pray for them. <I>For all men have not
 faith;</I> that is, many do not believe the gospel; they will not 
 embrace it themselves, and no wonder if such are restless and malicious 
 in their endeavours to oppose the gospel, decry the ministry, and 
 disgrace the ministers of the word; and too many have not common faith 
 or honesty; there is no confidence that we can safely put in them, and 
 we should pray to be delivered from those who have no conscience nor 
 honour, who never regard what they say or do. We may sometimes be in as 
 much or more danger from false and pretended friends as from open and 
 avowed enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages them to trust in God. We should not only pray to God 
 for his grace, but also place our trust and confidence in his grace, 
 and humbly expect what we pray for. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the good is which we may expect from the grace of 
 God-establishment, and preservation from evil; and the best Christians 
 stand in need of these benefits. 

 (1.) That God would establish them. This the apostle had prayed for on
 their behalf

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:17">
 <I>ch.</I> 2:17</A>),

 and now he encourages them to expect this favour. We stand no longer
 than God holds us up; unless he <I>hold up our goings in his paths, our 
 feet will slide,</I> and we shall fall. 

 (2.) That God will keep them from evil. We have as much need of the 
 grace of God for our perseverance to the end as for the beginning of 
 the good work. The evil of sin is the greatest evil, but there are 
 other evils which God will also preserve his saints from--the evil that 
 is in the world, yea, from all evil, to his heavenly kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What encouragement we have to depend upon the grace of God: <I>The 
 Lord is faithful.</I> He is faithful to his promises, and is the Lord 
 who cannot lie, who will not alter the thing that has gone out of his 
 mouth. When once the promise therefore is made, performance is sure and 
 certain. He is faithful to his relation, a faithful God and a faithful 
 friend; we may depend upon his filling up all the relations he stands 
 in to his people. Let it be our care to be true and faithful in our 
 promises, and to the relations we stand in to this faithful God. He 
 adds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A further ground of hope that God would do this for them, seeing 
 they did and would do the things they were commanded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The apostle had this confidence in them, and this was founded upon his 
 confidence in God; for there is otherwise no confidence in man. Their 
 obedience is described by doing what he and his fellow-labourers had 
 commanded them, which was no other thing than the commandments of the 
 Lord; for the apostles themselves had no further commission than to 
 teach men <I>to observe and to do what the Lord had commanded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 And as the experience the apostle had of their obedience for the time
 past was one ground of his confidence that they would do the things 
 commanded them for the time to come, so this is one ground to hope that 
 <I>whatsoever we ask of God we shall receive of him, because we keep 
 his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his 
 sight,</I> 1 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:22">John iii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He makes a short prayer for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is a prayer for spiritual blessings. Two things of the greatest 
 importance the apostle prays for:--

 1. That their hearts may be brought into the love of God, to be in love
 with God as the most excellent and amiable Being, the best of all 
 beings; and this is not only most reasonable and necessary in order to 
 our happiness, but is our happiness itself; it is a great part of the 
 happiness of heaven itself, where this love shall be made perfect. We 
 can never attain to this unless God by his grace direct our hearts 
 aright, for our love is apt to go astray after other things. Note, We
 sustain a great deal of damage by misplacing our affections; it is our 
 sin and our misery that we place our affections upon wrong objects. If 
 God directs our love aright upon himself, the rest of the affections 
 will thereby be rectified. 

 2. That a <I>patient waiting for Christ</I> may be joined with this
 love of God. There is no true love of God without faith in Jesus 
 Christ. We must wait for Christ, which supposes our faith in him, that 
 we believe he came once in flesh and will come again in glory: and we 
 must expect this second coming of Christ, and be careful to get ready 
 for it; there must be a patient waiting, enduring with courage and 
 constancy all that we may meet with in the mean time: and we <I>have 
 need of patience,</I> and need of divine grace to exercise Christian 
 patience, the <I>patience of Christ</I> (as some read the word), 
 patience for Christ's sake and after Christ's example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
 walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received
 of us.
 &nbsp; 7  For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved
 not ourselves disorderly among you;
 &nbsp; 8  Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought
 with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be
 chargeable to any of you:
 &nbsp; 9  Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an
 ensample unto you to follow us.
 &nbsp; 10  For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that
 if any would not work, neither should he eat.
 &nbsp; 11  For we hear that there are some which walk among you
 disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
 &nbsp; 12  Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord
 Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own
 bread.
 &nbsp; 13  But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
 &nbsp; 14  And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that
 man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
 &nbsp; 15  Yet count <I>him</I> not as an enemy, but admonish <I>him</I> as a
 brother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having commended their obedience for the time past, and 
 mentioned his confidence in their obedience for the time to come, 
 proceeds to give them commands and directions to some who were faulty, 
 correcting some things that were amiss among them. Observe, The best 
 society of Christians may have some faulty persons among them, and some 
 things that ought to be reformed. Perfection is not to be found on this 
 side heaven: but evil manners beget good laws; the disorders that Paul 
 heard of as existing among the Thessalonians occasioned the good laws 
 we find in these verses, which are of constant use to us, and all 
 others whom they may concern. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That which was amiss among the Thessalonians, which is 
 expressed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. More generally. There were some who <I>walked disorderly, not after 
 the tradition they received</I> from the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Some of the brethren were guilty of this disorderly walking; they did 
 not live regularly, nor govern themselves according to the rules of 
 Christianity, nor agreeably to their profession of religion; not 
 according to the precepts delivered by the apostle, which they had 
 received, and pretended to pay a regard to. Note, It is required of 
 those who have received the gospel, and who profess a subjection to it, 
 that they live according to the gospel. If they do not, they are to be 
 counted disorderly persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In particular, there were among them some <I>idle persons and 
 busy-bodies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This the apostle was so credibly informed of that he had sufficient 
 reason to give commands and directions with relation to such persons, 
 how they ought to behave, and how the church should act towards them.

 (1.) There were some among them who were idle, <I>not working at 
 all,</I> or doing nothing. It does not appear that they were gluttons 
 or drunkards, but idle, and therefore disorderly people. It is not 
 enough for any to say they do no hurt; for it is required of all 
 persons that they do good in the places and relations in which 
 Providence has placed them. It is probable that these persons had a 
 notion (by misunderstanding some passages in the former epistle) 
 concerning the near approach of the coming of Christ, which served them 
 for a pretence to leave off the work of their callings, and live in 
 idleness. Note, It is a great error, or abuse of religion, to make it a 
 cloak for idleness or any other sin. If we were sure that the day of 
 judgment were ever so near, we must, notwithstanding, do the work of 
 the day in its day, that when our Lord comes he may find us doing. The 
 servant who waits for the coming of his Lord aright must be working as 
 his Lord has commanded, that all may be ready when he comes. Or, it may 
 be, these disorderly persons pretended that the liberty wherewith 
 Christ had made them free discharged them from the services and 
 business of their particular callings and employments in the world: 
 where as they were <I>to abide in the same calling wherein they were 
 called of God, and therein abide with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:20,24">1 Cor. vii. 20, 24</A>.

 Industry in our particular callings as men is a duty required of us by 
 our general calling as Christians. Or perhaps the general charity there 
 was then among Christians to their poor brethren encouraged some to 
 live in idleness, as knowing the church would maintain them: whatever 
 was the cause, they were much to blame.

 (2.) There were busy-bodies among them: and it should seem, by the
 connection, that the same persons who were idle were busy-bodies also. 
 This may seem to be a contradiction; but so it is, that most commonly 
 those persons who have no business of their own to do, or who neglect 
 it, busy themselves in other men's matters. If we are idle, the devil
 and a corrupt heart will soon find us something to do. The mind of man 
 is a busy thing; if it be not employed in doing good, it will be doing 
 evil. Note, Busy-bodies are disorderly walkers, such as are guilty of 
 vain curiosity, and impertinent meddling with things that do not 
 concern them, and troubling themselves and others with other men's 
 matters. The apostle warns Timothy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13">1 Tim. v. 13</A>)

 to beware of such <I>as learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
 house, and are not only idle, but tatlers also, and busy-bodies, 
 speaking things which they ought not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good laws which were occasioned by these evil manners, 
 concerning which we may take notice,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whose laws they are: they are commands of the apostles of our Lord, 
 given in the name of their Lord and ours, that is, the commands of our 
 Lord himself. <I>We command you, brethren, in the name of the Lord 
 Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Again, <I>We command and exhort you by our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The apostle uses words of authority and entreaty: and, where disorders 
 are to be rectified or prevented, there is need of both. The authority 
 of Christ should awe our minds to obedience, and his grace and goodness 
 should allure us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the good laws and rules are. The apostle gives directions to 
 the whole church, commands to those disorderly persons, and an 
 exhortation to those in particular who did well among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His commands and directions to the whole church regard, 

 [1.] Their behaviour towards the disorderly persons who were among 
 them, which is thus expressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to <I>withdraw themselves from such,</I> and afterwards to <I>mark that 
 man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed; yet not to 
 count him as an enemy, but to admonish him as a brother.</I> The 
 directions of the apostle are carefully to be observed in our conduct 
 towards disorderly persons. We must be very cautious in church-censures 
 and church-discipline. We must, <I>First,</I> Note that man who is 
 suspected or charged with not obeying the word of God, or walking 
 contrary thereto, that is, we must have sufficient proof of his fault 
 before we proceed further. We must, <I>Secondly,</I> Admonish him in a 
 friendly manner; we must put him in mind of his sin, and of his duty; 
 and this should be done privately 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:15">Matt. xviii. 15</A>);

 then, if he will not hear, we must, <I>Thirdly,</I> Withdraw from him, 
 and not keep company with him, that is, we must avoid familiar converse 
 and society with such, for two reasons, namely, that we may not learn 
 his evil ways; for he who follows vain and idle persons, and keeps 
 company with such, is in danger of becoming like them. Another reason 
 is for the shaming, and so the reforming, of those that offend, that 
 when idle and disorderly persons see how their loose practices are 
 disliked by all wise and good people they may be ashamed of them, and 
 walk more orderly. Love therefore to the persons of our offending
 brethren, even when we hate their vices, should be the motive of our
 withdrawing from them; and even those who are under the censures of the
 church must not be accounted as enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 for, if they be reclaimed and reformed by these censures, they will 
 recover their credit and comfort, and right to church-privileges as 
 brethren. 

 [2.] Their general conduct and behaviour ought to be according to the 
 good example the apostle and those who were with him had given them: 
 <I>Yourselves know how you ought to follow us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those who planted religion among them had set a good example before 
 them; and the ministers of the gospel should be ensamples to the flock.
 It is the duty of Christians not only to walk according to the 
 traditions of the apostles, and the doctrines they preached, but also 
 according to the good example they set before them, <I>to be followers 
 of them so far as they were followers of Christ.</I> The particular 
 good example the apostle mentions was their diligence, which was so 
 different from what was found in the disorderly walkers he takes notice 
 of: "<I>We behaved not ourselves disorderly among you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 we did not spend our time idly, in idle visits, idle talk, idle 
 sports." They took pains in their ministry, in preaching the gospel, 
 and in getting their own living. <I>Neither did we eat any man's bread 
 for nought,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Though he might justly have demanded a maintenance, because those who 
 preach the gospel may of right expect to live by the gospel. This is a 
 just debt that people owe to their ministers, and the apostle had power 
 or authority to have demanded this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 but he waived his right from affection to them, and for the sake of the
 gospel, and that he might be an example for them to follow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that they might learn how to fill up time, and always be employed in
 something that would turn to good account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He commands and directs those that live idle lives to reform, and 
 set themselves to their business. He had given commandments to this 
 purport, as well as a good example of this, when he was among them: 
 <I>Even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any man 
 would not work neither should he eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It was a proverbial speech among the Jews, <I>He who does not labour 
 does not deserve to eat.</I> The labourer is worthy of his meat; but 
 what is the loiterer worthy of? It is the will of God that every man 
 should have a calling, and mind his calling, and make a business of it, 
 and that none should live like useless drones in the world. Such 
 persons do what in them lies to defeat the sentence, <I>In the sweat of 
 thy face shalt thou eat thy bread.</I> It was not the mere humour of 
 the apostle, who was an active stirring man himself and therefore would 
 have every body else to be so too, but it was the command of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ, that <I>with quietness we work, and eat our own 
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Men ought some way or other to earn their own living, otherwise they do 
 not eat their own bread. Observe, There must be work or labour, in 
 opposition to idleness; and there must be quietness, in opposition to 
 being busy-bodies in other men's matters. We must study to be quiet, 
 and do our own business. This is an excellent but rare composition, to 
 be of an active yet quiet spirit, active in our own business and yet 
 quiet as to other people's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He exhorts <I>those that did well not to</I> be <I>weary in 
 well-doing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 as if he had said, "Go on and prosper. The Lord is with you while you 
 are with him. See that whatever you do, that is good, you persevere 
 therein. Hold on your way, and hold out to the end. You must never
 give over, nor tire in your work. It will be time enough to rest when 
 you come to heaven, that <I>everlasting rest which remains for the 
 people of God.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this conclusion of the epistle we have the apostle's benediction and 
 prayers for these Thessalonians. Let us desire them for ourselves and 
 our friend. There are three blessings pronounced upon them, or desired 
 for them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God would give them peace. Note, 

 1. Peace is the blessing pronounced or desired. By peace we may
 understand all manner of prosperity; here it may signify, in 
 particular, peace with God, peace in their own minds and consciences, 
 peace among themselves, and peace with all men. 

 2. This peace is desired for them always, or in every thing; and he
 desired they might have all good things at all times. 

 3. Peace by all means: that, as they enjoyed the means of grace, they
 might with success use all the means and methods of peace too; for 
 peace is often difficult, as it is always desirable. 

 4. That God would give them peace, who is the Lord of peace. If we have
 any peace that is desirable, God must give it, who is the <I>author of 
 peace and lover of concord.</I> We shall neither have peaceable 
 dispositions ourselves nor find men disposed to be at peace with us, 
 unless the God of peace give us both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the presence of God might be with them: <I>The Lord be with 
 you all.</I> We need nothing more to make us safe and happy, nor can we 
 desire any thing better for ourselves and our friends, than to have 
 God's gracious presence with us and them. This will be a guide and
 guard in every way that we may go, and our comfort in every condition 
 we may be in. It is the presence of God that makes heaven to be heaven, 
 and this will make this earth to be like heaven. No matter where we are 
 if God be with us, nor who is absent if God be with us, nor who is 
 absent if God be present with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the <I>grace of our Lord Jesus Christ might be with them.</I> 
 So this apostle concluded his first epistle to these Thessalonians; and 
 it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that we may 
 comfortably hope to have peace with God and enjoy the presence of God,
 for he has made those nigh that were afar off. It is this grace that is 
 all in all to make us happy. This is what the apostle admired and 
 magnified on all occasions, what he delighted and trusted in; and by 
 this salutation or benediction, written with his own hand, as the token 
 of every epistle (when the rest was written by an amanuensis), he took 
 care lest the churches he wrote to should be imposed on by counterfeit 
 epistles, which he knew would be of dangerous consequence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us be thankful that we have the canon of scripture complete, and by 
 the wonderful and special care of divine Providence preserved pure and 
 uncorrupt through so many successive ages, and not dare to add to it,
 nor diminish from it. Let us believe the divine original of the sacred 
 scriptures, and conform our faith and practice to this our sufficient 
 and only rule, <I>which is able to make us wise unto salvation, through 
 faith which is in Christ Jesus.</I> Amen.</P>
