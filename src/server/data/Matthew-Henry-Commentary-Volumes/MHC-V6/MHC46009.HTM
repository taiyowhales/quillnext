 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle seems to answer some cavils against
 himself.

 I. He asserts his apostolical mission and authority, and gives in his
 success among them as a testimony to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He claims a right to subsist by his ministry, and defends it by
 several arguments from natural reason and the Mosaical law, and asserts
 it also to be a constitution of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:3-14">ver. 3-14</A>.

 III. He shows that he had willingly waived this privilege and power for
 their benefit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 IV. He specifies several other things, in which he had denied himself
 for the sake of other men's spiritual interest and salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>.

 And,

 V. Concludes his argument by showing what animated him to this course,
 even the prospect of an incorruptible crown, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:24-27">ver. 24, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Blessed Paul, in the work of his ministry, not only met with opposition 
 from those without, but discouragement from those within. He was under 
 reproach; false brethren questioned his apostleship, and were very 
 industrious to lessen his character and sink his reputation; 
 particularly here at Corinth, a place to which he had been instrumental 
 in doing much good, and from which he had deserved well; and yet there 
 were those among them who upon these heads created him great 
 uneasiness. Note, It is no strange nor new thing for a minister to meet 
 with very unkind returns for great good-will to a people, and diligent 
 and successful services among them. Some among the Corinthians 
 questioned, if they did not disown, his apostolical character. To their 
 cavils he here answers, and in such a manner as to set forth himself as 
 a remarkable example of that self-denial, for the good of others, which 
 he had been recommending in the former chapter. And, 

 1. He asserts his apostolical mission and character: <I>Am I not an 
 apostle? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?</I> To be a witness of 
 his resurrection was one great branch of the apostolical charge. "Now," 
 says Paul, "have not I seen the Lord, though not immediately after his 
 resurrection, yet since his ascent?" See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:8"><I>ch.</I> iv. 8</A>.

 "<I>Am I not free?</I> Have I not the same commission, and charge, and
 powers, with the other apostles? What respect, or honour, or 
 subsistence, can they challenge, which I am not at liberty to demand as 
 well as they?" It was not because he had no right to live of the gospel 
 that he maintained himself with his own hands, but for other reasons. 
 
 2. He offers the success of his ministry among them, and the good he
 had done to them, as a proof of his apostleship: "<I>Are not you my 
 work in the Lord?</I> Through the blessing of Christ on my labours, 
 have not I raised a church among you? <I>The seal of my apostleship
 are you in the Lord.</I> Your conversion by my means is a confirmation 
 from God of my mission." Note, The ministers of Christ should not think 
 it strange to be put upon the proof of their ministry by some who have 
 had experimental evidence of the power of it and the presence of God 
 with it. 

 3. He justly upbraids the Corinthians with their disrespect:
 "<I>Doubtless, if I am not an apostle to others, I am so to you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 I have laboured so long, and with so much success, among you, that you, 
 above all others, should own and honour my character, and not call it 
 in question." Note, It is no new thing for faithful ministers to meet 
 with the worst treatment where they might expect the best. This church 
 at Corinth had as much reason to believe, and as little reason to 
 question, his apostolical mission, as any; they had as much reason, 
 perhaps more than any church, to pay him respect. He had been
 instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge and faith of Christ; he 
 laboured long among them, nearly two years, and he laboured to good 
 purpose, <I>God having much people among them.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:10,11">Acts xviii. 10, 11</A>.
 
 It was aggravated ingratitude for this people to call in question his
 authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
 &nbsp; 4  Have we not power to eat and to drink?
 &nbsp; 5  Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as
 other apostles, and <I>as</I> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
 &nbsp; 6  Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
 &nbsp; 7  Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth
 a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a
 flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
 &nbsp; 8  Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same
 also?
 &nbsp; 9  For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle
 the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take
 care for oxen?
 &nbsp; 10  Or saith he <I>it</I> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
 doubt, <I>this</I> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in
 hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of
 his hope.
 &nbsp; 11  If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <I>is it</I> a great
 thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
 &nbsp; 12  If others be partakers of <I>this</I> power over you, <I>are</I> not
 we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer
 all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things
 live <I>of the things</I> of the temple? and they which wait at the
 altar are partakers with the altar?
 &nbsp; 14  Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
 gospel should live of the gospel.
 </FONT></P>

 Having asserted his apostolical authority, he proceeds to claim the 
 rights belonging to his office, especially that of being maintained by 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. These he states, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:3-6"><I>v.</I> 3-6</A>.

 "<I>My answer to those that do examine me</I> (that is, enquire into my 
 authority, or the reasons of my conduct, if I am an apostle) is this: 
 <I>Have we not power to eat and drink</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 or a right to maintenance? <I>Have we not power to lead about a
 sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the 
 Lord, and Cephas;</I> and, not only to be maintained ourselves, but 
 have them maintained also?" Though Paul was at that time single, he had 
 a right to take a wife when he pleased, and to lead her about with him, 
 and expect a maintenance for her, as well as himself, from the 
 churches. Perhaps Barnabas had a wife, as the other apostles certainly 
 had, and led them about with them. For that a wife is here to be 
 understood by the <I>sister-woman</I>~<B><I>adelphen gynaika,</I></B> 
 is plain from this, that it would have been utterly unfit for the 
 apostles to have carried about women with them unless they were wives. 
 The word implies that they had power over them, and could require their 
 attendance on them, which none could have over any but wives or 
 servants. Now the apostles, who worked for their bread, do not seem to 
 have been in a capacity to buy or have servants to carry with them.
 Not to observe that it would have raised suspicion to have carried 
 about even women-servants, and much more other women to whom they were 
 not married, for which the apostles would never give any occasion. The 
 apostle therefore plainly asserts he had a right to marry as well as 
 other apostles, and claim a maintenance for his wife, nay, and his 
 children too, if he had any, from the churches, without labouring with 
 his own hands to procure it. <I>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we 
 power to for bear working?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 In short, the apostle here claims a maintenance from the churches, both 
 for him and his. This was due from them, and what he might claim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proceeds, by several arguments, to prove his claim. 

 1. From the common practice and expectations of mankind. Those who
 addict and give themselves up to any way of business in the world 
 expect to live out of it. Soldiers expect to be paid for their service. 
 Husbandmen and shepherds expect to get a livelihood out of their 
 labours. If they plant vineyards, and dress and cultivate them, it is 
 with expectation of fruit; if they feed a flock, it is with the 
 expectation of being fed and clothed by it! <I>Who goeth a warfare at
 any time at his own charge? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the 
 fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not the milk 
 thereof?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 Note, It is very natural, and very reasonable, for ministers to expect 
 a livelihood out of their labours. 

 2. He argues it out of the Jewish law: <I>Say I these things as a man?
 Or saith not the law the same also?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Is this merely a dictate of common reason and according to common usage 
 only? No, it is also consonant to the old law. God had therein ordered 
 that the ox should not be muzzled while he was treading out the corn, 
 nor hindered from eating while he was preparing the corn for man's use, 
 and treading it out of the ear. But this law was not chiefly given out 
 of God's regard to oxen, or concern for them, but to teach mankind that 
 all due encouragement should be given to those who are employed by us, 
 or labouring for our good--that the labourers should taste of the fruit 
 of their labours. <I>Those who plough should plough in hope; and those 
 who thresh in hope should be partakers of their hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The law saith this about oxen for our sakes. Note, Those that lay
 themselves out to do our souls good should not have their mouths 
 muzzled, but have food provided for them. 

 3. He argues from common equity: <I>If we have sown unto you spiritual
 things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</I> 
 What they had sown was much better than they expected to reap. They had 
 taught them the way to eternal life, and laboured heartily to put them 
 in possession of it. It was no great matter, surely, while they were 
 giving themselves up to this work, to expect a support of their own 
 temporal life. They had been instruments of conveying to them the 
 greater spiritual blessings; and had they no claim to as great a share 
 in their carnal things as was necessary to subsist them? Note, Those 
 who enjoy spiritual benefits by the ministry of the word should not 
 grudge a maintenance to such as are employed in this work. If they have 
 received a real benefit, one would think they could not grudge them 
 this. What, get so much good by them, and yet grudge to do so little 
 good to them! Is this grateful or equitable? 

 4. He argues from the maintenance they afforded others: "<I>If others
 are partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?</I> You allow 
 others this maintenance, and confess their claim just; but who has so 
 just a claim as I from the church of Corinth? Who has given greater 
 evidence of the apostolic mission? Who had laboured so much for your 
 good, or done like service among you?" Note, Ministers should be valued 
 and provided for according to their worth. "<I>Nevertheless,</I>" says
 the apostle, "<I>we have not used this power; but suffer all things, 
 lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</I> We have not insisted on 
 our right, but have rather been in straits to serve the interests of 
 the gospel, and promote the salvation of souls." He renounced his 
 right, rather than by claiming it he would hinder his success. He 
 denied himself, for fear of giving offence; but asserted his right lest 
 his self-denial should prove prejudicial to the ministry. Note, He is 
 likely to plead most effectually for the rights of others who shows a 
 generous disregard to his own. It is plain, in this case, that justice, 
 and not self-love, is the principle by which he is actuated. 

 5. He argues from the old Jewish establishment: "<I>Do you not know
 that those who minister about holy things live of the things of the 
 temple, and those who wait at the altar are partakers with the 
 altar?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And, if the Jewish priesthood was maintained out of the holy things 
 that were then offered, shall not Christ's ministers have a maintenance 
 out of their ministry? Is there not as much reason that we should be 
 maintained as they?" He asserts it to be the institution of Christ: 
 "<I>Even so hath the Lord ordained that those who preach the gospel 
 should live of the gospel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 should have a right to a maintenance, though not bound to demand it, 
 and insist upon it." It is the people's duty to maintain their 
 minister, by Christ's appointment, though it be not a duty bound on 
 every minister to call for or accept it. He may waive his right, as 
 Paul did, without being a sinner; but those transgress an appointment 
 of Christ who deny or withhold it. Those who preach the gospel have a 
 right to live by it; and those who attend on their ministry, and yet 
 take no thought about their subsistence, fail very much in their duty 
 to Christ, and respect owing to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
 these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <I>it were</I>
 better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying
 void.
 &nbsp; 16  For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of:
 for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach
 not the gospel!
 &nbsp; 17  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if
 against my will, a dispensation <I>of the gospel</I> is committed unto
 me.
 &nbsp; 18  What is my reward then? <I>Verily</I> that, when I preach the
 gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I
 abuse not my power in the gospel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here he tells them that he had, notwithstanding, waived his privilege, 
 and lays down his reason for doing it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells them that he had neglected to claim his right in times 
 past: <I>I have used none of these things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He neither ate nor drank himself at their cost, nor led about a wife to 
 be maintained by them, nor forbore working to maintain himself. From 
 others he received a maintenance, but not from them, for some special 
 reasons. Nor did he write this to make his claim now. Though he here
 asserts his right, yet he does not claim his due; but denies himself 
 for their sakes, and the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the reason assigned of his exercising this self-denial. He 
 would not have his glorying made void: <I>It were better for his to die 
 than that any man should make his glorying void,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This glorying did imply nothing in it of boasting, or self-conceit, or 
 catching at applause, but a high degree of satisfaction and comfort. It 
 was a singular pleasure to him to preach the gospel without making it 
 burdensome; and he was resolved that among them he would not lose this 
 satisfaction. His advantages for promoting the gospel were his glory, 
 and he valued them above his rights, or his very life: <I>Better were 
 it for him to die than to have his glorying made void,</I> than to have 
 it justly said that he preferred his wages to his work. No, he was 
 ready to deny himself for the sake of the gospel. Note, It is the glory 
 of a minister to prefer the success of his ministry to his interest, 
 and deny himself, that he may serve Christ, and save souls. Not that in 
 so doing he does more than he ought; he is still acting within the 
 bounds of the law of charity. But he acts upon truly noble principles, 
 he brings much honour to God in so doing; and those that honour him he 
 will honour. It is what God will approve and commend, what a man may 
 value himself for and take comfort in, though he cannot make a merit of 
 it before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows that this self-denial was more honourable in itself, and 
 yielded him much more content and comfort, than his preaching did: 
 "<I>Though I preach the gospel, I have nothing whereof to glory; for 
 necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the 
 gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It is my charge, my business; it is the work for which I am constituted 
 an apostle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>.

 This is a duty expressly bound upon me. It is not in any degree a
 matter of liberty. <I>Necessity is upon me.</I> I am false and
 unfaithful to my trust, I break a plain and express command, and <I>woe 
 be to me, if I do not preach the gospel.</I>" Those who are set apart 
 to the office of the ministry have it in charge to preach the gospel. 
 Woe be to them if they do not. From this none is excepted. But it is
 not given in charge to all, nor any preacher of the gospel, to do his 
 work gratis, to preach and have no maintenance out of it. It is not 
 said, "Woe be to him if he do not preach the gospel, and yet maintain 
 himself." In this point he is more at liberty. It may be his duty to 
 preach at some seasons, and under some circumstances, without receiving 
 a maintenance for it; but he has, in the general, a right to it, and 
 may expect it from those among whom he labours. When he renounces this 
 right for the sake of the gospel and the souls of men, though he does 
 not supererogate, yet he denies himself, waives his privilege and 
 right; he does more than his charge and office in general, and at all 
 times, obliges him to. Woe be to him if he do not preach the gospel; 
 but it may sometimes be his duty to insist on his maintenance for so 
 doing, and whenever he forbears to claim it he parts with his right, 
 though a man may sometimes be bound to do so by the general duties of 
 love to God and charity to men. Note, It is a high attainment in 
 religion to renounce our own rights for the good of others; this will 
 entitle to a peculiar reward from God. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle here informs us that doing our duty with a willing mind 
 will meet with a gracious recompence from God: <I>If I do this 
 thing,</I> that is, either preach the gospel or take no maintenance, 
 <I>willingly, I have a reward.</I> Indeed, it is willing service only 
 that is capable of reward from God. It is not the bare doing of any 
 duty, but the doing of it heartily (that is, willingly and cheerfully) 
 that God has promised to reward. Leave the heart out of our duties, and 
 God abhors them: they are but the carcasses, without the life and 
 spirit, of religion. Those must preach willingly who would be accepted 
 of God in this duty. They must make their business a pleasure, and not 
 esteem it a drudgery. And those who, out of regard to the honour of God 
 or good of souls, give up their claim to a maintenance, should do this 
 duty willingly, if they would be accepted in it or rewarded for it. But 
 whether the duty of the office be done willingly or with reluctance, 
 whether the heart be in it or averse from it, all in office have a 
 trust and charge from God, for which they must be accountable. 
 Ministers have a dispensation of the gospel, or 
 <I>stewardship</I>--<B><I>oikonomia</I></B> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:2">Luke xvi. 2</A>),

 committed to them. Note, Christ's willing servants shall not fail of a 
 recompence, and that proportioned to their fidelity, zeal, and 
 diligence; and his slothful and unwilling servants shall all be called 
 to an account. Taking his name, and professing to do his business,
 will make men accountable at his bar. And how sad an account have 
 slothful servants to give!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The apostle sums up the argument, by laying before them the 
 encouraging hope he had of a large recompence for his remarkable 
 self-denial: <I>What is my reward then?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 What is it I expect a recompence from God for? <I>That when I preach 
 the gospel I may make it without charge, that I abuse not my power in 
 the gospel.</I> Or, "not so to claim my rights as to make them destroy 
 the great intentions and ends of my office, but renounce them for the 
 sake of these." It is an abuse of power to employ it against the very 
 ends for which it is given. And the apostle would never use his power, 
 or privilege of being maintained by his ministry, so as to frustrate 
 the ends of it, but would willingly and cheerfully deny himself for the 
 honour of Christ and the interest of souls. That ministers who follows 
 his example may have cheerful expectations of a full recompence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle takes occasion from what he had before discoursed to 
 mention some other instances of his self-denial and parting with his 
 liberty for the benefit of others.</P>

 I. He asserts his liberty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Though I be free from all men.</I> He was free-born, a citizen of 
 Rome. He was in bondage to none, nor depended upon any for his 
 subsistence; <I>yet he made himself a servant to all, that he might 
 gain the more.</I> He behaved as a servant; he laboured for their good 
 as a servant; he was careful to please, as a servant to his master; he 
 acted in many cases as if he had no privileges; and this that he might 
 gain the more, or make the more converts to Christianity. He made
 himself a servant, that they might be made free.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He specifies some particulars wherein he made himself a servant to 
 all. He accommodated himself to all sorts of people. 

 1. <I>To the Jews, and those under the law, he became a Jew,</I> and as
 under the law, to gain them. Though he looked on the ceremonial law as 
 a yoke taken off by Christ, yet in many instances he submitted to it, 
 that he might work upon the Jews, remove their prejudices, prevail with 
 them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. 

 2. <I>To those that are without the law as without law</I> that is, to
 the Gentiles, whether converted to the Christian faith or not. In 
 innocent things he could comply with people's usages or humours for 
 their advantage. He would reason with the philosophers in their own 
 way. And, as to converted Gentiles, he behaved among them as one that 
 was not under the bondage of the Jewish laws, as he had asserted and 
 maintained concerning them, though he did not act as a lawless person, 
 but as one who was bound by the laws of Christ. He would transgress no 
 laws of Christ to please or humour any man; but he would accommodate 
 himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Paul 
 was the apostle of the Gentiles, and so, one would have thought, might 
 have excused himself from complying with the Jews; and yet, to do them 
 good, and win them over to Christ, he did, in innocent things, neglect 
 the power he had to do otherwise, and conformed to some of their usages 
 and laws. And though he might, by virtue of that character, have 
 challenged authority over the Gentiles, yet he accommodated himself, as 
 much as he innocently might, to their prejudices and ways of thinking. 
 Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, so that he 
 might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges and punctilios.

 3. <I>To the weak he became as weak, that he might gain the weak,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He was willing to make the best of them. He did not despise nor judge
 them, but became as one of them, forbore to use his liberty for their 
 sake, and was careful to lay no stumbling-block in their way. Where 
 any, through the weakness of their understanding, or the strength of 
 their prejudices, were likely to fall into sin, or fall off from the 
 gospel into heathen idolatry, through his use of his liberty, he 
 refrained himself. He denied himself for their sakes, that he might
 insinuate into their affections, and gain their souls. In short, <I>he 
 became all things to all men, that he might by all means</I> (all 
 lawful means) <I>gain some.</I> He would not sin against God to save 
 the soul of his neighbour, but he would very cheerfully and readily 
 deny himself. The rights of God he could not give up, but he might 
 resign his own, and he very often did so for the good of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He assigns his reason for acting in this manner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>This I do for the gospel's sake, and that I may be partaker thereof 
 with you;</I> that is, for the honour of Christ, whose the gospel is, 
 and for the salvation of souls, for which it was designed, and that he 
 and they might communicate in the privileges of it, or partake together 
 of them. For these ends did he thus condescend, deny himself as to his 
 liberty, and accommodate himself to the capacities and usages of those 
 with whom he had to do, where he lawfully might. Note, A heart warmed 
 with zeal for God, and breathing after the salvation of men, will not 
 plead and insist upon rights and privileges in bar to this design.
 Those manifestly abuse their power in the gospel who employ it not to 
 edification but destruction, and therefore breathe nothing of its 
 spirit.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle hints at the great encouragement he had to 
 act in this manner. He had a glorious prize, an incorruptible crown, in 
 view. Upon this head he compares himself to the racers and combatants 
 in the Isthmian games, an allusion well known to the Corinthians, 
 because they were celebrated in their neighbourhood: "<I>Know you not 
 that those who run in a race run all, but one obtaineth the prize?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 All run at your games, but only one gets the race and wins the crown." 
 And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He excites them to their duty: "<I>So run that you may obtain.</I> 
 It is quite otherwise in the Christian race than in your races; only 
 one wins the prize in them. You may all run so as to obtain. You have 
 great encouragement, therefore, to persist constantly, and diligently, 
 and vigorously, in your course. There is room for all to get the prize. 
 You cannot fail if you run well. Yet there should be a noble emulation; 
 you should endeavour to outdo one another. And it is a glorious contest 
 who shall get first to heaven, or have the best rewards in that blessed 
 world. I make it my endeavour to run; so do you, as you see me go 
 before you." Note, It is the duty of Christians to follow their 
 ministers closely in the chase of eternal glory, and the honour and 
 duty of ministers to lead them in the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He directs them in their course, by setting more fully to view his 
 own example, still carrying on the allusion. 

 1. Those that ran in their games were kept to a set diet: "<I>Every man
 that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The fighters and wrestlers in your exercises are kept to strict diet 
 and discipline; nay, they keep themselves to it. They do not indulge 
 themselves, but restrain themselves from the food they eat and so from 
 the liberties they use on other occasions. And should not Christians
 much more abridge themselves of their liberty, for so glorious an end 
 as winning the race, and obtaining the prize set before them? They used 
 a very spare diet, and course food, and denied themselves much, to 
 prepare for their race and combat; so do I; so should you, after my 
 example. It is hard if, for the heavenly crown, you cannot abstain from 
 heathen sacrifices." 

 2. They were not only temperate, but inured themselves to hardships.
 Those who fought with one another in these exercises prepared 
 themselves by beating the air, as the apostle calls it, or by throwing 
 out their arms, and thereby inuring themselves, beforehand, to deal 
 about their blows in close combat, or brandish them by way of flourish. 
 There is no room for any such exercise in the Christian warfare. 
 Christians are ever in close combat. There enemies make fierce and 
 hearty opposition, and are ever at hand; and for this reason they must 
 lay about them in earnest, and never drop the contest, nor flag and 
 faint in it. They must fight, not as those that beat the air, but must 
 strive against their enemies with all their might. One enemy the 
 apostle here mentions, namely, the body; this must be kept under, 
 beaten black and blue, as the combatants were in these Grecian games, 
 and thereby brought into subjection. By the body we are to understand 
 fleshly appetites and inclinations. These the apostle set himself to 
 curb and conquer, and in this the Corinthians were bound to imitate 
 him. Note, Those who would aright pursue the interests of their souls 
 must beat down their bodies, and keep them under. They must combat hard 
 with fleshly lusts, and not indulge a wanton appetite, and long for 
 heathenish sacrifices, nor eat them, to please their flesh, at the 
 hazard of their brethren's souls. The body must be made to serve the 
 mind, not suffered to lord over it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle presses this advice on the Corinthians by proper 
 arguments drawn from the same contenders. 

 1. They take pains, and undergo all those hardships, <I>to obtain a
 corruptible crown</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>but we an incorruptible.</I> Those who conquered in these games were 
 crowned only with the withering leaves or boughs of trees, of olive, 
 bays, or laurel. But Christians have an incorruptible crown in view, a 
 crown of glory that never fadeth away, an inheritance incorruptible, 
 reserved in heaven for them. And would they yet suffer themselves to be 
 outdone by these racers or wrestlers? Can they use abstinence in diet, 
 exert themselves in racing, expose their bodies to so much hardship in 
 a combat, who have no more in view than the trifling huzzas of a giddy 
 multitude, or a crown of leaves? And shall not Christians, who hope for 
 the approbation of the sovereign Judge, and a crown of glory from his 
 hands, stretch forward in the heavenly race, and exert themselves in 
 beating down their fleshly inclinations, and the strong-holds of sin? 
 
 2. The racers in these games run at uncertainty. All run, but one
 receives the prize,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Every racer, therefore, is at a great uncertainty whether he shall win
 it or no. But the Christian racer is at no such uncertainty. Every one 
 may run here so as to obtain; but then he must run within the lines, he 
 must keep to the path of duty prescribed, which, some think, is the 
 meaning of <I>running not as uncertainly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He who keeps within the limits prescribed, and keeps on in his race, 
 will never miss his crown, though others may get theirs before him. And 
 would the Grecian racers keep within their bounds, and exert themselves 
 to the very last, when one only could win, and all must be uncertain 
 which that one would be? And shall not Christians be much more exact
 and vigorous when all are sure of a crown when they come to the end of 
 their race? 

 3. He sets before himself and them the danger of yielding to fleshly
 inclinations, and pampering the body and its lusts and appetites: <I>I 
 keep my body under, lest that by any means, when I have preached to 
 others, I myself should be a cast-away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>rejected, disapproved,</I> <B><I>adokimos,</I></B> one to whom the 
 <B><I>brabeutes</I></B>--<I>the judge</I> or <I>umpire</I> of the race, 
 will not decree the crown. The allusion to the games runs through the 
 whole sentence. Note, A preacher of salvation may yet miss it. He may 
 show others the way to heaven, and never get thither himself. To 
 prevent this, Paul took so much pains in subduing and keeping under 
 bodily inclinations, lest by any means he himself, who had preached to 
 others, should yet miss the crown, be disapproved and rejected by his 
 sovereign Judge. A holy fear of himself was necessary to preserve the
 fidelity of an apostle; and how much more necessary is it to our 
 preservation? Note, Holy fear of ourselves, and not presumptuous 
 confidence, is the best security against apostasy from God, and final 
 rejection by him.</P>
