 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having fully explained the doctrine of justification, and
 pressed the necessity of sanctification, in this chapter applies
 himself to the consolation of the Lord's people. Ministers are helpers
 of the joy of the saints. "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people," so runs
 our commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:1">Isa. xl. 1</A>.

 It is the will of God that his people should be a comforted people. And
 we have here such a draught of the gospel charter, such a display of 
 the unspeakable privileges of true believers, as may furnish us with 
 abundant matter for joy and peace in believing, that by all these 
 immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might 
 have strong consolation. Many of the people of God have, accordingly, 
 found this chapter a well-spring of comfort to their souls, living and 
 dying, and have sucked and been satisfied from these breasts of 
 consolation, and with joy drawn water out of these wells of salvation. 
 There are three things in this chapter:

 I. The particular instances of Christians' privileges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1-28">ver. 1-28</A>.

 II. The ground thereof laid in predestination,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:29,30">ver. 29, 30</A>.

 III. The apostle's triumph herein, in the name of all the saints,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:31-39">ver. 31 to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  <I>There is</I> therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
 Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
 &nbsp; 2  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
 me free from the law of sin and death.
 &nbsp; 3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
 the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
 flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
 &nbsp; 4  That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
 who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
 &nbsp; 5  For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the
 flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the
 Spirit.
 &nbsp; 6  For to be carnally minded <I>is</I> death; but to be spiritually
 minded <I>is</I> life and peace.
 &nbsp; 7  Because the carnal mind <I>is</I> enmity against God: for it is
 not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
 &nbsp; 8  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
 &nbsp; 9  But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
 the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
 Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle here beings with one signal privilege of true 
 Christians, and describes the character of those to whom it belongs: 
 <I>There is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ 
 Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This is his triumph after that melancholy complaint and conflict in the 
 foregoing chapter--sin remaining, disturbing, vexing, but, blessed be 
 God, not ruining. The complaint he takes to himself, but humbly 
 transfers the comfort with himself to all true believers, who are all 
 interested in it. 

 1. It is the unspeakable privilege and comfort of all those that are in
 Christ Jesus that there is therefore now no condemnation to them. He 
 does not say, "There is no accusation against them," for this there is; 
 but the accusation is thrown out, and the indictment quashed. He does 
 not say, "There is nothing in them that deserves condemnation," for 
 this there is, and they see it, and own it, and mourn over it, and 
 condemn themselves for it; but it shall not be their ruin. He does not 
 say, "There is no cross, no affliction to them or no displeasure in the 
 affliction," for this there may be; but <I>no condemnation.</I> They 
 may be chastened of the Lord, but not condemned with the world. Now 
 this arises from their being in Christ Jesus; by virtue of their union 
 with him through faith they are thus secured. They are in Christ
 Jesus, as in their city of refuge, and so are protected from the 
 avenger of blood. He is their advocate, and brings them off. There is 
 therefore no condemnation, because they are interested in the 
 satisfaction that Christ by dying made to the law. In Christ, God does 
 not only not condemn them, but is well pleased with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.

 2. It is the undoubted character of all those who are so in Christ
 Jesus as to be freed from condemnation that <I>they walk not after the 
 flesh but after the Spirit.</I> Observe, The character is given from 
 their walk, not from any one particular act, but from their course and 
 way. And the great question is, What is the principle of the walk, the
 flesh or the spirit, the old or the new nature, corruption or grace? 
 Which of these do we mind, for which of these doe we make provision, by 
 which of these are we governed, which of these do we take part 
 with?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This great truth, thus laid down, he illustrates in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:2-9">following verses</A>;

 and shows how we come by this great privilege, and how we may answer
 this character.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How we come by these privileges--the privilege of justification, that
 <I>there is no condemnation to us</I>--the privilege of sanctification,
 that <I>we walk after the Spirit, and not after the flesh,</I> which is 
 no less our privilege than it is our duty. How comes it about?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The law could not do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It could neither justify nor sanctify, neither free us from the guilt 
 nor from the power of sin, having not the promises either of pardon or 
 grace. The law made nothing perfect: <I>It was weak.</I> Some attempt 
 the law made towards these blessed ends, but, alas! it was weak, it 
 could not accomplish them: yet that weakness was not through any defect 
 in the law, but <I>through the flesh,</I> through the corruption of 
 human nature, by which we became incapable either of being justified or 
 sanctified by the law. We had become unable to keep the law, and, in 
 case of failure, the law, as a covenant of works, made no provision, 
 and so left us as it found us. Or understand it of the ceremonial law; 
 that was a plaster not wide enough for the wound, it could never take 
 away sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:4">Heb. x. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus</I> does it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The covenant of grace made with us in Christ is a treasury of merit and 
 grace, and thence we receive pardon and a new nature, <I>are freed from 
 the law of sin and death,</I> that is, both from the guilt and power of 
 sin--from the course of the law, and the dominion of the flesh. We are
 under another covenant, another master, another husband, under the 
 <I>law of the Spirit,</I> the law that gives the Spirit, spiritual life 
 to qualify us for eternal. The foundation of this freedom is laid in 
 Christ's undertaking for us, of which he speaks

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,

 <I>God sending his own Son.</I> Observe, When the law failed, God
 provided another method. Christ comes to do that which the law could
 not do. Moses brought the children of Israel to the borders of Canaan, 
 and then died, and left them there; but Joshua did that which Moses 
 could not do, and put them in possession of Canaan. Thus what the law 
 could not do Christ did. The best exposition of this verse we have

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1-10">Heb. x. 1-10</A>.

 To make the sense of the words clear, which in our translation is a
 little intricate, we may read it thus, with a little 
 transposition:--<I>God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful
 flesh, and a sacrifice for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, which the 
 law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] How Christ appeared: <I>In the likeness of sinful flesh.</I> Not
 sinful, for he was holy, harmless, undefiled; but in the likeness of 
 that flesh which was sinful. He took upon him that nature which was 
 corrupt, though perfectly abstracted from the corruptions of it. His 
 being circumcised, redeemed, baptized with John's baptism, bespeaks the 
 likeness of sinful flesh. The bitings of the fiery serpents were cured 
 by a serpent of brass, which had the shape, through free from the 
 venom, of the serpents that bit them. It was great condescension that 
 he who was God should be made in the likeness of flesh; but much 
 greater that he who was holy should be made in the likeness of sinful 
 flesh. <I>And for sin,</I>--here the best Greek copies place the comma.
 God sent him, <B><I>en homoiomati sarkos hamartias, kai peri 
 hamartias</I></B>--<I>in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as a 
 sacrifice for sin.</I> The LXX. call a sacrifice for sin no more than 
 <B><I>peri hamartias</I></B>--<I>for sin;</I> so Christ was a 
 sacrifice; he was sent to be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26">Heb. ix. 26</A>.

 [2.] What was done by this appearance of his: Sin <I>was condemned,</I>
 that is, God did therein more than ever manifest his hatred of sin; and 
 not only so, but for all that are Christ's both the damning and the 
 domineering power of sin is broken and taken out of the way. He that is 
 condemned can neither accuse nor rule; his testimony is null, and his 
 authority null. Thus by Christ is sin condemned; though it live and 
 remain, its life in the saints is still but like that of a condemned 
 malefactor. It was by the condemning of sin that death was disarmed,
 and the devil, who had the power of death, destroyed. The condemning of 
 sin saved the sinner from condemnation. Christ was made sin for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2 Cor. v. 21</A>),

 and, being so made, when he was condemned sin was condemned in the 
 flesh of Christ, condemned in the human nature: So was sanctification 
 made to divine justice, and way made for the salvation of the sinner. 
 
 [3.] The happy effect of this upon us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.</I> Both 
 in our justification and in our sanctification, the righteousness of 
 the law if fulfilled. A righteousness of satisfaction for the breach of 
 the law is fulfilled by the imputation of Christ's complete and perfect 
 righteousness, which answers the utmost demands of the law, as the 
 mercy-seat was as long and as broad as the ark. A righteousness of 
 obedience to the commands of the law is fulfilled in us, when by the 
 Spirit the law of love is written upon the heart, and that love is the 
 fulfilling of the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:10"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 10</A>.

 Though the righteousness of the law is not fulfilled by us, yet,
 blessed be God, it is fulfilled in us; there is that to be found upon 
 and in all true believers which answers the intention of the law.
 <I>Us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</I> This is 
 the description of all those that are interested in this 
 privilege--they act from spiritual and not from carnal principles; as 
 for others, the righteousness of the law will be fulfilled upon them in 
 their ruin. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe how we may answer to this character, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By looking to our minds. How may we know whether we are after the 
 flesh or after the Spirit? By examining what we mind, the things of the 
 flesh or the things of the spirit. Carnal pleasure, worldly profit and 
 honour, the things of sense and time, are the things of the flesh, 
 which unregenerate people mind. The favour of God, the welfare of the 
 soul, the concerns of eternity, are the things of the Spirit, which 
 those that are after the Spirit do mind. The man is as the mind is. The 
 mind is the forge of thoughts. <I>As he thinketh in his heart, so is 
 he,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:7">Prov. xxiii. 7</A>.

 Which way do the thoughts move with most pleasure? On what do they
 dwell with most satisfaction? The mind is the seat of wisdom. Which way 
 go the projects and contrivances? whether are we more wise for the 
 world or for our souls? <B><I>phronousi ta tes sarkos</I></B>--<I>they 
 savour the things of the flesh;</I> so the word is rendered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:23">Matt. xvi. 23</A>.
 
 It is a great matter what our savour is, what truths, what tidings,
 what comforts, we do most relish, and are most agreeable to us. Now, to 
 caution us against this carnal-mindedness, he shows the great misery 
 and malignity of it, and compares it with the unspeakable excellency 
 and comfort of spiritual-mindedness. 
 
 [1.] It is death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is spiritual death, the certain way to eternal death. It is the
 death of the soul; for it is its alienation from God, in union and 
 communion with whom the life of the soul consists. A carnal soul is a 
 dead soul, dead as a soul can die. She that <I>liveth in pleasure is 
 dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:6">1 Tim. v. 6</A>),

 not only dead in law as guilty, but dead in state as carnal. Death 
 includes all misery; carnal souls are miserable souls. But to be 
 <I>spiritually minded,</I> <B><I>phronema tou pneumatos</I></B>--<I>a 
 spiritual savour</I> (the wisdom that is from above, a principle of 
 grace) is <I>life and peace;</I> it is the felicity and happiness of 
 the soul. The life of the soul consists in its union with spiritual 
 things by the mind. A sanctified soul is a living soul, and that life 
 is peace; it is a very comfortable life. All the paths of spiritual 
 wisdom are paths of peace. It is life and peace in the other world, as 
 well as in this. Spiritual-mindedness is eternal life and peace begun, 
 and an assuring earnest of the perfection of it.

 [2.] It is enmity to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and this is worse than the former. The former speaks the carnal sinner 
 a dead man, which is bad; but this speaks him a devil of a man. It is 
 not only an enemy, but enmity itself. It is not only the alienation of 
 the soul from God, but the opposition of the soul against God; it 
 rebels against his authority, thwarts his design, opposes his interest, 
 spits in his face, spurns at his bowels. Can there be a greater enmity? 
 An enemy may be reconciled, but enmity cannot. How should this humble 
 us for and warn us against, carnal-mindedness! Shall we harbour and 
 indulge that which is enmity to God our creator, owner, ruler, and 
 benefactor? To prove this, he urges that <I>it is not subject to the 
 law of God, neither indeed can be.</I> The holiness of the law of God, 
 and the unholiness of the carnal mind, are as irreconcilable as light 
 and darkness. The carnal man may, by the power of divine grace, be made 
 subject to the law of God, but the <I>carnal mind</I> never can; this 
 must be broken and expelled. See how wretchedly the corrupt will of man 
 is enslaved to sin; as far as the carnal mind prevails, there is no 
 inclination to the law of God; therefore wherever there is a change 
 wrought it is by the power of God's grace, not by the freedom of man's 
 will. Hence he infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>Those that are in the flesh cannot please God.</I> Those that are in 
 a carnal unregenerate state, under the reigning power of sin, cannot do 
 the things that please God, wanting grace, the pleasing principle, and 
 an interest in Christ, the pleasing Mediator. The very <I>sacrifice of 
 the wicked is an abomination,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 Pleasing God is our highest end, of which those that are in the flesh 
 cannot but fall short; they cannot please him, nay, they cannot but 
 displease him. We may know our state and character,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By enquiring whether we have the Spirit of God and Christ, or not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>You are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.</I> This expresses 
 states and conditions of the soul vastly different. All the saints have 
 flesh and spirit in them; but to be in the flesh and to be in the 
 Spirit are contrary. It denotes our being overcome and subdued by one 
 of these principles. As we say, A man is <I>in love,</I> or <I>in 
 drink,</I> that is, overcome by it. Now the great question is whether 
 we are in the flesh or in the Spirit; and how may we come to know it? 
 Why, by enquiring whether the Spirit of God dwell in us. The Spirit 
 dwelling in us is the best evidence of our being in the Spirit, for the 
 indwelling is mutual 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:16">1 John iv. 16</A>):

 <I>Dwelleth in God, and God in him.</I> The Spirit visits many that are 
 unregenerate with his motions, which they resist and quench; but in all 
 that are sanctified he dwells; there he resides and rules. He is there 
 as a man at his own house, where he is constant and welcome, and has 
 the dominion. Shall we put this question to our own hearts, Who dwells, 
 who rules, who keeps house, here? Which interest has the ascendant? To 
 this he subjoins a general rule of trial: <I>If any man has not the 
 Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</I> To be Christ's (that is, to be 
 a Christian indeed, one of his children, his servants, his friends, in 
 union with him) is a privilege and honour which many pretend to that 
 have no part nor lot in the matter. None are his but those that have 
 his Spirit; that is, 

 [1.] That are spirited as he was spirited--are meek, and lowly, and 
 humble, and peaceable, and patient, and charitable, as he was. We 
 cannot tread in his steps unless we have his spirit; the frame and 
 disposition of our souls must be conformable to Christ's pattern.

 [2.] That are actuated and guided by the Holy Spirit of God, as a 
 sanctifier, teacher, and comforter. Having the Spirit of Christ is the 
 same with having the Spirit of God to dwell in us. But those two come 
 much to one; for all that are actuated by the Spirit of God as their 
 rule are conformable to the spirit of Christ as their pattern. Now this 
 description of the character of those to whom belongs this first 
 privilege of freedom from condemnation is to be applied to all the 
 other privileges that follow.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle represents two more excellent benefits, 
 which belong to true believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Life. The happiness is not barely a negative happiness, not to be 
 condemned; but it is positive, it is an advancement to a life that will 
 be the unspeakable happiness of the man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>If Christ be in you.</I> Observe, If the Spirit be in us, Christ is 
 in us. He dwells in the heart by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:17">Eph. iii. 17</A>.

 Now we are here told what becomes of the bodies and souls of those in
 whom Christ is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We cannot say but that <I>the body is dead;</I> it is a frail, 
 mortal, dying body, and it will be dead shortly; it is a house of clay, 
 whose foundation is in the dust. The life purchased and promised does 
 not immortalize the body in its present state. It is dead, that is, it 
 is appointed to die, it is under a sentence of death: as we say one 
 that is condemned is a dead man. In the midst of life we are in death: 
 be our bodies ever so strong, and healthful, and handsome, they are as 
 good as dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:12">Heb. xi. 12</A>),

 and this <I>because of sin.</I> It is sin that kills the body. This 
 effect the first threatening has 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>):

 <I>Dust thou art.</I> Methinks, were there no other argument, love to 
 our bodies should make us hate sin, because it is such an enemy to our 
 bodies. The death even of the bodies of the saints is a remaining token 
 of God's displeasure against sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But the spirit, the precious soul, that is life; it is now 
 spiritually alive, nay, it is life. Grace in the soul is its new 
 nature; the life of the saint lies in the soul, while the life of the 
 sinner goes no further than the body. When the body dies, and returns 
 to the dust, <I>the spirit if life;</I> not only living and immortal, 
 but swallowed up of life. Death to the saints is but the freeing of the 
 heaven-born spirit from the clog and load of this body, that it may be 
 fit to partake of eternal life. When Abraham was dead, yet God was the 
 God of Abraham, for even then his spirit was life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:31,32">Matt. xxii. 31, 32</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>.

 And this <I>because of righteousness.</I> The righteousness of Christ
 imputed to them secures the soul, the better part, from death; the 
 righteousness of Christ inherent in them, the renewed image of God upon 
 the soul, preserves it, and, by God's ordination, at death elevates it, 
 and improves it, and makes it meet to partake of the inheritance of the 
 saints in light. The eternal life of the soul consists in the vision 
 and fruition of God, and both assimilating, for which the soul is 
 qualified by the righteousness of sanctification. I refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:15">Ps. xvii. 15</A>,

 <I>I will behold thy face in righteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There is a life reserved too for the poor body at last: <I>He shall
 also quicken your mortal bodies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The Lord is for the body; and though at death it is cast aside as a 
 despised broken vessel, a vessel in which is no pleasure, yet God will 
 have a desire to the work of his hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:15">Job xiv. 15</A>),

 will remember his covenant with the dust, and will not lose a grain of 
 it; but the body shall be reunited to the soul, and clothed with a 
 glory agreeable to it. Vile bodies shall be newly fashioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21,1Co+15:42">Phil. iii. 21; 1 Cor. xv. 42</A>.

 Two great assurances of the resurrection of the body are mentioned:--

 (1.) The resurrection of Christ: He <I>that raised up Christ from the
 dead shall also quicken.</I> Christ rose as the head, and first-fruits, 
 and forerunner of all the saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:20">1 Cor. xv. 20</A>.

 The body of Christ lay in the grave, under the sin of all the elect 
 imputed, and broke through it. O grave, then, where is thy victory? It 
 is in the virtue of Christ's resurrection that we shall rise.

 (2.) The indwelling of the Spirit. The same Spirit that raiseth the
 soul now will raise the body shortly: <I>By his Spirit that dwelleth in 
 you.</I> The bodies of the saints are the temples of the Holy Ghost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16,6:19">1 Cor. iii. 16; vi. 19</A>.

 Now, though these temples may be suffered for awhile to lie in ruins, 
 yet they shall be rebuilt. The tabernacle of David, which has fallen 
 down, shall be repaired, whatever great mountains may be in the way. 
 The Spirit, breathing upon dead and dry bones, will make them live, and 
 the saints even in their flesh shall see God. Hence the apostle by the 
 way infers how much it is our duty to walk not after the flesh, but 
 after the Spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Let not our life be after the wills and motions of the flesh. Two
 motives he mentions here:--

 [1.] We are not debtors to the flesh, neither by relation, gratitude,
 nor any other bond or obligation. We owe no suit nor service to our 
 carnal desires; we are indeed bound to clothe, and feed, and take care 
 of the body, as a servant to the soul in the service of God, but no 
 further. We are not debtors to it; the flesh never did us so much 
 kindness as to oblige us to serve it. It is implied that we are debtors 
 to Christ and to the Spirit: there we owe our all, all we have and all 
 we can do, by a thousand bonds and obligations. Being delivered from so 
 great a death by so great a ransom, we are deeply indebted to our 
 deliverer. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19,20">1 Cor. vi. 19, 20</A>.

 [2.] Consider the consequences, what will be at the end of the way.
 Here are life and death, blessing and cursing, set before us. <I>If you 
 live after the flesh, you shall die;</I> that is, die eternally. It is 
 the pleasing, and serving, and gratifying, of the flesh, that are the 
 ruin of souls; that is, the second death. Dying indeed is the soul's 
 dying: the death of the saints is but a sleep. But, on the other hand,
 <I>You shall live,</I> live and be happy to eternity; that is the true 
 life: <I>If you through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body,</I> 
 subdue and keep under all fleshly lusts and affections, deny yourselves 
 in the pleasing and humouring of the body, and this through the Spirit; 
 we cannot do it without the Spirit working it in us, and the Spirit 
 will not do it without our doing our endeavour. So that in a word we 
 are put upon this dilemma, either to displease the body or destroy the 
 soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>Spirit of adoption</I> is another privilege belonging to 
 those that are in Christ Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All that are Christ's are taken into the relation of Children to 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Their property: They are <I>led by the Spirit of God,</I> as a 
 scholar in his learning is led by his tutor, as a traveller in his 
 journey is led by his guide, as a soldier in his engagements is led by 
 his captain; not driven as beasts, but led as rational creatures, drawn 
 with the cords of a man and the bands of love. It is the undoubted 
 character of all true believers that they are led by the Spirit of God. 
 Having submitted themselves in believing to his guidance, they do in 
 their obedience follow that guidance, and are sweetly led into all 
 truth and all duty. 

 (2.) Their privilege: <I>They are the sons of God,</I> received into 
 the number of God's children by adoption, owned and loved by him as his 
 children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. And those that are the sons of God have the Spirit,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To work in them the disposition of children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Understand it, <I>First,</I> Of that spirit of bondage which the 
 Old-Testament church was under, by reason of the darkness and terror of 
 that dispensation. The veil signified bondage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:15">2 Cor. iii. 15</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The Spirit of adoption was not then so plentifully poured out as now; 
 for the law opened the wound, but little of the remedy. Now you are not 
 under that dispensation, you have not received that spirit.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of that spirit of bondage which many of the saints 
 themselves were under at their conversion, under the convictions of sin 
 and wrath set home by the Spirit; as those in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>,

 the jailer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:30">Acts xvi. 30</A>),

 Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>.

 Then the Spirit himself was to the saints a spirit of bondage: "But,"
 says the apostle, "with you this is over." "God as a Judge," says Dr. 
 Manton, "by the spirit of bondage, sends us to Christ as Mediator, and 
 Christ as Mediator, by the spirit of adoption, sends us back again to 
 God as a Father." Though a child of God may come under fear of bondage 
 again, and may be questioning his sonship, yet the blessed Spirit is 
 not again a spirit of bondage, for then he would witness an 
 untruth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But you <I>have received the Spirit of adoption.</I> Men may give 
 a charter of adoption; but it is God's prerogative, when he adopts, to 
 give a spirit of adoption--the nature of children. The Spirit of
 adoption works in the children of God a filial love to God as a Father, 
 a delight in him, and a dependence upon him, as a Father. A sanctified 
 soul bears the image of God, as the child bears the image of the 
 father. <I>Whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</I> Praying is here called 
 <I>crying,</I> which is not only an earnest, but a natural expression 
 of desire; children that cannot speak vent their desires by crying. 
 Now, the Spirit teaches us in prayer to come to God as a Father, with a 
 holy humble confidence, emboldening the soul in that duty. <I>Abba, 
 Father. Abba</I> is a Syriac word signifying <I>father</I> or <I>my 
 father;</I> <B><I>pater,</I></B> a Greek work; and why both, <I>Abba, 
 Father?</I> Because Christ said so in prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:36">Mark xiv. 36</A>),

 <I>Abba, Father:</I> and we have received the Spirit of the Son. It 
 denotes an affectionate endearing importunity, and a believing stress 
 laid upon the relation. Little children, begging of their parents, can 
 say little but <I>Father, Father,</I> and that is rhetoric enough. It 
 also denotes that the adoption is common both to Jews and Gentiles: the 
 Jews call him <I>Abba</I> in their language, the Greeks may call him 
 <B><I>pater</I></B> in their language; for in Christ Jesus there is 
 neither Greek nor Jew.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To witness to the relation of children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The former is the work of the Spirit as a Sanctifier; this as a 
 Comforter. <I>Beareth witness with our spirit.</I> Many a man has the 
 witness of his own spirit to the goodness of his state who has not the 
 concurring testimony of the Spirit. Many speak peace to themselves to 
 whom the God of heaven does not speak peace. But those that are 
 sanctified have God's Spirit witnessing with their spirits, which is to 
 be understood not of any immediate extraordinary revelation, but an 
 ordinary work of the Spirit, in and by the means of comfort, speaking 
 peace to the soul. This testimony is always agreeable to the written
 word, and is therefore always grounded upon sanctification; for the 
 Spirit in the heart cannot contradict the Spirit in the word. The 
 Spirit witnesses to none the privileges of children who have not the 
 nature and disposition of children.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs
 with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <I>him,</I> that we may be
 also glorified together.
 &nbsp; 18  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time <I>are</I>
 not worthy <I>to be compared</I> with the glory which shall be
 revealed in us.
 &nbsp; 19  For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
 manifestation of the sons of God.
 &nbsp; 20  For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
 but by reason of him who hath subjected <I>the same</I> in hope,
 &nbsp; 21  Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
 bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children
 of God.
 &nbsp; 22  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
 in pain together until now.
 &nbsp; 23  And not only <I>they,</I> but ourselves also, which have the
 firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
 ourselves, waiting for the adoption, <I>to wit,</I> the redemption of
 our body.
 &nbsp; 24  For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:
 for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
 &nbsp; 25  But if we hope for that we see not, <I>then</I> do we with
 patience wait for <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle describes a fourth illustrious branch of the 
 happiness of believers, namely, a title to the future glory. This is 
 fitly annexed to our sonship; for as the adoption of sons entitles us 
 to that glory, so the disposition of sons fits and prepares us for it. 
 <I>If children, then heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 In earthly inheritances this rule does not hold, only the first-born 
 are heirs; but the church is a church of first-born, for they are all 
 heirs. Heaven is an inheritance that all the saints are heirs to. They 
 do not come to it as purchasers by any merit or procurement of their 
 own; but as heirs, purely by the act of God; for God makes heirs. The 
 saints are heirs though in this world they are heirs under age; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1,2">Gal. iv. 1, 2</A>.

 Their present state is a state of education and preparation for the
 inheritance. How comfortable should this be to all the children of God, 
 how little soever they have in possession, that, being heirs, they have 
 enough in reversion! But the honour and happiness of an heir lie in the 
 value and worth of that which he is heir to: we read of those that 
 inherit the wind; and therefore we have here an abstract of the 
 premises.

 1. <I>Heirs of God.</I> The Lord himself is the portion of the saints'
 inheritance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5">Ps. xvi. 5</A>),

 a goodly heritage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The saints are spiritual priests, that have the Lord for their 
 inheritance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:20">Num. xviii. 20</A>.

 The vision of God and the fruition of God make up the inheritance the 
 saints are heirs to. God himself will be with them, and will be their 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Rev. xxi. 3</A>.

 2. <I>Joint-heirs with Christ.</I> Christ, as Mediator, is said to be
 the heir of all things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>),

 and true believers, by virtue of their union with him, <I>shall inherit 
 all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:7">Rev. xxi. 7</A>.

 Those that now partake of the Spirit of Christ, as his brethren, shall, 
 as his brethren, partake of his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>),

 shall sit down with him upon his throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>.

 Lord, what is man, that thou shouldst thus magnify him! Now this future 
 glory is further spoken of as the reward of present sufferings and as 
 the accomplishment of present hopes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As the reward of the saints' present sufferings; and it is a rich 
 reward: <I>If so be that we suffer with him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 or <I>forasmuch as we suffer with him.</I> The state of the church in 
 this world always is, but was then especially, an afflicted state; to 
 be a Christian was certainly to be a sufferer. Now, to comfort them in 
 reference to those sufferings, he tells them that they suffered with 
 Christ--for his sake, for his honour, and for the testimony of a good 
 conscience, and should be glorified with him. Those that suffered with 
 David in his persecuted state were advanced by him and with him when he 
 came to the crown; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:12">2 Tim. ii. 12</A>.

 See the gains of suffering for Christ; though we may be losers for him,
 we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in the end. This the gospel 
 is filled with the assurances of. Now, that suffering saints may have 
 strong supports and consolations from their hopes of heaven, he holds 
 the balance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 in a comparison between the two, which is observable. 

 1. In one scale he puts the <I>sufferings of this present time.</I> The
 sufferings of the saints are but sufferings of this present time, 
 strike no deeper than the things of time, last no longer than the 
 present time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:17">2 Cor. iv. 17</A>),

 light affliction, and but for a moment. So that on the sufferings he 
 writes <I>tekel,</I> weighed in the balance and found light. 

 2. In the other scale he puts the glory, and finds that a weight, an
 exceeding and eternal weight: <I>Glory that shall be revealed.</I> In 
 our present state we come short, not only in the enjoyment, but in the 
 knowledge of that glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9,1Jo+3:2">1 Cor. ii. 9; 1 John iii. 2</A>):

 it shall be revealed. It surpasses all that we have yet seen and known: 
 present vouchsafements are sweet and precious, very precious, very 
 sweet; but there is something to come, something behind the curtain, 
 that will outshine all. <I>Shall be revealed in us;</I> not only 
 revealed to us, to be seen, but revealed in us, to be enjoyed. The 
 kingdom of God is within you, and will be so to eternity. 

 3. He concludes the sufferings <I>not worthy to be compared with the
 glory</I>--<B><I>ouk axia pros ten doxan.</I></B> They cannot merit 
 that glory; and, if suffering for Christ will not merit, much less will 
 doing. They should not at all deter and frighten us from the diligent 
 and earnest pursuit of that glory. The sufferings are small and short, 
 and concern the body only; but the glory is rich and great, and 
 concerns the soul, and is eternal. This he reckons. <I>I 
 reckon</I>--<B><I>logizomai.</I></B> It is not a rash and sudden 
 determination, but the product of a very serious and deliberate 
 consideration. He had reasoned the case within himself, weighed the
 arguments on both sides, and thus at last resolves the point. O how 
 vastly different is the sentence of the word from the sentiment of the 
 world concerning the sufferings of this present time! <I>I reckon,</I> 
 as an arithmetician that is balancing an account. He first sums up what 
 is disbursed for Christ in the sufferings of this present time, and 
 finds they come to very little; he then sums up what is secured to us 
 by Christ in the glory that shall be revealed, and this he finds to be 
 an infinite sum, transcending all conception, the disbursement 
 abundantly made up and the losses infinitely countervailed. And who 
 would be afraid then to suffer for Christ, who as he is before-hand 
 with us in suffering, so he will not be behind-hand with us in 
 recompence? Now Paul was as competent a judge of this point as ever any 
 mere man was. He could reckon not by art only, but by experience; for 
 he knew both. He knew what the sufferings of this present time were; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23-28">2 Cor. xi. 23-28</A>.
 
 He knew what the glory of heaven is; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:3,4">2 Cor. xii. 3, 4</A>.

 And, upon the view of both, he gives this judgment here. There is
 nothing like a believing view of the glory which shall be revealed to 
 support and bear up the spirit under all the sufferings of this present 
 time. The reproach of Christ appears riches to those who have respect 
 to the recompence of reward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:26">Heb. xi. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As the accomplishment of the saints' present hopes and 
 expectations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 &c. As the saints are suffering for it, so they are waiting for it.
 Heaven is therefore sure; for God by his Spirit would not raise and 
 encourage those hopes only to defeat and disappoint them. He will 
 establish that word unto his servants on which he has caused them to 
 hope 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:49">Ps. cxix. 49</A>),

 and heaven is therefore sweet; for, if hope deferred makes the heart 
 sick, surely when the desire comes it will be a tree of life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:12">Prov. xiii. 12</A>.
 
 Now he observes an expectation of this glory,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the creatures 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:19-22"><I>v.</I> 19-22</A>.

 That must needs be a great, a transcendent glory, which all the 
 creatures are so earnestly expecting and longing for. This observation 
 in these verses has some difficulty in it, which puzzles interpreters a 
 little; and the more because it is a remark not made in any other 
 scripture, with which it might be compared. By the <I>creature</I> here 
 we understand, not as some do the Gentile world, and their expectation 
 of Christ and the gospel, which is an exposition very foreign and 
 forced, but the whole frame of nature, especially that of this lower 
 world--the whole creation, the compages of inanimate and sensible 
 creatures, which, because of their harmony and mutual dependence, and 
 because they all constitute and make up one world, are spoken of in the 
 singular number as the <I>creature.</I> The sense of the apostle in 
 these four verses we may take in the following observations:--

 (1.) That there is a present vanity to which the creature, by reason of
 the sin of man, is made subject, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When man sinned, the ground was cursed for man's sake, and with it all 
 the creatures (especially of this lower world, where our acquaintance 
 lies) became subject to that curse, became mutable and mortal. <I>Under 
 the bondage of corruption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There is an impurity, deformity, and infirmity, which the creature has 
 contracted by the fall of man: the creation is sullied and stained, 
 much of the beauty of the world gone. There is an enmity of one
 creature to another; they are all subject to continual alteration and 
 decay of the individuals, liable to the strokes of God's judgments upon 
 man. When the world was drowned, and almost all the creatures in it, 
 surely then it was subject to vanity indeed. The whole species of 
 creatures is designed for, and is hastening to, a total dissolution by 
 fire. And it is not the least part of their vanity and bondage that 
 they are used, or abused rather, by men as instruments of sin. The 
 creatures are often abused to the dishonour of their Creator, the hurt 
 of his children, or the service of his enemies. When the creatures are 
 made the food and fuel of our lusts, they are subject to vanity, they 
 are captivated by the law of sin. And this <I>not willingly,</I> not of 
 their own choice. All the creatures desire their own perfection and 
 consummation; when they are made instruments of sin it is not 
 willingly. Or, They are thus captivated, not for any sin of their own, 
 which they had committed, but for man's sin: <I>By reason of him who 
 hath subjected the same.</I> Adam did it meritoriously; the creatures 
 being delivered to him, when he by sin delivered himself he delivered 
 them likewise into the bondage of corruption. God did it judicially; he 
 passed a sentence upon the creatures for the sin of man, by which they 
 became subject. And this yoke (poor creatures) they bear in hope that 
 it will not be so always. <B><I>Ep elpidi hoti kai,</I></B> &c.--<I>in
 hope that the creature itself;</I> so many Greek copies join the words. 
 We have reason to pity the poor creatures that for our sin have become 
 subject to vanity.

 (2.) That the creatures <I>groan and travail in pain</I> together under 
 this vanity and corruption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It is a figurative expression. Sin is a burden to the whole creation; 
 the sin of the Jews, in crucifying Christ, set the earth a quaking 
 under them. The idols were a burden to the weary beast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1">Isa. xlvi. 1</A>.
 
 There is a general outcry of the whole creation against the sin of man:
 the stone crieth out of the wall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:11">Hab. ii. 11</A>),
 
 the land cries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:38">Job xxxi. 38</A>.

 (3.) That the creature, that is now thus burdened, shall, at the time 
 of the restitution of all things, be <I>delivered from this bondage 
 into the glorious liberty of the children of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)--

 they shall no more be subject to vanity and corruption, and the other 
 fruits of the curse; but, on the contrary, this lower world shall be 
 renewed: when there will be new heavens there will be a new earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:13,Re+21:1">2 Pet. iii. 13; Rev. xxi. 1</A>);

 and there shall be a glory conferred upon all the creatures, which 
 shall be (in the proportion of their natures) as suitable and as great 
 an advancement as the glory of the children of God shall be to them. 
 The fire at the last day shall be a refining, not a destroying 
 annihilating fire. What becomes of the souls of brutes, that go 
 downwards, none can tell. But it should seem by the scripture that 
 there will be some kind of restoration of them. And if it be objected,
 What use will they be of to glorified saints? we may suppose them of as 
 much use as they were to Adam in innocency; and if it be only to 
 illustrate the wisdom, power, and goodness of their Creator, that is 
 enough. Compare with this 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10-13,98:7-9">Ps. xcvi. 10-13; xcviii. 7-9</A>.

 <I>Let the heavens rejoice before the Lord, for he cometh.</I> 

 (4.) That the creature doth therefore earnestly expect and wait for the 
 <I>manifestation of the children of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Observe, At the second coming of Christ there will be a manifestation 
 of the children of God. Now the saints are God's hidden ones, the wheat 
 seems lost in a heap of chaff; but then they shall be manifested. It 
 does not yet appear what we shall be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>),

 but then the glory shall be revealed. The children of God shall appear 
 in their own colours. And this redemption of the creature is reserved 
 till then; for, as it was with man and for man that they fell under the 
 curse, so with man and for man they shall be delivered. All the curse
 and filth that now adhere to the creature shall be done away then when 
 those that have suffered with Christ upon earth shall reign with him 
 upon the earth. This the whole creation looks and longs for; and it
 may serve as a reason why now a good man should be merciful to his 
 beast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the saints, who are new creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The grounds of this expectation in the saints. It is our having 
 received <I>the first-fruits of the Spirit,</I> which both quickens our 
 desires and encourages our hopes, and both ways raises our 
 expectations. The first-fruits did both sanctify and ensure the lump. 
 Grace is the first-fruits of glory, it is glory begun. We, having 
 received such clusters in this wilderness, cannot but long for the full 
 vintage in the heavenly Canaan. <I>Not only they</I>--not only the 
 creatures which are not capable of such a happiness as the first-fruits 
 of the Spirit, but even we, who have such present rich receivings, 
 cannot but long for something more and greater. In having the 
 first-fruits of the Spirit we have that which is very precious, but we 
 have not all we would have. <I>We groan within ourselves,</I> which
 denotes the strength and secrecy of these desires; not making a loud 
 noise, as the hypocrites howling upon the bed for corn and wine, but 
 with silent groans, which pierce heaven soonest of all. Or, <I>We groan 
 among ourselves.</I> It is the unanimous vote, the joint desire, of the 
 whole church, all agree in this: <I>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly.</I> 
 The groaning denotes a very earnest and importunate desire, the soul 
 pained with the delay. Present receivings and comforts are consistent
 with a great many groans; not as the pangs of one dying, but as the 
 throes of a woman in travail--groans that are symptoms of life, not of 
 death. 

 (2.) The object of this expectation. What is it we are thus desiring
 and waiting for? What would we have? <I>The adoption, to wit, the
 redemption of our body.</I> Though the soul be the principal part of 
 the man, yet the Lord has declared himself for the body also, and has 
 provided a great deal of honour and happiness for the body. The 
 resurrection is here called <I>the redemption of the body.</I> It shall 
 then be rescued from the power of death and the grave, and the bondage 
 of corruption; and, though a vile body, yet it shall be refined and 
 beautified, and made like that glorious body of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21,1Co+15:42">Phil. iii. 21; 1 Cor. xv. 42</A>.
 
 This is called <I>the adoption.</I>

 [1.] It is the adoption manifested before all the world, angels and
 men. Now are we the sons of God, but it does not yet appear, the honour 
 is now clouded; but then God will publicly own all his children. The 
 deed of adoption, which is now written, signed, and sealed, will then 
 be recognized, proclaimed, and published. As Christ was, so the saints
 will be, declared to be the sons of God with power, by the resurrection 
 from the dead,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4"><I>ch.</I> i. 4</A>.

 It will then be put past dispute. 

 [2.] It is the adoption perfected and completed. The children of God 
 have bodies as well as souls; and, till those bodies are brought into 
 the glorious liberty of the children of God, the adoption is not 
 perfect. But then it will be complete, when the Captain of our 
 salvation shall bring the many sons to glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.
 
 This is that which we expect, in hope of which our flesh rests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:9,10">Ps. xvi. 9, 10</A>.

 All the days of our appointed time we are waiting, till this change
 shall come, when he shall call, and we shall answer, and he will have a 
 desire to the work of his hands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:14,15">Job xiv. 14, 15</A>.

 (3.) The agreeableness of this to our present state,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Our happiness is not in present possession: <I>We are saved by 
 hope.</I> In this, as in other things, God hath made our present state 
 a state of trial and probation--that our reward is out of sight. Those 
 that will deal with God must deal upon trust. It is acknowledged that 
 one of the principal graces of a Christian is hope

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:13">1 Cor. xiii. 13</A>),

 which necessarily implies a good thing to come, which is the object of 
 that hope. Faith respects the promise, hope the thing promised. Faith 
 is the evidence, hope the expectation, of things not seen. Faith is the 
 mother of hope. <I>We do with patience wait.</I> In hoping for this 
 glory we have need of patience, to bear the sufferings we meet with in 
 the way to it and the delays of it. Our way is rough and long; but he 
 that shall come will come, and will not tarry; and therefore, though he 
 seem to tarry, it becomes us to wait for him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we
 know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit
 itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
 uttered.
 &nbsp; 27  And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what <I>is</I> the mind
 of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
 according to <I>the will of</I> God.

 that love God, to them who are the called according to <I>his</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here suggests two privileges more to which true Christians 
 are entitled:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The help of the Spirit in prayer. While we are in this world, hoping 
 and waiting for what we see not, we must be praying. Hope supposes 
 desire, and that desire offered up to God is prayer; we groan. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Our weakness in prayer: <I>We know not what we should pray for as we 
 ought.</I> 

 (1.) As to the matter of our requests, we know not what to ask. We are 
 not competent judges of our own condition. <I>Who knows what is good 
 for a man in this life?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:12">Eccl. vi. 12</A>.

 We are short-sighted, and very much biassed in favour of the flesh, and 
 apt to separate the end from the way. <I>You know not what you ask,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22">Matt. xx. 22</A>.

 We are like foolish children, that are ready to cry for fruit before it
 is ripe and fit for them; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:54,55">Luke ix. 54, 55</A>.

 (2.) As to the manner, we know not how to pray as we ought. It is not
 enough that we do that which is good, but we must do it well, seek in a 
 due order; and here we are often at a loss--graces are weak, affections 
 cold, thoughts wandering, and it is not always easy to <I>find the 
 heart to pray,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:27">2 Sam. vii. 27</A>.

 The apostle speaks of this in the first person: <I>We know not.</I> He
 puts himself among the rest. Folly, and weakness, and distraction in 
 prayer, are what all the saints are complaining of. If so great a saint 
 as Paul knew not what to pray for, what little reason have we to go 
 forth about that duty in our own strength!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The assistances which the Spirit gives us in that duty. He <I>helps 
 our infirmities,</I> meant especially of our praying infirmities, which 
 most easily beset us in that duty, against which the Spirit helps. The 
 Spirit in the world helps; many rules and promises there are in the 
 word for our help. The Spirit in the heart helps, dwelling in us, 
 working in us, as a Spirit of grace and supplication, especially with 
 respect to the infirmities we are under when we are in a suffering 
 state, when our faith is most apt to fail; for this end the Holy Ghost 
 was poured out. <I>Helpeth,</I> 
 <B><I>synantilambanetai</I></B>--<I>heaves with us, over against us,</I>
 helps as we help one that would lift up a burden, by lifting over 
 against him at the other end--helps with us, that is, with us doing our
 endeavour, putting forth the strength we have. We must not sit still, 
 and expect that the Spirit should do all; when the Spirit goes before 
 us we must bestir ourselves. We cannot without God, and he will not 
 without us. What help? Why, the <I>Spirit itself makes intercession for 
 us,</I> dictates our requests, indites our petitions, draws up our plea 
 for us. Christ intercedes for us in heaven, the Spirit intercedes for 
 us in our hearts; so graciously has God provided for the encouragement 
 of the praying remnant. The Spirit, as an enlightening Spirit, teaches 
 us what to pray for, as a sanctifying Spirit works and excites praying 
 graces, as a comforting Spirit silences our fears, and helps us over 
 all our discouragements. The Holy Spirit is the spring of all our 
 desires and breathings towards God. Now this intercession which the 
 Spirit makes is, 

 (1.) <I>With groanings that cannot be uttered.</I> The strength and 
 fervency of those desires which the Holy Spirit works are hereby 
 intimated. There may be praying in the Spirit where there is not a word 
 spoken; as Moses prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:15">Exod. xiv. 15</A>),
 
 and Hannah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:13">1 Sam. i. 13</A>.

 It is not the rhetoric and eloquence, but the faith and fervency, of 
 our prayers, that the Spirit works, as an intercessor, in us. <I>Cannot 
 be uttered;</I> they are so confused, the soul is in such a hurry with 
 temptations and troubles, we know not what to say, nor how to express 
 ourselves. Here is the Spirit interceding with groans that cannot be 
 uttered. When we can but cry, <I>Abba, Father,</I> and refer ourselves 
 to him with a holy humble boldness, this is the work of the Spirit.
 
 (2.) <I>According to the will of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The Spirit in the heart never contradicts the Spirit in the word. Those 
 desires that are contrary to the will of God do not come from the 
 Spirit. The Spirit interceding in us evermore melts our wills into the 
 will of God. <I>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The sure success of these intercessions: <I>He that searches the 
 heart knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 To a hypocrite, all whose religion lies in his tongue, nothing is more 
 dreadful than that God searches the heart and sees through all his 
 disguises. To a sincere Christian, who makes heart-work of his duty, 
 nothing is more comfortable than that God searches the heart, for then 
 he will hear and answer those desires which we want words to express.
 He knows what we have need of before we ask, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:8">Matt. vi. 8</A>.

 He knows what is the mind of his own Spirit in us. And, as he always
 hears the Son interceding for us, so he always hears the Spirit 
 interceding in us, because his intercession is according to the will of 
 God. What could have been done more for the comfort of the Lord's 
 people, in all their addresses to God? Christ had said, "Whatever you 
 ask the Father according to his will he will give it you." But how 
 shall we learn to ask according to his will? Why, the Spirit will teach 
 us that. Therefore it is that the seed of Jacob never seek in
 vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The concurrence of all providences for the good of those that are 
 Christ's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It might be objected that, notwithstanding all these privileges, we see 
 believers compassed about with manifold afflictions; though the Spirit 
 makes intercession for them, yet their troubles are continued. It is 
 very true; but in this the Spirit's intercession is always effectual, 
 that, however it goes with them, all this is working together for their 
 good. Observe here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The character of the saints, who are interested in this privilege; 
 they are here described by such properties as are common to all that 
 are truly sanctified. 

 (1.) <I>They love God.</I> This includes all the out-goings of the 
 soul's affections towards God as the chief good and highest end. It is 
 our love to God that makes every providence sweet, and therefore 
 profitable. Those that love God make the best of all he does, and take 
 all in good part. 

 (2.) <I>They are the called according to his purpose,</I> effectually 
 called according to the eternal purpose. The call is effectual, not 
 according to any merit or desert of ours, but according to God's own 
 gracious purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The privilege of the saints, that <I>all things work together for 
 good to them,</I> that is, all the providences of God that concern 
 them. All that God performs he performs for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:2">Ps. lvii. 2</A>.

 Their sins are not of his performing, therefore not intended here,
 though his permitting sin is made to work for their good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.

 But all the providences of God are theirs--merciful providences,
 afflicting providences, personal, public. They are all for good; 
 perhaps for temporal good, as Joseph's troubles; at least, for 
 spiritual and eternal good. That is good for them which does their 
 souls good. Either directly or indirectly, every providence has a 
 tendency to the spiritual good of those that love God, breaking them 
 off from sin, bringing them nearer to God, weaning them from the world, 
 fitting them for heaven. <I>Work together.</I> They work, as physic 
 works upon the body, various ways, according to the intention of the 
 physician; but all for the patient's good. <I>They work together,</I> 
 as several ingredients in a medicine concur to answer the intention. 
 God hath set the one over against the other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>):

 <B><I>synergei,</I></B> a very singular, with a noun plural, denoting 
 the harmony of Providence and its uniform designs, all the wheels as 
 one wheel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:13">Ezek. x. 13</A>.

 <I>He worketh all things together for good;</I> so some read it. It is
 not from any specific quality in the providences themselves, but from 
 the power and grace of God working in, with, and by, these providences. 
 All this <I>we know</I>--know it for a certainty, from the word of God, 
 from our own experience, and from the experience of all the saints.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <I>to be</I>
 conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn
 among many brethren.
 &nbsp; 30  Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
 whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,
 them he also glorified.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having reckoned up so many ingredients of the happiness of 
 true believers, comes here to represent the ground of them all, which 
 he lays in predestination. These precious privileges are conveyed to us 
 by the charter of the covenant, but they are founded in the counsel of 
 God, which infallibly secures the event. That Jesus Christ, the 
 purchaser, might not labour in vain, nor spend his strength and life 
 for nought and in vain, there is a remnant given him, a seed that he 
 shall see, so that the good pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his 
 hands. For the explication of this he here sets before us the order of 
 the causes of our salvation, a golden chain, which cannot be broken. 
 There are four links of it:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to 
 the image of his Son.</I> All that God designed for glory and happiness 
 as the end he decreed to grace and holiness as the way. Not, whom he 
 did foreknow to be holy those he predestinated to be so. The counsels 
 and decrees of God do not truckle to the frail and fickle will of men; 
 no, God's foreknowledge of the saints is the same with that everlasting 
 love wherewith he is said to have loved them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3">Jer. xxxi. 3</A>.

 God's knowing his people is the same with his owning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6,Joh+10:14,2Ti+2:19">Ps. i. 6; John x. 14; 2 Tim. ii. 19</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2"><I>ch.</I> xi. 2</A>.

 Words of knowledge often in scripture denote affection; so here:
 <I>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2">1 Pet. i. 2</A>.

 And the same word is rendered <I>fore-ordained,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:20">1 Pet. i. 20</A>.
 
 <I>Whom he did foreknow,</I> that is, whom he designed for his friends
 and favourites. <I>I know thee by name,</I> said God to Moses,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:12">Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>.

 Now those whom god thus foreknew he did predestinate to be conformed to 
 Christ.

 1. Holiness consists in our conformity to the image of Christ. This
 takes in the whole of sanctification, of which Christ is the great 
 pattern and sampler. To be spirited as Christ was, to walk and live as 
 Christ did, to bear our sufferings patiently as Christ did. Christ is 
 the express image of his Father, and the saints are conformed to the 
 image of Christ. Thus it is by the mediation and interposal of Christ 
 that we have God's love restored to us and God's likeness renewed upon 
 us, in which two things consists the happiness of man. 

 2. All that God hath from eternity foreknown with favour he hath
 predestinated to this conformity. It is not we that can conform 
 ourselves to Christ. Our giving ourselves to Christ takes rise in God's 
 giving us to him; and, in giving us to him, he predestinated us to be 
 conformable to his image. It is a mere cavil therefore to call the 
 doctrine of election a licentious doctrine, and to argue that it gives 
 encouragement to sin, as if the end were separated from the way and 
 happiness from holiness. None can know their election but by their
 conformity to the image of Christ; for all that are chosen are chosen 
 to sanctification

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13">2 Thess. ii. 13</A>),

 and surely it cannot be a temptation to any to be conformed to the 
 world to believe that they were predestinated to be conformed to 
 Christ. 

 3. That which is herein chiefly designed is the honour of Jesus Christ,
 that he might be the <I>first-born among many brethren;</I> that is, 
 that Christ might have the honour of being the great pattern, as well 
 as the great prince, and in this, as in other things, might have 
 pre-eminence. It was in the first-born that all the children were 
 dedicated to God under the law. The first-born was the head of the
 family, on whom all the rest did depend: now in the family of the 
 saints Christ must have the honour of being the first-born. And blessed 
 be God that there are many brethren; though they seem but a few in one 
 place at one time, yet, when they come all together, they will be a 
 great many. There is, therefore, a certain number predestinated, that 
 the end of Christ's undertaking might be infallibly secured. Had the 
 event been left at uncertainties in the divine counsels, to depend upon 
 the contingent turn of man's will, Christ might have been the 
 first-born among but few or no brethren--a captain without soldiers and 
 a prince without subjects--to prevent which, and to secure to him many 
 brethren, the decree is absolute, the thing ascertained, that he might 
 be sure to see his seed, there is a remnant predestinated to be 
 conformed to his image, which decree will certainly have its 
 accomplishment in the holiness and happiness of that chosen race; and 
 so, in spite of all the opposition of the powers of darkness, Christ 
 will be the first-born among many, very many brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Whom he did predestinate those he also called,</I> not only with 
 the external call (so many are called that were not chosen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:16,22:14">Matt. xx. 16; xxii. 14</A>),

 but with the internal and effectual call. The former comes to the ear 
 only, but this to the heart. All that God did from eternity 
 predestinate to grace and glory he does, in the fulness of time, 
 effectually call. The call is then effectual when we come at the call; 
 and we then come at the call when the Spirit draws us, convinces the 
 conscience of guilt and wrath, enlightens the understanding, bows the 
 will, persuades and enables us to embrace Christ in the promises, makes 
 us willing in the day of his power. It is an effectual call from self 
 and earth to God, and Christ, and heaven, as our end--from sin and 
 vanity to grace, and holiness, and seriousness as our way. This is the 
 gospel call. <I>Them he called,</I> that the purpose of God, according 
 to election, might stand: we are called to that to which we were 
 chosen. So that the only way to make our election sure is to make sure 
 our calling, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:10">2 Pet. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>Whom he called those he also justified.</I> All that are 
 effectually called are justified, absolved from guilt, and accepted as 
 righteous through Jesus Christ. They are <I>recti in curia--right in
 court;</I> no sin that ever they have been guilty of shall come against 
 them, to condemn them. The book is crossed, the bond cancelled, the 
 judgment vacated, the attainder reversed; and they are no longer dealt 
 with as criminals, but owned and loved as friends and favourites. 
 Blessed is the man whose iniquity is thus forgiven. None are thus 
 justified but those that are effectually called. Those that stand it 
 out against the gospel call abide under guilt and wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>Whom he justified those he also glorified.</I> The power of 
 corruption being broken in effectual calling, and the guilt of sin 
 removed in justification, all that which hinders is taken out of the 
 way, and nothing can come between that soul and glory. Observe, It is 
 spoken of as a thing done: <I>He glorified,</I> because of the 
 certainty of it; he <I>hath</I> saved us, and called us with a holy 
 calling. In the eternal glorification of all the elect, God's design of 
 love has its full accomplishment. This was what he aimed at all 
 along--to bring them to heaven. Nothing less than that glory would make
 up the fulness of his covenant relation to them as God; and therefore, 
 in all he does for them, and in them, he has this in his eye. Are they 
 chosen? It is to salvation. Called? It is to his kingdom and glory.
 Begotten again? It is to an inheritance incorruptible. Afflicted: It is 
 to work for them this exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Observe, 
 The author of all these is the same. It is God himself that 
 predestinated, calleth, justifieth, glorifieth; so <I>the Lord alone 
 did lead him, and there was no strange God with him.</I> Created wills 
 are so very fickle, and created powers so very feeble, that, if any of 
 these did depend upon the creature, the whole would shake. But God 
 himself hath undertaken the doing of it from first to last, that we 
 might abide in a constant dependence upon him and subjection to him, 
 and ascribe all the praise to him--that every crown may be cast before
 the throne. This is a mighty encouragement to our faith and hope; for, 
 as for God, his way, his work, is perfect. He that hath laid the 
 foundation will build upon it, and the top-stone will at length be 
 brought forth with shoutings, and it will be our eternal work to cry, 
 Grace, grace to it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  What shall we then say to these things? If God <I>be</I> for us,
 who <I>can be</I> against us?
 &nbsp; 32  He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
 all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

 to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle closes this excellent discourse upon the privileges of 
 believers with a holy triumph, in the name of all the saints. Having 
 largely set forth the mystery of God's love to us in Christ, and the 
 exceedingly great and precious privileges we enjoy by him, he concludes 
 like an orator: <I>What shall we then say to these things?</I> What use 
 shall we make of all that has been said? He speaks as one amazed and 
 swallowed up with the contemplation and admiration of it, wondering at 
 the height and depth, and length and breadth, of the love of Christ, 
 which passeth knowledge. The more we know of other things the less we 
 wonder at them; but the further we are led into an acquaintance with 
 gospel mysteries the more we are affected with the admiration of them. 
 If Paul was at a loss what to say to these things, no marvel if we be. 
 And what does he say? Why, if ever Paul rode in a triumphant chariot on 
 this side of heaven, here it was: with such a holy height and bravery 
 of spirit, with such a fluency and copiousness of expression, does he 
 here comfort himself and all the people of God, upon the consideration 
 of these privileges. In general, he here makes a challenge, throws down 
 the gauntlet, as it were, dares all the enemies of the saints to do 
 their worst: <I>If God be for us, who can be against us?</I> The ground 
 of the challenge is God's being for us; in this he sums up all our 
 privileges. This includes all, that <I>God is for us;</I> not only 
 reconciled to us, and so not against us, but in covenant with us, and 
 so engaged for us--all his attributes for us, his promises for us. All
 that he is, and has, and does, is for his people. He performs all 
 things for them. He is for them, even when he seems to act against 
 them. And, if so, <I>who can be against us,</I> so as to prevail 
 against us, so as to hinder our happiness? Be they ever so great and 
 strong, ever so many, ever so might, ever so malicious, what can they 
 do? While God is for us, and we keep in his love, we may with a holy 
 boldness defy all the powers of darkness. Let Satan do his worst, he is 
 chained; let the world do its worst, it is conquered: principalities 
 and powers are spoiled and disarmed, and triumphed over, in the cross 
 of Christ. Who then dares fight against us, while God himself is 
 fighting for us? And this we say to these things, this is the inference 
 we draw from these premises. More particularly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have supplies ready in all our wants 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>He that spared,</I> &c. Who can be against us, to strip us, to 
 deprive us of our comforts? Who can cut off our streams, while we have 
 a fountain to go to? 

 1. Observe what God has done for us, on which our hopes are built:
 <I>He spared not his own Son.</I> When he was to undertake our
 salvation, the Father was willing to part with him, did not think him
 too precious a gift to bestow for the salvation of poor souls; now we
 may know that he loves us, in that he hath not withheld his Son, his
 own Son, his only Son, from us, as he said of Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:12">Gen. xxii. 12</A>.

 If nothing less will save man, rather than man shall perish let him go,
 though it were out of his bosom. Thus did he <I>deliver him up for us 
 all,</I> that is, for all the elect; <I>for us all,</I> not only for 
 our good, but in our stead, as a sacrifice of atonement to be a 
 propitiation for sin. When he had undertaken it, he did not spare him.
 Though he was his own Son, yet, being made sin for us, it pleased the 
 Lord to bruise him. <B><I>Ouk epheisato</I></B>--<I>he did not 
 abate</I> him a farthing of that great debt, but charged it home.
 <I>Awake, O sword.</I> He did not <I>spare his own Son that served 
 him,</I> that he might spare us, though we have done him so much 
 disservice. 

 2. What we may therefore expect he will do: He will <I>with him freely
 give us all things.</I>

 (1.) It is implied that he will give us Christ, for other things are 
 bestowed with him: not only with him given for us, but with him given 
 to us. He that put himself to so much charge to make the purchase for 
 us surely will not hesitate at making the application to us. 

 (2.) He will with him freely give us all things, all things that he 
 sees to be needful and necessary for us, all good things, and more we 
 should not desire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 And Infinite Wisdom shall be the judge whether it be good for us and
 needful for us or no. <I>Freely give</I>--freely, without reluctancy;
 he is ready to give, meets us with his favours;--and freely, without 
 recompence, without money, and without price. <I>How shall he not?</I> 
 Can it be imagined that he should do the greater and not do the less? 
 that he should give so great a gift for us when we were enemies, and 
 should deny us any good thing, now that through him we are friends and 
 children? Thus may we by faith argue against our fears of want. He that
 hath prepared a crown and kingdom for us will be sure to give us enough 
 to bear our charges in the way to it. He that hath designed us for the 
 inheritance of sons when we come to age will not let us want 
 necessaries in the mean time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have an answer ready to all accusations and a security against 
 all condemnations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>):

 <I>Who shall lay any thing?</I> Doth the law accuse them? Do their own 
 consciences accuse them? Is the devil, the accuser of the brethren, 
 accusing them before our God day and night? This is enough to answer 
 all those accusations, <I>It is God that justifieth.</I> Men may 
 justify themselves, as the Pharisees did, and yet the accusations may 
 be in full force against them; but, if God justifies, this answers all. 
 He is the judge, the king, the party offended, and his judgment is 
 according to truth, and sooner or later all the world will be brought 
 to be of his mind; so that we may challenge all our accusers to come 
 and put in their charge. This overthrows them all; it is God, the 
 righteous faithful God, that justifieth. <I>Who is he that 
 condemneth?</I> Though they cannot make good the charge yet they will 
 be ready to condemn; but we have a plea ready to move in arrest of 
 judgment, a plea which cannot be overruled. <I>It is Christ that
 died,</I> &c. It is by virtue of our interest in Christ, our relation 
 to him, and our union with him, that we are thus secured. 

 1. His death: <I>It is Christ that died.</I> By the merit of his death
 he paid our debt; and the surety's payment is a good plea to an action 
 of debt. It is Christ, an able all-sufficient Saviour. 

 2. His resurrection: <I>Yea, rather, that has risen again.</I> This is
 a much greater encouragement, for it is a convincing evidence that 
 divine justice was satisfied by the merit of his death. His 
 resurrection was his acquittance, it was a legal discharge. Therefore 
 the apostle mentions it with a <I>yea, rather.</I> If he had died, and 
 not risen again, we had been where we were. 

 3. His sitting at the right hand of God: He is <I>even at the right
 hand of God</I>--a further evidence that he has done his work, and a 
 mighty encouragement to us in reference to all accusations, that we 
 have a friend, such a friend, in court. At <I>the right hand of 
 God,</I> which denotes that he is ready there--always at hand; and that 
 he is ruling there--all power is given to him. Our friend is himself 
 the judge. 

 4. The intercession which he makes there. He is there, not unconcerned
 about us, not forgetful of us, but <I>making intercession.</I> He is 
 agent for us there, an advocate for us, to answer all accusations, to 
 put in our plea, and to prosecute it with effect, to appear for us and 
 to present our petitions. And is not this abundant matter for comfort? 
 What shall we say to these things? Is this the manner of men, O Lord 
 God? What room is left for doubting and disquietment? Why art thou cast 
 down, O my soul? Some understand the accusation and condemnation here 
 spoken of of that which the suffering saints met with from men. The 
 primitive Christians had many black crimes laid to their 
 charge--heresy, sedition, rebellion, and what not? For these the
 ruling powers condemned them: "But no matter for that" (says the 
 apostle); "while we stand right at God's bar it is of no great moment 
 how we stand at men's. To all the hard censures, the malicious 
 calumnies, and the unjust and unrighteous sentences of men, we may with 
 comfort oppose our justification before God through Christ Jesus as 
 that which doth abundantly countervail," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3,4">1 Cor. iv. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have good assurance of our preservation and continuance in this 
 blessed state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35-39"><I>v.</I> 35, to the end</A>.

 The fears of the saints lest they should lose their hold of Christ are 
 often very discouraging and disquieting, and create them a great deal 
 of disturbance; but here is that which may silence their fears, and 
 still such storms, that nothing can separate them. We have here from 
 the apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A daring challenge to all the enemies of the saints to separate 
 them, if they could, from the love of Christ. <I>Who shall?</I> None 
 shall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35-37"><I>v.</I> 35-37</A>.

 God having manifested his love in giving his own Son for us, and not
 hesitating at that, can we imagine that any thing else should divert or 
 dissolve that love? Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The present calamities of Christ's beloved ones supposed--that they
 meet with <I>tribulation</I> on all hands, are in <I>distress,</I> know 
 not which way to look for any succour and relief in this world, are 
 followed with <I>persecution</I> from an angry malicious world that 
 always hated those whom Christ loved, pinched with <I>famine,</I> and 
 starved with <I>nakedness,</I> when stripped of all 
 <I>creature-comforts,</I> exposed to the greatest <I>perils,</I> the 
 <I>sword</I> of the magistrate drawn against them, ready to be sheathed 
 in their bowels, bathed in their blood. Can a case be supposed more 
 black and dismal? It is illustrated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)
 
 by a passage quoted from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:22">Ps. xliv. 22</A>,

 <I>For thy sake we are killed all the day long,</I> which intimates 
 that we are not to think strange, no not concerning the fiery bloody 
 trial. We see the Old-Testament saints had the same lot; so persecuted 
 they the prophets that were before us. <I>Killed all the day long,</I> 
 that is, continually exposed to and expecting the fatal stroke. There 
 is still every day, and all the day long, one or other of the people of 
 God bleeding and dying under the rage of persecuting enemies. 
 <I>Accounted as sheep for the slaughter;</I> they make no more of 
 killing a Christian than of butchering a sheep. Sheep are killed, not 
 because they are hurtful while they live, but because they are useful 
 when they are dead. They kill the Christians to please themselves, to 
 be food to their malice. <I>They eat up my people as they eat 
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The inability of all these things to separate us from the love of 
 Christ. Shall they, can they, do it? No, by no means. All this will not 
 cut the bond of love and friendship that is between Christ and true 
 believers. 

 [1.] Christ doth not, will not, love us the less for all this. All 
 these troubles are very consistent with the strong and constant love of 
 the Lord Jesus. They are neither a cause nor an evidence of the 
 abatement of his love. When Paul was whipped, and beaten, and 
 imprisoned, and stoned, did Christ love him ever the less? Were his
 favours intermitted? his smiles any whit suspended? his visits more 
 shy? By no means, but the contrary. These things separate us from the 
 love of other friends. When Paul was brought before Nero all men 
 forsook him, but then the Lord stood by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16,17">2 Tim. iv. 16, 17</A>.

 Whatever persecuting enemies may rob us of, they cannot rob us of the
 love of Christ, they cannot intercept his love-tokens, they cannot 
 interrupt nor exclude his visits: and therefore, let them do their 
 worst, they cannot make a true believer miserable.

 [2.] We do not, will not, love him the less for this; and that for this 
 reason, because we do not think that he loves us the less. Charity 
 thinks no evil, entertains no misgiving thoughts, makes no hard 
 conclusions, no unkind constructions, takes all in good part that comes 
 from love. A true Christian loves Christ never the less though he 
 suffer for him, thinks never the worse of Christ through he lose all 
 for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The triumph of believers in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:37">
 <I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] We are conquerors: though killed all the day long, yet conquerors. 
 A strange way of conquering, but it was Christ's way; thus he triumphed 
 over principalities and powers in his cross. It is a surer and a nobler 
 way of conquest by faith and patience than by fire and sword. The 
 enemies have sometimes confessed themselves baffled and overcome by the 
 invincible courage and constancy of the martyrs, who thus overcame the 
 most victorious princes by not loving their lives to the death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:11">Rev. xii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] We are more than conquerors. In our patiently bearing these trials 
 we are not only conquerors, but more than conquerors, that is, 
 triumphers. Those are more than conquerors that conquer, <I>First,</I> 
 With little loss. Many conquests are dearly bought; but what do the 
 suffering saints lose? Why, they lose that which the gold loses in the 
 furnace, nothing but the dross. It is no great loss to lose things 
 which are not--a body that is of the earth, earthy. <I>Secondly,</I>
 With great gain. The spoils are exceedingly rich; glory, honour, and 
 peace, a crown of righteousness that fades not away. In this the 
 suffering saints have triumphed; not only have not been separated from 
 the love of Christ, but have been taken into the most sensible 
 endearments and embraces of it. As afflictions abound, consolations 
 much more abound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>.

 There is one more than a conqueror, when pressed above measure. He that
 embraced the stake, and said, "Welcome the cross of Christ, welcome 
 everlasting life,"--he that dated his letter from the delectable 
 orchard of the Leonine prison,--he that said, "In these flames I feel 
 no more pain than if I were upon a bed of down,"--she who, a little 
 before her martyrdom, being asked how she did, said, "Well and merry, 
 and going to heaven,"--those that have gone smiling to the stake, and 
 stood singing in the flames--these were more than conquerors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] It is only <I>through Christ that loved us,</I> the merit of his 
 death taking the sting out of all these troubles, the Spirit of his 
 grace strengthening us, and enabling us to bear them with holy courage 
 and constancy, and coming in with special comforts and supports. Thus 
 we are conquerors, not in our own strength, but in the grace that is in 
 Christ Jesus. We are conquerors by virtue of our interest in Christ's 
 victory. He hath overcome the world for us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:33">John xvi. 33</A>),

 both the good things and the evil things of it; so that we have nothing 
 to do but to pursue the victory, and to divide the spoil, and so are 
 more than conquerors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A direct and positive conclusion of the whole matter: <I>For I am 
 persuaded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>.

 It denotes a full, and strong, and affectionate persuasion, arising 
 from the experience of the strength and sweetness of the divine love. 
 And here he enumerates all those things which might be supposed likely 
 to separate between Christ and believers, and concludes that it could 
 not be done.

 (1.) <I>Neither death nor life</I>--neither the terrors of death on the 
 one hand nor the comforts and pleasures of life on the other, neither 
 the fear of death nor the hope of life. Or, We shall not be separated 
 from that love either in death or in life. 

 (2.) <I>Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers.</I> Both the good 
 angels and the bad are called principalities and powers: the good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:21,Col+1:16">Eph. i. 21; Col. i. 16</A>;
 
 the bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:12,Col+2:15">Eph. vi. 12; Col. ii. 15</A>.

 And neither shall do it. The good angels will not, the bad shall not; 
 and neither can. The good angels are engaged friends, the bad are 
 restrained enemies.

 (3.) <I>Nor things present, nor things to come</I>--neither the sense
 of troubles present nor the fear of troubles to come. Time shall not 
 separate us, eternity shall not. Things present separate us from things 
 to come, and things to come separate and cut us off from things 
 present; but neither from the love of Christ, whose favour is twisted 
 in with both present things and things to come. 

 (4.) <I>Nor height, nor depth</I>--neither the height of prosperity and 
 preferment, nor the depth of adversity and disgrace; nothing from 
 heaven above, no storms, no tempests; nothing on earth below, no rocks, 
 no seas, no dungeons.

 (5.) <I>Nor any other creature</I>--any thing that can be named or 
 thought of. It will not, it cannot, separate us from the love of God, 
 which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. It cannot cut off or impair our love 
 to God, or God's to us; nothing does it, can do it, but sin. Observe, 
 The love that exists between God and true believers is through Christ.
 He is the Mediator of our love: it is in and through him that God can 
 love us and that we dare love God. This is the ground of the 
 stedfastness of the love; therefore God rests in his love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17">Zeph. iii. 17</A>),
 
 because Jesus Christ, in whom he loves us, is the same yesterday, 
 to-day, and for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mr. Hugh Kennedy, an eminent Christian of Ayr, in Scotland, when he was 
 dying, called for a Bible; but, finding his sight gone, he said, "Turn 
 me to the eighty of the Romans, and set my finger at these words, <I>I 
 am persuaded that neither death nor life,</I>" &c. "Now," said he, "is
 my finger upon them?" And, when they told him it was, without speaking 
 any more, he said, "Now, God be with you, my children; I have 
 breakfasted with you, and shall sup with my Lord Jesus Christ this 
 night;" and so departed.</P>
