 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Peter's necessary vindication of what he did in receiving Cornelius
 and his friends into the church, from the censure he lay under for it 
 among the brethren, and their acquiescence in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:1-18">ver. 1-18</A>.

 II. The good success of the gospel at Antioch, and the parts adjacent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 III. The carrying on of the good work that was begun at Antioch, by the
 ministry of Barnabas first, and afterwards of Paul in conjunction with
 him, and the lasting name of Christian first given to the disciples
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>.

 was made among the Gentile converts for the relief of the poor saints
 in Judea, upon that occasion,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Jud&aelig;a heard that
 the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
 &nbsp; 2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of
 the circumcision contended with him,
 &nbsp; 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat
 with them.
 &nbsp; 4 But Peter rehearsed <I>the matter</I> from the beginning, and
 expounded <I>it</I> by order unto them, saying,
 &nbsp; 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a
 vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet,
 let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
 &nbsp; 6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered,
 and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and
 creeping things, and fowls of the air.
 &nbsp; 7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and
 eat.
 &nbsp; 8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath
 at any time entered into my mouth.
 &nbsp; 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
 cleansed, <I>that</I> call not thou common.
 &nbsp; 10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again
 into heaven.
 &nbsp; 11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come
 unto the house where I was, sent from C&aelig;sarea unto me.
 &nbsp; 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting.
 Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into
 the man's house:
 &nbsp; 13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house,
 which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for
 Simon, whose surname is Peter;
 &nbsp; 14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house
 shall be saved.
 &nbsp; 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on
 us at the beginning.
 &nbsp; 16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said,
 John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
 the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as <I>he did</I>
 unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that
 I could withstand God?
 &nbsp; 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and
 glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted
 repentance unto life.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The preaching of the gospel to Cornelius was a thing which we poor 
 sinners of the Gentiles have reason to reflect upon with a great deal 
 of joy and thankfulness; for it was the bringing of light to us who sat 
 in darkness. Now it being so great a surprize to the believing as well 
 as the unbelieving Jews, it is worth while to enquire how it was 
 received, and what comments were made upon it. And here we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Intelligence was presently brought of it to the church in Jerusalem, 
 and thereabouts; for Cesarea was not so far from Jerusalem but that 
 they might presently hear of it. Some for good-will, and some for 
 ill-will, would spread the report of it; so that before he himself had 
 returned to Jerusalem <I>the apostles and</I> the <I>brethren</I> there 
 and <I>in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of 
 God,</I> that is, the gospel of Christ, which is not only a word of 
 God, but the word of God; for it is the summary and centre of all 
 divine revelation. They received Christ; <I>for his name is called the 
 Word of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:13">Rev. xix. 13</A>.

 Not only that the Jews who were dispersed into the Gentile countries, 
 and the Gentiles who were proselyted to the Jewish religion, but that 
 the Gentiles also themselves, with whom it had hitherto been thought 
 unlawful to hold common conversation, were taken into church-communion, 
 that they had <I>received the word of God.</I> That is, 

 1. That the word of God was preached to them, which was a greater
 honour put upon them than they expected. Yet I wonder this should seem 
 strange to those who were themselves commissioned to <I>preach the 
 gospel to every creature.</I> But thus often are the prejudices of 
 pride and bigotry held fast against the clearest discoveries of divine 
 truth. 

 2. That it was entertained and submitted to by them, which was a better
 work wrought upon them than they expected. It is likely they had got a 
 notion that if the gospel were preached to the Gentiles it would be to 
 no purpose, because the proofs of the gospel were fetched so much out 
 of the Old Testament, which the Gentiles did not receive: they looked 
 upon them as not inclined to religion, nor likely to receive the 
 impressions of it; and therefore were surprized to hear that they had 
 received the word of the Lord. Note, We are too apt to despair of
 doing good to those who yet, when they are tried, prove very 
 tractable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That offence was taken at it by the believing Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):
 
 <I>When Peter had himself come up to Jerusalem, those that were of the
 circumcision,</I> those Jewish converts that still retained a 
 veneration for circumcision, <I>contended with him.</I> They charged it 
 upon him as a crime that he <I>went in to men uncircumcised, and did 
 eat with them;</I> and thereby they think he has stained, if not 
 forfeited, the honour of his apostleship, and ought to come under the 
 censure of the church: so far were they from looking upon him as 
 infallible, or as the supreme head of the church that all were 
 accountable to, and he to none. See here, 

 1. How much it is the bane and damage of the church, to monopolize it,
 and to exclude those from it, and from the benefit of the means of 
 grace, that are not in every thing as we are. There are narrow souls 
 that are for engrossing the riches of the church, as there are that 
 would engross the riches of the world, and would be <I>placed alone in 
 the midst of the earth.</I> These men were of Jonah's mind, who, in a 
 jealousy for his people, was angry that the Ninevites received the word 
 of God, and justified himself in it. 

 2. Christ's ministers must not think it strange if they be censured and
 quarrelled with, not only by their professed enemies, but by their 
 professing friends; not only for their follies and infirmities, but for 
 their good actions seasonably and well done; but, if we have proved our 
 own work, we may have rejoicing in ourselves, as Peter had, whatever 
 reflections we may have from our brethren. Those that are zealous and 
 courageous in the service of Christ must expect to be censured by those 
 who, under pretence of being cautious, are cold and indifferent. Those 
 who are of catholic, generous, charitable principles, must expect to be 
 censured by such as are conceited and strait-laced, who say, <I>Stand 
 by thyself, I am holier than thou.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Peter gave such a full and fair account of the matter of fact as 
 was sufficient, without any further argument or apology, both to 
 justify him, and to satisfy them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>He rehearsed the matter from the beginning,</I> and laid it before 
 them in order, and then could appeal to themselves whether he had done 
 amiss; for it appeared all along God's own work, and not his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He takes it for granted that if they had rightly understood how the 
 matter was they would not have contended with him, and commended him. 
 And it is a good reason why we should be moderate in our censures, and 
 sparing of them, because if we rightly understood that which we are so 
 forward to run down perhaps we should see cause to run in with it. When 
 we see others do that which looks suspicious, instead of contending 
 with them, we should enquire of them what ground they went upon; and, 
 if we have not an opportunity to do that, should ourselves put the best 
 construction upon it that it will bear, and <I>judge nothing before the 
 time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is very willing to stand right in their opinion, and takes pains 
 to give them satisfaction. He does not insist upon his being the chief 
 of the apostles, for he was far from the thought of that supremacy 
 which his pretended successors claim. Nor does he think it enough to 
 tell them that he is satisfied himself in the grounds he went upon, and 
 they need not trouble themselves about it; but he is ready to <I>give a 
 reason of the hope that is in him</I> concerning the Gentiles, and why 
 he had receded from his former sentiments, which were the same with 
 theirs. It is a debt we owe both to ourselves and to our brethren to 
 set those actions of ours in a true light which at first looked ill and 
 gave offence, that we may remove stumbling-blocks out of our brethren's 
 way. Let us now see what Peter pleads in his own defence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he was instructed by a vision no longer to keep up the 
 distinctions which were made by the ceremonial law; he relates the
 vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),
 
 as we had it before 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9"><I>ch.</I> x. 9</A>,

 &c. The sheet which was there said to be <I>let down to the earth</I>
 he here says came <I>even to him,</I> which circumstance intimates that 
 it was particularly designed for instruction to him. We should thus see 
 all God's discoveries of himself, which he has made to the children of 
 men, coming even to us, applying them by faith to ourselves. Another 
 circumstance here added is that when the sheet <I>came to him he 
 fastened his eyes upon it, and considered it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 If we would be led into the knowledge of divine things, we must fix our 
 minds upon them, and consider them. He tells them what orders he had to 
 eat of all sorts of meat without distinction, asking no questions for 
 conscience' sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was not till after the flood (as it should seem) that man was 
 allowed to eat flesh at all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:3">Gen. ix. 3</A>.

 That allowance was afterwards limited by the ceremonial law; but now 
 the restrictions were taken off, and the matter set at large again. It 
 was not the design of Christ to abridge us in the use of our 
 creature-comforts by any other law than that of sobriety and 
 temperance, and preferring the meat that endures to eternal life before 
 that which perishes. He pleads that he was as averse to the thoughts of 
 conversing with Gentiles, or eating of their dainties, as they could 
 be, and therefore refused the liberty given him: <I>Not so, Lord; for 
 nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 But he was told from heaven that the case was now altered, that God
 had cleansed those persons and things which were before polluted; and 
 therefore that he must no longer call them common, nor look upon them 
 as unfit to be meddled with by the peculiar people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 so that he was not to be blamed for changing his thoughts, when God had 
 changed the thing. In things of this nature we must act according to 
 our present light; yet must not be so wedded to our opinion concerning 
 them as to be prejudiced against further discoveries, when the matter 
 may either be otherwise or appear otherwise; and God may reveal even 
 this unto us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:15">Phil. iii. 15</A>.

 And, that they might be sure he was not deceived in it, he tells them
 it was done three times

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 the same command given, to kill and eat, and the same reason, because 
 that which God hath cleansed is not to be called common, repeated a 
 second and third time. And, further to confirm him that it was a divine 
 vision, the things he saw did not vanish away into the air, but <I>were 
 drawn up again into heaven,</I> whence they were let down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he was particularly directed by the Spirit to go along with 
 the messengers that Cornelius sent. And, that it might appear that the 
 vision was designed to satisfy him in this matter, he observes to them 
 the time when the messengers came--immediately after he had that vision;
 yet, lest this should not be sufficient to clear his way, the Spirit 
 bade him <I>go with the men</I> that were then sent from Cesarea to 
 him, <I>nothing doubting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>);

 though they were Gentiles he went to, and went with, yet he must make 
 no scruple of going along with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he took some of his brethren along with him, who were of the 
 circumcision, that they might be satisfied as well as he; and these he 
 had brought up from Joppa, to witness for him with what caution he 
 proceeded, foreseeing the offence that would be taken at it. He did not 
 act separately, but with advice; not rashly, but upon due 
 deliberation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That Cornelius had a vision too, by which he was directed to send 
 for Peter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>He showed us how he had seen a angel in his house,</I> that bade him 
 <I>send to Joppa for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.</I> See how 
 good it is for those that have communion with God, and keep up a 
 correspondence with heaven, to compare notes, and communicate their 
 experiences to each other; for hereby they may strengthen one another's 
 faith: Peter is the more confirmed in the truth of his vision by 
 Cornelius's, and Cornelius by Peter's. Here is something added in what 
 the angel said to Cornelius; before it was, <I>Send for Peter, and he 
 shall speak to thee, he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:6,32"><I>ch.</I> x. 6, 32</A>);

 but here it is, "<I>He shall tell thee words whereby thou and thy house
 shall be saved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and therefore it is of vast concern to thee, and will be of unspeakable 
 advantage, to send for him." Note, 

 [1.] The words of the gospel are words whereby we may be saved, 
 eternally saved; not merely by hearing them and reading them, but by 
 believing and obeying them. They set the salvation before us, and show 
 us what it is; they open the way of salvation to us, and, if we follow 
 the method prescribed us by them, we shall certainly be saved from 
 wrath and the curse, and be for ever happy. 

 [2.] Those that embrace the gospel of Christ will have salvation 
 brought by it to their families: "<I>Thou and all thy house shall be 
 saved;</I> thou and thy children shall be taken into covenant, and have 
 the means of salvation; thy house shall be as welcome to the benefit of 
 the salvation, upon their believing, as thou thyself, even the meanest 
 servant thou hast. <I>This day is salvation come to this house,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>.
 
 Hitherto salvation was of the Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22">John iv. 22</A>),

 but now salvation is brought to the Gentiles as much as ever it was
 with the Jews; the promises, privileges, and means of it are conveyed 
 to all nations as amply and fully, to all intents and purposes, as ever 
 it had been appropriated to the Jewish nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That which put the matter past all dispute was the descent of the 
 Holy Ghost upon the Gentile hearers; this completed the evidence that 
 it was the will of God that he should take the Gentiles into communion. 
 
 [1.] The fact was plain and undeniable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>As I began to speak</I>" (and perhaps he felt some secret
 reluctance in his own breast, doubting whether he was in the right to 
 preach to the uncircumcised), "presently <I>the Holy Ghost fell on 
 them</I> in as visible signs <I>as on us at the beginning,</I> in which 
 there could be no fallacy." Thus God attested what was done, and 
 declared his approbation of it; that preaching is certainly right with 
 which the Holy Ghost is given. The apostle supposes this, when he thus 
 argues with the Galatians: <I>Received you the Spirit by the works of 
 the law, or by the hearing of faith?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:2">Gal. iii. 2</A>.

 [2.] Peter was hereby put in mind of a saying of his Master's, when he 
 was leaving them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>):

 <I>John baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This plainly intimated, <I>First,</I> that the Holy Ghost was the gift 
 of Christ, and the product and performance of his promise, that great 
 promise which he left with them when he went to heaven. It was 
 therefore without doubt from him that this gift came; and the filling 
 of them with the Holy Ghost was his act and deed. As it was promised by 
 his mouth, so it was performed by his hand, and was a token of his 
 favour. <I>Secondly,</I> That the gift of the Holy Ghost was a kind of 
 baptism. Those that received it were baptized with it in a more 
 excellent manner than any of those that even the Baptist himself 
 baptized with water. 

 [3.] Comparing that promise, so worded, with this gift just now 
 conferred, when the question was started, whether these persons should 
 be baptized or no, he concluded that the question was determined by 
 Christ himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did to 
 us</I>--gave it to us as <I>believing in the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> and
 to them upon their believing in him--<I>What was I, that I could
 withstand God?</I> Could I refuse to baptize them with water, whom God 
 had baptized with the Holy Ghost? Could I deny the sign to those on
 whom he had conferred the thing signified? <I>But, as for me, who was
 I?</I> What! able to forbid God? Did it become me to control the
 divine will, or to oppose the counsels of Heaven?" Note, Those who 
 hinder the conversion of souls withstand God; and those take too much 
 upon them who contrive how to exclude from their communion those whom 
 God has taken into communion with himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This account which Peter gave of the matter satisfied them, and all 
 was well. Thus, when the two tribes and a half gave an account to 
 Phinehas and the princes of Israel of the true intent and meaning of 
 their building themselves an altar on the banks of Jordan, the 
 controversy was dropped, and it pleased them that it was so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:30">Josh. xxii. 30</A>.

 Some people, when they have fastened a censure upon a person, will
 stick to it, though afterwards it appear ever so plainly to be unjust 
 and groundless. It was not so here; for these brethren, though they 
 were of the circumcision, and their bias went the other way, yet, when 
 they heard this, 

 1. They let fall their censures: they held their peace, and said no
 more against what Peter had done; they laid their hand upon their 
 mouth, because now they perceived that God did it. Now those who prided 
 themselves in their dignities as Jews began to see that God was 
 staining their pride, by letting in the Gentiles to share, and to share 
 equally, with them. And now that prophecy was fulfilled, <I>Thou shalt 
 no more be haughty because of my holy mountain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11">Zeph. iii. 11</A>.

 2. They turned them into praises. They not only held their peace from
 quarrelling with Peter, but opened their mouths to glorify God for what 
 he had done by and with Peter's ministry; they were thankful that their 
 mistake was rectified, and that God had shown more mercy to the poor 
 Gentiles than they were inclined to show them, saying, <I>Then hath God 
 also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life!</I> He hath granted 
 them not only the means of repentance, in opening a door of entrance 
 for his ministers among them, but the grace of repentance, in having 
 given them his Holy Spirit, who, wherever he comes to be a Comforter, 
 first convinces, and gives a sight of sin and sorrow for it, and then a 
 sight of Christ and joy in him. Note,

 (1.) Repentance, if it be true, is unto life. It is to spiritual life; 
 all that truly repent of their sins evidence it by living a new life, a 
 holy, heavenly, and divine life. Those that by repentance die unto sin
 thenceforward live unto God; and then, and not till then, we begin to 
 live indeed, and it shall be to eternal life. All true penitents shall 
 live, that is, they shall be restored to the favour of God, which is 
 life, which is better than life; they shall be comforted with the 
 assurance of the pardon of their sins, and shall have the earnest of 
 eternal life, and at length the fruition of it. 

 (2.) Repentance is God's gift; it is not only his free grace that 
 accepts it, but his mighty grace that works it in us, that <I>takes 
 away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice
 of God is a broken spirit;</I> it is he that provides himself this 
 lamb. 

 (3.) Wherever God designs to give life he gives repentance; for this is 
 a necessary preparative for the comforts of a sealed pardon and a 
 settled peace in this world, and for the seeing and enjoying of God in 
 the other world.

 (4.) It is a great comfort to us that God has exalted his Son Jesus, 
 not only to <I>give repentance to Israel, and the remission of sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:31"><I>ch.</I> v. 31</A>),

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution
 that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus,
 and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
 &nbsp; 20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
 they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the
 Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
 believed, and turned unto the Lord.
 &nbsp; 22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the
 church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that
 he should go as far as Antioch.
 &nbsp; 23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad,
 and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would
 cleave unto the Lord.
 &nbsp; 24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of
 faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
 &nbsp; 25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
 &nbsp; 26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And
 it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with
 the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called
 Christians first in Antioch.

 We have here an account of the planting and watering of a church at 
 Antioch, the chief city of Syria, reckoned afterwards the third most 
 considerable city of the empire, only Rome and Alexandria being 
 preferred before it, next to whose patriarch that of Antioch took 
 place. It stood where Hamath or Riblah did, which we read of in the Old 
 Testament. It is suggested that Luke, the penman of this history, as 
 well as Theophilus, to whom he dedicates it, was of Antioch, which may 
 be the reason why he takes more particular notice of the success of the 
 gospel at Antioch, as also because there it was that Paul began to be 
 famous, towards the story of whom he is hastening. Now concerning the 
 church at Antioch observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The first preachers of the gospel there were such as were dispersed 
 from Jerusalem by persecution, that persecution which arose five or six 
 years ago (as some compute), at the time of Stephen's death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>They travelled as far as Phenice</I> and other places <I>preaching 
 the word.</I> God suffered them to be persecuted, that thereby they 
 might be dispersed in the world, sown as seed to God, in order to their 
 bringing forth much fruit. Thus what was intended for the hurt of the 
 church was made to work for its good; as Jacob's curse of the tribe of 
 Levi (<I>I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel</I>) 
 was turned into a blessing. The enemies designed to scatter and lose 
 them, Christ designed to scatter and use them. Thus the wrath of man is 
 made to praise God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those that <I>fled from persecution</I> did not flee from their 
 work; though for the time they declined suffering, yet they did not 
 decline service; nay, they threw themselves into a larger field of 
 opportunity than before. Those that persecuted the preachers of the 
 gospel hoped thereby to prevent their carrying it to the Gentile world; 
 but it proved that they did but hasten it the sooner. <I>Howbeit, they 
 meant not so, neither did their heart think so.</I> Those that were 
 persecuted in one city fled to another; but they carried their religion 
 along with them, not only that they might take the comfort of it 
 themselves, but that they might communicate it to others, thus showing 
 that when they got out of the way it was not because they were afraid 
 of suffering, but because they were willing to reserve themselves for 
 further service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They pressed forward in their work, finding that the <I>good 
 pleasure of the Lord prospered in their hands.</I> When they had 
 preached successfully in Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, they got out of 
 the borders of the land of Canaan, and travelled into Ph&oelig;nicia, into 
 the island of Cyprus, and into Syria. Though the further they travelled 
 the more they exposed themselves, yet they travelled on; <I>plus 
 ultra--further still,</I> was their motto; grudging no pains, and
 dreading no perils, in carrying on so good a work, and serving so good 
 a Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They <I>preached the word to none but to the Jews only</I> who were 
 dispersed in all those parts, and had synagogues of their own, in which 
 they met with them by themselves, and preached to them. They did not 
 yet understand that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs, and of the 
 same body; but left the Gentiles either to turn Jews, and so come into 
 the church, or else remain as they were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They particularly applied themselves to the Hellenist Jews, here 
 called the Grecians, that were at Antioch. Many of the preachers were 
 natives of Judea and Jerusalem; but some of them were by birth of 
 Cyprus and Cyrene, as Barnabas himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>ch.</I> iv. 36</A>),
 
 and Simon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:21">Mark xv. 21</A>),

 but had their education in Jerusalem; and these, being themselves
 Grecian Jews, had a particular concern for those of their own 
 denomination and distinction, and applied themselves closely to them at 
 Antioch. Dr. Lightfoot says that they were there called 
 <I>Hellenists,</I> or <I>Grecians,</I> because they were Jews of the 
 corporation or enfranchisement of the city; for Antioch was a 
 Syrogrecian city. To them they preached the Lord Jesus. This was the 
 constant subject of their preaching; what else should the ministers of 
 Christ preach, but Christ--Christ, and him crucified--Christ, and him
 glorified?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They had wonderful success in their preaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 (1.) Their preaching was accompanied with a divine power: <I>The hand 
 of the Lord was with them,</I> which some understand of the power they 
 were endued with to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine; 
 in these the Lord <I>was working with them, for he confirmed the word 
 with signs following</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:20">Mark xvi. 20</A>);

 in these God <I>bore them witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4">Heb. ii. 4</A>.

 But I rather understand it of the power of divine grace working on the
 hearts of the hearers, and opening them, as Lydia's heart was opened, 
 because many saw the miracles who were not converted; but when by the 
 Spirit the understanding was enlightened, and the will bowed to the 
 gospel of Christ, that was a day of power, in which volunteers were 
 enlisted under the banner of the Lord Jesus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 <I>The hand of the Lord was with them,</I> to bring that home to the
 hearts and consciences of men which they could but speak to the outward 
 ear. Then the word of the Lord gains its end, when the hand of the Lord 
 goes along with it, to write it in their heart. Then people are brought 
 to believe the report of the gospel, when with it the <I>arm of the 
 Lord is revealed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>),

 when God <I>teaches with a strong hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:11">Isa. viii. 11</A>.

 These were not apostles, but ordinary ministers, yet they had the hand
 of the Lord with them, and did wonders.

 (2.) Abundance of good was done: <I>A great number believed, and turned 
 unto the Lord</I>--many more than could have been expected, considering
 the outward disadvantages they laboured under: some of all sorts of 
 people were wrought upon, and brought into obedience to Christ. 
 Observe, What the change was. 

 [1.] They believed; they were convinced of the truth of the gospel, and 
 subscribed to the record God had given in it concerning his Son. 

 [2.] The effect and evidence of this was that they <I>turned unto the 
 Lord.</I> They could not be said to turn from the service of idols, for 
 they were Jews, worshippers of the true God only; but they turned from 
 a confidence in the righteousness of the law, to rely only upon the 
 righteousness of Christ, the righteousness which is by faith; they 
 turned from a loose, careless, carnal way of living, to live a holy, 
 heavenly, spiritual, and divine life; they turned from worshipping God 
 in show and ceremony, to worship him <I>in spirit and in truth.</I> 
 They turned to the Lord Jesus, and he became all in all with them. This 
 was the work of conversion wrought upon them, and it must be wrought 
 upon every one of us. It was the fruit of their faith. All that
 sincerely believe will turn to the Lord; for, whatever we profess or 
 pretend, we do not really believe the gospel if we do not cordially 
 embrace Christ offered to us in the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good work thus begun at Antioch was carried on to great 
 perfection; and the church, thus founded, grew to be a flourishing one, 
 by the ministry of Barnabas and Saul, who built upon the foundation 
 which the other preachers had laid, and <I>entered into their 
 labours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:37,38">John iv. 37, 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The church at Jerusalem sent Barnabas thither, to nurse this 
 new-born church, and to strengthen the hands both of preachers and 
 people, and put a reputation upon the cause of Christ there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They heard the good news, that the gospel was received at Antioch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The apostles there were inquisitive how the work went on in the 
 countries about; and, it is likely, kept up a correspondence with all 
 parts where preachers were, so that <I>tidings of these things,</I> of 
 the great numbers that were converted at Antioch, soon <I>came to the 
 ears of the church that was in Jerusalem.</I> Those that are in the 
 most eminent stations in the church ought to concern themselves for 
 those in a lower sphere.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They despatched Barnabas to them with all speed; they desired him 
 to go, and assist and encourage these hopeful beginnings. They <I>sent 
 him forth</I> as an envoy from them, and a representative of their 
 whole body, to congratulate them upon the success of the gospel among 
 them, as matter of rejoicing both to preachers and hearers, and with 
 both they rejoiced. He must go <I>as far as Antioch.</I> It was a great 
 way, but, far as it was, he was willing to undertake the journey for a 
 public service. It is probable that Barnabas had a particular genius
 for work of this kind, was active and conversable, loved to be in 
 motion, and delighted in doing good abroad as much as others in doing 
 good at home, was as much of Zebulun's spirit, who rejoiced <I>in his 
 going out,</I> as others are of Issachar's, who rejoiced <I>in his 
 tent;</I> and, his talent lying this way, he was fittest to be employed 
 in this work. God gives various gifts for various services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Barnabas was wonderfully pleased to find that the gospel got 
 ground, and that some of his countrymen, men of Cyprus (of which 
 country he was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>ch.</I> iv. 36</A>)

 were instrumental in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>When he came, and had seen the grace of God,</I> the tokens of God's 
 good-will to the people of Antioch and the evidences of his good work 
 among them, <I>he was glad.</I> He took time to make his observations, 
 and not only in their public worship, but in their common conversations 
 and in their families, he saw the grace of God among them. Where the 
 grace of God is it will be seen, as the <I>tree is known by its 
 fruits;</I> and, where it is seen, it ought to be owned. What we see 
 which is good in any we must call God's grace in them, and give that 
 grace the glory of it; and we ought ourselves to take the comfort of 
 it, and make it the matter of our rejoicing. We must be glad to see the 
 grace of God in others, and the more when we see it where we did not 
 expect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He did what he could to fix them, to confirm those in the faith 
 who were converted to the faith. He <I>exhorted them</I>--<B>
 <I>parekalei.</I></B> It is the same word with that by which the name 
 of Barnabas is interpreted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>ch.</I> iv. 36</A>),

 <B><I>hyios parakleseos</I></B>--<I>a son of exhortation;</I> his
 talent lay that way, and he traded with it; let him that <I>exhorteth 
 attend to exhortation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:8">Rom. xii. 8</A>.

 Or, being <I>a son of consolation</I> (for so we render the word), he
 <I>comforted or encouraged them with purpose of heart to cleave to the 
 Lord.</I> The more he rejoiced in the beginning of the good work among 
 them, the more earnest he was with them to proceed according to these 
 good beginnings. Those we have comfort in we should exhort. Barnabas
 was glad for what he saw of the grace of God among them, and therefore 
 was the more earnest with them to persevere.

 [1.] To <I>cleave to the Lord.</I> Note, Those that have <I>turned to 
 the Lord</I> are concerned to <I>cleave unto the Lord,</I> not to fall 
 off from following him, not to flag and tire in following him. To 
 cleave to the Lord Jesus is to live a life of dependence upon him and 
 devotedness to him: not only to hold him fast, but to hold fast by him, 
 to <I>be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.</I> 

 [2.] To cleave to him with purpose of heart, with an intelligent, firm, 
 and deliberate resolution, founded upon good grounds, and fixed upon 
 that foundation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:1">Ps. cviii. 1</A>.

 It is to bind our souls with a bond to be the Lord's, and to say as
 Ruth, <I>Entreat me not to leave</I> him, or to return from following 
 after him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Herein he gave a proof of his good character 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith,</I> and 
 approved himself so upon this occasion. 

 [1.] He showed himself to be a man of a very sweet, affable, courteous 
 disposition, that had himself the art of obliging, and could teach 
 others. He was not only a righteous man, but a <I>good man,</I> a 
 good-tempered man. Ministers that are so recommend themselves and their 
 doctrine very much to the good opinion of those that are without. He 
 was a good man, that is, a charitable man; so he had approved himself, 
 when he sold an estate, and gave the money to the poor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:37"><I>ch.</I> iv. 37</A>.

 [2.] By this it appeared that he was richly endued with the gifts and
 graces of the Spirit. The goodness of his natural disposition would not 
 have qualified him for this service if he had not been <I>full of the 
 Holy Ghost, and so full of power by the Spirit of the Lord.</I> 

 [3.] He was full of faith, full of the Christian faith himself, and 
 therefore desirous to propagate it among others; full of the grace of 
 faith, and full of the fruits of that faith that works by love. He was 
 <I>sound in the faith,</I> and therefore pressed them to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) He was instrumental to do good, by bringing in those that were 
 without, as well as by building up those that were within: <I>Much 
 people were added to the Lord,</I> and thereby added to the 
 <I>church;</I> many were turned to the Lord before, yet more are to be 
 turned; it is <I>done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is 
 room.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Barnabas went to fetch Saul, to join with him in the work of the 
 gospel at Antioch. The last news we heard of him was that, when his 
 life was sought at Jerusalem, he was sent away to Tarsus, the city 
 where he was born, and, it should seem, he continued there ever since, 
 doing good, no doubt. But now Barnabas takes a journey to Tarsus on 
 purpose to see what had become of him, to tell him what a door of 
 opportunity was opened at Antioch, and to desire him to come and spend 
 some time with him there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 And here also it appears that Barnabas was a good sort of a man in two 
 things--

 (1.) That he would take so much pains to bring an active useful man out 
 of obscurity. It was he that introduced Saul to the disciples at 
 Jerusalem, when they were shy of him; and it was he that brought him 
 out of the corner into which he was driven, into a more public station. 
 It is a very good work to fetch a candle from under a bushel, and to 
 set it in a candlestick. 

 (2.) That he would bring in Saul at Antioch, who, being a <I>chief 
 speaker</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:12"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 12</A>),

 and probably a more popular preacher, would be likely to eclipse him
 there, by outshining him; but Barnabas is very willing to be eclipsed 
 when it is for the public service. If God by his grace inclines us to 
 do what good we can, according to the ability we have, we ought to 
 rejoice if others that have also larger capacities have larger 
 opportunities, and do more good than we can do. Barnabas brought Saul 
 to Antioch, though it might be the lessening of himself, to teach us to 
 seek the things of Christ more than our own things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are here further told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What service was now done to the church at Antioch. Paul and 
 Barnabas continued there a whole year, presiding in their religious 
 assemblies, and preaching the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] The church frequently assembled. The religious assemblies of 
 Christians are appointed by Christ for his honour, and the comfort and 
 benefit of his disciples. God's people of old frequently came together, 
 <I>at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation;</I> places of 
 meeting are now multiplied, but they must come together, though it be 
 with difficulty and peril. 

 [2.] Ministers were the masters of those assemblies, and held those 
 courts in Christ's name to which all that hold by, from, and under him, 
 owe suit and service. 

 [3.] <I>Teaching the people</I> is one part of the work of ministers, 
 when they preside in religious assemblies. They are not only to be the 
 people's mouth to God in prayer and praise, but God's mouth to the 
 people in opening the scriptures, and teaching out of them the good 
 knowledge of the Lord.

 [4.] It is a great encouragement to ministers when they have 
 opportunity of teaching much people, of casting the net of the gospel 
 where there is a large shoal of fish, in hopes that the more may be 
 enclosed. 

 [5.] Preaching is not only for the conviction and conversion of those 
 that are without, but for the instruction and edification of those that 
 are within. A constituted church must have its teachers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What honour was now put upon the church <I>at Antioch: There the 
 disciples were first called Christians;</I> it is probable they called 
 themselves so, incorporated themselves by that title, whether by some 
 solemn act of the church or ministers, or whether this name insensibly 
 obtained there by its being frequently used in their praying and 
 preaching, we are not told; but it should seem that two such great men 
 as Paul and Barnabas continuing there so long, being exceedingly 
 followed, and meeting with no opposition, Christian assemblies made a 
 greater figure there than any where, and became more considerable, 
 which was the reason of their being called <I>Christians</I> first 
 there, which, if there were to be a mother-church to rule over all 
 other churches, would give Antioch a better title to the honour than 
 Rome can pretend to. Hitherto those who gave up their names to Christ 
 were called <I>disciples, learners, scholars,</I> trained up under him, 
 in order to their being employed by him; but henceforward they were 
 called <I>Christians.</I> 

 [1.] Thus the reproachful names which their enemies had hitherto 
 branded them with would, perhaps, be superseded and disused. They 
 called them <I>Nazarenes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:5"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 5</A>),

 <I>the men of that way, that by-way,</I> which had no name; and thus
 they prejudiced people against them. To remove the prejudice, they gave 
 themselves a name which their enemies could not but say was proper.
 
 [2.] Thus those who before their conversion had been distinguished by 
 the names of Jews and Gentiles might after their conversion be called 
 by one and the same name, which would help them to forget their former 
 dividing names, and prevent their bringing their former marks of 
 distinction, and with them the seeds of contention, into the church.
 Let not one say, "I was a <I>Jew;</I>" nor the other, "I was a 
 <I>Gentile;</I>" when both the one and the other must now say, "I am a 
 <I>Christian.</I>" 

 [3.] Thus they studied to do honour to their Master, and showed that 
 they were not ashamed to own their relation to him, but gloried in it; 
 as the scholars of Plato called themselves <I>Platonists,</I> and so 
 the scholars of other great men. They took their denomination not from 
 the name of his person, <I>Jesus,</I> but of his office, 
 <I>Christ-anointed,</I> so putting their creed into their names, 
 <I>that Jesus is the Christ;</I> and they were willing all the world 
 should know that this is the truth they will live and die by. Their
 enemies will turn this name to their reproach, and impute it to them as 
 their crime, but they will glory in it: <I>If this be to be vile, I 
 will be yet more vile.</I> 

 [4.] Thus they now owned their dependence upon Christ, and their 
 receivings from him; not only that they believed in him who is <I>the 
 anointed,</I> but that through him they themselves had <I>the 
 anointing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:20,27">1 John ii. 20, 27</A>.

 And God is said to have <I>anointed us in Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:21">2 Cor. i. 21</A>.

 [5.] Thus they laid upon themselves, and all that should ever profess 
 that name, a strong and lasting obligation to submit to the laws of 
 Christ, to follow the example of Christ, and to devote themselves 
 entirely to the honour of Christ--<I>to be to him for a name and a
 praise.</I> Are we Christians? Then we ought to think, and speak, and
 act, in every thing as becomes Christians, and to do nothing to the 
 reproach of that worthy name by which we are called; that that may not 
 be said to us which Alexander said to a soldier of his own name that 
 was noted for a coward, <I>Aut nomen, aut mores muta--Either change thy
 name or mend thy manners.</I> And as we must look upon ourselves as 
 Christians, and carry ourselves accordingly, so we must look upon 
 others as Christians, and carry ourselves towards them accordingly. A 
 Christian, though not in every thing of our mind, should be loved and 
 respected for his sake whose name he bears, because he belongs to 
 Christ. 

 [6.] Thus <I>the scripture was fulfilled,</I> for so it was written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:2">Isa. lxii. 2</A>)
 
 concerning the gospel-church, <I>Thou shalt be called by a new name, 
 which the mouth of the Lord shall name.</I> And it is said to the 
 corrupt and degenerate church of the Jews, <I>The Lord God shall slay 
 thee, and call his servants by another name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:15">Isa. lxv. 15</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
 &nbsp; 28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified
 by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all
 the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius C&aelig;sar.
 &nbsp; 29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
 determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in
 Jud&aelig;a:
 &nbsp; 30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands
 of Barnabas and Saul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When our Lord Jesus <I>ascended on high he gave gifts unto men,</I> not 
 only <I>apostles and evangelists, but prophets,</I> who were enabled by 
 the Spirit to foresee and foretel things to come, which not only served 
 for a confirmation of the truth of Christianity (for all that these 
 prophets foretold came to pass, which proved that <I>they were sent of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:22,Jer+28:9">Deut. xviii. 22; Jer. xxviii. 9</A>),

 but was also of great use to the church, and served very much for its
 guidance. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A visit which some of these prophets made to Antioch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>In these days,</I> during that year that Barnabas and Saul lived at 
 Antioch, there <I>came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch:</I> we are 
 not told how many, nor is it certain whether these were any of those 
 prophets that we afterwards find <I>in the church at Antioch,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 1</A>.

 1. They came from Jerusalem, probably because they were not now so much
 regarded there as they had been; they saw their work in a manner done 
 there, and therefore thought it time to be gone. Jerusalem had been
 infamous for <I>killing the prophets</I> and abusing them, and 
 therefore is now justly deprived of these prophets. 

 2. They came to Antioch, because they heard of the flourishing state of
 that church, and there they hoped they might be of some service. Thus

 Barnabas came to exhort them, and they, having received the exhortation 
 well, now have prophets sent them <I>to show them things to come,</I> 
 as Christ had promised,

 II. A particular prediction of a famine approaching, delivered by one 
 of these prophets, his name <I>Agabus;</I> we read of him again 
 prophesying Paul's imprisonment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:10,11"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 10, 11</A>.

 Here he stood up, probably in one of their public assemblies, and
 prophesied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Whence he had his prophecy. What he said was not of himself, nor a 
 fancy of his own, nor an astronomical prediction, nor a conjecture upon 
 the present workings of second causes, but <I>he signified it by the 
 Spirit, the Spirit of prophecy, that there should be</I> a famine; as 
 Joseph, by the Spirit enabling him, understood Pharaoh's dreams, 
 foretold the famine in Egypt, and Elijah the famine in Israel in Ahab's 
 time. Thus God revealed his secrets to his servants the prophets.

 2. What the prophecy was: <I>There should be great dearth throughout
 all the world,</I> by unseasonable weather, that corn should be scarce 
 and dear, so that many of the poor should perish for want of bread. 
 This should be not in one particular country, but <I>through all the 
 world,</I> that is, all the Roman empire, which they in their pride, 
 like Alexander before them, called <I>the world.</I> Christ had 
 foretold in general <I>that there should be famines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:7,Mk+13:8,Lu+21:11">Matt. xxiv. 7; Mark xiii. 8; Luke xxi. 11</A>);

 but Agabus foretels one very remarkable famine now at hand. 

 3. The accomplishment of it: <I>It came to pass in the days of Claudius
 C&aelig;sar;</I> it began in the second year of his reign, and 
 continued to the fourth, if not longer. Several of the Roman historians 
 make mention of it, as does also Josephus. God sent them the bread of 
 life, and they rejected it, loathed the plenty of that manna; and 
 therefore God justly broke the staff of bread, and punished them with 
 famine; and herein he was righteous. They were barren, and did not 
 bring forth to God, and therefore God made the earth barren to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good use they made of this prediction. When they were told of 
 a famine at hand, they did not do as the Egyptians, hoard up corn for 
 themselves; but, as became Christians, laid by for charity to relieve 
 others, which is the best preparative for our own sufferings and want. 
 It is promised to those that <I>consider the poor that God will 
 preserve them, and keep them alive, and they shall be blessed upon the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1,2">Ps. xli. 1, 2</A>.

 And <I>those who show mercy, and give to the poor, shall not be ashamed
 in the evil time, but in the days of famine they shall be 
 satisfied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:19,21">Ps. xxxvii. 19, 21</A>.

 The best provision we can lay up against a dear time is to lay up an
 interest in these promises, by doing good, and communicating, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:33">Luke xii. 33</A>.

 Many give it as a reason why they should be sparing, but the scripture
 gives it as a reason why we should be liberal, <I>to seven, and also to 
 eight,</I> because <I>we know not what evil shall be upon the 
 earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:2">Eccl. xi. 2</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What they determined--that <I>every man, according to his
 ability,</I> should <I>send relief to the brethren that dwelt in 
 Judea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 (1.) The persons that were recommended to them as objects for charity 
 were <I>the brethren that dwelt in Judea.</I> Though we must, as we 
 have opportunity, <I>do good to all men,</I> yet we must have a special 
 regard <I>to the household of faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:10">Gal. vi. 10</A>.

 No poor must be neglected, but God's poor most particularly regarded.
 The care which every particular church ought to take of their own poor 
 we were taught by the early instance of that in the church at 
 Jerusalem, where the ministration was so constant <I>that none 
 lacked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:34"><I>ch.</I> iv. 34</A>.

 But the communion of saints in that instance is here extended further,
 and provision is made by the church at Antioch for the relief of the 
 poor in Judea, whom they call their brethren. It seems it was the 
 custom of the Jews of the dispersion to send money to those Jews who 
 dwelt in Judea, for the relief of the poor that were among them, and to 
 make collections for that purpose (Tully speaks of such a thing in his 
 time, <I>Orat. pro Flacco</I>), which supposes there were many poor in 
 Judea, more than in other countries, so that the rich among them were 
 not able to bear the charge of keeping them from starving; either 
 because their land had become <I>barren,</I> though it had been a 
 fruitful land, <I>for the iniquity of those that dwelt therein,</I> or 
 because they had no traffic with other nations. Now we may suppose
 that the greatest part of those who turned Christians in that country 
 were the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>,

 <I>The poor are evangelized</I>), and also that when the poor turned 
 Christians they were put out of the poor's book, and cut off from their 
 shares in the public charity; and it were easy to foresee that if there 
 came a famine it would go very hard with them; and, if any of them 
 should perish for want, it would be a great reproach to the Christian 
 profession; and therefore this early care was taken, upon notice of 
 this famine coming, to send them a stock beforehand, lest, if it should 
 be deferred till the famine came, it should be too late. 

 (2.) The agreement there was among the disciples about it, that 
 <I>every man</I> should contribute, <I>according to his ability,</I> to 
 this good work. The Jews abroad, in other countries, grew rich by
 trade, and many of the rich Jews became Christians, whose abundance 
 ought to be <I>a supply to the want of their poor brethren</I> that 
 were at a great distance; for the case of such ought to be considered, 
 and not theirs only that live among us. Charitable people are traders
 with what God has given them, and the merchants find their account in 
 sending effects to countries that lie very remote; and so should we in 
 giving alms to those afar off that need them, which therefore we should 
 be forward to do when we are called to it. <I>Every man determined to 
 send</I> something, more or less, <I>according to his ability,</I> what 
 he could spare from the support of himself and his family, and 
 <I>according as God had prospered him.</I> What may be said to be 
 <I>according to our ability</I> we must judge for ourselves, but must 
 be careful <I>that we judge righteous judgment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they did--they did as they determined
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>).

 <I>Which also they did.</I> They not only talked of it, but they did 
 it. Many a good motion of that kind is made and commended, but is not 
 prosecuted, and so comes to nothing. But this was pursued, the 
 collection was made, and was so considerable that they thought it worth 
 while <I>to send Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem,</I> to carry it <I>to 
 the elders</I> there, though they would want their labours in the mean 
 time at Antioch. They sent it, 

 (1.) <I>To the elders,</I> the presbyters, the ministers or pastors, 
 <I>of the churches in Judea,</I> to be by them distributed according to 
 the necessity of the receivers, as it had been contributed according to 
 the ability of the givers. 

 (2.) It was sent <I>by Barnabas and Saul,</I> who perhaps wanted an 
 occasion to go to Jerusalem, and therefore were willing to take this. 
 Josephus tells us that at this time king Irates sent his charity to the 
 chief men of Jerusalem, for the poor of that country; and Helena, queen 
 of the Adiabeni, being now at Jerusalem, and hearing of many that died 
 of famine there, and in the country about, sent for provisions from 
 Cyprus and Alexandria, and distributed them among the people; so says 
 Dr. Lightfoot, who also computes, by the date of Paul's rapture,
 "fourteen years before he wrote the second Epistle to the Corinthians" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:1,2">2 Cor. xii. 1, 2</A>),

 that it was in this journey of his <I>to Jerusalem, with these alms and 
 offerings,</I> that he had his <I>trance</I> in the temple (which he 
 speaks of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:17"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 17</A>),

 and in that <I>trance was rapt up into the third heaven;</I> and then
 it was that Christ told him he would send him thence <I>unto the 
 Gentiles,</I> which accordingly he did as soon as ever he came back to 
 Antioch. It is no disparagement, in an extraordinary case, for 
 ministers of the gospel to be messengers of the church's charity, 
 though to undertake the constant care of that matter would ordinarily 
 be too great a diversion from more needful work <I>to those who have 
 given themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word.</I></P>
