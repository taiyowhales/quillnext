 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
 &nbsp; 2  That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
 in charity, in patience.
 &nbsp; 3  The aged women likewise, that <I>they be</I> in behaviour as
 becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine,
 teachers of good things;
 &nbsp; 4  That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love
 their husbands, to love their children,
 &nbsp; 5  <I>To be</I> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
 their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
 &nbsp; 6  Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
 &nbsp; 7  In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in
 doctrine <I>showing</I> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
 &nbsp; 8  Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of
 the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
 you.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Exhort</I> servants to be obedient unto their own masters,
 <I>and</I> to please <I>them</I> well in all <I>things;</I> not answering again;

 adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the third thing in the matter of the epistle. In the chapter 
 foregoing, the apostle had directed Titus about matters of government, 
 and to set in order the things that were wanting in the churches. Now 
 here he exhorts him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Generally, to a faithful discharge of his own office. His ordaining 
 others to preach would not excuse himself from preaching, nor might he 
 take care of ministers and elders only, but he must instruct private 
 Christians also in their duty. The adversative particle (<I>but</I>) 
 here points back to the corrupt teachers, who vented <I>fables,</I> 
 things vain and unprofitable: in opposition to them, says he, "<I>But 
 speak thou the things that become sound doctrine,</I> what is agreeable 
 to the word, which is pure and uncorrupt, healthful and nourishing to 
 eternal life." Observe, 

 (1.) The true doctrines of the gospel are <I>sound doctrines,</I> 
 formally and effectively; they are in themselves good and holy, and 
 make the believers so; they make them fit for, and vigorous in, the 
 service of God. 

 (2.) Ministers must be careful to teach only such truths. If the common 
 talk of Christians must <I>be uncorrupt, to the use of edifying, such 
 as may minister grace to the hearers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:29">Eph. iv. 29</A>),

 much more must ministers' preaching be such. Thus the apostle exhorts 
 Titus generally: and then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Specially and particularly, he instructs him to apply this sound 
 doctrine to several sorts of persons, from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:2-10"><I>v.</I> 2-10</A>.

 Ministers must not stay in generals, but must divide to every one his
 portion, what belongs to his age, or place, or condition of life; they 
 must be particular as well as practical in their preaching; they must 
 teach men their duty, and must teach all and each his duty. Here is an 
 excellent Christian directory, accommodated to the old and to the 
 young; to men and women; to the preacher himself and to servants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To the aged men. By aged men some understand elders by office, 
 including deacons, &c. But it is rather to be taken of the aged in 
 point of years. Old disciples of Christ must conduct themselves in 
 every thing agreeably to the Christian doctrine. <I>That the aged men
 be sober,</I> not thinking that the decays of nature, which they feel 
 in old age, will justify them in any inordinacy or intemperance, 
 whereby they conceit to repair them; they must keep measure in things, 
 both for health and for fitness, for counsel and example to the 
 younger. <I>Grave:</I> levity is unbecoming in any, but especially in 
 the aged; they should be composed and stayed, grave in habit, speech, 
 and behaviour; gaudiness in dress, levity and vanity in the behaviour, 
 how unbeseeming in their years! <I>Temperate,</I> moderate and prudent, 
 one who governs well his passions and affections, so as not to be 
 hurried away by them to any thing that is evil or indecent. <I>Sound in 
 the faith,</I> sincere and stedfast, constantly adhering to the truth 
 of the gospel, not fond of novelties, nor ready to run into corrupt 
 opinions or parties, nor to be taken with Jewish fables or traditions, 
 or the dotages of their rabbin. Those who are full of years should be 
 full of grace and goodness, the inner man renewing more and more as the 
 outer decays. <I>In charity,</I> or love; this is fitly joined with 
 <I>faith,</I> which works by, and must be seen in, love, love to God 
 and men, and soundness therein. It must be sincere love, without 
 dissimulation: love of God for himself, and of men for God's sake. The 
 duties of the second table must be done in virtue of those of the 
 first; love to men as men, and to the saints as the excellent of the 
 earth, in whom must be special delight; and love at all times, in 
 adversity as well as prosperity. Thus must there be soundness in 
 charity or love. And <I>in patience.</I> Aged persons are apt to be 
 peevish, fretful, and passionate; and therefore need to be on their 
 guard against such infirmities and temptations. Faith, love, and
 patience, are three main Christian graces, and soundness in these is 
 much of gospel perfection. There is <I>enduring patience</I> and 
 <I>waiting patience,</I> both of which must be looked after; to <I>bear 
 evils</I> becomingly, and contentedly to <I>want the good</I> till we 
 are fit for it and it for us, being <I>followers of those who through 
 faith and patience inherit the promises.</I> Thus as to the aged 
 men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To the aged women. These also must be instructed and warned. Some by 
 these aged women understand the deaconesses, who were mostly employed 
 in looking after the poor and attending the sick; but it is rather to 
 be taken (as we render it) of all aged women professing religion. They 
 must <I>be in behaviour as becometh holiness:</I> both men and women 
 must accommodate their behaviour to their profession. Those virtues 
 before mentioned (<I>sobriety, gravity, temperance, soundness in the 
 faith, charity, and patience</I>), recommended to aged men, are not 
 proper to them only, but applicable to both sexes, and to be looked to 
 by aged women as well as men. Women are to hear and learn their duty 
 from the word, as well as the men: there is not one way of salvation 
 for one sex or sort, and another for another; but both must learn and 
 practise the same things, both as aged and as Christians; the virtues 
 and duties are common. <I>That the aged women likewise</I> (as well as 
 the men) <I>be in behaviour as becometh holiness;</I> or as beseems and 
 is proper for holy persons, such as they profess to be and should be, 
 keeping a pious decency and decorum in clothing and gesture, in looks 
 and speech, and all their deportment, and this from an inward principle 
 and habit of holiness, influencing and ordering the outward conduct at 
 all times. Observe, Though express scripture do not occur, or be not 
 brought, for every word, or look, or fashion in particular, yet general 
 rules there are according to which all must be ordered; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>,

 <I>Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</I> And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>,

 <I>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever 
 things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are 
 lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, 
 and if there be any praise, think on these things.</I> And here, 
 whatsoever things are beseeming or unbeseeming holiness form a measure 
 and rule of conduct to be looked to. <I>Not false accusers</I>--<B><I>me
 diabolous,</I></B> no calumniators or sowers of discord, slandering and 
 backbiting their neighbours, a great and too common fault; not only 
 loving to speak, but to speak ill, of people, and to separate very 
 friends. A slanderer is one <I>whose tongue is set on fire of hell;</I> 
 so much, and so directly, do these do the devil's work, that for it the 
 devil's name is given to such. This is a sin contrary to the great 
 duties of love, justice, and equity between one another; it springs 
 often from malice and hatred, or envy, and such like evil causes, to be 
 shunned as well as the effect. <I>Not given to much wine;</I> the word 
 denotes such addictedness thereto as to be under the power and mastery 
 of it. This is unseemly and evil in any, but especially in this sex and 
 age, and was too much to be found among the Greeks of that time and 
 place. How immodest and shameful, corrupting and destroying purity both 
 of body and mind! Of what evil example and tendency, unfitting for the 
 thing, which is a positive duty of aged matrons, namely, to be 
 <I>teachers of good things!</I> Not public preachers, that is forbidden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:34">1 Cor. xiv. 34</A>,

 <I>I permit not a woman to speak in the church</I>), but otherwise
 teach they may and should, that is, by example and good life. Hence
 observe, Those whose actions and behaviour become holiness are thereby 
 teachers of good things; and, besides this, they may and should also 
 teach by doctrinal instruction at home, and in a private way. <I>The
 words of king Lemuel, the prophecy his mother taught him.</I> Such a 
 woman is praised, <I>She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her 
 tongue is the law of kindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:1,26">Prov. xxxi. 1, 26</A>.

 <I>Teachers of good things</I> are opposed to teachers of things 
 corrupt, or to what is trifling and vain, of no good use or tendency, 
 old wives' fables or superstitious sayings and observances; in 
 opposition to these, their business is, and they may be called on to 
 it, to be teachers of good things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There are lessons for young women also, whom the aged women must 
 teach, instructing and advising them in the duties of religion 
 according to their years. For teaching such things aged women have 
 often better access than the men, even than ministers have, which 
 therefore they must improve in instructing the young women, especially 
 the young wives; for he speaks of their duty to their husbands and 
 children. These young women the more aged must teach, 

 (1.) To bear a good personal character: <I>To be sober and 
 discreet,</I> contrary to the vanity and rashness which younger years 
 are subject to: discreet in their judgments and sober in their 
 affections and behaviour. <I>Discreet</I> and <I>chaste</I> stand well
 together; many expose themselves to fatal temptations by that which at 
 first might be but indiscretion. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:11">Prov. ii. 11</A>,

 <I>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee from 
 the evil way. Chaste,</I> and <I>keepers at home,</I> are well joined
 too. Dinah, when she went to see the daughters of the land, lost her 
 chastity. Those whose home is their prison, it is to be feared, feel
 that their chastity is their fetters. Not but there are occasions, and 
 will be, of going abroad; but a gadding temper for merriment and 
 company sake, to the neglect of domestic affairs, or from uneasiness at 
 being in her place, is the opposite evil intended, which is commonly 
 accompanied with, or draws after it, other evils. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13,14">1 Tim. v. 13, 14</A>,

 <I>They learn to be idle, wandering from house to house; and not only 
 idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they 
 ought not.</I> Their business is <I>to guide the house,</I> and they 
 should give no occasion to the enemy to speak reproachfully. 
 <I>Good,</I> generally, in opposition to all vice; and specially, in 
 her place, kind, helpful, and charitable; as Dorcas, <I>full of good 
 works and almsdeeds.</I> It may also have, as some think, a more 
 particular sense; one of a meek and yet cheerful spirit and temper, not 
 sullen nor bitter; not taunting not fretting and galling any; not of a 
 troublesome or jarring disposition, uneasy in herself and to those 
 about her; but of a good nature and pleasing conversation, and likewise 
 helpful by her advice and pains: thus <I>building her house, and doing 
 her husband good, and not evil, all her days.</I> Thus in their 
 personal character <I>sober, discreet, chaste, keepers at home,</I> and 
 <I>good:</I> and,

 (2.) In their relative capacities: <I>To love their husbands, and to be 
 obedient to them;</I> and where there is true love this will be no 
 difficult command. God, in nature, and by his will, hath made this 
 subordination: <I>I suffer not a woman to usurp authority over the 
 man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:12">1 Tim. ii. 12</A>);

 and the reason is added: <I>For Adam was first formed, then Eve. Adam
 was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, was in the 
 transgression,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 She fell first, and was the means of seducing the husband. She was 
 given to be a helper, but proved a most grievous hinderer, even the 
 instrument of his fall and ruin, on which the bond of subjection was 
 confirmed, and tied faster on her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>):

 <I>Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee,</I> 
 with less easiness, it may be, than before. It is therefore doubly 
 enjoined: <I>first in innocency,</I> when was settled a subordination 
 of nature, Adam being first formed and then Eve, and the woman being 
 taken out of the man; <I>and then upon the fall,</I> the woman being 
 first in the transgression, and seducing the man; here now began to be 
 a subjection not so easy and comfortable, being a part of the penalty 
 in her case; yet through Christ is this nevertheless a sanctified 
 state. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:22,23">Eph. v. 22, 23</A>,

 <I>Wives submit yourselves unto you own husbands, as unto the Lord,</I>
 as owning Christ's authority in them, whose image they bear; <I>for the 
 husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the 
 church: and he is the saviour of the body.</I> God would have a 
 resemblance of Christ's authority over the church held forth in the 
 husband's over the wife. Christ is the head of the church, to protect 
 and save it, to supply it with all good, and secure or deliver it from 
 evil; and so the husband over the wife, to keep her from injuries, and 
 to provide comfortably for her, according to his ability. Therefore,
 as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the <I>wives be unto their 
 own husbands, as is fit in the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:18">Col. iii. 18</A>),

 as comports with the law of Christ, and is for his and the Father's 
 glory. It is not then an absolute, or unlimited, nor a slavish 
 subjection that is required; but a loving subordination, to prevent 
 disorder or confusion, and to further all the ends of the relation.
 Thus, in reference to the husbands, wives must be instructed in their 
 duties of love and subjection to them. <I>And to love their
 children,</I> not with a natural affection only, but a spiritual, a 
 love springing from a holy sanctified heart and regulated by the word; 
 not a fond foolish love, indulging them in evil, neglecting due reproof 
 and correction where necessary, but a regular Christian love, showing 
 itself in their pious education, forming their life and manners aright, 
 taking care of their souls as well as of their bodies, of their 
 spiritual welfare as well as of their temporal, of the former chiefly 
 and in the first place. The reason is added: <I>That the word of God 
 may not be blasphemed.</I> Failures in such relative duties would be 
 greatly to the reproach of Christianity. "What are these the better for 
 this their new religion?" would the infidels be ready to say. The word 
 of God and the gospel of Christ are pure, excellent, and glorious, in 
 themselves; and their excellency should be expressed and shown in the 
 lives and conduct of their professors, especially in relative duties; 
 failures here being disgrace. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:24">Rom. ii. 24</A>,

 <I>The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you.</I>
 "Judge what a God he is," would they be ready to say, "by these his 
 servants; and what his word, and doctrine, and religion, are by these 
 his followers." Thus would Christ <I>be wounded in the house of his 
 friends.</I> Thus of the duties of the younger women.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here is the duty of young men. They are apt to be eager and hot, 
 thoughtless and precipitant; therefore they must be earnestly called 
 upon and exhorted to be considerate, not rash; advisable and 
 submissive, not wilful and head-strong; humble and mild, not haughty 
 and proud; for there are more young people ruined by pride than by any 
 other sin. The young should be grave and solid in their deportment and 
 manners, joining the seriousness of age with the liveliness and vigour 
 of youth. This will make even those younger years to pass to good 
 purpose, and yield matter of comfortable reflection when the evil days 
 come; it will be preventive of much sin and sorrow, and lay the 
 foundation for doing and enjoying much good. Such shall not <I>mourn at 
 the last,</I> but have peace and comfort in death, and after it a 
 glorious crown of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. With these instructions to Titus, respecting what he should teach 
 others--the aged men and women, and the younger of both sexes (Titus
 himself probably at this time being a young man also), the apostle 
 inserts some directions to himself. He could not expect so successfully 
 to teach others, if he did not conduct himself well both in his 
 conversation and preaching. 

 (1.) Here is direction for his conversation: <I>In all things showing 
 thyself a pattern of good works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Without this, he would pull down with one hand what he built with the 
 other. Observe, Preachers of good works must be patterns of them also; 
 good doctrine and good life must go together. <I>Thou that teachest 
 another, teachest thou not thyself?</I> A defect here is a great 
 blemish and a great hindrance. <I>In all things;</I> some read,
 <I>above all things,</I> or <I>above all men.</I> Instructing others in 
 the particulars of their duty is necessary, and, above all things, 
 example, especially that of the teacher himself, is needful; hereby 
 both light and influence are more likely to go together. "Let them see 
 a lively image of those virtues and graces in thy life which must be in 
 theirs. Example may both teach and impress the things taught; when they 
 see purity and gravity, sobriety and all good life, in thee, they may 
 be more easily won and brought thereto themselves; they may become 
 pious and holy, sober and righteous, as thou art." Ministers must be 
 examples to the flock, and the people followers of them, as they are of 
 Christ. And here is direction,

 (2.) For his teaching and doctrine, as well as for his life: <I>In 
 doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech, that 
 cannot be condemned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 They must make it appear that the design of their preaching is purely 
 to advance the honour of God, the interest of Christ and his kingdom, 
 and the welfare and happiness of souls; that this office was not 
 entered into nor used with secular views, not from ambition nor 
 covetousness, but a pure aim at the spiritual ends of its institution. 
 In their preaching, therefore, the display of wit or parts, or of human 
 learning or oratory, is not to be affected; but sound speech must be 
 used, which cannot be <I>condemned;</I> scripture-language, as far as 
 well may be, in expressing scripture-truths. This is sound speech, that 
 cannot be condemned. We have more than once these duties of a minister 
 set together.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:16">1 Tim. iv. 16</A>,

 <I>Take heed to thyself, and to thy doctrine:</I> and, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 of the same chapter, "<I>Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an
 example of believers in word</I>--in thy speech, as a Christian, being 
 grave, serious, and to the use of edifying; and in thy preaching, that 
 it be the pure word of God, or what is agreeable to it and founded on 
 it. Thus be an example <I>in word:</I> and <I>in conversation,</I> the
 life corresponding with the doctrine. In doing this <I>thou shalt both 
 save thyself and those that hear thee.</I>" In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10">2 Tim. iii. 10</A>,

 <I>Thou hast fully known my doctrine and manner of life</I> (says the
 same apostle), how agreeable these have been. And so must it be with 
 others; their teaching must be agreeable to the word, and their life 
 with their teaching. This is the true and good minister.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:9,10">1 Thess. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 <I>Labouring night and day, we preached to you the gospel of God; and
 you are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and 
 unblamably, we behaved ourselves among you.</I> This must be looked to, 
 as the next words show, which are, 

 (3.) The reason both for the strictness of the minister's life and the 
 gravity and soundness of his preaching: <I>That he who is of the 
 contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</I> 
 Adversaries would be seeking occasion to reflect, and would do so could 
 they find any thing amiss in doctrine or life; but, if both were right 
 and good, such ministers might set calumny itself at defiance; they 
 would have not evil thing to say justly, and so must be ashamed of 
 their opposition. Observe, Faithful ministers will have enemies 
 watching for their halting, such as will endeavour to find or pick 
 holes in their teaching or behaviour; the more need therefore for them 
 to look to themselves, that no just occasion be found against them.
 Opposition and calumny perhaps may not be escaped; men of corrupt minds 
 will resist the truth, and often reproach the preachers and professors 
 of it; but let them see that <I>with well-doing they put to silence the 
 ignorance of foolish men; that, when they speak evil of them as 
 evil-doers; those may be ashamed who falsely accuse their good 
 conversation in Christ.</I> This is the direction to Titus himself, and 
 so of the duties of free persons, male and female, old and young. Then 
 follow,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The directions respecting servants. Servants must not think that 
 their mean and low state puts them beneath God's notice or the 
 obligations of his laws--that, because they are servants of men, they
 are thereby discharged from serving God. No; servants must know and do 
 their duty to their earthly masters, but with an eye to their heavenly 
 one: and Titus must not only instruct and warn earthly masters of their 
 duties, but servants also of theirs, both in his public preaching and 
 private admonitions. Servants must attend the ordinances of God for
 their instruction and comfort, as well as the masters themselves. In 
 this direction to Titus there are the duties themselves, to which he 
 must exhort servants, and a weighty consideration wherewith he was to 
 enforce them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The duties themselves are these:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>To be obedient to their own masters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This is the prime duty, that by which they are characterized. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:16">Rom. vi. 16</A>,

 <I>His servants you are whom you obey.</I> There must be inward 
 subjection and dutiful respect and reverence in the mind and thoughts.
 "<I>If I be a master, where is my fear,</I> the dutiful affection you 
 show to me, together with the suitable outward significations and 
 expressions of it, in doing what I command you?" This must be in 
 servants; their will must be subject to their master's will, and their 
 time and labour at their master's disposal and command.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:18">1 Pet. ii. 18</A>,

 <I>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the
 good and gentle, but also to the froward.</I> The duty results from the 
 will of God, and relation in which, by his providence, he has put such; 
 not from the quality of the person. If he be a master, the duties of a 
 servant are to be paid to him as such. Servants therefore are to be 
 exhorted to be obedient to their own masters. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>To please them well in all things,</I> in all lawful things, 
 and such as belong to them to command, or at least as are not contrary 
 to the will of their great and superior Lord. We are not to understand 
 it either of obeying or pleasing them absolutely, without any 
 limitation; but always with a reserve of God's right, which may in no 
 case be entrenched upon. If his command and the earthly master's come 
 in competition, we are instructed to obey God rather than man; but then 
 servants must be upon good grounds in this, that there is an 
 inconsistency, else are they not held to be excused. And not only must 
 the will of God be the measure of the servant's obedience, but the 
 reason of it also. All must be done with a respect to him, in virtue of 
 his authority, and for pleasing him primarily and chiefly, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:22-24">Col. iii. 22-24</A>.

 In serving the earthly master according to Christ's will, he is served;
 and such shall be rewarded by him accordingly. But how are servants to 
 please their masters in all things, and yet not be men-pleasers? 
 <I>Answer,</I> Men-pleasers, in the faulty sense, are such as eye men 
 alone, or chiefly, in what they do, leaving God out, or subordinating 
 him to man; when the will of man shall carry it, though against God's 
 will, or man's pleasure is more regarded than his,--when this can
 content them, that the earthly master is pleased, though God be 
 displeased,--or when more care, or more satisfaction, is taken in man's
 being pleased than in God's, this is sinful man-pleasing, of which all 
 must take heed.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:5-7">Eph. vi. 5-7</A>,

 "<I>Servants, be obedient to those that are your masters according to 
 the flesh, with fear and trembling, with singleness of your heart, as 
 unto Christ. Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers</I> (who look at
 nothing but the favour or displeasure of men, or at nothing so much as 
 this), <I>but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the 
 heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to 
 men;</I>" not to them chiefly, but to Christ, who requires, and who 
 will reward, any good done, whether by bond or free. Observe therefore, 
 Christian liberty comports well with civil servitude and subjection. 
 Persons may serve men, and yet be the servants of Christ; these are not
 contrary, but subordinate, so far as serving men is according to 
 Christ's will and for his sake. Christ came not to destroy or prejudice 
 civil order and differences. "<I>Art thou called, being a servant? Care 
 not for it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:21">1 Cor. vii. 21</A>.

 Let not this trouble thee, as if it were a condition unworthy of a
 Christian, or wherein the person so called is less pleasing unto God; 
 <I>for he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's 
 freeman,</I> not free from that service, but free in it; free 
 spiritually, though not in a civil sense. <I>Likewise also he that is 
 called, being free, is Christ's servant;</I> he is bound to him, though 
 he be not under civil subjection to any; so that, <I>bond or free, all 
 are one in Christ.</I>" Servants therefore should not regret nor be 
 troubled at their condition, but be faithful and cheerful in the 
 station wherein God hath set them, striving to please their masters in 
 all things. Hard it may be under some churlish Nabals, but it must be 
 aimed at as much as possible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>Not answering again;</I> not contradicting them, nor disputing 
 it with them; not giving them any disrespectful or provoking language. 
 Job complained of his servants, that he <I>called them, and they gave 
 him no answer;</I> that was faulty another way: <I>Non respondere pro 
 convitio est--Such silence is contempt:</I> but here it is respect,
 rather to take a check or reproof with humble silence, not making any
 confident nor bold replies. When conscious of a fault, to palliate or
 stand in justification of it doubles it. Yet this not answering again
 excludes not turning away wrath with a soft answer, when season and
 circumstances admit. Good and wise masters will be ready to hear and do
 right; but answering unseasonably, or in an unseemly manner, or, where
 the case admits not excuse, to be pert or confident, shows a want of
 the humility and meekness which such relation requires.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] <I>Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity.</I> This is 
 another great essential of good servants, to be <I>honest,</I> never 
 converting that to their own use which is their master's, nor wasting 
 the goods they are entrusted with; that is, <I>purloining.</I> They 
 must be just and true, and do for their masters as they would or should 
 for themselves. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:24">Prov. xxviii. 24</A>,

 <I>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no 
 transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer;</I> he will be 
 ready to join with him. Thus having such light thoughts of taking 
 beyond what is right, though it be from a parent or master, is likely 
 to harden conscience to go further; it is both wicked in itself, and it 
 tends to more. Be it so that the master is hard and strait, scarcely 
 making sufficient provision for servants; yet they must not be their 
 own carvers, nor go about by theft to right themselves; they must bear 
 their lot, committing their cause to God for righting and providing for 
 them. I speak not of cases of extremity, for preserving life, the 
 necessaries for which the servant has a right to. <I>Not purloining,
 but showing all good fidelity;</I> he must not only not steal nor 
 waste, but must improve his master's goods, and promote his prosperity 
 and thriving, to his utmost. He that increased not his master's talent 
 is accused of unfaithfulness, though he had not embezzled nor lost it. 
 Faithfulness in a servant lies in the ready, punctual, and thorough 
 execution of his master's orders; keeping his secrets and counsels, 
 despatching his affairs, and managing with frugality, and to as much 
 just advantage for his master as he is able; looking well to his 
 trusts, and preventing, as far as he can, all spoil, or loss, or 
 damage. This is a way to bring a blessing upon himself, as the contrary 
 often brings utter ruin. <I>If you have not been faithful in that which 
 is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:12">Luke xvi. 12</A>.

 Thus of the duties themselves, to which servants are to be exhorted.
 Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is the consideration with which Titus was to enforce them: 
 <I>That they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all 
 things;</I> that is, that they may recommend the gospel and Christ's 
 holy religion to the good opinion of those that are without, by their 
 meek, humble, obedient, and faithful conduct in all things. Even 
 servants, though they may think that such as they, in so low and 
 inferior a condition, can do little to bring repute to Christianity, or 
 adorn the doctrine of Christ, and set forth the excellences of his 
 truth and ways, yet, if they be careful to do their duty, it will 
 redound to the glory of God and the credit of religion. The unbelieving 
 masters would think the better of that despised way, which was every 
 where spoken against, when they found that those of their servants who 
 were Christians were better than their other servants--more obedient and
 submissive, more just and faithful, and more diligent in their places. 
 True religion is an honour to the professors of it; and they should see 
 that they do not any dishonour to it, but adorn it rather in all that 
 they are able. Our light must shine among men, so that they, seeing our 
 good works, may glorify our Father who is in heaven. And thus of the 
 apostle's directions to Titus, about the discharge of his office, in 
 reference to several sorts of persons.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
 to all men,
 &nbsp; 12  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
 should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
 world;
 &nbsp; 13  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
 the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
 &nbsp; 14  Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
 iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
 good works.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the grounds or considerations upon which all the foregoing 
 directions are urged, taken from the nature and design of the gospel, 
 and the end of Christ's death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the nature and design of the gospel. Let young and old, men and 
 women, masters and servants, and Titus himself, let all sorts do their 
 respective duties, for this is the very aim and business of 
 Christianity, to instruct, and help, and form persons, under all 
 distinctions and relations, to a right frame and conduct. For this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are put under the dispensation of <I>the grace of God,</I> so 
 the gospel is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:2">Eph. iii. 2</A>.

 It is grace in respect of the spring of it--the free favour and
 good-will of God, not any merit or desert in the creature; as 
 manifesting and declaring this good-will in an eminent and signal 
 manner; and as it is the means of conveying and working grace in the 
 hearts of believers. Now grace is obliging and constraining to 
 goodness: <I>Let not sin reign, but yield yourselves unto God; for you 
 are not under the law, but under grace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:12-14">Rom. vi. 12-14</A>.

 <I>The love of Christ constrains us</I> not to live to self, but to him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:14,15">2 Cor. v. 14, 15</A>);
 
 without this effect, grace is received in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This gospel grace <I>brings salvation</I> (reveals and offers it to 
 sinners and ensures it to believers)--salvation from sin and wrath, from
 death and hell. Hence it is called <I>the word of life;</I> it brings 
 to faith, and so to life, the life of holiness now and of happiness 
 hereafter. The law is the ministration of death, but the gospel the 
 ministration of life and peace. This therefore must be received as 
 salvation (its rules minded, its commands obeyed), that the end of it 
 may be obtained, <I>the salvation of the soul.</I> And more inexcusable 
 will the neglecters of this grace of God bringing salvation now be, 
 since,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>It hath appeared,</I> or shone out more clearly and illustriously 
 than ever before. The old dispensation was comparatively dark and 
 shadowy; this is a clear and shining light; and, as it is now more 
 bright, so more diffused and extensive also. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It hath appeared <I>to all men;</I> not to the Jews only, as the 
 glory of God appeared at mount Sinai to that particular people, and out 
 of the view of all others; but gospel grace is open to all, and all are 
 invited to come and partake of the benefit of it, Gentiles as well as 
 Jews. The publication of it is free and general: <I>Disciple all
 nations: Preach the gospel to every creature.</I> The pale is broken
 down; there is no such enclosure now as formerly. <I>The preaching of
 Jesus Christ, which was kept secret since the world began, now is made
 manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the
 commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the
 obedience of faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25,26">Rom. xvi. 25, 26</A>.

 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel is for all ranks and
 conditions of men (slaves and servants, as well as masters), therefore 
 engaging and encouraging all to receive and believe it, and walk 
 suitably to it, adorning it in all things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. This gospel revelation is to <I>teach,</I> and not by way of 
 information and instruction only, as a schoolmaster does his scholars, 
 but by way of precept and command, as a sovereign who gives laws to his 
 subjects. It directs what to shun and what to follow, what to avoid and 
 what to do. The gospel is not for speculation only or chiefly, but for 
 practice and right ordering of life; for it teaches us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To abandon sin: <I>Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts;</I> to 
 renounce and have no more to do with these, as we have had: <I>Put off, 
 concerning the former conversation, the old man which is corrupt;</I> 
 that is, the whole body of sins, here distributed into 
 <I>ungodliness</I> and <I>worldly lusts.</I> "Put away ungodliness and 
 irreligion, all unbelief, neglect or disesteem of the divine Being, not 
 loving, nor fearing, nor trusting in him, nor obeying him as we should, 
 neglecting his ordinances, slighting his worship, profaning his name or 
 day. Thus deny ungodliness (hate and put it away); <I>and worldly 
 lusts,</I> all corrupt and vicious desires and affections that prevail 
 in worldly men, and carry out to worldly things <I>the lust of the 
 flesh also, and of the eye, and the pride of life,</I> all sensuality 
 and filthiness, covetous desires and ambition, seeking and valuing more 
 the praise of men than of God; put away all these." An earthly sensual 
 conversation suits not a heavenly calling. <I>Those that are Christ's
 have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</I> They have 
 done it by covenant-engagement and promise, and have initially and 
 prevailingly done it in act; they are going on in the work, cleansing 
 themselves more and more from all filthiness of flesh and spirit. Thus 
 the gospel first unteaches that which is evil, to abandon sin; and 
 then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To make conscience of that which is good: <I>To live soberly, 
 righteously, and godly,</I> &c. Religion is not made up of negatives 
 only; there must be doing good as well as eschewing evil; in these 
 conjunctly is sincerity proved and the gospel adorned. We should live 
 soberly with respect to ourselves, in the due government of our 
 appetites and passions, keeping the limits of moderation and 
 temperance, avoiding all inordinate excesses; and righteously towards 
 all men, rendering to all their due, and injuring none, but rather 
 doing good to others, according to our ability and their need: this 
 seems a part of justice and righteousness, for we are not born for 
 ourselves alone, and therefore may not live to ourselves only. <I>We 
 are members one of another,</I> and <I>must seek every man another's 
 wealth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:24,12:25">1 Cor. x. 24; xii. 25</A>.

 The public, especially, which includes the interests of all, must have
 the regards of all. Selfishness is a sort of unrighteousness; it robs 
 others of that share in us which is their due. How amiable then will a 
 just and righteous conduct be! It secures and promotes all interests, 
 not particular only, but general and public, and so contributes to the 
 peace and happiness of the world. Live righteously therefore as well
 as soberly. And godly towards God, in the duties of his worship and 
 service. Regards to him indeed should run through all. <I>Whether you 
 eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>.

 Personal and relative duties must be done in obedience to his commands, 
 with due aim at pleasing and honouring him, from principles of holy 
 love and fear of him. But there is an express and direct duty also that 
 we owe to God, namely, belief and acknowledgment of his being and 
 perfections, paying him internal and external worship and 
 homage,--loving, fearing, and trusting in him,--depending on him, and
 devoting ourselves to him,--observing all those religious duties and
 ordinances that he has appointed,--praying to him, praising him, and
 meditating on his word and works. This is godliness, looking and coming 
 to God, as our state now is, not immediately, but as he has manifested 
 himself in Christ; so does the gospel direct and require. To go to God 
 in any other way, namely, by saints or angels, is unsuitable, yea, 
 contrary to the gospel rule and warrant. All communications from God to 
 us are through his Son, and our returns must also be by him. God in 
 Christ we must look at as the object of our hope and worship. Thus must 
 we exercise ourselves to godliness, without which there can be no 
 adorning of that gospel which is according to it, which teaches and 
 requires such a deportment. A gospel conversation must needs be a godly 
 conversation, expressing our love and fear and reverence of God, our 
 hope and trust and confidence in him, as manifested in his Son. <I>We 
 are the circumcision</I> (who have in truth what was signified by that 
 sacrament) <I>who worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ 
 Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</I> See in how small a 
 compass our duty is comprised; it is put into few words, <I>denying 
 ungodliness and worldly lusts, and living soberly, righteously, and 
 godly, in this present world.</I> The gospel teaches us not only how to 
 believe and hope well, but also to live well, as becomes that faith and 
 hope in this present world, and as expectants of another and better. 
 There is the world that now is, and that which is to come; the present 
 is the time and place of our trial, and the gospel teaches us to live 
 well here, not, however, as our final state, but with an eye chiefly to 
 a future: for it teaches us in all,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) To look for the glories of another world, to which a sober, 
 righteous, and godly life in this is preparative: <I>Looking for that 
 blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our 
 Saviour Jesus Christ.</I> Hope, by a metonymy, is put for the thing 
 hoped for, namely, heaven and the felicities thereof, called 
 emphatically <I>that hope,</I> because it is the great thing we look 
 and long and wait for; and a <I>blessed hope,</I> because, when 
 attained, we shall be completely happy for ever. <I>And the glorious 
 appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</I> This 
 denotes both the time of the accomplishing of our hope and the sureness 
 and greatness of it: it will be at the second appearing of Christ, when 
 he shall come <I>in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy 
 angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:26">Luke ix. 26</A>.

 His own glory which he had before the world was; and his Father's,
 being <I>the express image of his person,</I> and as God-man, his 
 delegated ruler and Judge; and of the holy angels, as his ministers and 
 glorious attendants. His first coming was in meanness, to satisfy 
 justice and purchase happiness; his second will be in majesty, to 
 bestow and instate his people in it. <I>Christ was once offered to bear 
 the sins of many; and unto those that look for him will he appear the 
 second time, without sin, unto salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:28">Heb. ix. 28</A>.

 <I>The great God and our Saviour</I> (or <I>even our Saviour</I>)
 <I>Jesus Christ;</I> for they are not two subjects, but one only, as 
 appears by the single article, <B><I>tou megalou Theou kai 
 Soteros,</I></B> not <B><I>kai tou Soteros,</I></B> and so is 
 <B><I>kai</I></B> rendered

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24">1 Cor. xv. 24</A>,

 <I>When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
 Father;</I> <B><I>to Theo kai Patri.</I></B> Christ then is the 
 <I>great God,</I> not figuratively, as magistrates and others are 
 sometimes called gods, or as appearing and acting in the name of God, 
 but properly and absolutely, <I>the true God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:20">1 John v. 20</A>),

 <I>the mighty God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>),

 <I>who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
 with God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6">Phil. ii. 6</A>.

 In his second coming he will reward his servants, and bring them to 
 glory with him. Observe,

 [1.] There is a common and blessed hope for all true Christians in the
 other world. If in this life only they had hope in Christ, they were of
 all men the most miserable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:19">1 Cor. xv. 19</A>.

 By hope is meant the thing hoped for, namely, Christ himself, who is
 called <I>our hope</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:1">1 Tim. i. 1</A>),

 and blessedness in and through him, even riches of glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:18">Eph. i. 18</A>),
 
 hence fitly termed here <I>that blessed hope.</I> 

 [2.] The design of the gospel is to stir up all to a good life by this 
 blessed hope. <I>Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
 the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation 
 of Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:13">1 Pet. i. 13</A>.

 To the same purport here, <I>Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, 
 live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world, looking 
 for the blessed hope;</I> not as mercenaries, but as dutiful and 
 thankful Christian. <I>What manner of persons ought you to be in all
 holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hastening to the 
 coming of the day of God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:11,12">2 Pet. iii. 11, 12</A>.

 Looking and hastening, that is, expecting and diligently preparing for
 it. 

 [3.] At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ will the blessed hope 
 of Christians be attained; for their felicity will be this, <I>To be 
 where he is, and to behold his glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 The glory of the great God and our Saviour will then break out as the
 sun. Though in the exercise of his judiciary power he will appear as 
 the Son of man, yet will he be mightily declared to be the Son of God 
 too. The divinity, which on earth was much veiled, will shine out then 
 as the sun in its strength. Hence the work and design of the gospel
 are to raise the heart to wait for this second appearing of Christ. 
 <I>We are begotten again to a lively hope of it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3">1 Pet. i. 3</A>),

 turned to <I>serve the living God, and wait for his Son from
 heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9,10">1 Thess. i. 9, 10</A>.

 Christians are marked by this, expecting their Master's coming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:36">Luke xii. 36</A>),
 
 <I>loving his appearance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8">2 Tim. iv. 8</A>.

 Let us then look to this hope; let our loins be girt, and our lights
 burning, and ourselves like those who wait for their Lord; the day or 
 hour we know not, but <I>he that shall come will come, and will not 
 tarry,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:37">Heb. x. 37</A>.

 [4.] The comfort and joy of Christians are that their Saviour is the
 great God, and will gloriously manifest himself at his second coming. 
 Power and love, majesty and mercy, will then appear together in the 
 highest lustre, to the terror and confusion of the wicked, but to the 
 everlasting triumph and rejoicing of the godly. Were he not thus the 
 great God, and not a mere creature, he could not be their Saviour, nor 
 their hope. Thus of the considerations to enforce the directions of all 
 sorts to their respective duties from the nature and design of the 
 gospel. And herewith is connected another ground, namely,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From the end of Christ's death: <I>Who gave himself for us, that he 
 might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar 
 people, zealous of good works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death, as 
 well as the scope of his doctrine. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The purchaser of salvation--Jesus Christ, <I>that great God and our
 Saviour,</I> who saves not simply as God, much less as man alone; but 
 as God-man, two natures in one person: man, that he might obey, and
 suffer, and die, for man, and be meet to deal with him and for him; and 
 God, that he might support the manhood, and give worth and efficacy to 
 his undertakings, and have due regard to the rights and honour of the 
 deity, as well as the good of his creature, and bring about the latter 
 to the glory of the former. Such a one became us; and this was,</P>

 2. The price of our redemption: <I>He gave himself.</I> The Father gave 
 him, but he gave himself too; and, in the freeness and voluntariness, 
 as well as the greatness of the offering, lay the acceptableness and 
 merit of it. <I>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my 
 life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay 
 it down of myself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:17,18">John x. 17, 18</A>.
 
 So 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>,

 "<I>For their sakes I sanctify myself,</I> or separate and devote
 myself to this work, to be both a priest and a sacrifice to God for the
 sins of men." The human nature was the offering, and the divine the
 altar, sanctifying the gift, and the whole the act of the person. <I>He
 gave himself a ransom for all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:6">1 Tim. ii. 6</A>.

 <I>Once in the end of the world hath he appeared, to put away sin by 
 the sacrifice of himself.</I> He was the priest and sacrifice too. 
 <I>We are redeemed, not with silver and gold, but the precious blood of 
 Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,19">1 Pet. i. 18, 19</A>),

 called <I>the blood of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>),

 that is, of him who is God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The persons for whom: <I>For us,</I> us poor perishing sinners, gone 
 off from God, and turned rebels against him. He gave himself <I>for 
 us,</I> not only for our good, but in our stead. Messiah was cut off, 
 not for himself, but for us. <I>He suffered, the just for the unjust,
 that he might bring us to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 <I>He was made sin for us</I> (an offering and sacrifice for sin),
 <I>that we might be made the righteousness of God in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2 Cor. v. 21</A>.

 Wonderful condescension and grace! <I>He loved us, and gave himself
 for us;</I> what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him? 
 Especially considering,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The ends of his giving himself for us, 

 (1.) <I>That he might redeem us from all iniquity.</I> This is fitted 
 to the first lesson, <I>denying ungodliness and worldly lusts.</I> 
 Christ gave himself to redeem us from these, therefore put them away. 
 To love and live in sin is to trample under foot redeeming blood, to 
 despise and reject one of the greatest benefits of it, and to act 
 counter to its design. But how could the short sufferings of Christ 
 redeem us from all iniquity? <I>Answer,</I> Through the infinite
 dignity of his person. He who was God suffered, though not as God. The 
 acts and properties of either nature are attributed to the person. God 
 purchased his church <I>with his own blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>.

 Could payment be made at once, no need of suffering for ever. A mere 
 creature could not do this, from the finiteness of his nature; but 
 God-man could. <I>The great God and our Saviour gave himself for 
 us:</I> this accounts for it. <I>By one offering he hath for ever 
 perfected those that are sanctified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:25,26,10:14">Heb. ix. 25, 26; x. 14</A>.

 He needed not to offer himself often, nor could he be holden of death, 
 when he had once undergone it. Happy end and fruit of Christ's death, 
 redemption from all iniquity! Christ died for this: and, 

 (2.) <I>To purify to himself a peculiar people.</I> This enforces the 
 second lesson: <I>To live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
 present world.</I> Christ died to purify as well as to pardon--to 
 obtain grace, to heal the nature, as well as to free from guilt and 
 condemnation. He gave himself for his church, <I>to cleanse it.</I> 
 Thus does he make <I>to himself a peculiar people,</I> by purifying 
 them. Thus are they distinguished from the world that lies in 
 wickedness; they are born of God, and assimilated to him, bear his 
 image, are holy as their heavenly Father is holy. Observe, Redemption 
 from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and both make a 
 peculiar people unto God: freedom from guilt and condemnation, freedom 
 from the power of lusts, and purification of soul by the Spirit. These 
 are <I>a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,</I> and 
 so <I>a peculiar people.</I> And, 

 (3.) <I>Zealous of good works.</I> This peculiar people, as they are 
 made so by grace purifying them, so must they be seen to be so by doing 
 good, and a zeal therein. Observe, The gospel is not a doctrine of 
 licentiousness, but of holiness and good life. We are redeemed from our 
 vain conversation, to serve God <I>in holiness and righteousness all 
 the days of our life.</I> Let us see then that we do good, and have 
 zeal in it; only looking that zeal be guided by knowledge and spirited 
 with love, directed to the glory of God, and always in some good thing.
 And thus of the motive to the duties directed, from the end of Christ's 
 death.</P>

 The apostle closes the chapter (as he began it) with a summary 
 direction to Titus upon the whole, in which we have the matter and 
 manner of ministers' teaching, and a special instruction to Titus in 
 reference to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The matter of ministers' teaching: <I>These thing,</I> namely, those 
 before mentioned: not Jewish fables and traditions, but the truths and 
 duties of the gospel, of avoiding sin, and living soberly, righteously,
 and godly, in this present world. Observe, Ministers in their
 preaching must keep close to the word of God. <I>If any man speak, let
 him speak as the oracles of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11">1 Pet. iv. 11</A>,

 and not the figments and inventions of his own brain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The manner; by doctrine, and exhortation, and reproof with all 
 authority. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16">2 Tim. iii. 16</A>,

 <I>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
 doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in 
 righteousness;</I> that is, to teach sound doctrine, to convince of sin 
 and refute error, to reform the life, and to carry forward in what is 
 just and good; <I>that the man of God</I> (the Christian or minister) 
 <I>may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works</I> that are 
 to be practised by himself or to be taught to others. Here is what will 
 furnish for all parts of his duty, and the right discharge of them. 
 "<I>These things speak,</I> or teach; shun not to declare the whole 
 counsel of God." The great and necessary truths and duties of the 
 gospel, especially, these <I>speak and exhort,</I> 
 <B><I>parakalei,</I></B> <I>press with much earnestness.</I> Ministers 
 must not be cold and lifeless in delivering heavenly doctrine and 
 precepts, as if they were indifferent things or of little concern; but 
 they must urge them with earnestness suitable to their nature and 
 importance; they must call upon persons to mind and heed, and not be 
 <I>hearers only, deceiving themselves; but doers of the word, that they 
 may be blessed therein. And rebuke;</I> convince and reprove such as 
 contradict or gainsay, or neglect and do not receive the truth as they 
 should, or retain it in unrighteousness--those who hear it not with 
 such a believing and obedient mind and heart as they ought, but, 
 instead of this (it may be) live in contrary practices, showing 
 themselves stubborn and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate. 
 <I>Rebuke with all authority,</I> as coming in the name of God, and 
 armed with his threatenings and discipline, whoever make light of which 
 will do it at their peril. Ministers are reprovers in the gate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a special instruction to Titus in reference to himself: 
 "<I>Let no man despise thee;</I> that is, give no occasion to do so, 
 nor suffer it without reproof, considering that <I>he who despiseth 
 despiseth not man, but God.</I>" Or thus, "<I>Speak and exhort these 
 things,</I> press them upon all, as they may respectively be concerned; 
 with boldness and faithfulness reprove sin, and carefully look to 
 thyself and thy own conduct, and then none will despise thee." The most 
 effectual way for ministers to secure themselves from contempt is to 
 keep close to the doctrine of Christ, and imitate his example--to preach
 and live well, and do their duty with prudence and courage; this will 
 best preserve both their reputation and their comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps too an admonition might be here intended to the people--that
 Titus, though young, and but a substitute of the apostle, yet should
 not be condemned by them, but considered and respected as a faithful
 minister of Christ, and encouraged and supported in his work and
 office. "<I>Know those that labour among you, and are over you in the
 Lord, and admonish you; and esteem them</I> <I>very highly in love for
 their work's sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:12,13">1 Thess. v. 12, 13</A>.

 Mind their teaching, respect their persons, support them in their
 function, and, what in you lies, further their endeavours for the 
 honour of God and the salvation of souls."</P>
