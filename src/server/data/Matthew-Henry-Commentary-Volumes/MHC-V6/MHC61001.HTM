 In this chapter we have, 

 I. An introduction, or preface, making way for, and leading to, what is
 principally designed by the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. An exhortation to advance and improve in all Christian graces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 III. To enforce this exhortation, and engage them seriously and 
 heartily to comply with it, he adds, 

 1. A representation of the very great advantage which will thereby 
 accrue to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 2. A promise of the best assistance the apostle was able to give to 
 facilitate and forward this good work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 3. A declaration of the certain truth and divine origin of the gospel 
 of Christ, in the grace whereof they were exhorted to increase and 
 persevere.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to
 them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
 righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
 &nbsp; 2  Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
 of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
 &nbsp; 3  According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
 that <I>pertain</I> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
 him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
 &nbsp; 4  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
 promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
 nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
 through lust.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle Peter, being moved by the Holy Ghost to write once more to 
 those who from among the Jews were turned to faith in Christ, begins 
 this second epistle with an introduction, wherein the same persons are 
 described and the same blessings are desired that are in the preface to 
 his former letter; but there are some additions or alterations which 
 ought to be taken notice of, in all the three parts of the 
 introduction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here a description of the person who wrote the epistle, by 
 the name of <I>Simon,</I> as well as <I>Peter,</I> and by the title of 
 <I>servant,</I> as well as that of <I>apostle. Peter,</I> being in both 
 epistles, seems to be the name most frequently used, and with which he 
 may be thought to be best pleased, it being given him by our Lord, upon 
 his confessing <I>Jesus to be Christ the Son of the living God,</I> and 
 the very name signifying and sealing that truth to be the fundamental 
 article, the rock on which all must build; but the name <I>Simon,</I> 
 though omitted in the former epistle, is mentioned in this, lest the 
 total omission of that name, which was given him when he was 
 circumcised, should make the Jewish believers, who were all zealous of 
 the law, to become jealous of the apostle, as if he disclaimed and 
 despised circumcision. He here styles himself <I>a servant</I> (as well 
 as an apostle) <I>of Jesus Christ;</I> in this he may be allowed to 
 glory, as David does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>.

 The service of Christ is the way to the highest honour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.

 Christ himself is <I>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</I> and he makes
 all his servants <I>kings and priests unto God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>.

 How great an honour is it to be the servants of this Master! This is
 what we cannot, without sin, be ashamed of. To triumph in being 
 <I>Christ's servant</I> is very proper for those who are engaging 
 others to enter into or abide in the service of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have an account of the people to whom the epistle is written. 
 They are described in the former epistle as <I>elect according to the 
 foreknowledge of God the Father,</I> and here as <I>having obtained 
 precious faith in our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> for the faith here 
 mentioned is vastly different from the false faith of the heretic, and 
 the feigned faith of the hypocrite, and the fruitless faith of the 
 formal professor, how orthodox soever he is. It is <I>the faith of 
 God's elect</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:1">Tit. i. 1</A>),

 wrought by the Spirit of God in effectual calling. Observe, 

 1. True saving faith is a precious grace, and that not only as it is 
 very uncommon, very scarce, even in the visible church, a very small 
 number of true believers among a great multitude of visible professors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:14">Matt. xxii. 14</A>),

 but true faith is very excellent and of very great use and advantage to
 those who have it. <I>The just lives by faith,</I> a truly divine
 spiritual life; faith procures all the necessary supports and comforts
 of this excellent life; faith goes to Christ, and buys the wine and 
 milk 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>)

 which are the proper nourishment of the new creature; faith buys and 
 brings home the tried gold, the heavenly treasure that enriches; faith 
 takes and puts on the white raiment, the royal robes that clothe and 
 adorn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 2. Faith is alike precious in the private Christian and in the apostle; 
 it produces the same precious effects in the one and in the other. 
 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ as really as it does the 
 strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and 
 every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God, 
 and that from all sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:39">Acts xiii. 39</A>.

 Faith, in whomsoever it exists, takes hold of the same <I>precious</I>
 Saviour, and applies the same precious promises.

 3. This precious faith is obtained of God. Faith is the gift of God,
 wrought by the Spirit, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead. 

 4. The preciousness of faith, as well as our obtaining it, is through
 the righteousness of Christ. The satisfactory meritorious righteousness 
 and obedience of Christ gives faith all its value and preciousness: and 
 the righteousness of such a person cannot but be of infinite value to 
 those who by faith receive it. For,

 (1.) This Jesus Christ is God, yea, <I>our</I> God, as it is in the 
 original. He is truly God, an infinite Being, who has wrought out this 
 righteousness, and therefore it must be of infinite value. 

 (2.) <I>He is the Saviour of those that believe,</I> and as such he 
 yielded this meritorious obedience; and therefore it is of such great 
 benefit and advantage to them, because, as surety and Saviour, he 
 wrought out this righteousness in their stead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the apostolical benediction, wherein he wishes for the 
 multiplication and increase of the divine favour to them, and the 
 advancement and growth of the work of grace in them, and that peace 
 with God and in their own consciences (which cannot be without 
 <I>grace</I>) may abound in them. This is the very same benediction 
 that is in the former epistle; but here he adds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. An account of the way and means whereby <I>grace and peace are 
 multiplied</I>--it is <I>through the knowledge of God and Jesus
 Christ;</I> this acknowledging or believing in <I>the only living and
 true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent,</I> is the great
 improvement of spiritual life, or it could not be the way to life
 eternal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3">John xvii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The ground of the apostle's faith in asking, and of the Christian's 
 hope in expecting, the increase of grace. What we have already received 
 should encourage us to ask for more; he who has begun the work of grace 
 will perfect it. Observe, 

 (1.) The fountain of all spiritual blessings is the divine power of 
 Jesus Christ, who could not discharge all the office of Mediator, 
 unless he was God as well as man. 

 (2.) All things that have any relation to, and influence upon, the true 
 spiritual life, the life and power of godliness, are from Jesus Christ; 
 <I>in him all fulness dwells,</I> and it is from him that we receive, 
 <I>and grace for grace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>),

 even all that is necessary for the preserving, improving, and
 perfecting of grace and peace, which, according to some expositors, are 
 called here in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:3">this verse</A>

 <I>godliness and life.</I> 

 (3.) Knowledge of God, and faith in him, are the channel whereby all 
 spiritual supports and comforts are conveyed to us; but then we must 
 own and acknowledge God as the author of our effectual calling, for so 
 he is here described: <I>Him that hath called us to glory and 
 virtue.</I> Observe here, The design of God in calling or converting 
 men is to bring them to <I>glory and virtue,</I> that is, <I>peace and 
 grace,</I> as some understand it; but many prefer the marginal 
 rendering, <I>by glory and virtue;</I> and so we have effectual calling 
 set forth as the work of the glory and virtue, or <I>the glorious 
 power, of God,</I> which is described 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19">Eph. i. 19</A>.

 It is the glory of God's power to convert sinners; this is the power 
 and glory of God which are seen and experienced in his sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:2">Ps. lxiii. 2</A>);

 this power or virtue is to be extolled by all <I>that are called out of
 darkness into marvellous light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 (4.) In the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4">fourth verse</A>

 the apostle goes on to encourage their faith and hope in looking for an
 increase of grace and peace, because the same glory and virtue are 
 employed and evidenced in giving the promises of the gospel that are 
 exercised in our effectual calling. Observe,

 [1.] The good things which the promises make over are exceedingly 
 great. Pardon of sin is one of the blessings here intended; how great 
 this is all who know any thing of the power of God's anger will readily 
 confess, and this is one of those promised favours in bestowing whereof 
 <I>the power of the Lord is great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:17">Num. xiv. 17</A>.

 To pardon sins that are numerous and heinous (every one of which
 deserves God's wrath and curse, and that for ever) is a wonderful 
 thing, and is so called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:18">Ps. cxix. 18</A>.

 [2.] The promised blessings of the gospel are very precious; as the 
 great promise of the Old Testament was <I>the Seed of the woman,</I> 
 the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:39">Heb. xi. 39</A>),

 so the great promise of the New Testament is the <I>Holy Ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:49">Luke xxiv. 49</A>),

 and how precious must the enlivening, enlightening, sanctifying Spirit
 be! 

 [3.] Those who receive the promises of the gospel <I>partake of the 
 divine nature.</I> They are <I>renewed in the spirit of their mind, 
 after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness;</I> 
 their hearts are set for God and his service; they have a divine temper 
 and disposition of soul; though the law is <I>the ministration of 
 death,</I> and <I>the letter killeth,</I> yet the gospel is <I>the 
 ministration of life,</I> and <I>the Spirit quickeneth</I> those 
 <I>who</I> are naturally <I>dead in trespasses and sins.</I>

 [4.] Those in whom the Spirit works the divine nature are freed from 
 the bondage of corruption. Those who are, by the Spirit of grace, 
 <I>renewed in the spirit of their mind,</I> are translated into <I>the 
 liberty of the children of God;</I> for it is the world in which 
 <I>corruption reigns.</I> Those who are <I>not of the Father, but of 
 the world,</I> are under the power of sin; the world lies in 
 wickedness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:19">1 John v. 19</A>.

 And the dominion that sin has in the men of the world is through lust;
 their desires are to it, and therefore it rules over them. The dominion 
 that sin has over us is according to the delight we have in it.</P>

 into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
 Christ.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle comes to the chief thing intended in this 
 epistle--to excite and engage them to advance in grace and holiness,
 they having already obtained precious faith, and been made partakers of 
 the divine nature. This is a very good beginning, but it is not to be 
 rested in, as if we were already perfect. The apostle had prayed that 
 grace and peace might be multiplied to them, and now he exhorts them to 
 press forward for the obtaining of more grace. We should, as we have 
 opportunity, exhort those we pray for, and excite them to the use of 
 all proper means to obtain what we desire God to bestow upon them; and 
 those who will make any progress in religion must be very diligent and 
 industrious in their endeavours. Without <I>giving all diligence,</I> 
 there is no gaining any ground in the work of holiness; those who are 
 slothful in the business of religion will make nothing of it; we must 
 strive if we will <I>enter in at the strait gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:24">Luke xiii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here we cannot but observe how the believer's way is marked out step 
 by step. 

 1. He must get <I>virtue,</I> by which some understand <I>justice;</I>
 and then the <I>knowledge, temperance, and patience</I> that follow, 
 being joined with it, the apostle may be supposed to put them upon 
 pressing after the four cardinal virtues, or the four elements that go 
 to the making up of every virtue or virtuous action. But seeing it is
 a <I>faithful saying, and constantly to be asserted, that those who 
 have faith be careful to maintain good works</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:8">Tit. iii. 8</A>),

 by <I>virtue</I> here we may understand <I>strength</I> and 
 <I>courage,</I> without which the believer cannot stand up for good 
 works, by abounding and excelling in them. The righteous must be bold 
 as a lion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>);

 a cowardly Christian, who is afraid to profess the doctrines or 
 practise the duties of the gospel, must expect that Christ will be 
 ashamed of him another day. "Let not your hearts fail you in the evil 
 day, but show yourselves valiant in standing against all opposition, 
 and resisting every enemy, world, flesh, devil, yea, and death too." We 
 have need of virtue while we live, and it will be of excellent use when 
 we come to die. 

 2. The believer must add <I>knowledge</I> to his virtue, prudence to
 his courage; there is a knowledge of God's name which must go before 
 our faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>),

 and we cannot approve of the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of 
 God, till we know it; but there are proper circumstances for duty, 
 which must be known and observed; we must use the appointed means, and 
 observe the accepted time. Christian prudence regards the persons we 
 have to do with and the place and company we are in. Every believer 
 must labour after the knowledge and wisdom that are profitable to 
 direct, both as to the proper method and order wherein all Christian 
 duties are to be performed and as to the way and manner of performing 
 them. 

 3. We must add <I>temperance</I> to our knowledge. We must be sober and
 moderate in our love to, and use of, the good things of this life; and, 
 if we have a right understanding and knowledge of outward comforts, we 
 shall see that their worth and usefulness are vastly inferior to those 
 of spiritual mercies. Bodily exercises and bodily privileges profit but 
 little, and therefore are to be esteemed and used accordingly; the 
 gospel teaches sobriety as well as honesty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:12">Tit. ii. 12</A>.
 
 We must be moderate in desiring and using the good things of natural
 life, such as meat, drink, clothes, sleep, recreations, and credit; an 
 inordinate desire after these is inconsistent with an earnest desire 
 after God and Christ; and those who take more of these than is due can 
 render to neither God nor man what is due to them. 

 4. Add to temperance <I>patience,</I> which must <I>have its perfect
 work,</I> or we cannot <I>be perfect and entire, wanting nothing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:4">Jam. i. 4</A>),

 for we are born to trouble, and must through many tribulations enter 
 into the kingdom of heaven; and it is this tribulation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3">Rom. v. 3</A>)

 which worketh patience, that is, requires the exercise and occasions 
 the increase of this grace, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses 
 with silence and submission, without murmuring against God or 
 complaining of him, but justifying him who lays all affliction upon us, 
 owning that our sufferings are less than our sins deserve, and 
 believing they are no more than we ourselves need. 

 5. To patience we must add <I>godliness,</I> and this is the very thing
 which is produced by patience, for that works experience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:4">Rom. v. 4</A>.

 When Christians bear afflictions patiently, they get an experimental
 <I>knowledge of the loving-kindness of their heavenly Father, which he 
 will not take from his children, even when he visits their iniquity 
 with the rod and their transgression with stripes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:32,33">Ps. lxxxix. 32, 33</A>),

 and hereby they are brought to the child-like fear and reverential love 
 wherein true godliness consists: to this, 

 6. We must add <I>brotherly-kindness,</I> a tender affection to all our
 fellow-christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the 
 same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same 
 country, and heirs of the same inheritance, and therefore are to be 
 loved with a pure heart fervently, with a love of complacency, as those 
 who are peculiarly near and dear to us, in whom we take particular 
 delight,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:3">Ps. xvi. 3</A>.

 7. <I>Charity,</I> or a love of good-will to all mankind, must be added
 to the love of delight which we have for those who are the children of 
 God. God has made of one blood all nations, and all the children of men 
 are partakers of the same human nature, are all capable of the same 
 mercies, and liable to the same afflictions, and therefore, though upon 
 a spiritual account Christians are distinguished and dignified above 
 those who are without Christ, yet are they to sympathize with others in 
 their calamities, and relieve their necessities, and promote their 
 welfare both in body and soul, as they have opportunity: thus must all 
 believers in Christ evidence that they are the children of God, who is 
 good to all, but is especially good to Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. All the forementioned graces must be had, or we shall not be 
 <I>thoroughly furnished for all good works</I>--for the duties of the
 first and second table, for active and passive obedience, and for those 
 services wherein we are to imitate God as well as for those wherein we 
 only obey him--and therefore to engage us to an industrious and
 unwearied pursuit of them, the apostle sets forth the advantages that 
 redound to all who successfully labour so as to get these things to 
 <I>be and abound in them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:8-11"><I>v.</I> 8-11</A>.
 
 These are proposed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. More generally, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The having <I>these things make not barren</I> (or slothful) <I>nor 
 unfruitful,</I> where, according to the style of the Holy Ghost, we 
 must understand a great deal more than is expressed; for when it is 
 said concerning Ahaz, the vilest and most provoking of all the kings of 
 Judah, <I>that he did not right in the sight of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:2">2 Kings xvi. 2</A>),

 we are to understand as much as if it had been said, He did what was
 most offensive and abominable, as the following account of his life 
 shows; so, when it is here said that the being and abounding of all 
 Christian graces in us will make us neither inactive nor unfruitful, we 
 are thereby to understand that it will make us very zealous and lively, 
 vigorous and active, in all practical Christianity, and eminently 
 fruitful in the works of righteousness. These will bring much glory to
 God, by bringing forth much fruit among men, being <I>fruitful in 
 knowledge, or the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> owning 
 him to be their <I>Lord,</I> and evidencing themselves to be his 
 servants by their abounding in the work that he has given them to do. 
 This is the necessary consequence of adding one grace to another; for, 
 where all Christian graces are in the heart, they improve and 
 strengthen, encourage and cherish, one another; so they all thrive and 
 grow (as the apostle intimates in the beginning of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and wherever grace abounds there will be an abounding in good works. 
 How desirable it is to be in such a case the apostle evidences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 There he sets forth how miserable it is to be without those quickening 
 fructifying graces; for he who has not the forementioned graces, or, 
 though he pretends or seems to have them, does not exercise and improve 
 them, <I>is blind,</I> that is, as to spiritual and heavenly things, as 
 the next words explain it: <I>He cannot see far off.</I> This present 
 evil world he can see, and dotes upon, but has no discerning at all of 
 the world to come, so as to be affected with the spiritual privileges 
 and heavenly blessings thereof. He who sees the excellences of 
 Christianity must needs be diligent in endeavours after all those 
 graces that are absolutely necessary for <I>obtaining glory, honour, 
 and immortality;</I> but, where these graces are not obtained nor 
 endeavoured after, men are not able to look forward to the things that 
 are but a very little way off in reality, though in appearance, or in 
 their apprehension, they are at a great distance, because they put them 
 far away from them; and how wretched is their condition who are thus 
 blind as to the awfully great things of the other world, who cannot see 
 any thing of the reality and certainty, the greatness and nearness, of 
 the glorious rewards God will bestow on the righteous, and the dreadful 
 punishment he will inflict on the ungodly! But this is not all the 
 misery of those who do not <I>add to their faith virtue, knowledge,</I> 
 &c. They are as unable to look backward as forward, their memories are 
 slippery and unable to retain what is past, as their sight is short and 
 unable to discern what is future; they forget that they have been 
 baptized, and had the means, and been laid under the obligations to 
 holiness of heart and life. By baptism we are engaged in a holy war 
 against sin, and are solemnly bound to fight against the flesh, the 
 world, and the devil. Often call to mind, and seriously meditate on, 
 your solemn engagement to be the Lord's, and your peculiar advantages 
 and encouragements to lay aside <I>all filthiness of flesh and 
 spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle proposes two particular advantages that will attend or 
 follow upon diligence in the work of a Christian: stability in grace, 
 and a triumphant entrance into glory. These he brings in by resuming 
 his former exhortation, and laying it down in other words; for what in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>

 is expressed by <I>giving diligence to add to faith virtue,</I> &c., is
 expressed in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>

 by <I>giving diligence to make our calling and election sure.</I> Here
 we may observe, 

 (1.) It is the duty of believers <I>to make their election sure,</I> to 
 clear it up to themselves that they are the chosen of God. 

 (2.) The way to make sure their eternal election is to make out their 
 effectual calling: none can look into the book of God's eternal 
 counsels and decrees; but, inasmuch as <I>whom God did predestinate 
 those he also called,</I> if we can find we are effectually called, we 
 may conclude we are chosen to salvation. 

 (3.) It requires a great deal of diligence and labour to make sure our 
 calling and election; there must be a very close examination of 
 ourselves, a very narrow search and strict enquiry, whether we are 
 thoroughly converted, our minds enlightened, our wills renewed, and our 
 whole souls changed as to the bent and inclination thereof; and to come 
 to a fixed certainty in this requires the utmost diligence, and cannot 
 be attained and kept without divine assistance, as we may learn from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:23,Ro+8:16">Ps. cxxxix. 23; Rom. viii. 16</A>.

 "But, how great soever the labour is, do not think much of it, for 
 great is the advantage you gain by it; for,"

 [1.] "By this you will be kept from falling, and that at all times and
 seasons, even in those hours of temptation that shall be on the earth." 
 When others shall fall into heinous and scandalous sin, those who are 
 thus diligent shall be enabled to walk circumspectly and keep on in the 
 way of their duty; and, when many fall into errors, they shall be 
 preserved sound in the faith, and stand perfect and complete in all the 
 will of God.

 [2.] Those who are diligent in the work of religion shall have a 
 triumphant entrance into glory; while of those few who get to heaven 
 some are scarcely saved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:18">1 Pet. iv. 18</A>),

 with a great deal of difficulty, <I>even as by fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:15">1 Cor. iii. 15</A>),
 
 those who are <I>growing in grace,</I> and <I>abounding in the work of
 the Lord,</I> shall have an <I>abundant entrance into the joy of their 
 Lord,</I> even that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they 
 shall <I>reign with him for ever and ever.</I></P>

 I. The importance and advantage of progress and perseverance in grace 
 and holiness made the apostle to be very diligent in doing the work of 
 a minister of Christ, that he might thereby excite and assist them to 
 be diligent in the duty of Christians. If ministers be negligent in
 their work, it can hardly be expected that the people will be diligent 
 in theirs; therefore Peter <I>will not be negligent</I> (that is, at no 
 time or place, in no part of his work, to no part of his charge), but 
 will be exemplarily and universally diligent, and that in the work of a 
 remembrancer. This is the office of the best ministers, even the 
 apostles themselves; they are <I>the Lord's remembrancers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6">Isa. lxxii. 6</A>);

 they are especially bound to make mention of the promises, and put God 
 in mind of his engagements to do good to his people; and they are the 
 people's remembrancers, making mention of God's precepts, and putting 
 them in mind of the doctrines and duties of Christianity, that they may 
 remember God's commandments, to do them. And this the apostle does, 
 though some persons might think it needless, inasmuch as they already 
 knew those thing that he writes about, and were established in the very 
 truth that he insists upon. Observe, 

 1. We need to be put in mind of what we already know to prevent our
 forgetting it, and to improve our knowledge, and reduce all to
 practice. 

 2. We must be established in the belief of the truth, that we may not
 be shaken by every wind of doctrine, and especially in that which is 
 the present truth, the truth more peculiarly necessary for us to know 
 in our day, that which belongs to our peace, and which is more 
 especially opposed in our time. The great doctrines of the gospel, 
 <I>that Jesus is the Christ, that Jesus Christ came into the world to 
 save sinners, that those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be 
 saved, and all that believe in God must be careful to maintain good 
 works</I>--these are truths the apostles insisted on in their day; 
 <I>these are faithful sayings, and worthy of all acceptation</I> in 
 every age of the Christian church. And, as these must be constantly 
 affirmed by ministers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:8">Tit. iii. 8</A>),

 so the people are to be well instructed and established therein, and 
 yet must, after all their attainments in knowledge, be put in mind of 
 such things as cannot be too clearly known nor too firmly believed. The 
 most advanced Christians cannot, while in this world, be above 
 ordinances, nor beyond the need of those means which God has appointed 
 and does afford. And, if the people need teaching and exhortation while 
 they are in the body, it is very meet and just that ministers should, 
 as long as they are in this tabernacle, instruct and exhort them, and 
 bring those truths to their remembrance that they have formerly heard, 
 this being a proper means to stir them up to be diligent and lively in 
 a course of gospel-obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle, being set upon the work, tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 what makes him earnest in this matter, even the knowledge he had, not 
 only that he must certainly, but also that he must shortly, <I>put off 
 this tabernacle.</I> Observe, 

 1. The body is but the tabernacle of the soul. It is a mean and
 movable structure, whose stakes can be easily removed, and its cords
 presently broken. 

 2. This tabernacle must be put off. We are not to continue long in this
 earthly house. As at night we put off our clothes, and lay them by, so
 at death we must put off our bodies, and they musts be laid up in the 
 grave till the morning of the resurrection. 

 3. The nearness of death makes the apostle diligent in the business of
 life. Our Lord Jesus had shown him that the time of his departure was 
 at hand, and therefore he bestirs himself with greater zeal and 
 diligence, because the time is short. He must soon be removed from 
 those to whom he wrote; and his ambition being that they should 
 remember the doctrine he had delivered to them, after he himself was 
 taken away from them, he commits his exhortation to writing. The 
 apostle had not any great opinion of oral tradition. This was not so 
 proper a means to reach the end he was in pursuit of. He would have 
 them always to remember these things, and not only to keep them in 
 mind, but also to make mention of them, as the original words import.
 <I>Those who fear the Lord make mention of his name,</I> and talk of 
 his loving-kindness. This is the way to spread the knowledge of the 
 Lord and this the apostle had at heart: and those who have the written 
 word of God are thereby put into a capacity to do this.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
 made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
 &nbsp; 17  For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
 there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is
 my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
 &nbsp; 18  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
 with him in the holy mount.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the reason of giving the foregoing exhortation, and that 
 with so much diligence and seriousness. These things are not idle 
 tales, or a vain thing, but of undoubted truth and vast concern. The 
 gospel is not a <I>cunningly devised fable.</I> These are not the words 
 of one who hath a devil, nor the contrivance of any number of men who 
 by cunning craftiness endeavour to deceive. The way of salvation by 
 Jesus Christ is eminently the counsel of God, the most excellent 
 contrivance of the infinitely wise Jehovah; it was he that invented 
 this way of saving sinners by Jesus Christ, whose power and coming are 
 set forth in the gospel, and the apostle's preaching was a making of 
 these things known. 

 1. The preaching of the gospel is a making known the power of Christ,
 that he is able to save to the uttermost all who come to God by him. He 
 is the mighty God, and therefore can save from both the guilt and the 
 filth of sin. 

 2. The coming of Christ also is make known by the preaching of the
 gospel. He who was promised immediately after the fall of man, as in 
 the fulness of time to be born of a woman, has now come in the flesh; 
 and whosoever denies this is an antichrist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:3">1 John iv. 3</A>),

 he is actuated and influenced by the spirit of anti-christ; but those
 who are the true apostles and ministers of Christ, and are directed and 
 guided by the Spirit of Christ, evidence that Christ has come according 
 to the promise which all the Old-Testament believers died in the faith 
 of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:39">Heb. xi. 39</A>.

 Christ has come in the flesh. Inasmuch as those whom he undertakes to
 save <I>are partakers of flesh and blood, he himself also took part of 
 the same,</I> that he might suffer in their nature and stead, and 
 thereby make an atonement. This coming of Christ the gospel is very 
 plain and circumstantial in setting forth; but there is a second 
 coming, which it likewise mentions, which the ministers of the gospel 
 ought also to make known, when he shall come in the glory of his Father 
 with all his holy angels, for he is appointed to be Judge both of quick 
 and dead. He will come to judge the world in righteousness by the 
 everlasting gospel, and call us all to give account of all things done 
 in the body, whether good or evil.

 3. And though this gospel of Christ has been blasphemously called a
 <I>fable</I> by one of those wretches who call themselves <I>the 
 successors of St. Peter,</I> yet our apostle proves that it is of the 
 greatest certainty and reality, inasmuch as during our blessed 
 Saviour's abode here on earth, when he took on him the form of a 
 servant and was found in fashion as a man, he sometimes manifested 
 himself to be God, and particularly to our apostle and the two sons of 
 Zebedee, who <I>were eye-witnesses of his divine majesty, when he was 
 transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his 
 raiment was white as the light, exceedingly white, as snow, so as no 
 fuller on earth can whiten them.</I> This Peter, James, and John, were 
 eye-witnesses of, and therefore might and ought to attest; and surely 
 their testimony is true, when they witness what they have seen with 
 their eyes, yea, and heard with their ears: for, besides the visible 
 glory that Christ was invested with here on earth, there was an audible 
 voice from heaven. Here observe,

 (1.) What a gracious declaration was made: <I>This is my beloved Son, 
 in whom I am well pleased</I>--the best voice that ever came from 
 heaven to earth; God is well pleased with Christ, and with us in him. 
 This is the Messiah who was promised, through whom all who believe in 
 him shall be accepted and saved. 

 (2.) This declaration is made by God the Father, who thus publicly owns 
 his Son (even in his state of humiliation, when he was in the form of a 
 servant), yea, proclaims him to be his beloved Son, when he is in that 
 low condition; yea, so far are Christ's mean and low circumstances from 
 abating the love of the Father to him that his laying down his life is 
 said to be one special reason of the Father's love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:17">John x. 17</A>.

 (3.) The design of this voice was to do our Saviour a singular humour
 while he was here below: <I>He received honour and glory from God the 
 Father.</I> This is the person whom God delights to honour. As he 
 requires us to give honour and glory to his Son by confessing him to be 
 our Saviour, so does he give glory and honour to our Saviour by 
 declaring him to be his Son. 

 (4.) This voice is from heaven, called here <I>the excellent glory,</I> 
 which still reflects a greater glory upon our blessed Saviour. This 
 declaration is from God the fountain of honour, and from heaven the 
 seat of glory, where God is most gloriously present. 

 (5.) This voice was heard, and that so as to be understood, by Peter, 
 James, and John. They not only heard a sound (as the people did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:28,29">John xii. 28, 29</A>),

 but they understood the sense. God opens the ears and understandings of
 his people to receive what they are concerned to know, when others are
 like Paul's companions, who only heard a sound of words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:7">Acts ix. 7</A>),

 but understood not the meaning thereof, and therefore are said not to 
 hear the voice of him that spoke,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:9">Acts xxii. 9</A>.

 Blessed are those who not only hear, but understand, who believe the
 truth, and feel the power of the voice from heaven, as he did who 
 testifieth these things: and we have all the reason in the world to 
 receive his testimony; for who would refuse to give credit to what is 
 so circumstantially laid down as this account of the voice from heaven, 
 of which the apostle tells us, 

 (6.) It was heard by them <I>in the holy mount,</I> when they were with 
 Jesus? The place wherein God affords any peculiarly gracious 
 manifestation of himself is thereby made holy, not with an inherent 
 holiness, but as the ground was holy where God appeared to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:5">Exod. iii. 5</A>),

 and the mountain holy on which the temple was built,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:1">Ps. lxxxvii. 1</A>.

 Such places are relatively holy, and to be regarded as such during the
 time that men in themselves experience, or may, by warrant from the 
 word, believingly expect, the special presence and gracious influence 
 of the holy and glorious God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
 well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
 place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
 &nbsp; 20  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
 any private interpretation.
 &nbsp; 21  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
 but holy men of God spake <I>as they were</I> moved by the Holy Ghost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle lays down another argument to prove the 
 truth and reality of the gospel, and intimates that this second proof 
 is more strong and convincing than the former, and more unanswerably 
 makes out that the doctrine of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ is not a mere fable or cunning contrivance of men, but the wise 
 and wonderful counsel of the holy and gracious God. For this is 
 foretold by the prophets and penmen of the Old Testament, who spoke and 
 wrote under the influence and according to the direction of the Spirit 
 of God. Here note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The description that is given of the scriptures of the Old 
 Testament: they are called a <I>more sure word of prophecy.</I> 

 1. It is a prophetical declaration of the power and coming, the Godhead
 and incarnation, of our Saviour, which we have in the Old Testament. It 
 is there foretold <I>that the seed of the woman shall bruise the 
 serpent's head.</I> His power to destroy the devil and his works, and 
 his being made of a woman, are there foretold; and the great and awful 
 Old Testament name of God, <I>Jehovah</I> (as read by some), signifies 
 only <I>He will be;</I> and that name of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>)

 is rendered by many, <I>I will be that I will be;</I> and, thus
 understood, they point at God's being incarnate in order to the 
 redemption and salvation of his people as what was <I>to come.</I> But 
 the New Testament is a history of that whereof the Old Testament is a 
 prophecy. <I>All the prophets and the law prophesied until John,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:13">Matt. xi. 13</A>.

 And the evangelists and the apostles have written the history of what
 was before delivered as prophecy. Now the accomplishment of the Old 
 Testament by the New, and the agreeableness of the New Testament to the 
 Old, are a full demonstration of the truth of both. Read the Old 
 Testament as a prophecy of Christ, and with diligence and thankfulness 
 use the New as the best exposition of the Old. 

 2. <I>The Old Testament is a more sure word of prophecy.</I> It is so
 to the Jews who received it as the oracles of God. Following prophets 
 confirmed what had been delivered by those who went before, and these 
 prophecies had been written by the express command, and preserved by 
 the special care, and many of them fulfilled by the wonderful 
 providence of God, and therefore were more certain to those who had all 
 along received and read the scriptures than the apostle's account of 
 this voice from heaven. <I>Moses and the prophets</I> more powerfully 
 persuade than even miracles themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:31">Luke xvi. 31</A>.

 How firm and sure should our faith be, who have such a firm and sure
 word to rest upon! All the prophecies of the Old Testament are more
 sure and certain to us who have the history of the most exact and 
 minute accomplishment of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The encouragement the apostle gives us to search the scriptures. He 
 tells us, <I>We do well if we take heed to them;</I> that is, apply our 
 minds to understand the sense, and our hearts to believe the truth, of 
 this sure word, yea, bend ourselves to it, that we may be moulded and 
 fashioned by it. The word is that form of doctrine into which we must 
 be cast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:17">Rom. vi. 17</A>),

 <I>that formulary of knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:20">Rom. ii. 20</A>)

 by which we are to regulate our thoughts and sentiments, our words and 
 confessions, our whole life and conversation. If we thus apply 
 ourselves to the word of God, we certainly do well in all respects, 
 what is pleasing to God and profitable to ourselves; and this indeed is 
 but paying that regard which is due to the oracles of God. But, in 
 order to this giving heed to the word, the apostle suggests some things 
 that are of singular use to those who would attend to the scriptures to 
 any good purpose. 

 1. They must account and use the scripture as a light which God hath
 sent into and set up in the world, to dispel that darkness which is
 upon the face of the whole earth. The word is a lamp to the feet of
 those who use it aright; this discovers the way wherein men ought to
 walk; this is the means whereby we come to know the way of life. 

 2. They must acknowledge their own darkness. This world is a place of
 error and ignorance, and every man in the world is naturally without
 that knowledge which is necessary in order to attain eternal life. 

 3. If ever men are made wise to salvation, it is by the shining of the
 word of God into their hearts. Natural notions of God are not 
 sufficient for fallen man, who does at best actually know a great deal 
 less, and yet does absolutely need to know a great deal more, of God 
 than Adam did while he continued innocent. 

 4. When the light of the scripture is darted into the blind mind and
 dark understanding by the Holy Spirit of God, then the <I>spiritual day 
 dawns and the day-star arises in that soul.</I> This enlightening of a 
 dark benighted mind is like the day-break that improves and advances, 
 spreads and diffuses itself through the whole soul, till it makes 
 perfect day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.
 
 It is a growing knowledge; those who are this way enlightened never 
 think they know enough, till they come to know as they are known. To 
 give heed to this light must needs be the interest and duty of all; and 
 all who do truth come to this light, while evil-doers keep at a 
 distance from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle lays down one thing as previously necessary in order 
 to our giving heed to, and getting good by, the scriptures, and that is 
 the knowing that all prophecy is of divine origin. Now this important 
 truth he not only asserts, but proves.

 1. Observe, No scripture prophecy is of private interpretation (or a
 man's own proper opinion, an explication of his own mind), but the 
 revelation of the mind of God. This was the difference between the
 prophets of the Lord and the false prophets who have been in the world. 
 The prophets of the Lord did not speak nor do any thing of their own 
 mind, as Moses, the chief of them, says expressly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:28">Num. xvi. 28</A>),

 <I>I have not done any of the works</I> (nor delivered any of the
 statutes and ordinances) <I>of my own mind.</I> But false prophets 
 <I>speak a vision of their own heart, not out of the mouth of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:16">Jer. xxiii. 16</A>.

 The prophets and penmen of the scripture spoke and wrote what was the
 mind of God; and though, when under the influence and guidance of the 
 Spirit, it may well be supposed that they were willing to reveal and 
 record such thing, yet it is because God would have them spoken and 
 written. But though the scripture be not the effusion of man's own 
 private opinion or inclination, but the revelation of the mind and will 
 of God, yet every private man ought to search it, and come to 
 understand the sense and meaning thereof.

 2. This important truth of the divine origin of the scriptures (that
 what is contained in them is the mind of God and not of man) is to be 
 known and owned by all who will give heed to the sure word of prophecy. 
 That the scriptures are the word of God is not only an article of the 
 true Christian's faith, but also a matter of science or knowledge. As a 
 man not barely believes, but knows assuredly that that very person is 
 his particular friend in whom he sees all the proper, peculiar, 
 distinguishing marks and characters of his friend, so the Christian 
 knows that book to be the word of God in and upon which he sees all the 
 proper marks and characters of a divinely inspired book. He tastes a 
 sweetness, and feels a power, and sees a glory, in it truly divine. 

 3. The divinity of the scriptures must be known and acknowledged in
 the first place, before men can profitably use them, before they can 
 give good heed to them. To call off our minds from all other writings, 
 and apply them in a peculiar manner to these as the only certain and 
 infallible rule, necessarily requires our being fully persuaded that 
 these are divinely inspired, and contain what is truly the mind and 
 will of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Seeing it is so absolutely necessary that persons be fully 
 persuaded of the scripture's divine origin, the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 tells us how the Old Testament came to be compiled, and that, 

 1. Negatively: <I>It came not by the will of man.</I> Neither the
 things themselves that are recorded, and make up the several parts of 
 the Old Testament, are the opinions of men, nor was the will of any of 
 the prophets or penmen of the scriptures the rule or reason why any of 
 those things were written which make up the canon of the scripture. 

 2. Affirmatively: <I>Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the
 Holy Ghost.</I> Observe,

 (1.) They were holy men of God who were employed about that book which 
 we receive as the word of God. If Balaam and Caiaphas, and others who 
 were destitute of holiness, had any thing of the spirit of prophecy, 
 upon occasion, yet such persons were not employed to write any part of 
 the scriptures for the use of the church of God. All the penmen of the 
 scriptures were holy men of God.

 (2.) <I>These holy men were moved by the Holy Ghost</I> in what they 
 delivered as the mind and will of God. The Holy Ghost is the supreme
 agent, the holy men are but instruments.

 [1.] The Holy Ghost inspired and dictated to them what they were to 
 deliver of the mind of God.

 [2.] He powerfully excited and effectually engaged them to speak (and 
 write) what he had put into their mouths.

 [3.] He so wisely and carefully assisted and directed them in the 
 delivery of what they had received from him that they were effectually 
 secured from any the least mistake in expressing what they revealed; so 
 that the very words of scripture are to be accounted the words of the 
 Holy Ghost, and all the plainness and simplicity, all the power and 
 virtue, all the elegance and propriety, of the very words and 
 expressions are to be regarded by us as proceeding from God. Mix faith 
 therefore with what you find in the scriptures; esteem and reverence 
 your Bible as a book written by holy men, inspired, influenced, and 
 assisted by the Holy Ghost.</P>
