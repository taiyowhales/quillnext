 In this chapter we are directed to consider, 

 I. Some causes of contention, besides those mentioned in the foregoing
 chapter, and to watch against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. We are taught to abandon the friendship of this world, so as to
 submit and subject ourselves entirely to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:4-10">ver. 4-10</A>.

 III. All detraction and rash judgment of others are to be carefully
 avoided, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. We must preserve a constant regard, and pay the utmost deference to 
 the disposals of divine Providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13-17">ver. 13, to the end</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  From whence <I>come</I> wars and fightings among you? <I>come they</I>
 not hence, <I>even</I> of your lusts that war in your members?
 &nbsp; 2  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and
 cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask
 not.
 &nbsp; 3  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
 consume <I>it</I> upon your lusts.
 &nbsp; 4  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the
 friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore
 will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
 &nbsp; 5  Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
 dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
 &nbsp; 6  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
 the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
 &nbsp; 7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
 will flee from you.
 &nbsp; 8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse
 <I>your</I> hands, <I>ye</I> sinners; and purify <I>your</I> hearts, <I>ye</I> double
 minded.
 &nbsp; 9  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be
 turned to mourning, and <I>your</I> joy to heaviness.
 &nbsp; 10  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall
 lift you up.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former chapter speaks of envying one another, as the great spring 
 of strifes and contentions; this chapter speaks of a lust after worldly 
 things, and a setting too great a value upon worldly pleasures and 
 friendships, as that which carried their divisions to a shameful 
 height.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle here reproves the Jewish Christians for their wars, and 
 for their lusts as the cause of them: <I>Whence come wars and fightings 
 among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your 
 members,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Jews were a very seditious people, and had therefore frequent wars 
 with the Romans; and they were a very quarrelsome divided people, often 
 fighting among themselves; and many of those corrupt Christians against 
 whose errors and vices this epistle was written seem to have fallen in 
 with the common quarrels. Hereupon, our apostle informs them that the 
 origin of their wars and fightings was not (as they pretended) a true 
 zeal for their country, and for the honour of God, but that their 
 prevailing lusts were the cause of all. Observe hence, What is
 sheltered and shrouded under a specious pretence of zeal for God and 
 religion often comes from men's pride, malice, covetousness, ambition, 
 and revenge. The Jews had many struggles with the Roman power before 
 they ere entirely destroyed. They often unnecessarily embroiled 
 themselves, and then fell into parties and factions about the different 
 methods of managing their wars with their common enemies; and hence it 
 came to pass that, when their cause might be supposed good, yet their 
 engaging in it and their management of it came from a bad principle. 
 Their worldly and fleshly lusts raised and managed their wars and 
 fightings; but one would think here is enough said to subdue those 
 lusts; for, 

 1. They make a war within as well as fightings without. Impetuous
 passions and desires first war in their members, and then raise feuds 
 in their nation. There is war between conscience and corruption, and 
 there is war also between one corruption and another, and from these 
 contentions in themselves arose their quarrels with each other. Apply 
 this to private cases, and may we not then say of fightings and strifes 
 among relations and neighbours they come from those lusts which war in 
 the members? From lust of power and dominion, lust of pleasure, or lust 
 of riches, from some one or more of these lusts arise all the broils 
 and contentions that are in the world; and, since all wars and 
 fightings come from the corruptions of our own hearts, it is therefore 
 the right method for the cure of contention to lay the axe to the root, 
 and mortify those lusts that war in the members.

 2. It should kill these lusts to think of their disappointment: "<I>You
 lust, and have not; you kill, and desire to have, and cannot 
 obtain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 You covet great things for yourselves, and you think to obtain them by
 your victories over the Romans or by suppressing this and the other 
 party among yourselves. You think you shall secure great pleasures and 
 happiness to yourselves, by overthrowing every thing which thwarts your 
 eager wishes; but, alas! you are losing your labour and your blood,
 while you kill one another with such views as these." Inordinate 
 desires are either totally disappointed, or they are not to be appeased 
 and satisfied by obtaining the things desired. The words here rendered
 <I>cannot obtain</I> signify cannot gain the happiness sought after. 
 Note hence, Worldly and fleshly lusts are the distemper which will not 
 allow of contentment or satisfaction in the mind. 

 3. Sinful desires and affections generally exclude prayer, and the
 working of our desires towards God: "<I>You fight and war, yet you have 
 not, because you ask not.</I> You fight, and do not succeed, because 
 you do not pray you do not consult God in your undertakings, whether he 
 will allow of them or not; and you do not commit your way to him, and 
 make known your requests to him, but follow your own corrupt views and 
 inclinations: therefore you meet with continual disappointments;" or 
 else. 

 4. "Your lusts spoil your prayers, and make them an abomination to God,
 whenever you put them up to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may 
 consume it upon your lusts.</I>" As if it had been said, "Though 
 perhaps you may sometimes pray for success against your enemies, yet it 
 is not your aim to improve the advantages you gain, so as to promote 
 true piety and religion either in yourselves or others; but pride, 
 vanity, luxury, and sensuality, are what you would serve by your 
 successes, and by your very prayers. You want to live in great power 
 and plenty, in voluptuousness and a sensual prosperity; and thus you 
 disgrace devotion and dishonour God by such gross and base ends; and 
 therefore your prayers are rejected." Let us learn hence, in the 
 management of all our worldly affairs, and in our prayers to God for 
 success in them, to see that our ends be right. When men follow their 
 worldly business (suppose them tradesmen or husbandmen), and ask of God 
 prosperity, but do not receive what they ask for, it is because they 
 ask with wrong aims and intentions. They ask God to give them success 
 in their callings or undertakings; not that they may glorify their 
 heavenly Father and do good with what they have, but that they may 
 <I>consume it upon their lusts</I>--that they may be enabled to eat 
 better meat, and drink better drink, and wear better clothes, and so 
 gratify their pride, vanity, and voluptuousness. But, if we thus seek 
 the things of this world, it is just in God to deny them; whereas, if 
 we seek any thing that we may serve God with it, we may expect he will 
 either give us what we seek or give us hearts to be content without it, 
 and give opportunities of serving and glorifying him some other way.
 Let us remember this, that when we speed not in our prayers it is 
 <I>because we ask amiss;</I> either we do not ask for right ends or not 
 in a right manner, not with faith or not with fervency: unbelieving and 
 cold desires beg denials; and this we may be sure of, that, when our 
 prayers are rather the language of our lusts than of our graces, they 
 will return empty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have fair warning to avoid all criminal friendships with this 
 world: <I>You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the 
 friendship of the world is enmity with God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Worldly people are here called adulterers and adulteresses, because of 
 their perfidiousness of God, while they give their best affections to 
 the world. Covetousness is elsewhere called idolatry, and it is here 
 called adultery; it is a forsaking of him to whom we are devoted and 
 espoused, to cleave to other things; there is this brand put upon 
 worldly-mindedness--that it is enmity to God. A man may have a 
 competent portion of the good things of this life, and yet may keep 
 himself in the love of God; but he who sets his heart upon the world, 
 who places his happiness in it, and will conform himself to it, and do 
 any thing rather than lose its friendship, he is an enemy to God; it is 
 constructive treason and rebellion against God to set the world upon 
 his throne in our hearts. <I>Whosoever therefore is the friend of the 
 world is the enemy of God.</I> He who will act upon this principle, to 
 keep the smiles of the world, and to have its continual friendship, 
 cannot but show himself, in spirit, and in his actions too, an enemy to 
 God. <I>You cannot serve God and mammon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:24">Matt. vi. 24</A>.

 Hence arise wars and fightings, even from this adulterous idolatrous
 love of the world, and serving of it; for what peace can there be among
 men, so long as there is enmity towards God? or who can fight against
 God, and prosper? "Think seriously with yourselves what the spirit of
 the world is, and you will find that you cannot suit yourselves to it
 as friends, but it must occasion your being envious, and full of evil
 inclinations, as the generality of the world are. <I>Do you think that
 the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to
 envy?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The account given in the holy scriptures of the hearts of men by nature 
 is <I>that their imagination is evil, only evil, and that 
 continually,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5">Gen. vi. 5</A>.

 Natural corruption principally shows itself by envying, and there is a
 continual propensity to this. The spirit which naturally dwells in man 
 is always producing one evil imagination or another, always emulating 
 such as we see and converse with and seeking those things which are 
 possessed and enjoyed by them. Now this way of the world, affecting
 pomp and pleasure, and falling into strifes and quarrels for the sake 
 of these things, is the certain consequence of being friends to the 
 world; for there is no friendship without a oneness of spirit, and 
 therefore Christians, to avoid contentions, must avoid the friendship 
 of the world, and must show that they are actuated by nobler principles 
 and that a nobler spirit dwells in them; for, if we belong to God, he 
 gives more grace than to live and act as the generality of the world 
 do. The spirit of the world teaches men to be churls; God teaches them 
 to be bountiful. The spirit of the world teaches us to lay up, or lay 
 out, for ourselves, and according to our own fancies; God teaches us to 
 be willing to communicate to the necessities and to the comfort of 
 others, and so as to do good to all about us, according to our ability. 
 The grace of God is contrary to the spirit of the world, and therefore 
 the friendship of the world is to be avoided, if we pretend to be 
 friends of God yea, the grace of God will correct and cure the spirit 
 that naturally dwells in us; where he giveth grace, he giveth another 
 spirit than that of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are taught to observe the difference God makes between pride 
 and humility. <I>God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the 
 humble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This is represented as the language of scripture in the Old Testament; 
 for so it is declared in the book of <I>Psalms that God will save the 
 afflicted people</I> (if their spirits be suited to their condition), 
 <I>but will bring down high looks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:27">Ps. xviii. 27</A>);
 
 and in the book of Proverbs it is said, <I>He scorneth the scorners,
 and giveth grace unto the lowly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34">Prov. iii. 34</A>.

 Two things are here to be observed:--

 1. The disgrace cast upon the proud: God resists them; the original
 word, <B><I>antitassetai,</I></B> signifies, God's setting himself as 
 in battle array against them; and can there be a greater disgrace than 
 for God to proclaim a man a rebel, an enemy, a traitor to his crown and 
 dignity, and to proceed against him as such? The proud resists God; in 
 his understanding he resists the truths of God; in his will he resists 
 the truths of God; in his will he resists the laws of God; in his 
 passions he resists the providence of God; and therefore no wonder that 
 God sets himself against the proud. Let proud spirits hear this and 
 tremble--<I>God resists them.</I> Who can describe the wretched state 
 of those who make God their enemy? He will certainly fill with same 
 (sooner or later) the faces of such as have filled their hearts with 
 pride. We should therefore resist pride in our hearts, if we would not 
 have God to resist us.

 2. The honour and help God gives to the humble. Grace, as opposed to
 disgrace, is honour; this God gives to the humble; and, where God gives 
 grace to be humble, there he will give all other graces, and, as in the 
 beginning of this

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:6">sixth verse</A>,

 he will <I>give more grace.</I> Wherever God gives true grace, he will
 give more; for to him that hath, and useth what he hath aright, more 
 shall be given. He will especially give more grace to the humble,
 because they see their need of it, will pray for it and be thankful for 
 it; and such shall have it. For this reason,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are taught to submit ourselves entirely to God: <I>Submit 
 yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from 
 you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Christians should forsake the friendship of the world, and watch 
 against that envy and pride which they see prevailing in natural men, 
 and should by grace learn to glory in their submissions to God. "Submit 
 yourselves to him as subjects to their prince, in duty, and as one 
 friend to another, in love and interest. Submit your understandings to 
 the truths of God; submit your wills to the will of God, the will of 
 his precept, the will of his providence." We are subjects, and as such 
 must be submissive; not only through fear, but through love; <I>not 
 only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</I> "Submit yourselves 
 to God, as considering how many ways you are bound to this, and as 
 considering what advantage you will gain by it; for God will not hurt 
 you by his dominion over you, but will do you good." Now, as this 
 subjection and submission to God are what the devil most industriously 
 strives to hinder, so we ought with great care and steadiness to resist 
 his suggestions. If he would represent a tame yielding to the will and 
 providence of God as what will bring calamities, and expose to contempt 
 and misery, we must resist these suggestions of fear. If he would 
 represent submission to God as a hindrance to our outward ease, or 
 worldly preferments, we must resist these suggestions of pride and 
 sloth. If he would tempt us to lay any of our miseries, and crosses, 
 and afflictions, to the charge of Providence, so that we might avoid 
 them by following his directions instead of God's, we must resist these 
 provocations to anger, <I>not fretting ourselves in any wise to do 
 evil.</I> "Let not the devil, in these or the like attempts, prevail 
 upon you; but <I>resist him and he will flee from you.</I>" If we 
 basely yield to temptations, the devil will continually follow us; but 
 if we <I>put on the whole armour of God,</I> and stand it out against 
 him, he will be gone from us. Resolution shuts and bolts the door
 against temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We are directed how to act towards God, in our becoming submissive 
 to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 1. <I>Draw nigh to God.</I> The heart that has rebelled must be brought 
 to the foot of God; the spirit that was distant and estranged from a 
 life of communion and converse with God must become acquainted with 
 him: "<I>Draw nigh to God,</I> in his worship and institutions, and in 
 every duty he requires of you." 

 2. <I>Cleanse your hands.</I> He who comes unto God must have clean
 hands. Paul therefore directs to <I>lift up holy hands without wrath
 and doubting</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8">1 Tim. ii. 8</A>),

 hands free from blood, and bribes, and every thing that is unjust or 
 cruel, and free from every defilement of sin: he is not subject to God 
 who is a servant of sin. The hands must be cleansed by faith, 
 repentance, and reformation, or it will be in vain for us to draw nigh 
 to God in prayer, or in any of the exercises of devotion. 

 3. The hearts of the double-minded must be purified. Those who halt
 between God and the world are here meant by <I>the double-minded.</I> 
 To <I>purify the heart</I> is to be sincere, and to act upon this 
 single aim and principle, rather to please God than to seek after any 
 thing in this world: hypocrisy is heart-impurity; but those who submit 
 themselves to God aright will purify their hearts as well as cleanse 
 their hands. 

 4. <I>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep.</I> "What afflictions God
 sends take them as he would have you, and by duly sensible of them. Be 
 afflicted when afflictions are sent upon you, and do not despise them; 
 or be afflicted in your sympathies with those who are so, and in laying 
 to heart the calamities of the church of God. Mourn and weep for your
 own sins and the sins of others; times of contention and division are 
 times to mourn in, and the sins that occasion wars and fightings should 
 be mourned for. <I>Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy 
 to heaviness.</I>" This may be taken either as a prediction of sorrow 
 or a prescription of seriousness. Let men think to set grief at 
 defiance, yet God can bring it upon them; none laugh so heartily but he 
 can turn their laughter into mourning; and this the unconcerned 
 Christians James wrote to are threatened should be their case. They are 
 therefore directed, before things come to the worst, to lay aside their 
 vain mirth and their sensual pleasures, that they might indulge godly 
 sorrow and penitential tears.

 5. "<I>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord.</I> Let the inward
 acts of the soul be suitable to all those outward expressions of
 grief, affliction, and sorrow, before mentioned." Humility of spirit is 
 here required, as in the sight of him who looks principally at the 
 spirits of men. "Let there be a thorough humiliation in bewailing every 
 thing that is evil; let there be great humility in doing that which is 
 good: <I>Humble yourselves.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. We have great encouragement to act thus towards God: <I>He will 
 draw nigh to those that draw nigh to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>and he will lift up</I> those who humble themselves in his sight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Those that draw nigh to God in a way of duty shall find God drawing 
 nigh to them in a way of mercy. Draw nigh to him in faith, and trust, 
 and obedience, and he will draw nigh to you for your deliverance. If 
 there be not a close communion between God and us, it is our fault, and 
 not his. <I>He shall lift up the humble.</I> Thus much our Lord himself 
 declared, <I>He that shall humble himself shall be exalted,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:12">Matt. xxiii. 12</A>.

 If we be truly penitent and humble under the marks of God's
 displeasure, we shall in a little time know the advantages of his 
 favour; he will lift us up out of trouble, or he will lift us up in our 
 spirits and comforts under trouble; he will lift us up to honour and 
 safety in the world, or he will lift us up in our way to heaven, so as 
 to raise our hearts and affections above the world. <I>God will revive
 the spirit of the humble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:15">Isa. lvii. 15</A>),

 <I>He will hear the desire of the humble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>),

 and he will at last lift them up to glory. <I>Before honour is
 humility.</I> The highest honour in heaven will be the reward of the 
 greatest humility on earth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh
 evil of <I>his</I> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of
 the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
 not a doer of the law, but a judge.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the chapter,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are cautioned against the sin of evil-speaking: <I>Speak not evil 
 one of another, brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The Greek word, <B><I>katalaleite,</I></B> signifies speaking any thing 
 that may hurt or injure another; we must not speak evil things of 
 others, though they be true, unless we be called to it, and there be 
 some necessary occasion for it; much less must we report evil things
 when they are false, or, for aught we know, may be so. Our lips must be 
 guided by the law of kindness, as well as truth and justice. This, 
 which Solomon makes a necessary part of the character of his virtuous 
 woman, <I>that she openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is 
 the law of kindness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:26">Prov. xxxi. 26</A>),

 must needs be a part of the character of every true Christian. <I>Speak 
 not evil one of another,</I> 

 1. Because you are brethren. The compellation, as used by the apostle
 here, carries an argument along with it. Since Christians are brethren, 
 they should not defile nor defame one another. It is required of us 
 that we be tender of the good name of our brethren; where we cannot 
 speak well, we had better say nothing than speak evil; we must not take 
 pleasure in making known the faults of others, divulging things that 
 are secret, merely to expose them, nor in making more of their known 
 faults than really they deserve, and, least of all, in making false 
 stories, and spreading things concerning them of which they are 
 altogether innocent. What is this but to raise the hatred and
 encourage the persecutions of the world, against those who are engaged 
 in the same interests with ourselves, and therefore with whom we 
 ourselves must stand or fall? "Consider, you are brethren."

 2. Because this is to judge the law: <I>He that speaketh evil of his
 brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth 
 the law.</I> The law of Moses says, <I>Thou shalt not go up and down as 
 a tale-bearer among thy people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:16">Lev. xix. 16</A>.

 The law of Christ is, <I>Judge not, that you be not judged,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1">Matt. vii. 1</A>.

 The sum and substance of both is that men should love one another. A
 detracting tongue therefore condemns the law of God, and the
 commandment of Christ, when it is defaming its neighbour. To break
 God's commandments is in effect to speak evil of them, and to judge
 them, as if they were too strict, and laid too great a restraint upon
 us. The Christians to whom James wrote were apt to speak very hard
 things of one another, because of their differences about indifferent
 things (such as <I>the observance of meats and days,</I> as appears
 from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23">Rom. xiv.</A>):

 "Now," says the apostle, "he who censures and condemns
 his brother for not agreeing with him in those things which the law of
 God has left indifferent thereby censures and condemns the law, as if
 it had done ill in leaving them indifferent. He who quarrels with his
 brother, and condemns him for the sake of any thing not determined in
 the word of God, does thereby reflect on that word of God, as if it
 were not a perfect rule. Let us take heed of judging the law, for the
 law of the Lord is perfect; if men break the law, leave that to judge
 them; if they do not break it, let us not judge them." This is a
 heinous evil, because it is to forget our place, that we ought to be
 doers of the law, and it is to set up ourselves above it, as if we were
 to be judges of it. He who is guilty of the sin here cautioned against 
 is not a doer of the law, but a judge; he assumes an office and a place 
 that do not belong to him, and he will be sure to suffer for his 
 presumption in the end. Those who are most ready to set up for judges 
 of the law generally fail most in their obedience to it. 

 3. Because God, the Lawgiver, has reserved the power of passing the
 final sentence on men wholly to himself: <I>There is one Lawgiver, who 
 is able to save, and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Princes and states are not excluded, by what is here said, from making 
 laws; nor are subjects at all encouraged to disobey human laws; but God 
 is still to be acknowledged as the supreme Lawgiver, who only can give 
 law to the conscience, and who alone is to be absolutely obeyed. His 
 right to enact laws is incontestable, because he has such a power to 
 enforce them. He <I>is able to save, and to destroy,</I> so as no other 
 can. He has power fully to reward the observance of his laws, and to 
 punish all disobedience; he can save the soul, and make it happy for 
 ever, or he can, after he has killed, cast into hell; and therefore 
 should be feared and obeyed as the great Lawgiver, and all judgment 
 should be committed to him. Since there is one Lawgiver, we may infer 
 that it is not for any man or company of men in the world to pretend to 
 give laws immediately to bind conscience; for that is God's 
 prerogative, which must not be invaded. As the apostle had before 
 warned against being many masters, so here he cautions against being 
 many judges. Let us not prescribe to our brethren, let us not censure 
 and condemn them; it is sufficient that we have the law of God, which 
 is a rule to us all; and therefore we should not set up other rules.
 Let us not presume to set up our own particular notions and opinions as 
 a rule to all about us; for <I>there is one Lawgiver.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are cautioned against a presumptuous confidence of the 
 continuance of our lives, and against forming projects thereupon with 
 assurance of success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 The apostle, having reproved those who were judges and condemners of 
 the law, now reproves such as were disregardful of Providence: <I>Go to 
 now,</I> and old way of speaking, designed to engage attention; the 
 Greek word may be rendered, <I>Behold now,</I> or "<I>See, and 
 consider, you that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a 
 city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain.</I> 
 Reflect a little on this way of thinking and talking; call yourselves 
 to account for it." Serious reflection on our words and ways would show 
 us many evils that we are apt, through inadvertency, to run into and 
 continue in. There were some who said of old, as too many say still, 
 <I>We will go to such a city, and do this or that,</I> for such a term 
 of time, while all serious regards to the disposals of Providence were 
 neglected. Observe here, 

 1. How apt worldly and projecting men are to leave God out of their
 schemes. Where any are set upon earthly things, these have a strange
 power of engrossing the thoughts of the heart. We should therefore have
 a care of growing intent or eager in our pursuits after any thing here
 below. 

 2. How much of worldly happiness lies in the promises men make to
 themselves beforehand. Their heads are full of fine visions, as to what 
 they shall do, and be, and enjoy, in some future time, when they can 
 neither be sure of time nor of any of the advantages they promise 
 themselves; therefore observe, 

 3. How vain a thing it is to look for any thing good in futurity,
 without the concurrence of Providence. <I>We will go to such a
 city</I> (say they), perhaps to Antioch, or Damascus, or Alexandria, 
 which were then the great places for traffic; but how could they be 
 sure, when they set out, that they should reach any of these cities? 
 Something might possibly stop their way, or call them elsewhere, or cut 
 the thread of life. Many who have set out on a journey have gone to 
 their long home, and never reached their journey's end. But, suppose 
 they should reach the city they designed, how did they know they should 
 continue there? Something might happen to send them back, or to call
 them thence, and to shorten their stay. Or suppose they should stay the 
 full time they proposed, yet they could not be certain that they should 
 buy and sell there; perhaps they might lie sick there, or they might 
 not meet with those to trade with them that they expected. Yea, suppose 
 they should go to that city, and continue there a year, and should buy 
 and sell, yet they might not get gain; getting of gain in this world is 
 at best but an uncertain thing, and they might probably make more 
 losing bargains than gainful ones. And then, as to all these
 particulars, the frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to 
 check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of such projectors for 
 futurity: <I>What is your life? It is even a vapour that appeareth for 
 a little time, and then vanisheth away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 God that wisely left us in the dark concerning future events, and even 
 concerning the duration of life itself. We <I>know not what shall be on 
 the morrow;</I> we may know what we intend to do and to be, but a 
 thousand things may happen to prevent us. We are not sure of life 
 itself, since it is but as a <I>vapour,</I> something in appearance, 
 but nothing solid nor certain, easily scattered and gone. We can fix
 the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we 
 cannot fix the certain time of a vapour's being scattered; such is our 
 life: <I>it appears but for a little time, and then vanisheth away;</I> 
 it vanisheth as to this world, but there is a life that will continue 
 in the other world; and, since this life is so uncertain, it concerns 
 us all to prepare and lay up in store for that to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are taught to keep up a constant sense of our dependence on the 
 will of God for life, and all the actions and enjoyments of it: <I>You 
 ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or 
 that,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The apostle, having reproved them for what was amiss, now directs them 
 how to be and do better: "You ought to say it in your hearts at all 
 times, and with your tongues upon proper occasions, especially in your 
 constant prayers and devotions, that if the Lord will give leave, and 
 if he will own and bless you, you have such and such designs to 
 accomplish." This must be said, not in a slight, formal, and customary 
 way, but so as to think what we say, and so as to be reverent and 
 serious in what we say. It is good to express ourselves thus when we 
 have to do with others, but it is indispensably requisite that we 
 should say this to ourselves in all that we go about. <B><I>Syn
 Theo</I></B>--<I>with the leave and blessing of God,</I> was used by 
 the Greeks in the beginning of every undertaking. 

 1. <I>If the Lord will, we shall live.</I> We must remember that our
 times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God; we live as
 long as God appoints, and in the circumstances God appoints, and
 therefore must be submissive to him, even as to life itself; and then,
 
 2. <I>If the Lord will, we shall do this or that.</I> All our actions
 and designs are under the control of Heaven. Our heads may be filled 
 with cares and contrivances. This and the other thing we may propose
 to do for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence 
 sometimes breaks all our measures, and throws our schemes into 
 confusion. Therefore both our counsels for action and our conduct in
 action should be entirely referred to God; all we design and all we do 
 should be with a submissive dependence on God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are directed to avoid vain boasting, and to look upon it not 
 only as a weak, but a very evil thing. <I>You rejoice in your 
 boastings; all such rejoicing is evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They promised themselves life and prosperity, and great things in the 
 world, without any just regard to God; and then they boasted of these 
 things. Such is the joy of worldly people, to boast of all their 
 successes, yea, often to boast of their very projects before they know 
 what success they shall have. How common is it for men to boast of 
 things which they have no other title to than what arises from their 
 own vanity and presumption! <I>Such rejoicing</I> (says the apostle) 
 <I>is evil;</I> it is foolish and it is hurtful. For men to boast of 
 worldly things, and of their aspiring projects, when they should be
 attending to the humbling duties before laid down (in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>),

 is a very evil thing. It is a great sin in God's account, it will bring
 great disappointment upon themselves, and it will prove their 
 destruction in the end. If we rejoice in God that our times are in his 
 hand, that all events are at his disposal, and that he is our God in 
 covenant, this rejoicing is good; the wisdom, power, and providence of 
 God, are then concerned to make all things work together for our good: 
 but, if we rejoice in our own vain confidences and presumptuous boasts, 
 this is evil; it is an evil carefully to be avoided by all wise and 
 good men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We are taught, in the whole of our conduct, to act up to our own 
 convictions, and, whether we have to do with God or men, to see that we 
 never go contrary to our own knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is 
 sin;</I> it is aggravated sin; it is sinning with a witness; and it is 
 to have the worst witness against his own conscience. Observe, 

 1. This stands immediately connected with the plain lesson of saying,
 <I>If the Lord will, we shall do this or that;</I> they might be ready 
 to say, "This is a very obvious thing; who knows not that we all depend 
 upon almighty God <I>for life, and breath, and all things?</I>" 
 Remember then, if you do know this, whenever you act unsuitably to such 
 a dependence, that <I>to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to 
 him it is sin,</I> the greater sin. 

 2. Omissions are sins which will come into judgment, as well as
 commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well 
 as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. 
 Let us therefore take care that conscience be rightly informed, and 
 then that it be faithfully and constantly obeyed; for, if <I>our own 
 hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God;</I> but if 
 we say, <I>We see,</I> and do not act suitably to our sight, then 
 <I>our sin remaineth,</I>
