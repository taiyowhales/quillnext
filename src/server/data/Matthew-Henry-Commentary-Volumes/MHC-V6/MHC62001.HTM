 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
 we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
 hands have handled, of the Word of life;
 &nbsp; 2  (For the life was manifested, and we have seen <I>it,</I> and bear
 witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the
 Father, and was manifested unto us;)
 &nbsp; 3  That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that
 ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship
 <I>is</I> with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 4  And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be
 full.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle omits his name and character (as also the author to the 
 Hebrews does) either out of humility, or as being willing that the 
 Christian reader should be swayed by the light and weight of the things 
 written rather than by the name that might recommend them. And so he 
 begins,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With an account or character of the Mediator's person. He is the 
 great subject of the gospel, the foundation and object of our faith and 
 hope, the bond and cement that unite us unto God. He should be well 
 known; and he is represented here, 
 
 1. <I>As the Word of life,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 In the gospel these two are disjoined, and he is called first <I>the 
 Word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>,

 and afterwards <I>Life,</I> intimating, withal, that he is
 <I>intellectual life. In him was life, and that life was</I> 
 (efficiently and objectively) <I>the light of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:4">John i. 4</A>.

 Here both are conjoined: <I>The Word of life,</I> the vital Word. In
 that he is the Word, it is intimated that he is the Word of some person 
 or other; and that is God, even the Father. <I>He is the Word of 
 God,</I> and so he is intimated to issue from the Father, as truly 
 (though not in the same manner) as a word (or speech, which is a train
 of words) from a speaker. But he is not a mere vocal word, a bare 
 <B><I>logos prophorikos,</I></B> but a vital one: <I>the Word of 
 life,</I> the living word; and thereupon,

 2. <I>As eternal life.</I> His duration shows his excellency. He was
 from eternity; and so is, in scripture-account, necessary, essential,
 uncreated life. That the apostle speaks of his eternity, <I>&agrave;
 parte ante</I> (as they say) and as <I>from everlasting,</I> seems
 evident in that he speaks of him as he was in and from the beginning;
 when he was then with the Father, before his manifestation to us, yea,
 before the making of all things that were made; as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:2,3">John i. 2, 3</A>.

 So that he is the eternal, vital, intellectual Word of the eternal
 living Father.

 3. <I>As life manifested</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 manifested in the flesh, manifested to us. The eternal life would
 assume mortality, would put on flesh and blood (in the entire human 
 nature), and so dwell among us and converse with us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.

 Here were condescension and kindness indeed, that eternal life (a
 person of eternal essential life) should come to visit mortals, and to 
 procure eternal life for them, and then confer it on them!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With the evidences and convictive assurances that the apostle and 
 his brethren had of the Mediator's presence and converse in this world. 
 There were sufficient demonstrations of the reality of his abode here, 
 and of the excellency and dignity of his person in the way of his 
 manifestation. <I>The life, the word of life, the eternal life,</I> as 
 such, could not be seen and felt; but the life manifested might be, and 
 was so. The life was clothed with flesh, put on the state and habit of 
 abased human nature, and as such gave sensible proof of its existence 
 and transactions here. The divine life, or Word incarnate, presented 
 and evinced itself to the very senses of the apostles. As, 

 1. To their ears: <I>That which we have heard,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1,3"><I>v.</I> 1, 3</A>.

 The life assumed a mouth and tongue, that he might utter words of life. 
 The apostles not only heard of him, but they heard him himself. Above 
 three years might they attend his ministry, be auditors of his public 
 sermons and private expositions (for he expounded them in his house), 
 and be charmed with the words of him who spoke as never man spoke 
 before or since. The divine word would employ the ear, and the ear 
 should be devoted to the word of life. And it was meet that those who 
 were to be his representatives and imitators to the world should be 
 personally acquainted with his ministrations. 

 2. To their eyes: <I>That which we have seen with our eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 The Word would become visible, would not only be heard, but seen, seen 
 publicly, privately, at a distance and at nearest approach, which may 
 be intimated in the expression, <I>with our eyes</I>--with all the use 
 and exercise that we could make of our eyes. We saw him in his life and 
 ministry, saw him in his transfiguration on the mount, hanging, 
 bleeding, dying, and dead, upon the cross, and we saw him after his 
 return from the grave and resurrection from the dead. His apostles must 
 be eye-witnesses as well as ear-witnesses of him. <I>Wherefore, of 
 these men that have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord 
 Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John, 
 must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21,22">Acts i. 21, 22</A>.

 <I>And we were eye-witnesses of his majesty,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16">2 Pet. i. 16</A>.

 3. To their internal sense, to the eyes of their mind; for so
 (possibly) may the next clause be interpreted: <I>Which we have looked 
 upon.</I> This may be distinguished from the foregoing perception, 
 <I>seeing with the eyes;</I> and may be the same with what the apostle 
 says in his gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:14"><I>ch.</I> i. 14</A>),

 <I>And we beheld</I>--<B><I>etheasametha,</I></B> <I>his glory, the
 glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.</I> The word is not 
 applied to the immediate object of the eye, but to that which was 
 rationally collected from what they saw. "What we have well discerned, 
 contemplated, and viewed, what we have well known of this Word of life, 
 we report to you." The senses are to be the informers of the mind. 

 4. To their hands and sense of feeling: <I>And our hands have
 handled</I> (touched and felt) <I>of the Word of life.</I> This surely 
 refers to the full conviction our Lord afforded his apostles of the 
 truth, reality, solidity, and organization of his body, after his 
 resurrection from the dead. When he showed them his hands and his side, 
 it is probable that he gave them leave to touch him; at least, he knew 
 of Thomas's unbelief, and his professed resolution too not to believe, 
 till he had found and felt the places and signatures of the wounds by 
 which he died. Accordingly at the next congress he called Thomas, in
 the presence of the rest, to satisfy the very curiosity of his 
 unbelief. And probably others of them did so too. <I>Our hands have 
 handled of the Word of life.</I> The invisible life and Word was no 
 despiser of the testimony of sense. Sense, in its place and sphere, is 
 a means that God has appointed, and the Lord Christ has employed, for 
 our information. Our Lord took care to satisfy (as far as might be) all 
 the senses of his apostles, that they might be the more authentic 
 witnesses of him to the world. Those that apply all this to the hearing 
 of the gospel lose the variety of sensations here mentioned, and the 
 propriety of the expressions, as well as the reason of their 
 inculcation and repetition here: <I>That which we have seen and heard 
 declare we unto you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The apostles could not be deceived in such long and various exercise of 
 their sense. Sense must minister to reason and judgment; and reason and 
 judgment must minister to the reception of the Lord Jesus Christ and 
 his gospel. The rejection of the Christian revelation is at last 
 resolved into the rejection of sense itself. <I>He upbraided them with 
 their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not those 
 who had seen him after he had risen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:14">Mark xvi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With a solemn assertion and attestation of these grounds and 
 evidences of the Christian truth and doctrine. The apostles publish 
 these assurances for our satisfaction: <I>We bear witness, and show 
 unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It became the apostles to open to the disciples the evidence by which 
 they were led, the reasons by which they were constrained to proclaim 
 and propagate the Christian doctrine in the world. Wisdom and integrity 
 obliged them to demonstrate that it was not either private fancy or a 
 cunningly-devised fable that they presented to the world. Evident truth 
 would open their mouths, and force a public profession. <I>We cannot 
 but speak the things which we have seen and heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>.

 It concerned the disciples to be well assured of the truth of the
 institution they had embraced. They should see the evidences of their 
 holy religion. It fears not the light, nor the most judicious 
 examination. It is able to afford rational conviction and solid 
 persuasion of mind and conscience. <I>I would that you knew what great 
 conflict</I> (or concern of mind) <I>I have for you, and for those at 
 Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, that 
 their hearts might be knit together in love, and unto all riches of 
 full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery 
 of God, even of the Father, and of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1,2">Col. ii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. With the reason of the apostle's exhibiting and asserting this 
 summary of sacred faith, and this breviate of evidence attending it. 
 This reason is twofold:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the believers of it may be advanced to the same happiness with 
 them (with the apostles themselves): <I>That which we have seen and 
 heard declare we unto you, that you may have fellowship with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The apostle means not personal fellowship nor consociation in the same 
 church-administrations, but such as is consistent with personal 
 distance from each other. It is communion with heaven, and in blessings 
 that come thence and tend thither. "This we declare and testify, that 
 you may share with us in our privileges and happiness." Gospel spirits 
 (or those that are made happy by gospel grace) would fain have others 
 happy too. We see, also, there is a fellowship or communion that runs 
 through the whole church of God. There may be some personal 
 distinctions and peculiarities, but there is a communion (or common 
 participation of privilege and dignity) belonging to all saints, from 
 the highest apostle to the lowest believer. As there is the same 
 precious faith, there are the same precious promises dignifying and 
 crowning that faith and the same precious blessings and glories 
 enriching and filling those promises. Now that believers may be 
 ambitious of this communion, that they may be instigated to retain and 
 hold fast the faith that is the means of such communion, that the 
 apostles also may manifest their love to the disciples in assisting 
 them to the same communion with themselves, they indicate what it is 
 and where it is: <I>And truly our fellowship</I> (or communion) <I>is 
 with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ.</I> We have communion with 
 the Father, and with the Son of the Father (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:3">2 John 3</A>,

 he is most emphatically styled) in our happy relation to them, in our
 receiving heavenly blessings from them, and in our spiritual converse 
 with them. We have now such supernatural conversation with God and the
 Lord Christ as is an earnest and foretaste of our everlasting abode 
 with them, and enjoyment of them, in the heavenly glory. See to what 
 the gospel revelation tends--to advance us far above sin and earth and 
 to carry us to blessed communion with the Father and the Son. See for 
 what end the eternal life was made flesh--that he might advance us to 
 eternal life in communion with the Father and himself. See how far 
 those live beneath the dignity, use, and end of the Christian faith and 
 institution, who have not spiritual blessed communion with the Father 
 and his Son Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That believers may be enlarged and advanced in holy joy: <I>And 
 these things write we unto you that your joy may be full,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The gospel dispensation is not properly a dispensation of fear, sorrow, 
 and dread, but of peace and joy. Terror and astonishment may well 
 attend mount Sinai, but exultation and joy mount Zion, where appears 
 <I>the eternal Word, the eternal life,</I> manifested in our flesh. The 
 mystery of the Christian religion is directly calculated for the joy of 
 mortals. It should be joy to us that the eternal Son should come to 
 seek and save us, that he has made a full atonement for our sins, that 
 he has conquered sin and death and hell, that he lives as our 
 Intercessor and Advocate with the Father, and that he will come again 
 to perfect and glorify his persevering believers. And therefore those 
 live beneath the use and end of the Christian revelation who are not 
 filled with spiritual joy. Believers should rejoice in their happy 
 relation to God, as his sons and heirs, his beloved and adopted,--in 
 their happy relation to the Son of the Father, as being members of his 
 beloved body, and coheirs with himself,--in the pardon of their sins, 
 the sanctification of their natures, the adoption of their persons, and 
 the prospect of grace and glory that will be revealed at the return of 
 their Lord and head from heaven. Were they confirmed in their holy 
 faith, how would they rejoice! <I>The disciples were filled with joy, 
 and with the Holy Ghost,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having declared the truth and dignity of the author of the 
 gospel, brings a message or report from him, from which a just 
 conclusion is to be drawn for the consideration and conviction of the 
 professors of religion, or professed entertainers of this glorious 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the message or report that the apostle avers to come from 
 the Lord Jesus: <I>This then is the message which we have heard of 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 of his Son Jesus Christ. As he was the immediate sender of the 
 apostles, so he is the principal person spoken of in the preceding 
 context, and the next antecedent also to whom the pronoun <I>him</I> 
 can relate. The apostles and apostolical ministers are the messengers 
 of the Lord Jesus; it is their honour, the chief they pretend to, to 
 bring his mind and messages to the world and to the churches. This is 
 the wisdom and present dispensation of the Lord Jesus, to send his 
 messages to us by persons like ourselves. He that put on human nature 
 will honour earthen vessels. It was the ambition of the apostles to be 
 found faithful, and faithfully to deliver the errands and messages they 
 had received. What was communicated to them they were solicitous to 
 impart: <I>This then is the message which we have heard of him, and 
 declare unto you.</I> A message from the Word of life, from the eternal 
 Word, we should gladly receive: and the present one is this (relating 
 to the nature of God whom we are to serve, and with whom we should 
 covet all indulged communion)--<I>That God is light, and in him is no 
 darkness at all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This report asserts the excellency of the divine nature. He is all that 
 beauty and perfection that can be represented to us by light. He is a 
 self-active uncompounded spirituality, purity, wisdom, holiness, and 
 glory. And then the absoluteness and fulness of that excellency and 
 perfection. There is no defect or imperfection, no mixture of any
 thing alien or contrary to absolute excellency, no mutability nor 
 capacity of any decay in him: <I>In him is no darkness at all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Or this report may more immediately relate to what is usually called 
 the moral perfection of the divine nature, what we are to imitate, or 
 what is more directly to influence us in our gospel work. And so it 
 will comprehend the holiness of God, the absolute purity of his nature 
 and will, his penetrative knowledge (particularly of hearts), his 
 jealousy and injustice, which burn as a most bright and vehement flame.
 It is meet that to this dark world the great God should be represented 
 as pure and perfect light. It is the Lord Jesus that best of all opens 
 to us the name and nature of the unsearchable God: <I>The 
 only-begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, the same hath 
 declared him.</I> It is the prerogative of the Christian revelation to 
 bring us the most noble, the most august and agreeable account of the 
 blessed God, such as is most suitable to the light of reason and what 
 is demonstrable thereby, most suitable to the magnificence of his works 
 round about us, and to the nature and office of him that is the supreme 
 administrator, governor, and judge of the world. What more (relating to 
 and comprehensive of all such perfection) could be included in one word 
 than in this, <I>God is light, and in him is no darkness at all?</I> 
 Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There is a just conclusion to be drawn from this message and 
 report, and that for the consideration and conviction of professors of 
 religion, or professed entertainers of this gospel. This conclusion 
 issues into two branches:--

 1. For the conviction of such professors as have no true fellowship
 with God: <I>If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
 darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.</I> It is known that to walk, 
 in scripture account, is to order and frame the course and actions of 
 the moral life, that is, of the life so far as it is capable of 
 subjection to the divine law. <I>To walk in darkness</I> is to live and 
 act according to such ignorance, error, and erroneous practice, as are 
 contrary to the fundamental dictates of our holy religion. Now there 
 may be those who may pretend to great attainments and enjoyments in 
 religion; they may profess to have communion with God; and yet their 
 lives may be irreligious, immoral, and impure. To such the apostle 
 would not fear to give the lie: <I>They lie, and do not the truth.</I> 
 They belie God; for he holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with 
 unholy souls. What communion hath light with darkness? They belie 
 themselves, or lie concerning themselves; for they have no such 
 communications from God nor accesses to him. There is no truth in their 
 profession nor in their practice, or their practice gives their 
 profession and pretences the lie, and demonstrates the folly and 
 falsehood of them. 

 2. For the conviction and consequent satisfaction of those that are
 near to God: <I>But, if we walk in the light, we have fellowship one 
 with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from 
 all sin.</I> As the blessed God is the eternal boundless light, and the 
 Mediator is, from him, the light of the world, so the Christian 
 institution is the great luminary that appears in our sphere, and 
 shines here below. A conformity to this in spirit and practice 
 demonstrates fellowship or communion with God. Those that so walk show
 that they know God, that they have received of the Spirit of God, and 
 that the divine impress or image is stamped upon their souls. <I>Then
 we have fellowship one with another,</I> they with us and we with them, 
 and both with God, in his blessed or beatific communications to us. And 
 this is one of those beatific communications to us--that his Son's 
 blood or death is applied or imputed to us: <I>The blood of Jesus 
 Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</I> The eternal life, the 
 eternal Son, hath put on flesh and blood, and so became Jesus Christ.
 Jesus Christ hath shed his blood for us, or died to wash us from our 
 sins in his own blood. His blood applied to us discharges us from the 
 guilt of all sin, both original and actual, inherent and committed: and 
 so far we stand righteous in his sight; and not only so, but his blood 
 procures for us those sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued 
 more and more, till it is quite abolished,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 I. The apostle, having supposed that even those of this heavenly 
 communion have yet their sin, proceeds here to justify that 
 supposition, and this he does by showing the dreadful consequences of 
 denying it, and that in two particulars:--

 1. <I>If we say, We have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
 not in us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 We must beware of deceiving ourselves in denying or excusing our sins. 
 The more we see them the more we shall esteem and value the remedy. 
 <I>If we deny them, the truth is not in us,</I> either the truth that 
 is contrary to such denial (we lie in denying our sin), or the truth of 
 religion, is not in us. The Christian religion is the religion of 
 sinners, of such as have sinned, and in whom sin in some measure still 
 dwells. The Christian life is a life of continued repentance,
 humiliation for and mortification of sin, of continual faith in, 
 thankfulness for, and love to the Redeemer, and hopeful joyful 
 expectation of a day of glorious redemption, in which the believer 
 shall be fully and finally acquitted, and sin abolished for ever. 

 2. <I>If we say, We have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word
 is not in us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 The denial of our sin not only deceives
 ourselves, but reflects dishonour upon God. It challenges his veracity.
 He has abundantly testified of, and testified against, the sin of the 
 world. <I>And the Lord said in his heart</I> (determined thus with 
 himself), <I>I will not again curse the ground</I> (as he had then 
 lately done) <I>for man's sake; for</I> (or, with the learned bishop 
 Patrick, <I>though) the imagination of man's heart is evil from his 
 youth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>.

 But God has given his testimony to the continued sin and sinfulness of 
 the world, by providing a sufficient effectual sacrifice for sin, that 
 will be needed in all ages, and to the continued sinfulness of 
 believers themselves by requiring them continually to confess their 
 sins, and apply themselves by faith to the blood of that sacrifice. And 
 therefore, if we say either that we have not sinned or do not yet sin, 
 <I>the word of God is not in us,</I> neither in our minds, as to the 
 acquaintance we should have with it, nor in our hearts, as to the 
 practical influence it should have upon us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle then instructs the believer in the way to the continued 
 pardon of his sin. Here we have, 

 1. His duty in order thereto: <I>If we confess our sins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Penitent confession and acknowledgment of sin are the believer's 
 business, and the means of his deliverance from his guilt. And, 

 2. His encouragement thereto, and assurance of the happy issue. This is
 the veracity, righteousness, and clemency of God, to whom he makes such 
 confession: <I>He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to 
 cleanse us from all unrighteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God is faithful to his covenant and word, wherein he has promised 
 forgiveness to penitent believing confessors. He is just to himself and 
 his glory who has provided such a sacrifice, by which his righteousness 
 is declared in the justification of sinners. He is just to his Son who 
 has not only sent him for such service, but promised to him that those 
 who come through him shall be forgiven on his account. <I>By his 
 knowledge</I> (by the believing apprehension of him) <I>shall my 
 righteous servant justify many,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.

 He is clement and gracious also, and so will forgive, to the contrite
 confessor, all his sins, cleanse him from the guilt of all 
 unrighteousness, and in due time deliver him from the power and 
 practice of it.</P>
