 In this chapter the apostle continues his discourse upon the priesthood 
 of Christ, a sweet subject, which he would not too soon dismiss. And 
 here, 

 I. He explains the nature of the priestly office in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The proper and regular call there must be to this office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 III. The requisite qualifications for the work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 IV. The peculiar order of the priesthood of Christ; it was not after
 the order of Aaron, but of Melchisedec, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:6,7,10">ver. 6, 7, 10</A>.

 V. He reproves the Hebrews, that they had not made those improvements
 in knowledge which might have made them capable of looking into the 
 more abstruse and mysterious parts of scripture, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
 men in things <I>pertaining</I> to God, that he may offer both gifts
 and sacrifices for sins:
 &nbsp; 2  Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
 out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
 infirmity.
 &nbsp; 3  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
 himself, to offer for sins.
 &nbsp; 4  And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
 called of God, as <I>was</I> Aaron.
 &nbsp; 5  So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high
 priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I
 begotten thee.
 &nbsp; 6  As he saith also in another <I>place,</I> Thou <I>art</I> a priest for
 ever after the order of Melchisedec.
 &nbsp; 7  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
 and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was
 able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
 &nbsp; 8  Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
 which he suffered;
 &nbsp; 9  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
 salvation unto all them that obey him;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the nature of the priestly office in 
 general, though with an accommodation to the Lord Jesus Christ. We are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of what kind of beings the high priest must be. He must be taken 
 from among men; he must be a man, one of ourselves, bone of our bones, 
 flesh of our flesh, and spirit of our spirits, a partaker of our 
 nature, and a standard-bearer among ten thousand. This implies, 

 1. That man had sinned. 

 2. That God would not admit sinful man to come to him immediately and 
 alone, without a high priest, who must be taken from among men. 

 3. That God was pleased to take one from among men, by whom they might
 approach God in hope, and he might receive them with honour.

 4. That every one shall now be welcome to God that comes to him by this
 his priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For whom every high priest is ordained: <I>For men in things 
 pertaining to God,</I> for the glory of God and the good of men, that 
 he might come between God and man. So Christ did; and therefore let us 
 never attempt to go to God but through Christ, nor expect any favour 
 from God but through Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For what purpose every high priest was ordained: <I>That he might 
 offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he might offer gifts or free-will offerings, brought to the 
 high priest, so offered for the glory of God, and as an acknowledgment 
 that our all is of him and from him; we have nothing but what he is 
 pleased to give us, and of his own we offer to him an oblation of 
 acknowledgment. This intimates, 

 (1.) That all we bring to God must be free and not forced; it must be a 
 gift; it must be given and not taken away again. 

 (2.) That all we bring to God must go through the high priest's hands, 
 as the great agent between God and man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he might offer sacrifices for sin; that is, the offerings that 
 were appointed to make atonement, that sin might be pardoned and 
 sinners accepted. Thus Christ is constituted a high priest for both 
 these ends. Our good deeds must be presented by Christ, to render 
 ourselves and them acceptable; and our evil deeds must be expiated by 
 the sacrifice of himself, that they may not condemn and destroy us. And 
 now, as we value acceptance with God and pardon, we must apply 
 ourselves by faith to this our great high priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How this high priest must be qualified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must be one that can have compassion on two sorts of 
 persons:--

 (1.) <I>On the ignorant,</I> or those that are guilty of sins of
 ignorance. He must be one who can find in his heart to pity them, and 
 intercede with God for them, one that is willing to instruct those that 
 are dull of understanding. 

 (2.) <I>On those that are out of the way,</I> out of the way of truth, 
 duty, and happiness; and he must be one who has tenderness enough to 
 lead them back from the by-paths of error, sin, and misery, into the 
 right way: this will require great patience and compassion, even the 
 compassion of a God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He must also be compassed with infirmity; and so be able from 
 himself feelingly to consider our frame, and to sympathize with us. 
 Thus Christ was qualified. He took upon him our sinless infirmities; 
 and this gives us great encouragement to apply ourselves to him under 
 every affliction; for in all the afflictions of his people he is 
 afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How the high priest was to be called of God. He must have both an 
 internal and external call to his office: <I>For no man taketh this 
 honour to himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that is, no man ought to do it, no man can do it legally; if any does 
 it, he must be reckoned a usurper, and treated accordingly. Here 
 observe, 

 1. The office of the priesthood was a very great honour. To be employed
 to stand between God and man, one while representing God and his will 
 to men, at another time representing man and his case to God, and 
 dealing between them about matters of the highest importance--entrusted 
 on both sides with the honour of God and the happiness of man--must 
 render the office very honourable. 

 2. The priesthood is an office and honour that no man ought to take to
 himself; if he does, he can expect no success in it, nor any reward for 
 it, only from himself. He is an intruder who is not called of God, as 
 was Aaron. Observe,

 (1.) God is the fountain of all honour, especially true spiritual 
 honour. He is the fountain of true authority, whether he calls any to 
 the priesthood in an extraordinary way, as he did Aaron, or in an 
 ordinary way, as he called his successors. 

 (2.) Those only can expect assistance from God, and acceptance with 
 him, and his presence and blessing on them and their administrations, 
 that are called of God; others may expect a blast instead of a 
 blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. How this is brought home and applied to Christ: <I>So Christ 
 glorified not himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Observe here, Though Christ reckoned it his glory to be made a high 
 priest, yet he would not assume that glory to himself. He could truly 
 say, <I>I seek not my own glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:50">John viii. 50</A>.

 Considered as God, he was not capable of any additional glory, but as
 man and Mediator he did not run without being sent; and, if he did not, 
 surely others should be afraid to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The apostle prefers Christ before Aaron, both in the manner of his 
 call and in the holiness of his person. 

 1. In the manner of his call, in which God said unto him, <I>Thou art
 my Son, this day have I begotten thee</I> (quoted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>),

 referring to his eternal generation as God, his wonderful conception as 
 man, and his perfect qualification as Mediator. Thus God solemnly 
 declared his dear affection to Christ, his authoritative appointment of 
 him to the office of a Mediator, his installment and approbation of him 
 in that office, his acceptance of him, and of all he had done or should 
 do in the discharge of it. Now God never said thus to Aaron. Another 
 expression that God used in the call of Christ we have in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:4">Ps. cx. 4</A>,

 <I>Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God the Father appointed him a priest of a higher order than that of 
 Aaron. The priesthood of Aaron was to be but temporary; the priesthood 
 of Christ was to be perpetual: the priesthood of Aaron was to be 
 successive, descending from the fathers to the children; the priesthood 
 of Christ, after the order of Melchisedec, was to be personal, and the 
 high priest immortal as to his office, without descent, having neither 
 beginning of days nor end of life, as it is more largely described in 
 the seventh chapter, and will be opened there. 

 2. Christ is here preferred to Aaron in the holiness of his person.
 Other priests were to offer up sacrifices, as for the <I>sins of 
 others, so for themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 But Christ needed not to offer for sins for himself, <I>for he had done 
 no violence,</I> neither was there <I>any deceit in his mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>.

 And such a high priest became us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. We have an account of Christ's discharge of this his office, and 
 of the consequences of that discharge, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The discharge of his office of the priesthood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and 
 supplications,</I> &c. Here observe, 

 (1.) He took to him flesh, and for some days tabernacled therein; he 
 became a mortal man, and reckoned his life by days, herein setting us 
 an example how we should reckon ours. Were we to reckon our lives by
 days, it would be a means to quicken us to do the work of every day in 
 its day. 

 (2.) Christ, in the days of his flesh, subjected himself to death; he 
 hungered, he was a tempted, bleeding, dying Jesus! He body is now in 
 heaven, but it is a spiritual glorious body. 

 (3.) God the Father was able to save him from death. He could have 
 prevented his dying, but he would not; for then the great design of his 
 wisdom and grace must have been defeated. What would have become of us 
 if God had saved Christ from dying? The Jews reproachfully said, <I>Let 
 him deliver him now, if he will have him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:43">Matt. xxvii. 43</A>.
 
 But it was in kindness to us that the Father would not suffer that
 bitter cup to pass away from him; for then we must have drunk the dregs 
 of it, and been miserable for ever. 

 (4.) Christ, in the days of his flesh, offered up prayers and
 supplications to his Father, as an earnest of his intercession in 
 heaven. A great many instances we have of Christ's praying. This refers 
 to his prayer in his agony

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:39,27:46">Matt. xxvi. 39,
 and <I>ch.</I> xxvii. 46</A>),

 and to that before his agony 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">John xvii.</A>)

 which he put up for his disciples, and all who should believe on his
 name. 

 (5.) The prayers and supplications that Christ offered up were joined 
 with strong cries and tears, herein setting us an example not only to 
 pray, but to be fervent and importunate in prayer. How many dry 
 prayers, how few wet ones, do we offer up to God! 

 (6.) Christ was heard in that he feared. How? Why he was answered by 
 present supports in and under his agonies, and in being carried well 
 through death, and delivered from it by a glorious resurrection: He 
 <I>was heard in that he feared.</I> He had an awful sense of the wrath 
 of God, of the weight of sin. His human nature was ready to sink under 
 the heavy load, and would have sunk, had he been quite forsaken in 
 point of help and comfort from God; but he was heard in this, he was 
 supported under the agonies of death. He was carried through death;
 and there is no real deliverance from death but to be carried well 
 through it. We may have many recoveries from sickness, but we are never 
 saved from death till we are carried well through it. And those that 
 are thus saved from death will be fully delivered at last by a glorious 
 resurrection, of which the resurrection of Christ was the earnest and 
 first-fruits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The consequences of this discharge of his office,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By these his sufferings <I>he learned obedience, though he was a 
 Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 [1.] The privilege of Christ: <I>He was a Son;</I> the only-begotten of 
 the Father. One would have thought this might have exempted him from 
 suffering, but it did not. Let none then who are the children of God by 
 adoption expect an absolute freedom from suffering. <I>What Son is he 
 whom the Father chasteneth not?</I>

 [2.] Christ made improvement by his sufferings. By his passive 
 obedience, he learned active obedience; that is, he practiced that 
 great lesson, and made it appear that he was well and perfectly learned 
 in it; though he never was disobedient, yet he never performed such an 
 act of obedience as when he became obedient to death, even to the death 
 of the cross. Here he has left us an example, that we should learn by
 all our afflictions a humble obedience to the will of God. We need 
 affliction, to teach us submission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By these his sufferings he was made perfect, and became the author 
 of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 [1.] Christ by his sufferings was consecrated to his office, 
 consecrated by his own blood.

 [2.] By his sufferings he consummated that part of his office which was 
 to be performed on earth, making reconciliation for iniquity; and in 
 this sense he is said to be <I>made perfect,</I> a perfect 
 propitiation. 

 [3.] Hereby he has become the author of eternal salvation to men; he 
 has by his sufferings purchased a full deliverance from sin and misery, 
 and a full fruition of holiness and happiness for his people. Of this 
 salvation he has given notice in the gospel; he has made a tender of it 
 in the new covenant, and has sent the Spirit to enable men to accept 
 this salvation.

 [4.] This salvation is actually bestowed on none but those who obey 
 Christ. It is not sufficient that we have some doctrinal knowledge of 
 Christ, or that we make a profession of faith in him, but we must 
 hearken to his word, and obey him. He is exalted to be a prince to rule 
 us, as well as a Saviour to deliver us; and he will be a Saviour to 
 none but to those whom he is a prince, and who are willing that he 
 should reign over them; the rest he will account his enemies, and treat 
 them accordingly. But to those who obey him, devoting themselves to 
 him, denying themselves, and taking up their cross, and following him, 
 he will be the author, <B><I>aitios</I></B>--the grand cause of their 
 salvation, and they shall own him as such for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
 &nbsp; 11  Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
 seeing ye are dull of hearing.
 &nbsp; 12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
 that one teach you again which <I>be</I> the first principles of the
 oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not
 of strong meat.
 &nbsp; 13  For every one that useth milk <I>is</I> unskilful in the word of
 righteousness: for he is a babe.
 &nbsp; 14  But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,
 <I>even</I> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
 discern both good and evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle returns to what he had in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:6;Ps+110:4"><I>v.</I> 6
 cited out of Ps. cx.</A>,

 concerning the peculiar order of the priesthood of Christ, that is, the
 order of Melchisedec. And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He declares he had many things which he could say to them concerning this mysterious person called Melchisedec, whose priesthood was eternal, and therefore the salvation procured thereby should be eternal also. We have a more particular account of
 this Melchisedec in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:1-28"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>.

 Some think the things which the apostle means, that were hard to be 
 uttered, were not so much concerning Melchisedec himself as concerning 
 Christ, of whom Melchisedec was the type. And doubtless this apostle 
 had many things to say concerning Christ that were very mysterious, 
 hard to be uttered; there are great mysteries in the person and offices 
 of the Redeemer; Christianity is the great mystery of godliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assigns the reason why he did not say all those things 
 concerning Christ, our Melchisedec, that he had to say, and what it was 
 that made it so difficult for him to utter them, namely, the dulness of 
 the Hebrews to whom he wrote: <I>You are dull of hearing.</I> There is 
 a difficulty in the things themselves, and there may be a weakness in 
 the ministers of the gospel to speak clearly about these things; but 
 generally the fault is in the hearers. Dull hearers make the preaching 
 of the gospel a difficult thing, and even many who have some faith are 
 but dull hearers, dull of understanding and slow to believe; the 
 understanding is weak, and does not apprehend these spiritual things; 
 the memory is weak, and does not retain them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He insists upon the faultiness of this infirmity of theirs. It was 
 not a mere natural infirmity, but it was a sinful infirmity, and more 
 in them than others, by reason of the singular advantages they had 
 enjoyed for improving in the knowledge of Christ: <I>For when, for the 
 time, you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again 
 which are the first principles of the oracles of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What proficiency might have been reasonably expected from these 
 Hebrews--that they might have been so well instructed in the doctrine of
 the gospel as to have been teachers of others. Hence learn, 

 (1.) God takes notice of the time and helps we have for gaining 
 scripture-knowledge. 

 (2.) From those to whom much is given much is expected. 

 (3.) Those who have a good understanding in the gospel should be 
 teachers of other, if not in a public, yet in a private station.

 (4.) None should take upon them to be teachers of others, but those who 
 have made a good improvement in spiritual knowledge themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe the sad disappointment of those just expectations: <I>You 
 have need that one should teach you again,</I> &c. Here note, 

 (1.) In the oracles of God there are some first principles, plain to be
 understood and necessary to be learned. 

 (2.) There are also deep and sublime mysteries, which those should 
 search into who have learned the first principles, that so they may 
 stand complete in the whole will of God. 

 (3.) Some persons, instead of going forward in Christian knowledge, 
 forget the very first principles that they had learned long ago; and 
 indeed those that are not improving under the means of grace will be 
 losing. 

 (4.) It is a sin and shame for persons that are men for their age and 
 standing in the church to be children and babes in understanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle shows how the various doctrines of the gospel must be 
 dispensed to different persons. There are in the church babes and 
 persons of full age 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>),

 and there are in the gospel milk and strong meat. Observe, 

 1. Those that are babes, unskillful in the word of righteousness, must
 be fed with milk; they must be entertained with the plainest truths, 
 and these delivered in the plainest manner; <I>there must be line upon 
 line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:10">Isa. xxviii. 10</A>.

 Christ despises not his babes; he has provided suitable food for them. 
 It is good to be babes in Christ, but not always to continue in that 
 childish state; we should endeavor to pass the infant state; we should 
 always remain in malice children, but in understanding we should grow 
 up to a manly maturity.

 2. There is strong meat for those that are of full age,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The deeper mysteries of religion belong to those that are of a higher
 class in the school of Christ, who have learned the first principles 
 and well improved them; so that by reason of use they have their senses 
 exercised to discern both good and evil, duty and sin, truth and error. 
 Observe,

 (1.) There have been always in the Christian state children, young men, 
 and fathers. 

 (2.) Every true Christian, having received a principle of spiritual 
 life from God, stands in need of nourishment to preserve that life. 
 
 (3.) The word of God is food and nourishment to the life of grace: 
 <I>As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may 
 grow thereby.</I> 

 (4.) It is the wisdom of ministers rightly to divide the word of truth, 
 and to give to every one his portion--milk to babes, and strong meat to 
 those of full age. 

 (5.) There are spiritual senses as well as those that are natural.
 There is a spiritual eye, a spiritual appetite, a spiritual taste; the 
 soul has its sensations as well as the body; these are much depraved 
 and lost by sin, but they are recovered by grace.

 (6.) It is by use and exercise that these senses are improved, made 
 more quick and strong to taste the sweetness of what is good and true, 
 and the bitterness of what is false and evil. Not only reason and 
 faith, but spiritual sense, will teach men to distinguish between what 
 is pleasing and what is provoking to God, between what is helpful and 
 what is hurtful to our own souls.</P>
