 much expectation, and many enquiries, the last volume of the late
 reverend Mr. Henry's Exposition now appears in the world. The common 
 disadvantages that attend posthumous productions will doubtless be 
 discerned in this; but we hope, though there are diversities of gifts, 
 there will be found to be the same spirit. Some of the relations and 
 hearers of that excellent person have been at the pains of transcribing 
 the notes they took in short-hand of this part of the holy scripture, 
 when expounded by him in his family or in the congregation; they have 
 furnished us with very good materials for the finishing of this great 
 work, and we doubt not but that the ministers who have been concerned 
 in it have made that use of those assistances which may entitle this 
 composure to the honour of Mr. Henry's name; and, if so, they can very 
 willingly conceal their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The New Testament may be very properly divided into two parts, the one 
 <I>historical</I> the other <I>epistolary.</I> It is the exposition of 
 the latter we now recommend, and shall offer some thoughts on the 
 epistolary way of writing in general, and then proceed to observe the 
 divine authority of these epistles, together with the style, matter, 
 method, and design of them, leaving what might be said concerning the 
 several inspired penmen to the prefaces appertaining to the particular 
 epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the epistolary way of writing, it may be sufficient to observe 
 that it has usually three properties:--It may in some things be more 
 <I>difficult</I> to be understood, but then it is very 
 <I>profitable,</I> and very <I>pleasant;</I> these will be found to be 
 the properties of these sacred letters. We shall meet with things not 
 easy to be understood, especially in some parts of them, where we 
 cannot so well discover the particular occasions on which they were 
 written or the questions or matters of fact to which they refer; but 
 this is abundantly compensated by the profit which will accrue to those 
 that read them with due attention. They will find the strongest 
 reasoning, the most moving expostulations, and warm and pressing 
 exhortations, mixed with seasonable cautions and reproofs, which are 
 all admirably fitted to impress the mind with suitable sentiments and 
 affections. And how much solid pleasure and delight must this afford to 
 persons of a serious and religious spirit, especially when they wisely 
 and faithfully apply to themselves what they find to suit their case! 
 Thus they will appear to be as truly written to them as if their names 
 were superscribed on them. It is natural for us to be very much pleased 
 in perusing a wise and kind letter, full of instruction and comfort, 
 sent to us by an absent friend: how then should we prize this part of 
 holy scripture, when we consider herein that our God and Saviour has 
 written these letters <I>to us,</I> in which we have the great things 
 of his law and gospel, the things that belong to our peace! By these 
 means not only the holy apostles, <I>being dead, yet speak,</I> but the 
 Lord of the prophets and apostles continues to speak and write to us; 
 and while we read them with proper affections, and follow them with 
 suitable petitions and thanksgivings, a blessed correspondence and 
 intercourse will be kept up between heaven and us, while we are yet 
 sojourners in the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But it is the divine inspiration and authority of these epistles we are 
 especially concerned to know; and it is of the last importance that in 
 this our minds be fully established. And we have strong and clear 
 evidence that these epistles were written by the apostles of our Lord 
 Jesus, and that they (like the prophets of the Old Testament) spoke and 
 wrote <I>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</I> These epistles have 
 in all ages of the church been received by Christians as a part of 
 those holy scriptures that are <I>given by inspiration of God, and are 
 profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for 
 instruction in righteousness, and are able to make us wise to salvation 
 through faith which is in Jesus Christ;</I> they are part of that 
 perpetual universal rule of faith and life which contains doctrines and 
 revelations we are bound to believe with a divine faith, as coming from 
 the God of truth, and duties to be practised by us in obedience to the 
 will of God, <I>acknowledging that the things written therein are the 
 commandments of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:37">1 Cor. xiv. 37</A>.

 And, for the same reasons that lead us to acknowledge the other parts
 of the Bible to be the word of God, we must own these to be so too. If 
 there is good reason (as indeed there is) to believe that the books of 
 Moses were written by inspiration of God, there is the same reason to 
 believe that the writings of the prophets were also from God, because 
 the law and the prophets speak the same things, and such things as none 
 but the Holy Ghost could teach; and, if we must with a divine faith 
 believe the Old Testament to be a revelation from God, we cannot with 
 any good reason question the divine authority of the New, when we 
 consider how exactly the histories of the one agree with the prophecies 
 of the other, and how the dark types and shadows of the law are 
 illustrated and accomplished in the gospel. Nor can any person who 
 pretends to believe the divine authority of the historical part of the 
 New Testament, containing the Gospels and the Acts, with good reason 
 question the equal authority of the epistolary part; for the 
 subject-matter of all these epistles, as well as of the sermons of the 
 apostles, is the <I>word of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:17,1Th+2:13,Col+1:25">Rom. x. 17; 
 1 Thess. ii. 13; Col. i. 25</A>),
 
 and the <I>gospel of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16,2Co+11:7">Rom. xv. 16; 2 Cor. xi. 7</A>),
 
 and the <I>gospel of Christ</I>, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12">2 Cor. ii. 12</A>.

 We <I>are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus 
 Christ himself being the chief corner-stone;</I> and, as Moses wrote of 
 Christ, so did all the prophets, for the Spirit of Christ in them did 
 testify of him. And the apostles confirmed what Christ himself began to 
 teach, <I>God also bearing them witness with signs, and wonders, and 
 divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his 
 will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3,4">Heb. ii. 3, 4</A>.

 The manifestation of God in the flesh, and the things <I>he began both 
 to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up,</I> together 
 with his sufferings unto death, and his resurrection (which things are 
 declared to us, and are firmly to be believed, and strictly regarded by 
 us), do give us an ample account of the way of life and salvation by 
 Jesus Christ; but still it was the will of our blessed Lord that his 
 apostles should not only publish his gospel to all the world, but also 
 that, after his resurrection, they should declare some things more 
 plainly concerning him than he thought fit to do while he was here on 
 earth, for which end he promised to send his Holy Spirit <I>to teach 
 them all things, to bring all things to their remembrance which he had 
 spoken unto them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>.
 
 For he told them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:12,13">John xvi. 12, 13</A>),

 <I>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now; 
 but when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall lead you into all 
 truth, and shall show you things to come.</I> Accordingly we find there 
 was a wonderful effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles (who in 
 these epistles are called the <I>servants, ambassadors, and 
 ministers</I> of Christ, <I>and stewards of the mysteries of God</I>), 
 under whose infallible guidance they preached the gospel, and declared 
 the whole counsel of God, and that with amazing courage and success, 
 Satan every where falling down before them like lightning from heaven.
 That in preaching the gospel they were under the influence of the 
 infallible Spirit is undeniable, from the miraculous gifts and powers 
 they received for their work, particularly that gift of tongues so 
 necessary for the publication of the gospel throughout the world to 
 nations of different languages; nor must we omit that mighty power that 
 accompanied the word preached, bringing multitudes to the obedience of 
 faith, notwithstanding all opposition from earth and hell, and the 
 potent lusts in the hearts of those who were <I>turned from idols to 
 serve the living God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he 
 raised from the dead, even Jesus, that delivered us from the wrath to 
 come.</I> Now that they were under the same mighty influence in writing 
 these epistles as in preaching cannot be denied. Such infallible 
 assistance seems to be as needful at least to direct their writing as 
 their preaching, considering that these epistles were written to keep 
 in memory those things that had been delivered by word of mouth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:15">2 Pet. i. 15</A>),

 and to rectify the mistakes that might arise about some expressions 
 that had been used in preaching 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2">2 Thess. ii. 2</A>),

 and were to remain as a standing rule and record to which believers 
 were to appeal, for defending the truth and discovering error, and a 
 proper means to transmit the truths of the gospel to posterity, even to 
 the end of time. Besides, the writers of these epistles have declared 
 that what they wrote was from God: now they must know whether they had 
 the special assistance of the divine Spirit or no, in their writing as 
 well as preaching; and they in all things appear to have been men of 
 such probity that they would not dare to say they had the Spirit of God 
 when they had it not, or if they so much as doubted whether they had it 
 or not; yea, they are careful, when they speak their own private 
 opinion, or only under some common influence, to tell the world that 
 not the <I>Lord,</I> but <I>they,</I> spoke those things, but that in 
 the rest it was not they but the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:10,12">1 Cor. vii. 10, 12</A>,

 &c. And the apostle Paul makes the acknowledgment of this their 
 inspiration to be a test to try those that pretended to be prophets or 
 spiritual: <I>Let them</I> (says he) <I>acknowledge that the things I 
 write unto you are the commandments of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:37">1 Cor. xiv. 37</A>.

 And the apostle Peter gives this as the reason of his writing, that
 those he wrote to <I>might after his decease have those things always 
 in remembrance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:15">2 Pet. i. 15</A>),

 which afterwards he calls <I>the commandment of the apostles of the
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:1,2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1, 2</A>),

 and so of the Lord himself. And the apostles John declareth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:6">1 John iv. 6</A>),

 <I>We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God 
 heareth not us; by this we know the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of 
 error.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the style of these epistles, though it be necessary we should 
 believe a divine influence superintending the several writers of them, 
 yet it is not easy to explain the manner of it, nor to determine 
 whether and in what particulars the words they wrote were dictated to 
 them by the Holy Spirit, as mere <I>amanuenses,</I> or how far their 
 own memories, and reasoning faculties, and other natural or acquired 
 endowments, were employed under the inspection of the Spirit. We must 
 believe that these holy men spoke and wrote <I>as they were moved by 
 the Holy Ghost,</I> that he put them on and assisted them in this work. 
 It is very probable that sometimes he not only suggested the very 
 thoughts in their minds, but put words into their mouths, and always 
 infallibly guided them into all truth, both when they expounded the 
 scriptures of the Old Testament and when they gave rules for our faith 
 and practice in the gospel church state. And yet perhaps it may be 
 allowed, without any diminution to the authority of these epistles, 
 that the penmen of them made some use of their own reasoning powers and 
 different endowments in their manner of writing, as well as of their 
 different sorts of chirography; and that by this we are to account for 
 that difference of style which has been observed between the writings 
 of Paul, who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and those of Peter 
 and John, who were fishermen. The like difference may be discerned 
 between the style of the prophet Isaiah, who was educated in a court, 
 and that of Amos, who was one of the herdsmen of Tekoa. However, the 
 best way to understand these scriptures aright is not to criticise too 
 nicely upon the words and phrases, but to attend carefully to the drift 
 and design of these inspired writers in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>subject-matter</I> of these epistles is entirely conformable to 
 the rest of the scriptures. In them we find frequent reference to some 
 passages of the Old Testament, and explanations of them: in the epistle 
 to the Hebrews we have the best exposition of the Levitical law. Indeed 
 the New Testament refers to, and in a manner builds upon, the Old, 
 showing the accomplishment of all the ancient promises and prophecies 
 concerning the Messiah, and explains all the antiquated types and 
 <I>shadows of the good things that were then to come.</I> But, besides 
 these references to the preceding part of holy writ, in some of these 
 epistles there are contained prophecies, either wholly new or at least 
 more largely and plainly revealed, as that in the <I>Revelation</I> 
 concerning the rise, reign, and fall of antichrist, of which great 
 apostasy we have some account in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3,4">2 Thess. ii. 3, 4</A>,
 
 and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1-3">1 Tim. iv. 1-3</A>.

 And in these epistles we have several of the great doctrines of the
 gospel more fully discussed than elsewhere, particularly the doctrine 
 of original sin, of the sin that dwells in the regenerate, and of 
 justification by the righteousness of Christ, of the abolishing of the 
 Jewish rites and ceremonies, of the true nature and design of the seals 
 of the new covenant, the obligations they bring us under, and their 
 perpetual use in the Christian church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The general method of these epistles is such as best serves the end or 
 design of them, which is indeed the end of the whole 
 scripture--practical godliness, out of a principle of divine love, a 
 good conscience, and faith unfeigned. Accordingly most of the epistles 
 begin with the great doctrines of the gospel, the articles of the 
 Christian faith, which, when received, work by love, purify the 
 conscience, and produce evangelical obedience; and, after these 
 principles have been laid down, practical conclusions are drawn and 
 urged from them. In taking this method there is a regard paid to the 
 nature and faculties of the soul of man (where the understanding is to 
 lead the way, the will, affections, and executive powers, to follow 
 after), and to the nature of religion in general, which is a reasonable 
 service. We are not to be determined by superstitious fancies, nor by 
 blind passions, but by a sound judgment and good understanding in the 
 mind and will of God. By this we are taught how necessary it is that 
 faith and practice, truth and holiness, be joined together, that the 
 performance of moral duties will never be acceptable to God, nor 
 available to our own salvation, without the belief of the truth, since 
 those who make shipwreck of the faith seldom maintain a good 
 conscience, and the most solemn profession of the faith will never save 
 those that <I>hold the truth in unrighteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The particular occasions upon which these epistles were written do not 
 so evidently appear in them all as in some. The first to the 
 Corinthians seems to have taken its rise from the unhappy divisions 
 that so early rose in the churches of Christ, through the emulation of 
 the ministers and personal affections of the people; but it does not 
 confine itself to that subject. That to the Galatians seems directed 
 chiefly against those judaizing teachers that went about to draw the 
 Gentile converts away from the simplicity of the gospel in doctrine and 
 worship. The epistle to the Hebrews is manifestly calculated to wean 
 the converted Jews from those Mosaical rites and ceremonies for which 
 they retained too great a fondness, and to reconcile them to the 
 abolition of that economy. Those epistles that are directed to 
 particular persons more evidently carry their design in them, which he 
 that runs may read. But this is certain, none of these epistles are of 
 private interpretation. Most of the psalms and of the prophecies of the 
 Old Testament were penned or pronounced on particular occasions, and 
 yet they are of standing and universal use, and very instructive even 
 to us upon whom the ends of the world have come. And so are those 
 epistles that seem to have been most limited in the rise and occasion 
 of them. There will always be need enough to warn Christians against 
 uncharitable divisions, against corrupting the faith and worship of the 
 gospel; and, whenever the case is the same, these epistles are as 
 certainly directed to such churches and persons as if they had been 
 inscribed to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These general observations, we suppose, may be sufficient to introduce 
 the reader into the book itself; let us now take a short view of the 
 whole work, of which this posthumous piece is the conclusion. It is now 
 about fourteen years since the first part of this exposition of the 
 Bible was made public. In five years' time the Old Testament was 
 finished in four volumes. The first volume of the New Testament was 
 longer in hand; for though the ever-memorable author was always fully 
 employed in the ordinary work of his ministry, yet those last years of 
 his life, in which he drew up the exposition upon the historical part 
 of the New Testament, were less at his own command than any other had 
 been. His removal to Hackney, his almost continual preaching from day 
 to day, his journeys to Chester, and the necessity of more frequent 
 visits to his friends in and about London, together with a gradual 
 sensible decay of health, will more than excuse the three years' time 
 that passed before that was finished. And under such difficulties none 
 but a man of his holy zeal, unwearied industry, and great sagacity, 
 could have gone through such a service in that space of time. He lived 
 not to see that volume published, though left by him ready for the 
 press. The church of God was suddenly deprived of one of the most 
 useful ministers of the age. We have been gathering up the fragments of 
 those feasts with which he used to entertain his family and friends, in 
 his delightful work of opening the scriptures. What remains is that we 
 recommend the whole of this work to the acceptance and blessing of our 
 God and Saviour, to whose honour and interest it was from the first 
 directed and devoted. We need not be very solicitous about the 
 acceptance it may meet with in the world: what has been before 
 published has been received and read with great pleasure and advantage 
 by the most serious experienced Christians in Great Britain and 
 Ireland; and the many loud calls there have been for the publishing of 
 this supplement, and reprinting the whole, leave us no room to doubt 
 but that it will meet with a hearty welcome. Though it must be 
 acknowledged that we live in an age which by feeding upon ashes and the 
 wind, has very much lost the relish of every thing that is spiritual 
 and evangelical, yet we persuade ourselves there will still be found 
 many who, <I>by reason of use, have, their senses exercised to discern 
 both good and evil.</I> Those that may think the expository notes too 
 long, especially for family worship, may easily relieve themselves, 
 either by reading a less part of the chapter at one time, or by 
 abridging the annotations, and perusing the rest when they have more 
 leisure; for, though it must be owned they are somewhat copious, yet we 
 are persuaded that those who peruse them seriously will find nothing in 
 them superfluous or impertinent; and, if any where some things in the 
 comment do not seem to flow so naturally and necessarily from the text, 
 we believe when they are well considered and compared it will appear 
 they come under the analogy and general reason of the subject, and 
 truly belong to it. If there be any that think this exposition of the 
 Bible is too plain and familiar, that it wants the beauties of oratory 
 and the strength of criticism, we only wish that they will read it over 
 again with due attention, and we are pretty confident they will find 
 the style natural, clear, and comprehensive; and we think they will 
 hardly be able to produce one valuable criticism out of the most 
 learned commentators but they will have it in this exposition, though 
 couched in plain terms, and not brought in as of a critical nature. No 
 man was more happy than Mr. Henry in that useful talent of making dark 
 things plain, while too many, that value themselves upon their 
 criticising faculty, affect rather to make plain things dark.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But we leave this great and good work to speak for itself, and doubt 
 not but it will grow in its use and esteem, and will, through the 
 blessing of God, help to revive and promote family religion and 
 scriptural knowledge, and support the credit of scripture commentaries,
 though couched in human expressions. These have been always accounted 
 the great treasures of the church, and when done with judgment, have 
 been so far from lessening the authority of the Bible that they have 
 greatly promoted its honour and usefulness.</P>
