 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONCERNING</FONT>

 this epistle we must enquire,

 I. Into the divine authority of it; for this has been questioned by
 some, whose distempered eyes could not bear the light of it, or whose 
 errors have been confuted by it; such as the Arians, who deny the 
 Godhead and self-existence of Christ; and the Socinians, who deny his 
 satisfaction; but, after all the attempts of such men to disparage this 
 epistle, the divine original of it shines forth with such strong and 
 unclouded rays that he who runs may read it is an eminent part of the 
 canon of scripture. The divinity of the matter, the sublimity of the 
 style, the excellency of the design, the harmony of this with other 
 parts of scripture, and its general reception in the church of God in 
 all ages--these are the evidences of its divine authority.

 II. As to the divine amanuensis or penman of this epistle, we are not
 so certain; it does not bear the name of any in the front of it, as the 
 rest of the epistles do, and there has been some dispute among the 
 learned to whom they should ascribe it. Some have assigned it to 
 Clemens of Rome; other to Luke; and many to Barnabas, thinking that the 
 style and manner of expression is very agreeable to the zealous, 
 authoritative, affectionate temper that Barnabas appears to be of, in 
 the account we have of him in the acts of the Apostles; and one ancient 
 father quotes an expression out of this epistle as the words of 
 Barnabas. But it is generally assigned to the apostle Paul; and some 
 later copies and translations have put Paul's name in the title. In the 
 primitive times it was generally ascribed to him, and the style and 
 scope of it very well agree with his spirit, who was a person of a 
 clear head and a warm heart, whose main end and endeavour it was to 
 exalt Christ. Some think that the apostle Peter refers to this epistle, 
 and proves Paul to be the penman of it, by telling the Hebrews, to whom 
 he wrote, of Paul's having written to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15">2 Pet. iii. 15</A>.

 We read of no other epistle that he ever wrote to them but this. And
 though it has been objected that, since Paul put his name to all his 
 other epistles, he would not have omitted it here; yet others have well 
 answered that he, being the apostle of the Gentiles, who were odious to 
 the Jews, might think fit to conceal his name, lest their prejudices 
 against him might hinder them from reading and weighing it as they 
 ought to do.

 III. As to the scope and design of this epistle, it is very evident
 that it was clearly to inform the minds, and strongly to confirm the 
 judgment, of the Hebrews in the transcendent excellency of the gospel 
 above the law, and so to take them off from the ceremonies of the law, 
 to which they were so wedded, of which they were so fond, that they 
 even doted on them, and those of them who were Christians retained too 
 much of the old leaven, and needed to be purged from it. The design of
 this epistle was to persuade and press the believing Hebrews to a 
 constant adherence to the Christian faith, and perseverance in it, 
 notwithstanding all the sufferings they might meet with in so doing. In 
 order to this, the apostle speaks much of the excellency of the author 
 of the gospel, the glorious Jesus, whose honour he advances, and whom 
 he justly prefers before all others, showing him to be all in all, and 
 this in lofty strains of holy rhetoric. It must be acknowledged that 
 there are many things in this epistle hard to be understood, but the 
 sweetness we shall find therein will make us abundant amends for all 
 the pains we take to understand it. And indeed, if we compare all the 
 epistles of the New Testament, we shall not find any of them more 
 replenished with divine, heavenly matter than this to the Hebrews.</P>
