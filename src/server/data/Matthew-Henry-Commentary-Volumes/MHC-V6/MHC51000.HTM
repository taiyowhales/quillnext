 was a considerable city of Phrygia, and probably not far from Laodicea 
 and Hierapolis; we find these mentioned together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:13">iv. 13</A>.

 It is now buried in ruins, and the memory of it chiefly preserved in
 this epistle. The design of the epistle is to warn them of the danger 
 of the Jewish zealots, who pressed the necessity of observing the 
 ceremonial law; and to fortify them against the mixture of the Gentile 
 philosophy with their Christian principles. He professes a great 
 satisfaction in their stedfastness and constancy, and encourages them 
 to perseverance. It was written about the same time with the epistles
 to the Ephesians and Philippians, A.D. 62, and in the same place, while 
 he was now a prisoner at Rome. He was not idle in his confinement, and 
 the word of God was not bound.</P>

 This epistle, like that to the Romans, was written to those he had 
 never seen, nor had any personal acquaintance with. The church planted 
 at Colosse was not by Paul's ministry, but by the ministry of Epaphras 
 or Epaphroditus, an evangelist, one whom he delegated to preach the 
 gospel among the Gentiles; and yet, 

 I. There was a flourishing church at Colosse, and one which was eminent 
 and famous among the churches. One would have thought none would have
 come to be flourishing churches but those which Paul himself had 
 planted; but here was a flourishing church planted by Epaphras. God is 
 sometimes pleased to make use of the ministry of those who are of less 
 note, and lower gifts, for doing great service to his church. God uses 
 what hands he pleases, and is not tied to those of note, that the 
 <I>excellence of the power may appear to be of God and not of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:7">2 Cor. iv. 7</A>.

 II. Though Paul had not the planting of this church, yet he did not 
 therefore neglect it; nor, in writing his epistles, does he make any 
 difference between that and other churches. The Colossians, who were 
 converted by the ministry of Epaphras, were as dear to him, and he was 
 as much concerned for their welfare, as the Philippians, or any others 
 who were converted by his ministry. Thus he put an honour upon an
 inferior minister, and teaches us not to be selfish, nor think all that 
 honour lost which goes beside ourselves. We learn, in his example, not 
 to think it a disparagement to us to water what others have planted, or 
 build upon the foundation which others have laid: as he himself, as a 
 <I>wise master-builder, laid the foundation, and another built 
 thereon,</I>
