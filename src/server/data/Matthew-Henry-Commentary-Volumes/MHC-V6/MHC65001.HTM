 We have here, 

 I. An account of the penman of this epistle, a character of the church,
 the blessings and privileges of that happy society,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The occasion of writing this epistle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. A character of evil and perverse men, who had already sprung up in
 that infant state of the church, and would be succeeded by others of
 the like evil spirit and temper in after-times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:4">ver. 4</A>.

 IV. A caution against hearkening to and following after such, from the
 severity of God towards the unbelieving murmuring Israelites at their 
 coming out of Egypt, the angels that fell, the sin and punishment of 
 Sodom and Gomorrah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 V. To these the apostle likens the seducers against whom he was warning
 them, and describes them at large, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:8-10">ver. 8 to 13</A>,

 inclusive).

 VI. Then (as specially suitable to his argument) he cites an ancient
 prophecy of Enoch foretelling and describing the future judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 VII. He enlarges on the seducers' character, and guards against the
 offence which honest minds might be apt to take at the so early 
 permission of such things, by showing that it was foretold long before 
 that so it must be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>.

 VIII. Exhorts them to perseverance in the faith, fervency in prayer,
 watchfulness against falling from the love of God, and a lively hope of 
 eternal life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.

 IX. Directs them how to act towards the erroneous and scandalous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.
 
 And,

 X. Closes with an admirable doxology in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24,25">last two verses.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
 them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
 Jesus Christ, <I>and</I> called:
 &nbsp; 2  Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the preface or introduction, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have an account of the penman of this epistle, <I>Jude,</I> or 
 <I>Judas,</I> or Judah. He was name-sake to one of his ancestors, the 
 patriarch--son of Jacob, the most eminent though not the first-born of
 his sons, out of whose loins (lineally, in a most direct succession) 
 the Messiah came. This was a name of worth, eminency, and honour; yet 
 
 1. He had a wicked name-sake. There was one Judas (one of the twelve,
 surnamed <I>Iscariot,</I> from the place of his birth) who was a vile
 traitor, the betrayer of his and our Lord. The same names may be common
 to the best and worst persons. It may be instructive to be called after 
 the names of eminently good men, but there can be no inference drawn 
 thence as to what we shall prove, though we may even thence conclude 
 what sort of persons our good parents or progenitors desired and hoped 
 we should be. But, 

 2. Our Judas was quite another man. He was an apostle, so was Iscariot; 
 but he was a sincere disciple and follower of Christ, so was not the 
 other. He was a faithful servant of Jesus Christ, the other was his 
 betrayer and murderer; therefore here the one is very carefully 
 distinguished from the other. Dr. Manton's note upon this is, that God 
 takes great care of the good name of his sincere and useful servants. 
 Why then should we be prodigal of our own or one another's reputation 
 and usefulness? Our apostle here calls himself a servant of Jesus 
 Christ, esteeming that a most honourable title. It is more honourable 
 to be a sincere and useful servant of Christ than to be an earthly 
 king, how potent and prosperous soever. He might have claimed kindred 
 to Christ according to the flesh, but he waives this, and rather 
 glories in being his servant. Observe,

 (1.) It is really a greater honour to be a faithful servant of Jesus 
 Christ than to be akin to him according to the flesh. Many of Christ's 
 natural kindred, as well as of his progenitors, perished; not from want 
 of natural affection in him as man, but from infidelity and obstinacy 
 in themselves, which should make the descendants and near relatives of 
 persons most eminent for sincere and exemplary piety <I>jealous over 
 themselves with a godly jealousy.</I> A son of Noah may be saved in the 
 ark from a flood of temporal destruction, and yet be overwhelmed at 
 last in a deluge of divine wrath, and suffer <I>the vengeance of 
 eternal fire.</I> Christ himself tells us <I>that he that heareth his 
 word and doeth it</I> (that is, he only) <I>is as his brother, and
 sister, and mother,</I> that is, more honourably and advantageously 
 related to him than the nearest and dearest of his natural relatives, 
 considered merely as such. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:48-50">Matt. xii. 48-50</A>.

 (2.) In that the apostle Jude styles himself a servant, though an
 apostle, a dignified officer in Christ's kingdom, it is a great honour 
 to the meanest sincere minister (and it holds proportionably as to 
 every upright Christian) that he is <I>the servant of Christ Jesus.</I> 
 The apostles were servants before they were apostles, and they were but 
 servants still. Away then with all pretensions in the ministers of
 Christ to lordly dominion either over one another or over the flocks 
 committed to their charge. Let us ever have that of our dear Redeemer 
 in actual view, <I>It shall not be so among you,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:25,26">Matt. xx. 25, 26</A>.

 --<I>And brother of James,</I> to wit, of him whom the ancients style
 <I>the first bishop of Jerusalem,</I> of whose character and martyrdom 
 Josephus makes mention, ascribing the horrible destruction of that city 
 and nation to this wicked cruelty, as one of its principal causes. Of
 this James our Jude was brother, whether in the strictest or a larger 
 (though very usual) acceptation I determine not. He however reckons it 
 an honour to him that he was the brother of such a one. We ought to 
 honour those who are above us in age, gifts, graces, station; not to 
 envy them, yet neither to flatter them, nor be led merely by their 
 example, when we have reason to think they act wrong. Thus the apostle 
 Paul withstood his fellow-apostle Peter to the face, notwithstanding 
 the high esteem he had for him and the affectionate love he bore to 
 him, when he saw that he was to be blamed, that is, really blameworthy, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:11">Gal. ii. 11</A>,
 
 and following verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here informed to whom this epistle is directed; namely, to 
 all those <I>who are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in 
 Jesus Christ, and called.</I> I begin with the last--<I>called,</I> that
 is, called <I>Christians,</I> in the judgment of charity, further than 
 which we cannot, nor in justice ought to go, in the judgments or 
 opinions we form or receive of one another; for what appears not is 
 not, nor ought to come into account in all our dealings with and 
 censures of one another, whatever abatements the divine goodness may 
 see fit to make for an honest though misguided zeal. The church 
 pretends not (I am sure it ought not) to judge of <I>secret or hidden 
 things</I> (things drawn into the light before time), lest our rash and 
 preposterous zeal do more harm than good, or I am afraid ever will do. 
 <I>The tares and wheat</I> (if Christ may be Judge) <I>must grow 
 together till the harvest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:28-30">Matt. xiii. 28-30</A>);

 and then he himself will, by proper instruments, take timely care to
 separate them. We ought to think the best we can of every man till the
 contrary appear; not being forward to receive or propagate, much less
 invent, disadvantageous characters of our brethren. This is the least
 we can make of the apostle's large and excellent description of charity
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1-13">1 Cor. xiii.</A>),

 and this we ought to make conscience of acting up to, which till we do,
 the Christian churches will be (as, alas! they are at this day) filled 
 with <I>envying and strife, confusion and every evil work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:16">Jam. iii. 16</A>.

 Or, the apostle may speak of their being <I>called to be
 Christians,</I> by the preaching of the word, which they gladly 
 received, and professed cordially to believe, and so were received into 
 the society and fellowship of the church--Christ the head, and 
 believers the members; real believers really, professed believers 
 visibly. Note, Christians are the called, called out of the world, the 
 evil spirit and temper of it,--above the world, to higher and better 
 things, heaven, things unseen and eternal,--called from sin to Christ, 
 from vanity to seriousness, from uncleanness to holiness; and this in 
 pursuance of divine purpose and grace; <I>for whom he did predestinate 
 those he also called,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>.

 Now those who are thus called, are, 

 1. Sanctified: <I>Sanctified by God the Father.</I> Sanctification is
 usually spoken of in scripture as the work of the Holy Spirit, yet here 
 it is ascribed to God the Father, because the Spirit works it as the 
 Spirit of the Father and the Son. Note, All who are effectually called
 are sanctified, <I>made partakers of a divine nature</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4">2 Pet. i. 4</A>);
 
 <I>for without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:14">Heb. xii. 14</A>.
 
 Observe, Our sanctification is not our own work. If any are
 sanctified, they are so by God the Father, not excluding Son or Spirit, 
 for they are one, one God. Our corruption and pollution are of 
 ourselves; but our sanctification and renovation are of God and his 
 grace; and therefore if we perish in our iniquity we must bear the 
 blame, but if we be sanctified and glorified all the honour and glory 
 must be ascribed to God, and to him alone. I own it is hard to give a 
 clear and distinct account of this, but we must not deny nor disregard 
 necessary truth because we cannot fully reconcile the several parts of 
 it to each other; for, on that supposition, we might deny that any one 
 of us could stir an inch from the place we are at present in, though we 
 see the contrary every day and hour. 

 2. The called and sanctified are <I>preserved in Christ Jesus.</I> As 
 it is God who begins the work of grace in the souls of men, so it is he 
 who carries it on, and perfects it. Where he begins he will perfect; 
 though we are fickle, he is constant. <I>He will not forsake the work 
 of his own hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:8">Ps. cxxxviii. 8</A>.

 Let us not therefore trust in ourselves, nor in our stock of grace
 already received, but in him, and in him alone, still endeavouring, by 
 all proper and appointed means, to keep ourselves, as ever we would 
 hope he should keep us. Note,

 (1.) Believers are <I>preserved</I> from the gates of hell, and to the 
 glory of heaven.

 (2.) All who are preserved are preserved in Jesus Christ, in him as 
 their <I>citadel and stronghold,</I> no longer than they abide in him, 
 and solely by virtue of their union with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the apostolical benediction: <I>Mercy to you,</I> &c. From 
 the mercy, peace, and love of God all our comfort flows, all our real 
 enjoyment in this life, all our hope of a better. 

 1. The <I>mercy</I> of God is the spring and fountain of all the good
 we have or hope for; mercy not only to the miserable, but to the
 guilty. 

 2. Next to mercy is <I>peace,</I> which we have from the sense of
 having obtained mercy. We can have no true and lasting peace but what
 flows from our reconciliation with God by Jesus Christ. 

 3. As from mercy springs peace, so from peace springs <I>love,</I> his
 love to us, our love to him, and our brotherly love (forgotten, 
 wretchedly neglected, grace!) to one another. These the apostle prays 
 may be multiplied, that Christians may not be content with scraps and 
 narrow scantlings of them; but that souls and societies may be full of 
 them. Note, God is ready to supply us with all grace, and a fulness in
 each grace. If we are straitened, we are not straitened in him, but in 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
 common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
 exhort <I>you</I> that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which
 was once delivered unto the saints.
 &nbsp; 4  For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
 of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
 grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord
 God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
 this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land
 of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
 &nbsp; 6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
 their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
 under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
 &nbsp; 7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
 manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
 strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
 vengeance of eternal fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, I. The design of the apostle in writing this epistle to 
 the lately converted Jews and Gentiles; namely, to establish them in 
 the Christian faith, and a practice and conversation truly consonant 
 and conformable thereunto, and in an open and bold profession thereof, 
 especially in times of notorious opposition, whether by artful 
 seduction or violent and inhuman persecution. But then we must see to 
 it very carefully that it be really the Christian faith that we 
 believe, profess, propagate, and contend for; not the discriminating 
 badges of this or the other party, not any thing of later date than the 
 inspired writings of the holy evangelists and apostles. Here observe, 
 
 1. The gospel salvation is a common salvation, that is, in a most
 sincere offer and tender of it to all mankind to whom the notice of it 
 reaches: for so the commission runs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15,16">Mark xvi. 15, 16</A>),

 <I>Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every 
 creature,</I> &c. Surely God means as he speaks; he does not delude us 
 with vain words, whatever men do; and therefore none are excluded from 
 the benefit of these gracious offers and invitations, but those who 
 obstinately, impenitently, finally exclude themselves. <I>Whoever will 
 may come and drink of the water of life freely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Rev. xxii. 17</A>.

 The application of it is made to all believers, and only to such; it is 
 made to the weak as well as to the strong. Let none discourage 
 themselves on the account of hidden decrees which they can know little 
 of, and with which they have nothing to do. God's decrees are dark, his 
 covenants are plain. "All good Christians meet in Christ the common 
 head, are actuated by one and the same Spirit, are guided by one rule, 
 meet here at one throne of grace, and hope shortly to meet in one 
 common inheritance," a glorious one to be sure, but what or how 
 glorious we cannot, nor at present need to know; but such it will be as 
 vastly to exceed all our present hopes and expectations. 

 2. This common salvation is the subject-matter of the faith of all the 
 saints. The doctrine of it is what they all most heartily consent to; 
 they esteem it as a <I>faithful saying, and worthy of all 
 acceptation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:15">1 Tim. i. 15</A>.

 It is the faith once, <I>or at once, once for all, delivered to the
 saints,</I> to which nothing can be added, from which nothing may be
 detracted, in which nothing more nor less should be altered. Here let
 us abide; here we are safe; if we stir a step further, we are in danger
 of being either entangled or seduced. 

 3. The apostles and evangelists all wrote to us of this common 
 salvation. This cannot be doubted by those who have carefully read 
 their writings. It is strange that any should think they wrote chiefly 
 to maintain particular schemes and opinions, especially such as they 
 never did nor could think of. It is enough that they have fully 
 declared to us, by inspiration of the Holy Ghost, all that is necessary 
 <I>for every one to believe and do,</I> in order to obtain a personal 
 interest in the common salvation.

 4. Those who preach or write of the common salvation should give all
 diligence to do it well: they should not allow themselves to offer to
 God or his people that which costs them nothing, or next to nothing,
 little or no pains or thought,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:24">2 Sam. xxiv. 24</A>.

 This were to treat God irreverently, and man unjustly. The apostle
 (though inspired) gave all diligence to write of the common salvation. 
 What then will become of those who (though uninspired) give no 
 diligence, or next to none, but say to the people (even in the name of 
 God) <I>quicquid in buccam venerit--whatever comes next,</I> who, so 
 that they use scripture-words, care not how they interpret or apply 
 them? Those who speak of sacred things ought always to speak of them 
 with the greatest reverence, care, and diligence. 

 5. Those who have received the doctrine of this common salvation must
 contend earnestly for it. <I>Earnestly,</I> not <I>furiously.</I>
 Those who strive for the Christian faith, or in the Christian course, 
 must strive lawfully, or they lose their labour, and run great hazard 
 of losing their crown,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:5">2 Tim. ii. 5</A>.

 <I>The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20">Jam. i. 20</A>.

 Lying for the truth is bad, and scolding for it is not much better.
 Observe, Those who have received the truth must contend for it. But
 how? As the apostles did; by suffering patiently and courageously for 
 it, not by making others suffer if they will not presently embrace 
 every notion that we are pleased (proved or unproved) to call faith, or 
 fundamental. We must not suffer ourselves to be robbed of any essential 
 article of Christian faith, by the cunning craftiness or specious 
 plausible pretences of any who <I>lie in wait to deceive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14">Eph. iv. 14</A>.

 The apostle Paul tells us he preached the gospel (mind it was the
 gospel) <I>with much contention</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1 Thess. ii. 2</A>),

 that is (as I understand it), with earnestness, with a hearty zeal, and
 a great concern for the success of what he preached. But, if we will 
 understand <I>contention</I> in the common acceptation of the word, we 
 must impartially consider with whom the apostle contended, and how, the 
 enlarging on which would not be proper for this place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The occasion the apostle had to write to this purport. As evil 
 manners give rise to good laws, so dangerous errors often give just 
 occasion to the proper defence of important truths. Here observe, 

 1. Ungodly men are the great enemies of the faith of Christ and the
 peace of the church. Those who deny or corrupt the one, and disturb the 
 other, are here expressly styled <I>ungodly men.</I> We might have 
 truth with peace (a most desirable thing) were there none (ministers or 
 private Christians) in our particular churches and congregations but 
 truly godly men--a blessing scarcely to be looked or hoped for on this 
 side heaven. Ungodly men raise scruples, merely to advance and promote 
 their own selfish, ambitious, and covetous ends. This has been the 
 plague of the church in all past ages, and I am afraid no age is, or 
 will be, wholly free from such men and such practices as long as time 
 shall last. Observe, Nothing cuts us off from the church but that which 
 cuts us off from Christ; namely, reigning infidelity and ungodliness.
 We must abhor the thought of branding particular parties or persons 
 with this character, especially of doing it without the least proof, 
 or, as it too often happens, the least shadow of it. Those are ungodly 
 men who live <I>without God in the world,</I> who have no regard to God 
 and conscience. Those are to be dreaded and consequently to be avoided, 
 not only who are wicked by sins of commission, but also who are ungodly 
 by sins of omission, who, for example, restrain prayer before God, who 
 dare not reprove a rich man, when it is the duty of their place so to 
 do, for fear of losing his favour and the advantage they promise 
 themselves therefrom, who <I>do the work of the Lord negligently,</I> 
 &c.

 2. Those are <I>the worst of ungodly men who turn the grace of God into
 lasciviousness,</I> who take encouragement to sin more boldly because 
 the grace of God has abounded, and still abounds, so wonderfully, who 
 are hardened in their impieties by the extent and fulness of gospel 
 grace, the design of which is to reduce men from sin, and bring them 
 unto God. Thus therefore to wax wanton under so great grace, and turn 
 it into an occasion of working all uncleanness with greediness, and 
 hardening ourselves in such a course by that very grace which is the 
 last and most forcible means to reclaim us from it, is to render 
 ourselves the vilest, the worst, and most hopeless of sinners.

 3. Those who turn the grace of God into lasciviousness do in effect
 <I>deny the Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> that is, they deny 
 both natural and revealed religion. They strike at the foundation of 
 natural religion, for they <I>deny the only Lord God;</I> and they 
 overturn all the frame of revealed religion, for they deny <I>the Lord 
 Jesus Christ.</I> Now his great design in establishing revealed 
 religion in the world was to bring us unto God. To deny revealed 
 religion is virtually to overturn natural religion, for they stand or 
 fall together, and they mutually yield light and force to each other.
 Would to God our modern deists, who live in the midst of gospel light, 
 would seriously consider this, and cautiously, diligently, and 
 impartially examine what it is that hinders their receiving the gospel, 
 while they profess themselves fully persuaded of all the principles and 
 duties of natural religion! Never to tallies answered more exactly to 
 each other than these do, so that it seems absurd to receive the one 
 and reject the other. One would think it were the fairer way to receive 
 both or reject both; though perhaps the more plausible method, 
 especially in this age, is to act the part they do. 

 4. Those who turn the grace of God into lasciviousness are ordained
 unto condemnation. They sin against the last, the greatest, and most
 perfect remedy; and so are without excuse. Those who thus sin must 
 needs die of their wounds, of their disease, are of old ordained to 
 this condemnation, whatever that expression means. But what if our 
 translators had thought fit to have rendered the words <B><I>palai 
 progegrammenoi</I></B>--<I>of old fore-written of,</I> as persons who 
 would through their own sin and folly become the proper subjects of 
 this condemnation, where had the harm been? Plain Christians had not 
 been troubled with dark, doubtful, and perplexing thoughts about 
 reprobation, which the strongest heads cannot enter far into, can 
 indeed bear but little of, without much loss and damage. Is it not 
 enough that early notice was given by inspired writers that such 
 seducers and wicked men should arise in later times, and that every 
 one, being fore-warned of, should be fore-armed against them? 

 5. We ought to contend earnestly for the faith, in opposition to those
 who would corrupt or deprave it, such as have <I>crept in unawares:</I> 
 a wretched character, to be sure, but often very ill applied by weak 
 and ignorant people, and even by those who themselves creep in 
 unawares, who think their <I>ipse dixit</I> should stand for a law to 
 all their followers and admirers. Surely faithful humble ministers are 
 helpers of their people's joy, peace, and comfort; <I>not lords of 
 their faith!</I> Whoever may attempt to corrupt the faith, we ought to 
 contend earnestly against them. The more busy and crafty the 
 instruments and agents of Satan are, to rob us of the truth, the more 
 solicitous should we be to hold it fast, always provided we be very 
 sure that we fasten no wrong or injurious characters on persons, 
 parties, or sentiments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fair warning which the apostle, in Christ's name, gives to 
 those who, having professed his holy religion, do afterwards desert and 
 prove false to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 We have here a recital of the former judgments of God upon sinners, 
 with design to awaken and terrify those to whom warning is given in 
 this epistle. Observe, The judgments of God are often denounced and 
 executed <I>in terrorem--for warning to others,</I> rather than from 
 immediate or particular displeasure against the offenders themselves; 
 not that God is not displeased with them, but perhaps not more with 
 them than with others who, at least for the present, escape. <I>I will 
 put you in remembrance.</I> What we already know we still need to be 
 put in remembrance of. Therefore there will always be need and use of a 
 standing stated ministry in the Christian church, though all the 
 doctrines of faith, the essentials, are so plainly revealed in express 
 words, or by the most near, plain, and immediate consequence, that he 
 who runs may read and understand them. There wants no infallible 
 interpreter, really or conceitedly such, for any such end or purpose. 
 Some people (weakly enough) suggest, "If the scriptures do so plainly 
 contain all that is necessary to salvation, what need or use can there 
 be of a standing ministry? Why may we not content ourselves with 
 staying at home, and reading our Bibles?" The inspired apostle has here 
 fully, though not wholly, answered this objection. Preaching is not 
 designed to teach us something new in every sermon, somewhat that we 
 knew nothing of before; but <I>to put us in remembrance,</I> to call to 
 mind things forgotten, to affect our passions, and engage and fix our 
 resolutions, that our lives may be answerable to our faith. <I>Though 
 you know these things,</I> yet you still need to <I>know them 
 better.</I> There are many things which we have known which yet we have 
 unhappily forgotten. Is it of no use or service to be put afresh in
 remembrance of them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now what are these things which we Christians need to be put in 
 remembrance of?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The destruction of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Paul puts the Corinthians in mind of this,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-33">1 Cor. x</A>.

 The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-10">first ten verses</A>

 of that chapter (as the scripture is always the best commentary upon
 itself) are the best explication of the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5">
 fifth verse</A>

 of this epistle of Jude. None therefore ought to presume upon their
 privileges, since many who were brought out of Egypt by a series of 
 amazing miracles, yet perished in the wilderness by reason of their 
 unbelief. <I>Let us not therefore be high-minded, but fear,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20">Rom. xi. 20</A>.

 <I>Let us fear lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, 
 any of you should seem to come short of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 They had miracles in abundance: they were their daily bread; yet even
 they perished in unbelief. We have greater (much greater) advantages 
 than they had; let their error (their so fatal error) be our awful 
 warning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here put in remembrance of the fall of the angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 There were a great number of the angels who <I>left their own 
 habitation;</I> that is, who were not pleased with the posts and 
 stations the supreme Monarch of the universe had assigned and allotted 
 to them, but thought (like discontented ministers in our age, I might 
 say in every age) they deserved better; they would, with the title of 
 <I>ministers,</I> be <I>sovereigns,</I> and in effect their Sovereign 
 should be their minister--do all, and only, what they would have him;
 thus was pride the main and immediate cause or occasion of their fall. 
 Thus they quitted their post, and rebelled against God, their Creator 
 and sovereign Lord. But God did not spare them (high and great as they 
 were); he would not truckle to them; he threw them off, as a wise and 
 good prince will a selfish and deceitful minister; and the great, the 
 all-wise God, could not be ignorant, as the wisest and best of earthly 
 princes often are, what designs they were hatching. After all, what 
 became of them? They thought to have dared and outfaced Omnipotence 
 itself; but God was too hard for them, he cast them down to hell. Those 
 who would not be servants to their Maker and his will in their first 
 state were made captives to his justice, and are <I>reserved in 
 everlasting chains, under darkness.</I> Here see what the condition of 
 fallen angels is: they are <I>in chains,</I> bound under the divine 
 power and justice, bound over <I>to the judgment of the great day;</I> 
 they are <I>under darkness,</I> though once <I>angels of light;</I> so 
 horribly in the dark are they that they continue to fight against God, 
 as if there were yet some small hope at least left them of prevailing 
 and overcoming in the conflict. Dire infatuation! Light and liberty
 concur, chains and darkness how well do they agree and suit each other! 
 The devils, once angels in the best sense, are <I>reserved,</I> &c. 
 Observe, There is, undoubtedly there is, a judgment to come; the fallen 
 angels are <I>reserved to the judgment of the great day;</I> and shall 
 fallen men escape it? Surely not. Let every reader consider this in due 
 time. Their chains are called everlasting, because it is impossible 
 they should ever break loose from them, or make an escape; they are 
 held fast and sure under them. The decree, the justice, the wrath of 
 God, are the very chains under which fallen angels are held so fast. 
 Hear and fear, O sinful mortals of mankind!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The apostle here calls to our remembrance the destruction of Sodom 
 and Gomorrah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Even as,</I> &c. It is in allusion to the destruction of 
 <I>Pentapolis,</I> or the five cities, that the miseries of the damned 
 are set forth by a lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; they were 
 guilty of abominable wickedness, not to be named or thought of but with 
 the utmost abhorrence and detestation; their ruin is a particular 
 warning to all people to take heed of, and fly <I>from, fleshly lusts 
 that war against the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:11">1 Pet. ii. 11</A>.

 "These lusts consumed the Sodomites with fire from heaven, and they are
 now <I>suffering the vengeance of eternal fire;</I> therefore take 
 heed, imitate not their sins, lest the same plagues overtake you as did 
 them. God is the same holy, just, pure Being now as then; and can the
 beastly pleasures of a moment make amends for your suffering the 
 vengeance of eternal fire? <I>Stand in awe, therefore, and sin
 not,</I>"

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Likewise also these <I>filthy</I> dreamers defile the flesh,
 despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.
 &nbsp; 9  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
 disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a
 railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
 &nbsp; 10  But these speak evil of those things which they know not:
 but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
 they corrupt themselves.
 &nbsp; 11  Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and
 ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished
 in the gainsaying of Core.
 &nbsp; 12  These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
 with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds <I>they are</I>
 without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
 withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
 &nbsp; 13  Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
 wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
 for ever.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here exhibits a charge against deceivers who were now 
 seducing the disciples of Christ from the profession and practice of 
 his holy religion. He calls them <I>filthy dreamers,</I> forasmuch as 
 delusion is a dream, and the beginning of, and inlet to, all manner of 
 filthiness. Note, Sin is filthiness; it renders men odious and vile in 
 the sight of the most holy God, and makes them (sooner or later, as 
 penitent or as punished to extremity and without resource) vile in 
 their own eyes, and in a while they become vile in the eyes of all 
 about them. <I>These filthy dreamers</I> dream themselves into a fool's 
 paradise on earth, and into a real hell at last: let their character, 
 course, and end, be our seasonable and sufficient warning; like sins 
 will produce like punishments and miseries. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The character of these deceivers is described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>defile the flesh.</I> The flesh or body is the immediate 
 seat, and often the irritating occasion, of many horrid pollutions; yet 
 these, though done in and against the body, do greatly defile and 
 grievously maim and wound the soul. <I>Fleshly lusts do war against
 the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:11">1 Pet. ii. 11</A>;

 and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1">2 Cor. vii. 1</A>

 we read of <I>filthiness of flesh and spirit,</I> each of which,
 though of different kinds, defiles the whole man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They <I>despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities,</I> are of a
 disturbed mind and a seditious spirit, forgetting that <I>the powers
 that be are ordained of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1">Rom. xiii. 1</A>.

 God requires us to <I>speak evil of no man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:2">Tit. iii. 2</A>.</A>);

 but it is a great aggravation of the sin of evil-speaking when what we
 say is pointed at magistrates, men whom God has set in authority over 
 us, by blaspheming or speaking evil of whom we blaspheme God himself. 
 Or if we understand it, as some do, with respect to religion, which 
 ought to have the dominion in this lower world, such evil-speakers 
 despise the dominion of conscience, make a jest of it, and would banish 
 it out of the world; and as for the word of God, the rule of 
 conscience, they despise it. The revelations of the divine will go for 
 little with them; they are a rule of faith and manners, but not till 
 they have explained them, and imposed their sense of them upon all 
 about them. Or, as others account for the sense of this passage, the 
 people of God, truly and specially so, are the dignities here spoken of 
 or referred to, according to that of the psalmist, <I>Touch not mine 
 anointed, and do my prophets no harm,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:15">Ps. cv. 15</A>.

 They <I>speak evil,</I> &c. Religion and its serious professors have 
 been always and every where evil spoken of. Though there is nothing in 
 religion but what is very good, and deserves our highest regards, both 
 as it is perfective of our natures and as it is subservient to our 
 truest and highest interests; yet <I>this sect,</I> as its enemies are 
 pleased to call it, <I>is every where spoken against,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:22">Acts xxviii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On this occasion the apostle brings in <I>Michael the archangel,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Interpreters are at a loss what is here meant by <I>the body of 
 Moses.</I> Some think that the devil contended that Moses might have a 
 public and honourable funeral, that the place where he was interred 
 might be generally known, hoping thereby to draw the Jews, so naturally 
 prone thereto, to a new and fresh instance of idolatry. Dr. Scott 
 thinks that by the body of Moses we are to understand the Jewish 
 church, whose destruction the devil strove and contended for, as the 
 Christian church is called the body of Christ in the New-Testament 
 style. Others bring other interpretations, which I will not here 
 trouble the reader with. Though this contest was mightily eager and 
 earnest, and Michael was victorious in the issue, yet he would not 
 <I>bring a railing accusation against the devil himself;</I> he knew a 
 good cause needed no such weapons to be employed in its defence. It is 
 said, <I>he durst not bring,</I> &c. Why durst he not? Not that he was 
 afraid of the devil, but he believed God would be offended if, in such 
 a dispute, he went that way to work; he thought it below him to engage 
 in a trial of skill with the great enemy of God and man which of them 
 should out-scold or out-rail the other: a memorandum to all disputants, 
 never to bring railing accusations into their disputes. Truth needs no 
 supports from falsehood or scurrility. Some say, Michael would not 
 bring a railing accusation against the devil as knowing beforehand that 
 he would be too hard for him at that weapon. Some think the apostle 
 refers here to the remarkable passage we have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:7-14">Num. xx. 7-14</A>.

 Satan would have represented Moses under disadvantageous colours, which
 he, good man, had at that time, and upon that occasion, given but too 
 much handle for. Now Michael, according to this account, stands up in 
 defence of Moses, and, in the zeal of an upright and bold spirit, says 
 to Satan, <I>The Lord rebuke thee.</I> He would not stand disputing 
 with the devil, nor enter into a particular debate about the merits of 
 that special cause. He knew Moses was his fellow-servant, a favourite 
 of God, and he would not patiently suffer him to be insulted, no, not 
 by the prince of devils; but in a just indignation cries out, <I>The 
 Lord rebuke thee:</I> like that of our Lord himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:10">Matt. iv. 10</A>),

 <I>Get thee hence, Satan.</I> Moses was a dignity, a magistrate, one
 beloved and preferred by the great God; and the archangel thought it 
 insufferable that such a one should be so treated by a vile apostate 
 spirit, of how high an order soever. So the lesson hence is that we 
 ought to stand up in defence of those whom God owns, how severe soever 
 Satan and his instruments may be in their censures of them and their 
 conduct. Those who censure (in particular) upright magistrates, upon 
 every slip in their behaviour, may expect to hear, <I>The Lord rebuke 
 thee;</I> and divine rebukes are harder to be borne than careless 
 sinners now think for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>They speak evil of the things which they know not,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Observe, Those who speak evil of religion and godliness <I>speak evil 
 of the things which they know not;</I> for, if they had known them, 
 they would have spoken well of them, for nothing but good and excellent 
 can be truly said of religion, and it is sad that any thing different 
 or opposite should ever be justly said of any of its professors. A 
 religious life is the most safe, happy, comfortable, and honourable 
 life that is. Observe, further, Men are most apt to speak evil of
 those persons and things that they know least of. How many had never 
 suffered by slanderous tongues if they had been better known! On the 
 other hand, retirement screens some even from just censure. <I>But what 
 they know naturally,</I> &c. It is hard, if not impossible, to find any 
 obstinate enemies to the Christian religion, who do not in their stated 
 course live in open or secret contradiction to the very principles of 
 natural religion: this many think hard and uncharitable; but I am 
 afraid it will appear too true in <I>the day of the revelation of the 
 righteous judgment of God.</I> The apostle likens such to <I>brute 
 beasts,</I> though they often think and boast themselves, if not as the 
 wisest, yet at least as the wittiest part of mankind. <I>In those 
 things they corrupt themselves;</I> that is, in the plainest and most 
 natural and necessary things, things that lie most open and obvious to 
 natural reason and conscience; even in those things they corrupt, 
 debase, and defile themselves: the fault, whatever it is, lies not in 
 their understanding or apprehensions, but in their depraved wills and 
 disordered appetites and affections; they could and might have acted 
 better, but then they must have offered violence to those vile 
 affections which they obstinately chose rather to gratify than to 
 mortify.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>

 the apostle represents them as followers <I>of Cain,</I> and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>,

 as atheistical and profane people, who thought little, and perhaps 
 believed not much, of God or a future world--as greedy and covetous, 
 who, so they could but gain present worldly advantages, cared not what 
 came next--rebels against God and man, who, like Core, ran into 
 attempts in which they must assuredly perish, as he did. Of such the 
 apostle further says,

 (1.) <I>These are spots in your feasts of charity</I>--the 
 <B><I>agapai</I></B> or <I>love-feasts,</I> so much spoken of by the 
 ancients. They happened, by whatever means or mischance, to be admitted 
 among them, but were spots in them, defiled and defiling. Observe, It 
 is a great reproach, though unjust and accidental, to religion, when 
 those who profess it, and join in the most solemn institution of it, 
 are in heart and life unsuitable and even contrary to it: <I>These are 
 spots.</I> Yet how common in all Christian societies here on earth, the 
 very best not excepted, are such blemishes! The more is the pity. The 
 Lord remedy it in his due time and way, not in men's blind and rigorous 
 way of plucking up the wheat with the tares. But in the heaven we are 
 waiting, hoping, and preparing for, there is none of this mad work, 
 there are none of these disorderly doings. 

 (2.) <I>When they feast with you, they feed themselves without 
 fear.</I> Arrant gluttons, no doubt, there were; such as minded only 
 the gratifying of their appetites with the daintiness and abundance of 
 their fare; they had no regard to Solomon's caution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:2">Prov. xxiii. 2</A>.

 Note, In common eating and drinking a holy fear is necessary, much more
 in feasting, though we may sometimes be more easily and insensibly 
 overcome at a common meal than at a feast; for, in the case supposed, 
 we are less upon our guard, and sometimes, at least to some persons, 
 the plenty of a feast is its own antidote, as to others it may prove a 
 dangerous snare.

 (3.) <I>Clouds they are without water,</I> which promise rain in time
 of drought, but perform nothing of what they promise. Such is the case 
 of formal professors, who at first setting out promise much, like 
 early-blossoming trees in a forward spring, but in conclusion bring 
 forth little or no fruit.--<I>Carried about of winds,</I> light and 
 empty, easily driven about this way or that, as the wind happens to 
 set; such are empty, ungrounded professors, and easy prey to every 
 seducer. It is amazing to hear many talk so confidently of so many 
 things of which they know little or nothing, and yet have not the 
 wisdom and humility to discern and be sensible how little they know.
 How happy would our world be if men either knew more or practically 
 knew how little they know. 

 (4.) <I>Trees whose fruit withereth,</I> &c. Trees they are, for they
 are planted in the Lord's vineyard, yet fruitless ones. Observe, Those 
 whose fruit withereth may be justly said to be without fruit. As good 
 never a whit as never the better. It is a sad thing when men seem to 
 <I>begin in the Spirit and end in the flesh,</I> which is almost as 
 common a case as it is an awful one. The text speaks of such as were 
 <I>twice dead.</I> One would think to be once dead were enough; we none 
 of us, till grace renew us to a higher degree than ordinary, love to 
 think of dying once, though this is appointed for us all. What then is 
 the meaning of this being twice dead? They had been once dead in their 
 natural, fallen, lapsed state; but they seemed to recover, and, as a 
 man in a swoon, to be brought to life again, when they took upon them 
 the profession of the Christian religion. But now they are dead again 
 by the evident proofs they have given of their hypocrisy: whatever they 
 seemed, they had nothing truly vital in them.--<I>Plucked up by the 
 roots,</I> as we commonly serve dead trees, from which we expect no 
 more fruit. They are <I>dead, dead, dead; why cumber they the 
 ground?</I> Away with them to the fire. 

 (5.) <I>Raging waves of the sea,</I> boisterous, noisy, and clamorous; 
 full of talk and turbulency, but with little (if any) sense or meaning: 
 <I>Foaming out their own shame,</I> creating much uneasiness to men of 
 better sense and calmer tempers, which yet will in the end turn to 
 their own greater shame and just reproach. The psalmist's prayer ought 
 always to be that of every honest and good man, "<I>Let integrity and 
 uprightness preserve me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:21">Ps. xxv. 21</A>),

 and, if it will not, let me be unpreserved." If honesty signify little 
 now, knavery will signify much less, and that in a very little while. 
 Raging waves are a terror to sailing passengers; but, when they have 
 got to port, the waves are forgotten as if no longer in being: their 
 noise and terror are for ever ended. 

 (6.) <I>Wandering stars,</I> planets that are erratic in their motions, 
 keep not that steady regular course which the fixed ones do, but shift 
 their stations, that one has sometimes much ado to know where to find 
 them. This allusion carries in it a very lively emblem of false
 teachers, who are sometimes here and sometimes there, so that one knows 
 not where nor how to fix them. In the main things, at least, one would
 think something should be fixed and steady; and this might be without 
 infallibility, or any pretensions to it in us poor mortals. In religion 
 and politics, the great subjects of present debate, surely there are 
 certain <I>stamina</I> in which wise and good, honest and 
 disinterested, men might agree, without throwing the populace into the 
 utmost anguish and distress of mind, or blowing up their passions into 
 rage and fury, without letting them know what they say or whereof they 
 affirm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The doom of this wicked people is declared: <I>To whom is reserved 
 the blackness of darkness for ever.</I> False teachers are to expect 
 the worst of punishments in this and a future world: not every one who 
 teaches by mistake any thing that is not exactly true (for who then, in 
 any public assembly, durst open a Bible to teach others, unless he 
 thought himself equal or superior to the angels of God in heaven?) but 
 every one who prevaricates, dissembles, would lead others into by-paths 
 and side-ways, that he may have opportunity to make a gain or prey of 
 them, or (in the apostle's phrase) to make merchandize of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:3">2 Pet. ii. 3</A>.

 But enough of this. As for the blackness of darkness for ever, I shall 
 only say that this terrible expression, with all the horror it imports, 
 belongs to false teachers, truly, not slanderously so called, who 
 <I>corrupt the word of God, and betray the souls of men.</I> If this 
 will not make both ministers and people cautious, I know not what 
 will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of the prophecy of Enoch, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>)

 we have no mention made in any other part or place of scripture; yet 
 now it is scripture that there was such prophecy. One plain text of 
 scripture is proof enough of any one point that we are required to 
 believe, especially when relating to a matter of fact; but in matters 
 of faith, necessary saving faith, God has not seen fit (blessed be his 
 holy name he has not) to try us so far. There is no fundamental article 
 of the Christian religion, truly so called, which is not inculcated 
 over and over in the New Testament, by which we may know on what the 
 Holy Ghost does, and consequently on what we ought, to lay the greatest 
 stress. Some say that this prophecy of Enoch was preserved by tradition 
 in the Jewish church; others that the apostle Jude was immediately 
 inspired with the notice of it: be this as it may, it is certain that 
 there was such a prophecy of ancient date, of long standing, and 
 universally received in the Old-Testament church; and it is a main 
 point of our New-Testament creed. Observe, 

 1. Christ's coming to judgment was prophesied of as early as the
 middle of the patriarchal age, and was therefore even then a received 
 and acknowledged truth.--<I>The Lord cometh with</I> his holy myriads, 
 including both angels and the spirits of just men made perfect. What a 
 glorious time will that be, when Christ shall <I>come with ten thousand 
 of these!</I> And we are told for what great and awful ends and 
 purposes he will come so accompanied and attended, namely, <I>to 
 execute judgment upon all.</I> 

 2. It was spoken of then, so long ago, as a thing just at hand: 
 "<I>Behold, the Lord cometh;</I> he is just a coming, he will be upon 
 you before you are aware, and, unless you be very cautious and 
 diligent, before you are provided to meet him comfortably." He 
 <I>cometh,</I>

 (1.) <I>To execute judgment upon</I> the wicked. 

 (2.) <I>To convince</I> them. Observe, Christ will condemn none without 
 precedent, trial, and conviction, such conviction as shall at least 
 silence themselves. They shall have no excuse or apology to make that 
 they either can or dare then stand by. Then <I>every mouth shall be 
 stopped,</I> the Judge and his sentence shall be (by all the impartial) 
 approved and applauded, and even the guilty condemned criminals shall 
 be speechless, though at present they want not bold and specious pleas, 
 which they vent with all assurance and confidence; and yet it is 
 certain that the mock-trials of prisoners in the jail among themselves 
 and the real trial at the bar before the proper judge soon appear to be 
 very different things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I cannot pass 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>

 without taking notice how often, and how emphatically, the word 
 <I>ungodly</I> is repeated in it, no fewer than four times: ungodly 
 men, ungodly sinners, ungodly deeds, and, as to the manner, ungodly 
 committed. Godly or ungodly signifies little with men now-a-days, 
 unless it be to scoff at and deride even the very expressions; but it 
 is not so in the language of the Holy Ghost. Note, Omissions, as well 
 as commissions, must be accounted for in the day of judgment. Note, 
 further, Hard speeches of one another, especially if ill-grounded, will 
 most certainly come into account at <I>the judgment of the great 
 day.</I> Let us all take care in time. "If thou," says one of our good 
 old puritans, "smite (a miscalled heretic, or) a schismatic, and God 
 find a real saint bleeding, look thou to it, how thou wilt answer it." 
 It may be too late to say before the angel that it was an error, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccl. v. 6</A>.

 I only here allude to that expression of the divinely inspired
 writer.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. The apostle enlarges further on the character of these evil 
 men and seducers: they <I>are murmurers, complainers,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Observe, A murmuring complaining temper, indulged and expressed, lays 
 men under a very bad character; such are very weak at least, and for 
 the most part very wicked. They murmur against God and his providence, 
 against men and their conduct; they are angry at every thing that 
 happens, and never pleased with their own state and condition in the 
 world, as not thinking it good enough for them. Such <I>walk after 
 their own lusts;</I> their will, their appetite, their fancy, are their 
 only rule and law. Note, Those who please their sinful appetites are 
 most prone to yield to their ungovernable passions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proceeds to caution and exhort those to whom he is writing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:17-23"><I>v.</I> 17-23</A>.

 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He calls them to remember how they have been forewarned: <I>But, 
 beloved, remember,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 "<I>Remember,</I> take heed that you think it not strange (so as to 
 stumble and be offended, and have your faith staggered by it) that such 
 people as the seducers before described and warned against should arise 
 (and that early) in the Christian church, seeing all this was foretold 
 by <I>the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> and consequently the 
 accomplishment of it in the event is a confirmation of your faith, 
 instead of being in the least an occasion of shaking and unsettling you 
 therein." Note,

 (1.) Those who would persuade must make it evident that they sincerely 
 love those whom they would persuade. Bitter words and hard usage never 
 did nor ever will convince, much less persuade any body. 

 (2.) The words which inspired persons have spoken (or written), duly
 remembered and reflected on, are the best preservative against 
 dangerous errors; this will always be so, till men have learnt to speak 
 better than God himself. 

 (3.) We ought not to be offended if errors and persecutions arise and 
 prevail in the Christian church; this was foretold, and therefore we 
 should not think worse of Christ's person, doctrine, or cross, when we 
 see it fulfilled. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1,2Ti+3:1,2Pe+3:3">1 Tim. iv. 1,
 and 2 Tim. iii. 1, and 2 Pet. iii. 3</A>.

 We must not think it strange, but comfort ourselves with this, that in 
 the midst of all this confusion Christ will maintain his church, and 
 make good his promise, that <I>the gates of hell shall not prevail 
 against it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Matt. xvi. 18</A>.

 (4.) The more religion is ridiculed and persecuted the faster hold we
 should take and keep of it; being forewarned, we should show that we 
 are fore-armed; under such trials we should stand firm, and <I>not be 
 soon shaken in mind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2">2 Thess. ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He guards them against seducers by a further description of their 
 odious character: <I>These are those who separate,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Observe, 

 (1.) Sensualists are the worst separatists. They separate themselves 
 from God, and Christ, and his church, to the devil, the world, and the 
 flesh, by their ungodly courses and vicious practices; and this is a 
 great deal worse than separation from any particular branch of the 
 visible church on account of opinions or modes and circumstances of 
 external government or worship, though many can patiently bear with the 
 former, while they are plentifully and almost perpetually railing at 
 the latter, as if no sin were damnable but what they are pleased to 
 call <I>schism.</I> 

 (2.) Sensual men have not the Spirit, that is, of God and Christ, the 
 Spirit of holiness, which whoever <I>has not, is none of Christ's,</I> 
 does not belong to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9">Rom. viii. 9</A>.

 (3.) The worse others are the better should we endeavour and approve
 ourselves to be; the more busy Satan and his instruments are to pervert 
 others, in judgment or practice, the more tenacious should we be of 
 sound doctrine and a good conversation, <I>holding fast the faithful 
 word, as we have been</I> (divinely) <I>taught, holding the mystery of 
 the faith in a pure conscience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:9,1Ti+3:9">Tit. i. 9; 1 Tim. iii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He exhorts them to persevering constancy in truth and holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Building up yourselves in your most holy faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Observe, The way to hold fast our profession is to hold on in it. 
 Having laid our foundation well in a sound faith, and a sincere upright 
 heart, we must build upon it, make further progress continually; and we 
 should take care with what materials we carry on our building, namely, 
 <I>gold, silver, precious stones,</I> not <I>wood, hay, stubble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:12">1 Cor. iii. 12</A>.

 Right principles and a regular conversation will stand the test even of
 the fiery trial; but, whatever we mix of baser alloy, though we be in 
 the main sincere, we shall suffer loss by it, and though our persons be 
 saved all that part of our work shall be consumed; and, if we ourselves 
 escape, it will be with great danger and difficulty, as from a house on 
 fire on every side.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Praying in the Holy Ghost.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] Prayer is the nurse of faith; the way to <I>build up ourselves in 
 our most holy faith</I> is to <I>continue instant in prayer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:12">Rom. xii. 12</A>.

 [2.] Our prayers are then most likely to prevail when we <I>pray in the
 Holy Ghost,</I> that is, under his guidance and influence, according to 
 the rule of his word, with faith, fervency, and constant persevering 
 importunity; this is praying in the Holy Ghost, whether it be done by 
 or without a set prescribed form.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Keep yourselves in the love of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 [1.] "Keep up the grace of love to God in its lively vigorous actings 
 and exercises in your souls."

 [2.] "Take heed of throwing yourselves out of the love of God to you, 
 or its delightful, cheering, strengthening manifestations; keep 
 yourselves in the way of God, if you would continue in his love."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>Looking for the mercy,</I> &c. 

 [1.] Eternal life is to be looked for only through <I>mercy;</I> mercy 
 is our only plea, not merit; or if merit, not our own, but another's, 
 who has merited for us what otherwise we could have laid no claim to, 
 nor have entertained any well-grounded hope of.

 [2.] It is said, not only through the mercy of God as our Creator, but 
 through the mercy <I>of our Lord Jesus Christ</I> as Redeemer; all who 
 come to heaven must come thither through our Lord Jesus Christ; for 
 <I>there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must 
 be saved,</I> but that of the Lord Jesus only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:12,Jude+1:10">Acts iv. 12
 compared with <I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 [3.] A believing expectation of eternal life will arm us against the
 snares of sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14">2 Pet. iii. 14</A>);

 a lively faith of the blessed hope will help us to mortify our cursed
 lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He directs them how to behave towards erring brethren: <I>And of 
 some have compassion,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:22,23">
 <I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) We ought to do all we can to rescue others out of the snares of 
 the devil, that they may be saved from (or recovered, when entangled 
 therein, out of) dangerous errors, or pernicious practices. We are not 
 only (under God) our own keepers, but every man ought to be, as much as 
 in him lies, his <I>brother's keeper;</I> none but a wicked Cain will 
 contradict this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:9">Gen. iv. 9</A>.

 We must watch over one another, must faithfully, yet prudently, reprove 
 each other, and set a good example to all about us.

 (2.) This must be done with <I>compassion, making a difference.</I> How
 is that? We must distinguish between the weak and the wilful. 

 [1.] <I>Of some</I> we must <I>have compassion,</I> treat them with all 
 tenderness, <I>restore them in the spirit of meekness,</I> not be 
 needlessly harsh and severe in our censures of them and their actions, 
 nor proud and haughty in our conduct towards them; not implacable, nor 
 averse to reconciliation with them, or admitting them to the friendship 
 they formerly had with us, when they give evident or even strongly 
 hopeful tokens of a sincere repentance: if God has forgiven them, why 
 should not we? We infinitely more need his forgiveness than they do, or 
 can do, ours, though perhaps neither they nor we are justly or 
 sufficiently sensible of this.

 [2.] <I>Others save with fear,</I> urging upon them <I>the terrors of 
 the Lord;</I> "Endeavour to frighten them out of their sins; preach 
 hell and damnation to them." But what if prudence and caution in 
 administering even the most just and severe reproofs be what are 
 primarily and chiefly here intimated--(I do but offer it for 
 consideration); as if he had said, "Fear lest you frustrate your own 
 good intentions and honest designs by rash and imprudent management, 
 that you do not harden, instead of reclaiming, even where greater 
 degrees of severity are requisite than in the immediately foregoing 
 instance." We are often apt to over-do, when we are sure we mean 
 honestly, and think we are right in the main; yet the very worst are 
 not needlessly, nor rashly, nor to extremity, to be provoked, lest they 
 be thereby further hardened through our default.--"<I>Hating even the 
 garment spotted with the flesh,</I> that is, keeping yourselves at the 
 utmost distance from what is or appears evil, and designing and 
 endeavouring that others may do so too. Avoid all that leads to sin or 
 that looks like sin," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:22">1 Thess. v. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle concludes this epistle with a solemn ascription of 
 glory to the great God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24,25">
 <I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.
 
 Note, 

 1. Whatever is the subject or argument we have been treating of, 
 ascribing glory to God is fittest for us to conclude with. 

 2. God is able, and he is as willing as able, <I>to keep us from
 falling, and to present us faultless before the presence of his 
 glory;</I> not as those who never have been faulty (for what has once 
 been done can never be rendered undone, even by Omnipotence itself, for 
 that implies a contradiction), but as those whose faults shall not be 
 imputed, to their ruin, which, but for God's mercy and a Saviour's 
 merits, they might most justly have been.--<I>Before the presence of 
 his glory.</I> Observe,

 (1.) The glory of the Lord will shortly be present. We now look upon it
 as distant, and too many look upon it as uncertain, but it will come, 
 and it will be manifest and apparent. <I>Every eye shall see him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>.
 
 This is now the object of our faith, but hereafter (and surely it
 cannot <I>now</I> be long) it will be the object of our sense; whom we 
 now believe in, him we shall shortly see, to our unspeakable joy and 
 comfort or inexpressible terror and consternation. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8">1 Pet. i. 8</A>.

 (2.) All real sincere believers shall be presented, at the Lord
 Redeemer's appearance and coming, by him their glorious head, to the 
 Father, in order to his approbation, acceptance, and reward. They were 
 given to him of the Father, and <I>of all that were so given to him he 
 has lost none,</I> nor will lose any one, not an individual, a single 
 soul, but will present them all perfectly holy and happy, when he shall 
 surrender his mediatorial kingdom to <I>his God and our God, his Father 
 and our Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39,17:12,1Co+15:24">John vi. 39,
 with <I>ch.</I> xvii. 12, 1 Cor. xv. 24</A>.

 (3.) When believers shall be presented faultless it will be with
 exceeding joy. Alas! now our faults fill us with fears, doubts, and 
 sorrows. But <I>be of good cheer;</I> if we be sincere, we shall be, 
 our dear Redeemer has undertaken for it, we shall be <I>presented 
 faultless;</I> where there is no sin there will be no sorrow; where 
 there is the perfection of holiness, there will be the perfection of 
 joy. Surely, the God who can and will do this is worthy to have 
 <I>glory, majesty, dominion, and power,</I> ascribed to him, <I>both 
 now and for ever!</I> And to this we may well, with the apostle, affix 
 our hearty <I>Amen.</I></P>
