 In this chapter the apostle, 

 I. Reproves them for going to law with one another about small matters,
 and bringing the cause before heathen judges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. He takes occasion hence to warn them against many gross sins, to
 which they had been formerly addicted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 III. And, having cautioned them against the abuse of their liberty, he
 vehemently dehorts them from fornication, by various arguments, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:12-20">ver. 12 to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law
 before the unjust, and not before the saints?
 &nbsp; 2  Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if
 the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the
 smallest matters?
 &nbsp; 3  Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things
 that pertain to this life?
 &nbsp; 4  If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life,
 set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
 &nbsp; 5  I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
 among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his
 brethren?
 &nbsp; 6  But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
 unbelievers.
 &nbsp; 7  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye
 go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why
 do ye not rather <I>suffer yourselves to</I> be defrauded?
 &nbsp; 8  Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <I>your</I> brethren.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle reproves them for going to law with one another before 
 heathen judges for little matters; and therein blames all <I>vexatious 
 law-suits.</I> In the previous chapter he had directed them to punish 
 heinous sins among themselves by church-censures. Here he directs them 
 to determine controversies with one another by church-counsel and 
 advice, concerning which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fault he blames them for: it was going to law. Not but that 
 <I>the law is good, if a man use it lawfully.</I> But, 

 1. <I>Brother went to law with brother</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 one member of the church with another. The near relation could not 
 preserve peace and good understanding. The bonds of fraternal love were 
 broken through. <I>And a brother offended,</I> as Solomon says, <I>is 
 harder to be won than a strong city;</I> their contentions are like the 
 bars of a castle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:19">Prov. xviii. 19</A>.

 Note, Christians should not contend with one another, for they are
 brethren. This, duly attended to, would prevent law-suits, and put an 
 end to quarrels and litigations. 

 2. They brought the matter before the heathen magistrates: <I>they went
 to law before the unjust, not before the saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 brought the controversy before unbelievers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and did not compose it among themselves, Christians and saints, at
 least in profession. This tended much to the reproach of Christianity.
 It published at once their folly and unpeaceableness; whereas they 
 pretended to be the children of wisdom, and the followers of the Lamb, 
 the meek and lowly Jesus, the <I>prince of peace.</I> And therefore, 
 says the apostle, "<I>Dare any of you,</I> having a controversy with 
 another, go to law, implead him, bring the matter to a hearing before 
 the unjust?" Note, Christians should not dare to do any thing that 
 tends to the reproach of their Christian name and profession. 

 3. Here is at least an intimation that they went to law for trivial
 matters, things of little value; for the apostle blames them that they 
 did not suffer wrong rather than go to law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 which must be understood of matters not very important. In matters of 
 great damage to ourselves or families, we may use lawful means to right 
 ourselves. We are not bound to sit down and suffer the injury tamely,
 without stirring for our own relief; but, in matters of small 
 consequence, it is better to put up with the wrong. Christians should
 be of a forgiving temper. And it is more for their ease and honour to 
 suffer small injuries and inconveniences than seem to be 
 contentious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He lays before them the aggravations of their fault: <I>Do you not 
 know that the saints shall judge the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>shall judge angels?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And are they unworthy <I>to judge the smallest matters, the things of 
 this life?</I> It was a dishonour to their Christian character, a 
 forgetting of their real dignity, as saints, for them to carry little 
 matters, about the things of life, before heathen magistrates. When 
 they were to judge the world, nay, to judge, it is unaccountable that 
 they could not determine little controversies among one another. By 
 judging the world and angels, some think, is to be understood, their 
 being assessors to Christ in the great judgment-day; it being said of 
 our Saviour's disciples that they should at that day <I>sit on twelve 
 thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Matt. xix. 28</A>.

 And elsewhere we read of our <I>Lord's coming with ten thousand of his
 saints to execute judgment on all,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">Jude 14, 15</A>.

 <I>He will come to judgment with all his saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:13">1 Thess. iii. 13</A>.

 They themselves are indeed to be judged (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:31=41">Matt. xxv. 31-41</A>),

 but they may first be acquitted, and then advanced to the bench, to
 approve and applaud the righteous judgment of Christ both on men and 
 angels. In no other sense can they be judges. They are not partners in 
 their Lord's commission, but they have the honour to sit by, and see 
 his proceeding against the wicked world, and approve it. Others 
 understand this judging of the world to be meant when the empire should 
 become Christian. But it does not appear that the Corinthians had
 knowledge of the empire's becoming Christian; and, if they had, in what 
 sense could Christian emperors be said to judge angels? Others 
 understand it of their condemning the world by their faith and 
 practice, and casting out evil angels by miraculous power, which was 
 not confined to the first ages, nor to the apostles. The first sense 
 seems to be most natural; and at the same time it gives the utmost 
 force to the argument. "Shall Christians have the honour to sit with 
 the sovereign Judge at the last day, whilst he passes judgment on 
 sinful men and evil angels, and are they not worthy to judge of the 
 trifles about which you contend before heathen magistrates? Cannot they 
 make up your mutual differences? Why must you bring them before heathen 
 judges? When you are to judge them, as it fit to appeal to their 
 judicature? Must you, about <I>the affairs of this life, set those to 
 judge who are of no esteem in the church?</I>" (so some read, and
 perhaps most properly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>heathen</I> magistrates, <B><I>exouthenemenous,</I></B> the 
 <I>things that are not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>.

 "Must those be called in to judge in your controversies of whom you
 ought to entertain so low an opinion? Is this not shameful?"
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Some who read it as our translators make it an ironical speech: "If you 
 have such controversies depending, set those to judge who are of least 
 esteem among yourselves. The meanest of your own members are able 
 surely to determine these disputes. Refer the matters in variance to 
 any, rather than go to law about them before heathen judges. They are 
 trifles not worth contending about, and may easily be decided, if you 
 have first conquered your own spirits, and brought them into a truly 
 Christian temper. <I>Bear and forbear,</I> and the men of meanest skill 
 among you may end your quarrels. <I>I speak it to your shame,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, It is a shame that little quarrels should grow to such a head 
 among Christians, that they cannot be determined by arbitration of the 
 brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He puts them on a method to remedy this fault. And this 
 twofold:--

 1. By referring it to some to make it up: "<I>Is it so that there is no
 wise man among you, no one able to judge between his brethren?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 You who value yourselves so much upon your wisdom and knowledge, who 
 are so puffed up upon your extraordinary gifts and endowments, is there 
 none among you fit for this office, none that has wisdom enough to 
 judge in these differences? Must brethren quarrel, and the heathen 
 magistrate judge, in a church so famous as yours for knowledge and 
 wisdom? It is a reproach to you that quarrels should run so high, and 
 none of your wise men interpose to prevent them." Note, Christians 
 should never engage in law-suits till all other remedies have been 
 tried in vain. Prudent Christians should prevent, if possible, their 
 disputes, and not courts of judicature decide them, especially in 
 matters of no great importance. 

 2. By suffering wrong rather than taking this method to right
 themselves: <I>It is utterly a fault among you to go to law in this 
 matter:</I> it is always a fault of one side to go to law, except in a 
 case where the title is indeed dubious, and there is a friendly 
 agreement of both parties to refer it to the judgment of those learned 
 in the law to decide it. And this is referring it, rather than 
 contending about it, which is the thing the apostle here seems chiefly 
 to condemn: <I>Should you not rather take wrong, rather suffer 
 yourselves to be defrauded?</I> Note, A Christian should rather put up 
 with a little injury than tease himself, and provoke others, by a 
 litigious contest. The peace of his own mind, and the calm of his 
 neighbourhood, are more worth than victory in such a contest, or 
 reclaiming his own right, especially when the quarrel must be decided 
 by those who are enemies to religion. But the apostle tells them they 
 were so far from bearing injuries <I>that they actually did wrong, and 
 defrauded, and that their brethren.</I> Note, It is utterly a fault to 
 wrong and defraud any; but it is an aggravation of this fault to 
 defraud our Christian brethren. The ties of mutual love ought to be 
 stronger between them than between others. And <I>love worketh no ill 
 to his neighbour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:10">Rom. xiii. 10</A>.

 Those who love the brotherhood can never, under the influence of this
 principle, hurt or injure them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
 kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor
 idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
 themselves with mankind,
 &nbsp; 10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
 extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 11  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
 sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
 and by the Spirit of our God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here he takes occasion to warn them against many heinous evils, to 
 which they had been formerly addicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He puts it to them as a plain truth, of which they could not be 
 ignorant, that such sinners should not inherit the kingdom of God. The 
 meanest among them must know thus much, that <I>the unrighteous shall 
 not inherit the kingdom of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 shall not be owned as true members of his church on earth, nor admitted 
 as glorious members of the church in heaven. All unrighteousness is 
 sin; and all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin committed 
 deliberately, and not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. 
 He specifies several sorts of sins: against the first and second 
 commandments, as <I>idolaters;</I> against the seventh, as 
 <I>adulterers, fornicators, effeminate,</I> and <I>Sodomites;</I> 
 against the eighth, as <I>thieves</I> and <I>extortioners,</I> that by 
 force or fraud wrong their neighbours; against the ninth, as 
 <I>revilers;</I> and against the tenth, as <I>covetous and 
 drunkards,</I> as those who are in a fair way to break all the rest. 
 Those who knew any thing of religion must know that heaven could never 
 be intended for these. The scum of the earth are no ways fit to fill 
 the heavenly mansions. Those who do the devil's work can never receive 
 God's wages, at least no other than <I>death, the just wages of 
 sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:23">Rom. vi. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet he warns them against deceiving themselves: <I>Be not 
 deceived.</I> Those who cannot but know the fore-mentioned truth are 
 but too apt not to attend to it. Men are very much inclined to flatter 
 themselves that <I>God is such a one as themselves,</I> and that they 
 may live in sin and yet die in Christ, may lead the life of the devil's 
 children and yet go to heaven with the children of God. But this is all 
 a gross cheat. Note, It is very much the concern of mankind that they 
 do not cheat themselves in the matters of their souls. We cannot hope 
 to sow to the flesh and yet reap everlasting life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He puts them in mind what a change the gospel and grace of God had
 made in them: <I>Such were some of you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 such notorious sinners as he had been reckoning up. The Greek word is 
 <B><I>tauta</I></B>--<I>such things</I> were some of you, very monsters 
 rather than men. Note, Some that are eminently good after their 
 conversion have been as remarkably wicked before. <I>Quantum mutatus ab 
 illo!--How glorious a change does grace make!</I> It changes the vilest 
 of men into saints and the children of God. Such were some of you, but 
 you are not what you were. <I>You are washed, you are sanctified, you 
 are justified in the name of Christ, and by the Spirit of our God.</I> 
 Note, The wickedness of men before conversion is no bar to their 
 regeneration and reconciliation to God. The blood of Christ, and <I>the 
 washing of regeneration,</I> can purge away all guilt and defilement.
 Here is a rhetorical change of the natural order: <I>You are 
 sanctified, you are justified.</I> Sanctification is mentioned before 
 justification: and yet the name of Christ, by which we are justified, 
 is placed before the Spirit of God, by whom we are sanctified. Our 
 justification is owing to the merit of Christ; our sanctification to 
 the operation of the Spirit: but both go together. Note, None are 
 cleansed from the guilt of sin, and reconciled to God through Christ, 
 but those who are also sanctified by his Spirit. All who are made 
 righteous in the sight of God are made holy by the grace of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:12,13">twelfth verse 
 and former part of the thirteenth</A>

 seem to relate to that early dispute among Christians about the 
 distinction of meats, and yet to be prefatory to the caution that 
 follows against fornication. The connection seems plain enough if we 
 attend to the famous determination of the apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:19-29">Acts xv.</A>,

 where the prohibition of certain foods was joined with that of
 fornication. Now some among the Corinthians seem to have imagined that 
 they were as much at liberty in the point of fornication as of meats, 
 especially because it was not a sin condemned by the laws of their 
 country. They were ready to say, even in the case of fornication, 
 <I>All things are lawful for me.</I> This pernicious conceit Paul here 
 sets himself to oppose: he tells them that many things lawful in 
 themselves were not expedient at certain times, and under particular 
 circumstances; and Christians should not barely consider what is in 
 itself lawful to be done, but what is fit for them to do, considering 
 their profession, character, relations, and hopes: they should be very 
 careful that by carrying this maxim too far they be not brought into 
 bondage, either to a crafty deceiver or a carnal inclination. <I>All 
 things are lawful for me,</I> says he, <I>but I will not be brought 
 under the power of any,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Even in lawful things, he would not be subject to the impositions of a 
 usurped authority: so far was he from apprehending that in the things 
 of God it was lawful for any power on earth to impose its own 
 sentiments. Note, There is a liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, 
 in which we must stand fast. But surely he would never carry this 
 liberty so far as to put himself into the power of any bodily appetite.
 Though all meats were supposed lawful, he would not become a glutton 
 nor a drunkard. And much less would he abuse the maxim of lawful 
 liberty to countenance the sin of fornication, which, though it might 
 be allowed by the Corinthian laws, was a trespass upon the law of 
 nature, and utterly unbecoming a Christian. He would not abuse this 
 maxim about eating and drinking to encourage any intemperance, nor 
 indulge a carnal appetite: "<I>Though meats are for the belly and the 
 belly for meats</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 though the belly was made to receive food, and food was originally 
 ordained to fill the belly, yet if it be not convenient for me, and 
 much more if it be inconvenient, and likely to enslave me, if I am in 
 danger of being subjected to my belly and appetite, I will abstain. 
 <I>But God shall destroy both it and them,</I> at least as to their 
 mutual relation. There is a time coming when the human body will need 
 no further recruits of food." Some of the ancients suppose that this is 
 to be understood of abolishing the belly as well as the food; and that 
 though the same body will be raised at the great day, yet not with all 
 the same members, some being utterly unnecessary in a future state, as 
 the belly for instance, when the man is never to hunger, nor thirst, 
 nor eat, nor drink more. But, whether this be true or no, there is a 
 time coming when the need and use of food shall be abolished. Note, The 
 expectation we have of being without bodily appetites in a future life 
 is a very good argument against being under their power in the present 
 life. This seems to me the sense of the apostle's argument; and that 
 this passage is plainly to be connected with his caution against 
 fornication, though some make it a part of the former argument against 
 litigious law-suits, especially before heathen magistrates and the 
 enemies of true religion. These suppose that the apostle argues that
 though it may be lawful to claim our rights yet it is not always 
 expedient, and it is utterly unfit for Christians to put themselves 
 into the power of infidel judges, lawyers, and solicitors, on these 
 accounts. But this connection seems not so natural. The transition to
 his arguments against fornication, as I have laid it, seems very 
 natural: <I>But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and 
 the Lord for the body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Meats and the belly are for one another; not so fornication and the 
 body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord. This is the first 
 argument he uses against this sin, for which the heathen inhabitants of 
 Corinth were infamous, and the converts to Christianity retained too 
 favourable an opinion of it. It is making things to cross their 
 intention and use. The <I>body is not for fornication;</I> it was never 
 formed for any such purpose, <I>but for the Lord,</I> for the service 
 and honour of God. It is to be an instrument <I>of righteousness to 
 holiness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:19">Rom. vi. 19</A>),

 and therefore is never to be made an instrument of uncleanness. It is
 to be a member of Christ, and therefore must not be made the member of 
 a harlot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And <I>the Lord is for the body,</I> that is, as some think, Christ is 
 to be Lord of the body, to have property in it and dominion over it, 
 having assumed a body and been made to partake of our nature, that he 
 might be head of his church, and head over all things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5,18">Heb. ii. 5, 18</A>.
 
 Note, We must take care that we do not use what belongs to Christ as if
 it were our own, and much less to his dishonour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some understand this last passage, <I>The Lord is for the body,</I> 
 thus: He is for its resurrection and glorification, according to what 
 follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 which is a second argument against this sin, the honour intended to be 
 put on our bodies: <I>God hath both raised up our Lord, and will raise 
 us up by his power</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 by the power of him who <I>shall change our vile body, and make it like 
 to his glorious body by that power whereby he is able to subdue all 
 things to himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21">Phil. iii. 21</A>.

 It is an honour done to the body that Jesus Christ was raised from the
 dead: and it will be an honour to our bodies that they will be raised. 
 Let us not abuse those bodies by sin, and make them vile, which, if 
 they be kept pure, shall, notwithstanding their present vileness, be 
 made like to <I>Christ's glorious body.</I> Note, The hopes of a 
 resurrection to glory should restrain Christians from dishonouring 
 their bodies by fleshly lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A third argument is the honour already put on them: <I>Know you 
 not that your bodies are the members of Christ?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 If the soul be united to Christ by faith, the whole man is become a 
 member of his mystical body. The body is in union with Christ as well 
 as the soul. How honourable is this to the Christian! His very flesh
 is a part of the mystical body of Christ. Note, It is good to know in 
 what honourable relations we stand, that we may endeavour to become 
 them. <I>But now,</I> says the apostle, <I>shall I take the members of
 Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid.</I> Or, 
 <I>take away</I> the members of Christ? Would not this be a gross 
 abuse, and the most notorious injury? Would it not be dishonouring 
 Christ, and dishonouring ourselves to the very last degree? What, make 
 a Christ's members the members of a harlot, prostitute them to so vile 
 a purpose! The thought is to be abhorred. God forbid. <I>Know you not 
 that he who is joined to a harlot is one body</I> with hers? <I>For
 two,</I> says he, <I>shall be one flesh. But he who is joined to the 
 Lord is one spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Nothing can stand in greater opposition to the honourable relations and 
 alliances of a Christian man than this sin. He is joined to the Lord in 
 union with Christ, and made partaker by faith of his Spirit. One spirit 
 lives and breathes and moves in the head and members. Christ and his 
 faithful disciples are one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21,22">John xvii. 21, 22</A>.

 <I>But he that is joined to a harlot is one body, for two shall be one
 flesh,</I> by carnal conjunction, which was ordained of God only to be 
 in a married state. Now shall one in so close a union with Christ as to 
 be one spirit with him yet be so united to a harlot as to become one 
 flesh with her? Were not this a vile attempt to make a union between 
 Christ and harlots? And can a greater indignity he offered to him or 
 ourselves? Can any thing be more inconsistent with our profession or 
 relation? Note, The sin of fornication is a great injury in a Christian 
 to his head and lord, and a great reproach and blot on his profession. 
 It is no wonder therefore that the apostle should say, "<I>Flee 
 fornication</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 avoid it, keep out of the reach of temptations to it, of provoking 
 objects. Direct the eyes and mind to other things and thoughts."
 <I>Alia vitia pugnando, sola libido fugiendo vincitur--Other vices may 
 be conquered in fight, this only by flight;</I> so speak many of the 
 fathers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A fourth argument is that it is a sin against our own bodies. 
 <I>Every sin that a man does is without the body; he that committeth 
 fornication sinneth against his own body</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 every sin, that is, every other sin, every external act of sin besides, 
 is without the body. It is not so much an abuse of the body as of 
 somewhat else, as of wine by the drunkard, food by the glutton, &c. Nor 
 does it give the power of the body to another person. Nor does it so 
 much tend to the reproach of the body and render it vile. This sin is 
 in a peculiar manner styled uncleanness, pollution, because no sin has 
 so much external turpitude in it, especially in a Christian. He sins 
 against his own body; he defiles it, he degrades it, making it one with 
 the body of that vile creature with whom he sins. He casts vile 
 reproach on what he Redeemer has dignifies to the last degree by taking 
 it into union with himself. Note, We should not make our present vile 
 bodies more vile by sinning against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The fifth argument against this sin is that the bodies of Christians 
 are <I>the temples of the Holy Ghost which is in them, and which they 
 have of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He that is joined to Christ is one spirit. He is yielded up to him, is 
 consecrated thereby, and set apart for his use, and is hereupon 
 possessed, and occupied, and inhabited, by his Holy Spirit. This is the 
 proper notion of a temple--a place where God dwells, and sacred to his 
 use, by his own claim and his creature's surrender. Such temples real 
 Christians are of the Holy Ghost. Must he not therefore be God? But the 
 inference is plain that hence we are not our own. We are yielded up to 
 God, and possessed by and for God; nay, and this is virtue of a 
 purchase made of us: <I>You are bought with a price.</I> In short, our 
 bodies were made for God, they were purchased for him. If we are 
 Christians indeed they are yielded to him, and he inhabits and occupies 
 them by his Spirit: so that our bodies are not our own, but his. And 
 shall we desecrate his temple, defile it, prostitute it, and offer it 
 up to the use and service of a harlot? Horrid sacrilege! This is
 robbing God in the worst sense. Note, The temple of the Holy Ghost must 
 be kept holy. Our bodies must be kept as his whose they are, and fit 
 for his use and residence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostle argues from the obligation we are under <I>to glorify 
 God both with our body and spirit, which are his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He made both, he bought both, and therefore both belong to him and 
 should be used and employed for him, and therefore should not be 
 defiled, alienated from him, and prostituted by us. No, they must be 
 kept as vessels fitted for our Master's use. We must look upon our 
 whole selves as holy to the Lord, and must use our bodies as property 
 which belongs to him and is sacred to his use and service. We are to 
 honour <I>him with our bodies and spirits, which are his;</I> and 
 therefore, surely, must abstain from fornication; and not only from the 
 outward act, but from the <I>adultery of the heart,</I> as our Lord 
 calls it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28">Matt. v. 28</A>.
 
 Body and spirit are to be kept clean, that God may be honoured by both.
 But God is dishonoured when either is defiled by so beastly a sin.
 Therefore flee fornication, nay, and every sin. Use your bodies for the
 glory and service of their Lord and Maker. Note, We are not proprietors
 of ourselves, nor have power over ourselves, and therefore should not
 use ourselves according to our own pleasure, but according to his will,
 and for his glory, <I>whose we are, and whom we should serve,</I>
