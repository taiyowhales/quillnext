 The things contained in this chapter came in after the opening of the
 six seals, which foretold great calamities in the world; and before the
 sound of the seven trumpets, which gave notice of great corruptions
 arising in the church: between these comes in this comfortable chapter,
 which secures the graces and comforts of the people of God in times of
 common calamity. We have, 

 I. An account of the restraint laid upon the winds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The sealing of the servants of God,

 III. The songs of angels and saints on this occasion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 faithfully served Christ, and suffered for him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four
 corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that
 the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any
 tree.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
 seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
 four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
 &nbsp; 3  Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
 till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
 &nbsp; 4  And I heard the number of them which were sealed: <I>and there
 were</I> sealed a hundred <I>and</I> forty <I>and</I> four thousand of all
 the tribes of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5  Of the tribe of Juda <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the
 tribe of Reuben <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Gad <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand.
 &nbsp; 6  Of the tribe of Aser <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the
 tribe of Nepthalim <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Manasses <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand.
 &nbsp; 7  Of the tribe of Simeon <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the
 tribe of Levi <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Issachar <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand.
 &nbsp; 8  Of the tribe of Zabulon <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the
 tribe of Joseph <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Benjamin <I>were</I> sealed twelve thousand.
 &nbsp; 9  After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
 could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
 tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
 with white robes, and palms in their hands;
 &nbsp; 10  And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
 which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
 &nbsp; 11  And all the angels stood round about the throne, and <I>about</I>
 the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on
 their faces, and worshipped God,
 &nbsp; 12  Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and
 thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, <I>be</I> unto our God
 for ever and ever. Amen.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, I. An account of the restraint laid upon the winds. By 
 these winds we suppose are meant those errors and corruptions in 
 religion which would occasion a great deal of trouble and mischief to 
 the church of God. Sometimes the Holy Spirit is compared to the wind: 
 here the spirits of error are compared to <I>the four winds,</I> 
 contrary one to another, but doing much hurt to the church, the garden 
 and vineyard of God, breaking the branches and blasting the fruits of 
 his plantation. The devil is called <I>the prince of the power of the 
 air;</I> he, by a great wind, overthrew the house of Job's eldest son. 
 Errors are as wind, by which those who are unstable are shaken, and 
 carried <I>to and fro,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14">Eph. iv. 14</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. These are called <I>the winds of the earth,</I> because they blow
 only in these lower regions near the earth; heaven is always clear and
 free from them. 

 2. They are restrained by the ministry of angels, <I>standing on the
 four corners of the earth,</I> intimating that the spirit of error 
 cannot go forth till God permits it, and that the angels minister to 
 the good of the church by restraining its enemies.

 3. Their restraint was only for a season, and that was <I>till the
 servants of God were sealed in their foreheads.</I> God has a 
 particular care and concern for his own servants in times of temptation 
 and corruption, and he has a way to secure them from the common 
 infection; he first establishes them, and then he tries them; he has 
 the timing of their trials in his own hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the sealing of the servants of God, where observe, 

 1. To whom this work was committed--to an angel, <I>another angel.</I>
 While some of the angels were employed to restrain Satan and his 
 agents, another angel was employed to mark out and distinguish the 
 faithful servants of God. 

 2. How they were distinguished--the seal of God was set upon their 
 foreheads, a seal known to him, and as plain as if it appeared in their 
 foreheads; by this mark they were set apart for mercy and safety in the 
 worst of times. 
 
 3. The number of those that were sealed, where observe,

 (1.) A particular account of those that were sealed of the twelve 
 tribes of Israel--twelve thousand out of every tribe, the whole sum 
 amounting to <I>a hundred and forty-four thousand.</I> In this list the 
 tribe of Dan is omitted, perhaps because they were greatly addicted to 
 idolatry; and the order of the tribes is altered, perhaps according as 
 they had been more or less faithful to God. Some take these to be a 
 select number of the Jews who were reserved for mercy at the 
 destruction of Jerusalem; others think that time was past, and 
 therefore it is to be more generally applied to God's chosen remnant in 
 the world; but, if the destruction of Jerusalem was not yet over (and I 
 think it is hard to prove that it was), it seems more proper to 
 understand this of the remnant of that people which God had reserved 
 according to the election of grace, only here we have a definite number 
 for an indefinite. 

 (2.) A general account of those who were saved out of other nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>A great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and 
 kindreds, and people, and tongues.</I> Though these are not said to be 
 sealed, yet they were selected by God out of all nations, and brought 
 into his church, and there stood before the throne. Observe, 

 [1.] God will have a greater harvest of souls among the Gentiles than 
 he had among the Jews. <I>More are the children of the desolate than of 
 the married woman.</I>

 [2.] The Lord knows who are his, and he will keep them safe in times of 
 dangerous temptation.

 [3.] Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison of 
 the wicked world, yet it is no contemptible society, but really large 
 and to be still more enlarged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the songs of saints and angels on this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9-12"><I>v.</I> 9-12</A>,

 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The praises offered up by the saints (and, as it seems to me, by the 
 Gentile believers) for the care of God in reserving so large a remnant 
 of the Jews, and saving them from infidelity and destruction. The 
 Jewish church prayed for the Gentiles before their conversion, and the 
 Gentile churches have reason to bless God for his distinguishing mercy 
 to so many of the Jews, when the rest were cut off. Here observe, 

 (1.) The posture of these praising saints: they <I>stood before the 
 throne, and before the Lamb,</I> before the Creator and the Mediator. 
 In acts of religious worship we come nigh to God, and are to conceive 
 ourselves as in his special presence; and we must come to God by 
 Christ. The throne of God would be inaccessible to sinners were it not 
 for a Mediator. 

 (2.) Their habit: they were <I>clothed with white robes, and had palms 
 in their hands;</I> they were invested with the robes of justification, 
 holiness, and victory, and had palms in their hands, as conquerors used 
 to appear in their triumphs: such a glorious appearance will the 
 faithful servants of God make at last, when they have <I>fought the 
 good fight of faith and finished their course.</I> 

 (3.) Their employment: they <I>cried with a loud voice, saying, 
 Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</I> 
 This may be understood either as a <I>hosannah,</I> wishing well to the 
 interest of God and Christ in the church and in the world, or as a 
 <I>hallelujah,</I> giving to God and the Lamb the praise of the great 
 salvation; both the Father and the Son are joined together in these 
 praises; the Father contrived this salvation, the Son purchased it, and 
 those who enjoy it must and will bless the Lord and the Lamb, and they 
 will do it publicly, and with becoming fervour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the song of the angels 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 where observe, 

 (1.) Their station--<I>before the throne of God,</I> attending on him,
 and about the saints, ready to serve them. 

 (2.) Their posture, which is very humble, and expressive of the 
 greatest reverence: <I>They fell before the throne on their faces, and 
 worshipped God.</I> Behold the most excellent of all the creatures, who 
 never sinned, who are before him continually, not only covering their 
 faces, but falling down on their faces before the Lord! What humility
 then, and what profound reverence, become us vile frail creatures, when 
 we come into the presence of God! We should fall down before him; there 
 should be both a reverential frame of spirit and a humble behaviour in 
 all our addresses to God 

 (3.) Their praises. They consented to the praises of the saints, said 
 their <I>Amen</I> thereto; there is in heaven a perfect harmony between 
 the angels and saints; and then they added more of their own, 
 <I>saying, Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and 
 honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever.
 Amen.</I> Here, 

 [1.] They acknowledge the glorious attributes of God--his wisdom, his 
 power, and his might.

 [2.] They declare that for these his divine perfections he ought to be 
 blessed, and praised, and glorified, to all eternity; and they confirm 
 it by their <I>Amen.</I> We see what is the work of heaven, and we 
 ought to begin it now, to get our hearts tuned for it, to be much in 
 it, and to long for that world where our praises, as well as happiness, 
 will be perfected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are
 these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
 &nbsp; 14  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
 These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
 washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him
 day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne
 shall dwell among them.
 &nbsp; 16  They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
 shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
 &nbsp; 17  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
 them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and
 God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have a description of the honour and happiness of those who 
 have faithfully served the Lord Jesus Christ, and suffered for him.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A question asked by one of the elders, not for his own information, 
 but for John's instruction: ministers may learn from the people, 
 especially from aged and experienced Christians; the lowest saint in 
 heaven knows more than the greatest apostle in the world. Now the 
 question has two parts:--

 1. <I>What are these that are arrayed in white robes?</I> 

 2. <I>Whence came they?</I> It seems to be spoken by way of admiration, 
 as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:6">Cant. iii. 6</A>,

 <I>Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness!</I> Faithful 
 Christians deserve our notice and respect; we should <I>mark the 
 upright.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The answer returned by the apostle, in which he tacitly 
 acknowledges his own ignorance, and sues to this elder for information: 
 <I>Thou knowest.</I> Those who would gain knowledge must not be ashamed 
 to own their ignorance, nor to desire instruction from any that are 
 able to give it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account given to the apostle concerning that noble army of 
 martyrs who stood <I>before the throne of God in white robes,</I> with 
 palms of victory in their hands: and notice is taken here of, 

 1. The low and desolate state they had formerly been in; they had been
 in great tribulation, persecuted by men, tempted by Satan, sometimes 
 troubled in their own spirits; they had suffered the spoiling of their 
 goods, the imprisonment of their persons, yea, the loss of life itself.
 The way to heaven lies through many tribulations; but tribulation, how 
 great soever, shall not <I>separate us from the love of God.</I> 
 Tribulation, when gone through well, will make heaven more welcome and 
 more glorious. 

 2. The means by which they had been prepared for the great honour and 
 happiness they now enjoyed: they had <I>washed their robes, and made 
 them white in the blood of the Lamb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is not the blood of the martyrs themselves, but the blood of the 
 Lamb, that can wash away sin, and make the soul pure and clean in the 
 sight of God. Other blood stains; this is the only blood that makes the 
 robes of the saints white and clean. 

 3. The blessedness to which they are now advanced, being thus prepared
 for it.

 (1.) They are happy in their station, for <I>they are before the throne 
 of God night and day;</I> and he <I>dwells among them;</I> they are in 
 that presence where there is fulness of joy. 

 (2.) They are happy in their employment, for they serve God 
 continually, and that without weakness, drowsiness, or weariness. 
 Heaven is a state of service, though not of suffering; it is a state of 
 rest, but not of sloth; it is a praising delightful rest.

 (3.) They are happy in their freedom from all the inconveniences of 
 this present life. 

 [1.] From all want and sense of want: <I>They hunger and thirst no 
 more;</I> all their wants are supplied, and all the uneasiness caused 
 thereby is removed.

 [2.] From all sickness and pain: they shall never be scorched by <I>the 
 heat of the sun any more.</I>

 (4.) They are happy in the love and guidance of the Lord Jesus: <I>He 
 shall feed them, he shall lead them to living fountains of waters,</I> 
 he shall put them into the possession of every thing that is pleasant 
 and refreshing to their souls, and therefore <I>they shall hunger and 
 thirst no more.</I> 

 (5.) They are happy in being delivered from all sorrow or occasion of 
 it: <I>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</I> They have 
 formerly had their sorrows, and shed many tears, both upon the account 
 of sin and affliction; but God himself, with his own gentle and 
 gracious hand, will wipe those tears away, and they shall return no 
 more for ever; and they would not have been without those tears, when 
 God comes to wipe them away. In this he deals with them as a tender 
 father who finds his beloved child in tears, he comforts him, he wipes 
 his eyes, and turns his sorrow into rejoicing. This should moderate
 the Christian's sorrow in his present state, and support him under all 
 the troubles of it; for <I>those that sow in tears shall reap in joy; 
 and those that now go forth weeping, bearing precious seed, shall 
 doubtless come again rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with 
 them.</I></P>
