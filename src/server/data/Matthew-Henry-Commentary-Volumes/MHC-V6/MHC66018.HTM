 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And after these things I saw another angel come down from
 heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his
 glory.
 &nbsp; 2  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon
 the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
 devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
 unclean and hateful bird.
 &nbsp; 3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
 fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
 fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed
 rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
 &nbsp; 4  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
 her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
 receive not of her plagues.
 &nbsp; 5  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath
 remembered her iniquities.
 &nbsp; 6  Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her
 double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled
 fill to her double.
 &nbsp; 7  How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously,
 so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart,
 I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
 &nbsp; 8  Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
 mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire:
 for strong <I>is</I> the Lord God who judgeth her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The downfall and destruction of Babylon form an event so fully 
 determined in the counsels of God, and of such consequence to his 
 interests and glory, that the visions and predictions concerning it are 
 repeated. 

 1. Here is another angel sent from heaven, attended with great power
 and lustre,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had not only light in himself, to discern the truth of his own 
 prediction, but to inform and enlighten the world about that great 
 event; and not only light to discern it, but power to accomplish it. 

 2. This angel publishes the fall of Babylon, as a thing already come
 to pass; and this he does with a mighty strong voice, that all might 
 hear the cry, and might see how well this angel was pleased to be the 
 messenger of such tidings. Here seems to be an allusion to the 
 prediction of the fall of pagan Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:9">Isa. xxi. 9</A>),
 
 where the word is repeated as it is here: <I>has fallen, has 
 fallen.</I> Some have thought a double fall is hereby intended, first 
 her apostasy, and then her ruin; and they think the words immediately 
 following favour their opinion; <I>She has become the habitation of 
 devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every 
 unclean and hateful bird,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 But this is also borrowed from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:9">Isa. xxi. 9</A>,

 and seems to describe not so much her sin of entertaining idols (which
 are truly called <I>devils</I>) as her punishment, it being a common 
 notion that unclean spirits, as well as ominous and hateful birds, used 
 to haunt a city or house that lay in its ruins. 

 3. The reason of this ruin is declared

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 for, though God is not obliged to give any account of his matters, yet 
 he is pleased to do so, especially in those dispensations of providence 
 that are most awful and tremendous. The wickedness of Babylon had been 
 very great; for she had not only forsaken the true God herself, and set 
 up idols, but had with great art and industry drawn all sorts of men 
 into the spiritual adultery, and by her wealth and luxury had retained 
 them in her interest. 

 4. Fair warning is given to all that expect mercy from God, that they
 should not only <I>come out of her,</I> but be assisting in her 
 destruction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) God may have a people even in Babylon, some who belong to the 
 election of grace.

 (2.) God's people shall be called out of Babylon, and called 
 effectually. 

 (3.) Those that are resolved to partake with wicked men in their sins 
 must receive of their plagues.

 (4.) When the sins of a people reach up to heaven, the wrath of God 
 will reach down to the earth. 

 (5.) Though private revenge is forbidden, yet God will have his people 
 act under him, when called to it, in pulling down his and their 
 inveterate and implacable enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 (6.) God will proportion the punishment of sinners to the measure of 
 their wickedness, pride, and security, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 (7.) When destruction comes on a people suddenly, the surprise is a 
 great aggravation of their misery,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication
 and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for
 her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
 &nbsp; 10  Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,
 alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour
 is thy judgment come.
 &nbsp; 11  And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over
 her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
 &nbsp; 12  The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones,
 and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
 and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all
 manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and
 marble,
 &nbsp; 13  And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense,
 and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
 sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
 &nbsp; 14  And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
 thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed
 from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
 &nbsp; 15  The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
 shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and
 wailing,
 &nbsp; 16  And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in
 fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and
 precious stones, and pearls!
 &nbsp; 17  For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
 shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as
 many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
 &nbsp; 18  And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying,
 What <I>city is</I> like unto this great city!
 &nbsp; 19  And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
 wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made
 rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!
 for in one hour is she made desolate.
 &nbsp; 20  Rejoice over her, <I>thou</I> heaven, and <I>ye</I> holy apostles and
 prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
 &nbsp; 21  And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone,
 and cast <I>it</I> into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that
 great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at
 all.
 &nbsp; 22  And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
 trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no
 craftsman, of whatsoever craft <I>he be,</I> shall be found any more
 in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at
 all in thee;
 &nbsp; 23  And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in
 thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be
 heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
 men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
 &nbsp; 24  And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints,
 and of all that were slain upon the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A doleful lamentation made by Babylon's friends for her fall; and 
 here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who are the mourners, namely, those who had been bewitched by her 
 fornication, those who had been sharers in her sensual pleasures, and 
 those who had been gainers by her wealth and trade--the kings and the
 merchants of the earth: <I>the kings of the earth,</I> whom she had 
 flattered into idolatry by allowing them to be arbitrary and tyrannical 
 over their subjects, while they were obsequious to her; and <I>the 
 merchants,</I> that is, those who trafficked with her for indulgences, 
 pardons, dispensations, and preferments; these will mourn, because by 
 <I>this craft they got their wealth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the manner of their mourning. 

 (1.) They stood afar off, they durst not come nigh her. Even Babylon's 
 friends will stand at a distance from her fall. Though they had been 
 partakers with her in her sins, and in her sinful pleasures and 
 profits, they were not willing to bear a share in her plagues. 

 (2.) They made a grievous outcry: <I>Alas! alas! that great city,
 Babylon, that mighty city!</I> 

 (3.) They wept, and <I>cast dust upon their heads,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The pleasures of sin are but for a season, and they will end in dismal 
 sorrow. All those who rejoice in the success of the church's enemies 
 will share with them in their downfall; and those who have most 
 indulged themselves in pride and pleasure are the least able to bear 
 calamities; their sorrows will be as excessive as their pleasure and 
 jollity were before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What was the cause of their mourning; not their sin, but their 
 punishment. They did not lament their fall into idolatry, and luxury, 
 and persecution, but their fall into ruin--the loss of their traffic and
 of their wealth and power. The spirit of antichrist is a worldly 
 spirit, and their sorrow is a mere worldly sorrow; they did not lament 
 for the anger of God, that had now fallen upon them, but for the loss 
 of their outward comfort. We have a large schedule and inventory of the 
 wealth and merchandise of this city, all which was suddenly lost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),
 
 and lost irrecoverably
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>All things which were dainty and goodly have departed from thee, and 
 thou shalt find them no more at all.</I> The church of God may fall for 
 a time, but she shall rise again; but the fall of Babylon will be an 
 utter overthrow, like that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Godly sorrow is some 
 support under affliction, but mere worldly sorrow adds to the 
 calamity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the joy and triumph there was both in heaven and 
 earth at the irrecoverable fall of Babylon: while her own people were 
 bewailing her, the servants of God were called to <I>rejoice over 
 her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. How universal this joy would be: heaven and earth, angels and 
 saints, would join in it; that which is matter of rejoicing to the 
 servants of God in this world is matter of rejoicing to the angels in 
 heaven. 
 
 2. How just and reasonable; and that,

 (1.) Because the fall of Babylon was an act of God's vindictive 
 justice. God was then avenging his people's cause. They had committed 
 their cause to him <I>to whom vengeance belongs,</I> and now the year 
 of recompence had come for the controversies of Zion; and, though they 
 did not take pleasure in the miseries of any, yet they had reason to 
 rejoice in the discoveries of the glorious justice of God. 

 (2.) Because it was an irrecoverable ruin. This enemy should never 
 molest them any more, and of this they were assured by a remarkable 
 token 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 An <I>angel</I> from heaven <I>took up a stone like a great millstone, 
 and cast it into the sea, saying, "Thus shall Babylon be thrown down 
 with violence, and be found no more at all;</I> the place shall be no 
 longer habitable by man, no work shall be done there, no comfort 
 enjoyed, no light seen there, but utter darkness and desolation, as the 
 reward of her great wickedness, first in <I>deceiving the nations with 
 her sorceries,</I> and secondly in destroying and murdering those whom 
 she could not deceive," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Such abominable sins deserved so great a ruin.</P>
