 The apostle proceeds to further exhortations to several duties, to be 
 like-minded, and lowly-minded, which he presses from the example of
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>),

 to be diligent and serious in the Christian course

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),

 and to adorn their Christian profession by several suitable graces,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 He then concludes with particular notice and commendation of two good
 ministers, Timothy and Epaphroditus, whom he designed to send to them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  If <I>there be</I> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
 comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels
 and mercies,
 &nbsp; 2  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same
 love, <I>being</I> of one accord, of one mind.
 &nbsp; 3  <I>Let</I> nothing <I>be done</I> through strife or vainglory; but in
 lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
 &nbsp; 4  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on
 the things of others.
 &nbsp; 5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
 &nbsp; 6  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
 equal with God:
 &nbsp; 7  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
 of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
 &nbsp; 8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
 became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
 &nbsp; 9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
 name which is above every name:
 &nbsp; 10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <I>things</I>
 in heaven, and <I>things</I> in earth, and <I>things</I> under the earth;
 &nbsp; 11  And <I>that</I> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
 <I>is</I> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds in this chapter where he left off in the last, 
 with further exhortations to Christian duties. He presses them largely 
 to like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, in conformity to the example
 of the Lord Jesus, the great pattern of humility and love. Here we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great gospel precept passed upon us; that is, to love one 
 another. This is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, 
 the livery of his family. This he represents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 by being <I>like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of 
 one mind.</I> We are of a like mind when we have the same love. 
 Christians should be one in affection, whether they can be one in 
 apprehension or no. This is always in their power, and always their 
 duty, and is the likeliest way to bring them nearer in judgment. 
 <I>Having the same love.</I> Observe, The same love that we are 
 required to express to others, others are bound to express to us. 
 Christian love ought to be mutual love. Love, and you shall be loved. 
 <I>Being of one accord, and of one mind;</I> not crossing and 
 thwarting, or driving on separate interests, but unanimously agreeing 
 in the great things of God and keeping the <I>unity of the Spirit</I> 
 in other differences. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The pathetic pressing of the duty. He is very importunate with them, 
 knowing what an evidence it is of our sincerity, and what a means of 
 the preservation and edification of the body of Christ. The inducements 
 to brotherly love are these:--

 (1.) "If there is any <I>consolation in Christ.</I> Have you
 experienced consolation in Christ? Evidence that experience by loving 
 one another." The sweetness we have found in the doctrine of Christ 
 should sweeten our spirits. Do we expect consolation in Christ? If we
 would not be disappointed, we must love one another. If we have not
 consolation in Christ, where else can we expect it? Those who have an
 interest in Christ have consolation in him, strong and everlasting 
 consolation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:18,2Th+2:16">Heb. vi. 18; 2 Thess. ii. 16</A>),

 and therefore ought to love one another. 

 (2.) "<I>Comfort of love.</I> If there is any comfort in Christian 
 love, in God's love to you, in your love to God, or in your brethren's 
 love to us, in consideration of all this, be you like-minded. If you 
 have ever found that comfort, if you would find it, if you indeed 
 believe that the grace of love is a comfortable grace, abound in it." 
 
 (3.) "<I>Fellowship of the Spirit.</I> If there is such a thing as 
 communion with God and Christ by the Spirit, such a thing as the 
 communion of saints, by virtue of their being animated and actuated by 
 <I>one and the same Spirit,</I> be you like-minded; for Christian love 
 and like-mindedness will preserve to us our communion with God and with 
 one another." 

 (4.) "<I>Any bowels and mercies,</I> in God and Christ, towards you. If 
 you expect the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be you 
 compassionate one to another. If there is such a thing as mercy to be 
 found among the followers of Christ, if all who are sanctified have a 
 disposition to holy pity, make it appear this way." How cogent are 
 these arguments! One would think them enough to tame the most fierce,
 and mollify the hardest, heart.

 (5.) Another argument he insinuates is the comfort it would be to him: 
 <I>Fulfil you my joy.</I> It is the joy of ministers to see people 
 like-minded and living in love. He had been instrumental in bringing 
 them to the grace of Christ and the love of God. "Now," says he, "if 
 you have found any benefit by your participation of the gospel of 
 Christ, if you have any comfort in it, or advantage by it, <I>fulfil 
 the joy</I> of your poor minister, who preached the gospel to you."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He proposes some means to promote it. 

 (1.) <I>Do nothing through strife and vain glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There is no greater enemy to Christian love than pride and passion. If 
 we do things in contradiction to our brethren, this is doing them 
 through strife; if we do them through ostentation of ourselves, this is 
 doing them through vain-glory: both are destructive of Christian love 
 and kindle unchristian heats. Christ came to slay all enmities; 
 therefore let there not be among Christians a spirit of opposition. 
 Christ came to humble us, and therefore let there not be among us a 
 spirit of pride.

 (2.) We must <I>esteem others in lowliness of mind better than 
 ourselves,</I> be severe upon our own faults and charitable in our 
 judgments of others, be quick in observing our own defects and 
 infirmities, but ready to overlook and make favourable allowances for 
 the defects of others. We must esteem the good which is in others above 
 that which is in ourselves; for we best know our own unworthiness and 
 imperfections.

 (3.) We must interest ourselves in the concerns of others, not in a way 
 of curiosity and censoriousness, or as <I>busy-bodies in other men's 
 matters,</I> but in Christian love and sympathy: <I>Look not every man 
 on his own things, but every man also on the things of others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 A selfish spirit is destructive of Christian love. We must be concerned 
 not only for our own credit, and ease, and safety, but for those of 
 others also; and rejoice in the prosperity of others as truly as in our 
 own. We must love our neighbour as ourselves, and make his case our 
 own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a gospel pattern proposed to our imitation, and that is the 
 example of our Lord Jesus Christ: <I>Let this mind be in you which was 
 also in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Observe, Christians must be of Christ's mind. We must bear a 
 resemblance to his life, if we would have the benefit of his death. 
 <I>If we have not the Spirit of Christ, we are none of his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9">Rom. viii. 9</A>.

 Now what was the mind of Christ? He was eminently humble, and this is
 what we are peculiarly to learn of him. <I>Learn of me, for I am meek 
 and lowly in heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>.

 If we were lowly-minded, we should be like-minded; and, if we were like
 Christ, we should be lowly-minded. We must walk in the same spirit and 
 in the same steps with the Lord Jesus, who humbled himself to 
 sufferings and death for us; not only to satisfy God's justice, and pay 
 the price of our redemption, but to set us an example, and that we 
 might <I>follow his steps.</I> Now here we have the two natures and the 
 two states of our Lord Jesus. It is observable that the apostle, having 
 occasion to mention the Lord Jesus, and the mind which was in him, 
 takes the hint to enlarge upon his person, and to give a particular 
 description of him. It is a pleasing subject, and a gospel minister 
 needs not think himself out of the way when he is upon it; any fit 
 occasion should be readily taken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here are the two natures of Christ: his divine nature and his human 
 nature. 

 (1.) Here is his divine nature: <I>Who being in the form of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 partaking of the divine nature, as the eternal and only begotten Son of
 God. This agrees with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>,

 <I>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God:</I> it is
 of the same import with being the <I>image of the invisible</I> God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15">Col. i. 15</A>),

 and the <I>brightness of his glory, and express image of his 
 person,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 <I>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</I> did not think
 himself guilty of any invasion of what did not belong to him, or 
 assuming another's right. He said, <I>I and my Father are one,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:30">John x. 30</A>.

 It is the highest degree of robbery for any mere man or mere creature 
 to pretend to be equal with God, or profess himself <I>one with the 
 Father.</I> This is for a man to rob God, not in tithes and offerings, 
 but of the rights of his Godhead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8">Mal. iii. 8</A>.

 Some understand <I>being in the form of God</I>--<B><I>en morphe Theou
 hyparchon,</I></B> of his appearance in a divine majestic glory to the 
 patriarchs, and the Jews, under the Old Testament, which was often 
 called the <I>glory,</I> and the <I>Shechinah.</I> The word is used in 
 such a sense by the LXX. and in the New Testament. <I>He appeared to 
 the two disciples,</I> <B><I>en hetera morphe</I></B>--<I>In another 
 form,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:12">Mark xvi. 12</A>.

 <B><I>Metemorphothe</I></B>--<I>he was transfigured</I> before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:2">Matt. xvii. 2</A>.

 And <I>he thought it no robbery to be equal with God;</I> he did not
 greedily <I>catch at,</I> nor covet and affect to appear in that glory; 
 he laid aside the majesty of his former appearance while he was here on 
 earth, which is supposed to be the sense of the peculiar expression, 
 <B><I>ouk harpagmon hegesato.</I></B> Vid. <I>Bishop Bull's Def.</I> 
 cap. 2 sect. 4 et alibi, and <I>Whitby</I> in loc. 

 (2.) His human nature: He was <I>made in the likeness of men,</I> and 
 <I>found in fashion as a man.</I> He was really and truly man, <I>took 
 part of our flesh and blood,</I> appeared in the nature and habit of 
 man. And he voluntarily assumed human nature; it was his own act, and 
 by his own consent. We cannot say that our participation of the human
 nature is so. Herein he <I>emptied himself,</I> divested himself of the 
 honours and glories of the upper world, and of his former appearance, 
 to clothe himself with the rags of human nature. <I>He was in all 
 things like to us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here are his two estates, of humiliation and exaltation. 

 (1.) His estate of humiliation. He not only took upon him the likeness 
 and fashion of a man, but the <I>form of a servant,</I> that is, a man 
 of mean estate. He was not only God's servant whom he had chosen, but 
 he came to minister to men, and was among them as one who serveth in a 
 mean and servile state. One would think that the Lord Jesus, if he 
 would be a man, should have been a prince, and appeared in splendour.
 But quite the contrary: <I>He took upon him the form of a servant.</I> 
 He was brought up meanly, probably working with his supposed father at 
 his trade. His whole life was a life of humiliation, meanness, poverty, 
 and disgrace; he had nowhere to lay his head, lived upon alms, was a 
 <I>man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,</I> did not appear with 
 external pomp, or any marks of distinction from other men. This was the 
 humiliation of his life. But the lowest step of his humiliation was his 
 dying the death of the cross. <I>He became obedient to death, even the 
 death of the cross.</I> He not only suffered, but was actually and 
 voluntarily obedient; he obeyed the law which he brought himself under 
 as Mediator, and by which he was obliged to die. <I>I have power to lay 
 down my life, and I have power to take it again: this commandment have 
 I received of my Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18">John x. 18</A>.

 And he was <I>made under the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>.

 There is an emphasis laid upon the manner of his dying, which had in it
 all the circumstances possible which are humbling: <I>Even the death of 
 the cross,</I> a cursed, painful, and shameful death,--a death accursed 
 by the law (<I>Cursed is he that hangeth on a tree</I>)--full of pain, 
 the body nailed through the nervous parts (the hands and feet) and 
 hanging with all its weight upon the cross,--and the death of a 
 malefactor and a slave, not of a free-man,--exposed as a public 
 spectacle. Such was the condescension of the blessed Jesus. 

 (2.) His exaltation: <I>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him.</I> 
 His exaltation was the reward of his humiliation. Because he humbled 
 himself, God exalted him; and he <I>highly exalted him,</I> 
 <B><I>hyperypsose,</I></B> raised him to an exceeding height. He 
 exalted his whole person, the human nature as well as the divine; for 
 he is spoken of as being in the form of God as well as in the fashion 
 of man. As it respects the divine nature, it could only be the 
 recognizing of his rights, or the display and appearance of the 
 <I>glory he had with the Father before the world was</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5">John xvii. 5</A>),

 not any new acquisition of glory; and so the Father himself is said to
 be exalted. But the proper exaltation was of his human nature, which
 alone seems to be capable of it, though in conjunction with the divine.
 His exaltation here is made to consist in honour and power. In honour;
 so <I>he had a name above every name,</I> a title of dignity above all
 the creatures, men and angels. And in power: <I>Every knee must bow to
 him.</I> The whole creation must be in subjection to him: <I>things in
 heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,</I> the
 inhabitants of heaven and earth, the living and the dead. <I>At the
 name of Jesus;</I> not at the sound of the word, but the authority of
 Jesus; all should pay a solemn homage. And that <I>every tongue should
 confess that Jesus Christ is Lord</I>--every nation and language should
 publicly own the universal empire of the exalted Redeemer, and that
 <I>all power in heaven and earth is given to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18">Matt. xxviii. 18</A>.
 
 Observe the vast extent of the kingdom of Christ; it reaches to heaven
 and earth, and to all the creatures in each, to angels as well as men, 
 and to the dead as well as the living.--<I>To the glory of God the 
 Father.</I> Observe, It is to the glory of God the Father to confess 
 that Jesus Christ is Lord; for it is his will that <I>all men should 
 honour the Son as they honour the Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:23">John v. 23</A>.

 Whatever respect is paid to Christ redounds to the honour of the
 Father. <I>He who receiveth me receiveth him who sent me,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:40">Matt. x. 40</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
 my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your
 own salvation with fear and trembling.
 &nbsp; 13  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
 <I>his</I> good pleasure.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He exhorts them to diligence and seriousness in the Christian
 course: <I>Work out your own salvation.</I> It is the salvation of our 
 souls 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:9">1 Pet. i. 9</A>),

 and our eternal salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:9">Heb. v. 9</A>),

 and contains deliverance from all the evils sin had brought upon us and 
 exposed us to, and the possession of all good and whatsoever is 
 necessary to our complete and final happiness. Observe, It concerns us 
 above all things to secure the welfare of our souls: whatever becomes 
 of other things, let us take care of our best interests. It is our own 
 salvation, the salvation of our own souls. It is not for us to judge 
 other people; we have enough to do to look to ourselves; and, though we 
 must promote the common salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">
 Jude 3</A>)

 as much as we can, yet we must upon no account neglect our own. We are
 required to <I>work out our salvation,</I> <B><I>katergazesthe.</I></B> 
 The word signifies <I>working thoroughly</I> at a thing, and taking 
 <I>true pains.</I> Observe, We must be diligent in the use of all the 
 means which conduce to our salvation. We must not only work at our 
 salvation, by doing something now and then about it; but we must work 
 out our salvation, by doing all that is to be done, and persevering 
 therein to the end. Salvation is the great thing we should mind, and
 set our hearts upon; and we cannot attain salvation without the utmost 
 care and diligence. He adds, <I>With fear and trembling,</I> that is,
 with great care and circumspection: "Trembling for fear lest you 
 miscarry and come short. Be careful to do every thing in religion in
 the best manner, and fear lest under all your advantages you should so 
 much as <I>seem to come short,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 Fear is a great guard and preservative from evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He urges this from the consideration of their readiness always to 
 obey the gospel: "<I>As you have always obeyed, not as in my presence 
 only, but now much more in my absence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 You have been always willing to comply with every discovery of the will 
 of God; and that in my absence as well as presence. You make it to 
 appear that regard to Christ, and care of your souls, sway more with 
 you than any mode of showing respect whatsoever." They were not merely 
 awed by the apostle's presence, but did it even <I>much more in his 
 absence.</I> "And because <I>it is God who worketh in you,</I> do you 
 work out your salvation. Work, for he worketh." It should encourage us
 to do our utmost, because our <I>labour shall not be in vain.</I> God 
 is ready to concur with his grace, and assist our faithful endeavours. 
 Observe, Though we must use our utmost endeavours in working out our 
 salvation, yet still we must go forth, and go on, in a dependence upon 
 the grace of God. His grace works in us in a way suitable to our 
 natures, and in concurrence with our endeavours; and the operations of 
 God's grace in us are so far from excusing, that they are intended to 
 quicken and engage our endeavours. "And work out our salvation <I>with
 fear and trembling,</I> for <I>he worketh in you.</I>" All our working 
 depends upon his working in us. "Do not trifle with God by neglects
 and delays, lest you provoke him to withdraw his help, and all your 
 endeavours prove in vain. Work with <I>fear,</I> for he works of his 
 <I>good pleasure."--To will and to do:</I> he gives the whole ability. 
 It is the grace of God which inclines the will to that which is good: 
 and then enables us to perform it, and to act according to our 
 principles. <I>Thou hast wrought all our works in us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:12">Isa. xxvi. 12</A>.
 
 <I>Of his good pleasure.</I> As there is no strength in us, so there is
 no merit in us. As we cannot act without God's grace, so we cannot 
 claim it, nor pretend to deserve it. God's good will to us is the
 cause of his good work in us; and he is under no engagements to his 
 creatures, but those of his gracious promise.</P>

 The apostle exhorts them in these verses to adorn their Christian 
 profession by a suitable temper and behaviour, in several instances. 

 1. By a cheerful obedience to the commands of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Do all things,</I> do your duty in every branch of it, <I>without
 murmurings.</I> Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, 
 and do not quarrel with it." God's commands were given to be obeyed, 
 not to be disputed. This greatly adorns our profession, and shows we 
 serve a good Master, whose service is freedom and whose work is its own 
 reward. 

 2. By peaceableness and love one to another. "Do all things <I>without
 disputing,</I> wrangling, and debating one another; because the light 
 of truth and the life of religion are often lost in the heats and mists 
 of disputation." 
 
 3. By a blameless conversation towards all men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without 
 rebuke;</I> that you be not injurious to any in word or deed, and give 
 no just occasion of offence." We should endeavour not only to be 
 harmless, but to be blameless; not only not to do hurt, but not to come 
 under the just suspicion of it. <I>Blameless and sincere;</I> so some 
 read it. Blameless before men, sincere towards God. The <I>sons of 
 God.</I> It becomes those to be blameless and harmless who stand in 
 such a relation, and are favoured with such a privilege. The children 
 of God should differ from the sons of men. <I>Without
 rebuke</I>--<B><I>amometa.</I></B> Momus was a carping deity among the 
 Greeks, mentioned by Hesiod and Lucian, who did nothing himself, and 
 found fault with every body and every thing. From him all carpers at 
 other men, and rigid censurers of their works, were called <I>Momi.</I> 
 The sense of the expression is, "Walk so circumspectly that Momus 
 himself may have no occasion to cavil at you, that the severest 
 censurer may find no fault with you." We should aim and endeavour, not 
 only to get to heaven, but to get thither without a blot; and, like 
 Demetrius, to <I>have a good report of all men, and of the truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:12">3 John 12</A>.

 <I>In the midst of a crooked and perverse generation;</I> that is,
 among the heathens, and those who are without. Observe, Where there is
 no true religion, little is to be expected but crookedness and
 perverseness; and the more crooked and perverse others are among whom
 we live, and the more apt to cavil, the more careful we should be to
 keep ourselves blameless and harmless. Abraham and Lot must not
 <I>strive, because the Canaanite and Perizzite dwelt in the land,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:7">Gen. xiii. 7</A>.

 <I>Among whom you shine as lights in the world.</I> Christ is the light
 of the world, and good Christians are lights in the world. When God
 raises up a good man in any place, he sets up a light in that place. Or
 it may be read imperatively: <I>Among whom shine you as lights:</I>
 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>,

 <I>Let your light so shine before men.</I> Christians should endeavour
 not only to approve themselves to God, but to recommend themselves to 
 others, that they may also glorify God. They must shine as well as be 
 sincere.--<I>Holding forth the word of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The gospel is called the word of life because it reveals and proposes 
 to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. <I>Life and immortality are 
 brought to light by the gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10">2 Tim. i. 10</A>.

 It is our duty not only to hold fast, but to hold forth the word of
 life; not only to hold it fast for our own benefit, but to hold it 
 forth for the benefit of others, to hold it forth as the candlestick 
 holds forth the candle, which makes it appear to advantage all around, 
 or as the luminaries of the heavens, which shed their influence far and 
 wide. This Paul tells them would be his joy: "<I>That I may rejoice in 
 the day of Christ;</I> not only rejoice in your stedfastness, but in 
 your usefulness." He would have them think his pains well bestowed, and 
 that <I>he had not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</I> Observe,

 (1.) The work of the ministry requires the putting forth of the whole 
 man: all that is within us is little enough to be employed in it; as in 
 running and labouring. Running denotes vehemence and vigour, and 
 continual pressing forward; labour denotes constancy and close 
 application. 

 (2.) It is a great joy to ministers when they perceive that they have 
 not <I>run in vain, nor laboured in vain;</I> and it will be their 
 rejoicing in the day of Christ, when their converts will be their 
 crown. <I>What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even 
 you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For you
 are our glory and joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:19,20">1 Thess. ii. 19, 20</A>.

 The apostle not only ran and laboured for them with satisfaction, but
 shows that he was ready to suffer for their good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your 
 faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.</I> He could reckon himself 
 happy if he could promote the honour of Christ, the edification of the 
 church, and the welfare of the souls of men; though it were not only by 
 hazarding, but by laying down, his life: he could willingly be a 
 sacrifice at their altars, to serve the faith of God's elect. Could 
 Paul think it worth while to shed his blood for the service of the 
 church, and shall we think it much to take a little pains? Is not that 
 worth our labour which he thought worth his life? <I>If I be 
 offered,</I> or <I>poured</I> out as the wine of the 
 <I>drink-offerings,</I> <B><I>spendomai.</I></B>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6">2 Tim. iv. 6</A>,

 <I>I am now ready to be offered.</I> He could rejoice to seal his 
 doctrine with his blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>For the same cause also do you joy and rejoice with me.</I> It is 
 the will of God that good Christians should be much in rejoicing; and 
 those who are happy in good ministers have a great deal of reason to 
 joy and rejoice with them. If the minister loves the people, and is 
 willing to spend and be spent for their welfare, the people have reason 
 to love the minister and to <I>joy and rejoice with him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1> 19  But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
 you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
 &nbsp; 20  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for
 your state.
 &nbsp; 21  For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
 Christ's.
 &nbsp; 22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the
 father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
 &nbsp; 23  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall
 see how it will go with me.
 &nbsp; 24  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come
 shortly.
 &nbsp; 25  Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
 brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your
 messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
 &nbsp; 26  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness,
 because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
 &nbsp; 27  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
 him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have
 sorrow upon sorrow.
 &nbsp; 28  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see
 him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
 &nbsp; 29  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and
 hold such in reputation:
 &nbsp; 30  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
 regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul takes particular notice of two good ministers; for though he was 
 himself a great apostle, and <I>laboured more abundantly than they 
 all,</I> yet he took all occasions to speak with respect of those who 
 were far his inferiors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He speaks of Timothy, whom he intended to send to the Philippians, 
 that he might have an account of their state. See Paul's care of the 
 churches, and the comfort he had in their well-doing. He was in pain 
 when he had not heard of them for a good while, and therefore would 
 send Timothy to enquire, and bring him an account: <I>For I have no man 
 like-minded, who will naturally care for your state.</I> Timothy was a 
 non-such. There were, no doubt, many good ministers, who were in care 
 for the souls of those for whom they preached; but none comparable to 
 Timothy, a man of an excellent spirit and tender heart. <I>Who will 
 naturally care for your state.</I> Observe, It is best with us when our 
 duty becomes in a manner natural to us. Timothy was a genuine son of 
 blessed Paul, and walked in the same spirit and the same steps. 
 <I>Naturally,</I> that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only: with a 
 willing heart and upright view, so agreeably to the make of his mind. 
 Note, 

 1. It is the duty of ministers to care for the state of their people
 and be concerned for their welfare: <I>I seek not yours, but you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:14">2 Cor. xii. 14</A>.

 2. It is a rare thing to find one who does it naturally: such a one is
 remarkable and distinguished among his brethren. <I>All seek their own, 
 not the things which are Jesus Christ's,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Did Paul say this in haste, as David said, <I>All men are liars?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:11">Ps. cxvi. 11</A>.

 Was there so general a corruption among ministers so early that there 
 was not one among them who cared for the state of their people? We must 
 not understand it so: he means the generality; <I>all,</I> that is, 
 either the most, or all in comparison of Timothy. Note, Seeking our
 own interest to the neglect of Jesus Christ is a very great sin, and 
 very common among Christians and ministers. Many prefer their own 
 credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty, the things 
 of their own pleasure and reputation before the things of Christ's 
 kingdom and his honour and interest in the world: but Timothy was none 
 of these.--<I>You know the proof of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Timothy was a man who had been tried, and had made <I>full proof of his 
 ministry</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:5">2 Tim. iv. 5</A>),

 and was faithful in all that befel him. All the churches with whom he 
 had acquaintance knew the proof of him. He was a man as good as he 
 seemed to be; and <I>served Christ so as to be acceptable to God,</I> 
 and <I>approved of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:18">Rom. xiv. 18</A>.

 "You not only know the name of him, and the face of him, but the proof
 of him, and have experienced his affection and fidelity in your 
 service," <I>that, as a son with a father, he hath served with me in 
 the gospel.</I> He was Paul's assistant in many places where he 
 preached, and served with him in the gospel with all the dutiful 
 respect which a child pays to a father, and with all the love and 
 cheerfulness with which a child is serviceable to his father. Their 
 ministrations together were with great respect on the one side and 
 great tenderness and kindness on the other--an admirable example to 
 elder and younger ministers united in the same service. Paul designed 
 to send him shortly: <I>Him therefore I hope to send presently, as soon 
 as I shall see how it will go with me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He was now a prisoner, and did not know what would be the issue; but, 
 according as it turned, he would dispose of Timothy. Nay, he hoped to
 come himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</I> 
 He hoped he should soon be set at liberty, and be able to pay them a 
 visit. Paul desired his liberty, not that he might take his pleasure, 
 but that he might do good.--<I>I trust in the Lord.</I> He expresses 
 his hope and confidence of seeing them, with a humble dependence and 
 submission to the divine will. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:21,1Co+4:19,Jam+4:15,Heb+6:3">Acts xviii. 21; 
 1 Cor. iv. 19; James iv. 15; and Heb. vi. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning Epaphroditus, whom he calls <I>his brother, and 
 companion in labour, and fellow-soldier,</I> his Christian brother, to 
 whom he bore a tender affection,--his companion in the work and
 sufferings of the gospel, who submitted to the same labours and 
 hardships with himself,--and their messenger, one who was sent by them
 to him, probably to consult him about some affairs relating to their 
 church, or to bring a present from them for his relief for he adds, and 
 <I>who ministered to my wants.</I> He seems to be the same who is 
 called <I>Epaphras,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:12">Col. iv. 12</A>.

 He had an earnest desire to come to them, and Paul was willing he 
 should. It seems, 

 1. Epaphroditus had been sick: <I>They had heard that he had been
 sick,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 And <I>indeed he was sick, nigh unto death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Sickness is a calamity common to men, to good men and ministers. But 
 why did not the apostle heal him, who was endued with a power of curing 
 diseases, as well as raising the dead? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:10">Acts xx. 10</A>.

 Probably because that was intended as a sign to others, and to confirm
 the truth of the gospel, and therefore needed not be exercised one 
 towards another. <I>These signs shall follow those who believe, they
 shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17,18">Mark xvi. 17, 18</A>.

 And perhaps they had not that power at all times, and at their own
 discretion, but only when some great end was to be served by it, and 
 when God saw fit. It was proper to Christ, who had <I>the Spirit above 
 measure.</I> 

 2. The Philippians were exceedingly sorry to hear of his sickness. They
 were full of heaviness, as well as he, upon the tidings of it: for he 
 was one, it seems, for whom they had a particular respect and 
 affection, and thought fit to choose out to send to the apostle. 

 3. It pleased God to recover and spare him: <I>But God had mercy on
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The apostle owns it is a great mercy to himself, as well as to 
 Epaphroditus and others. Though the church was blessed at that time 
 with extraordinary gifts, they could even then ill spare a good 
 minister. He was sensibly touched with the thoughts of so great a loss: 
 <I>Lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow;</I> that is, "Lest, besides 
 the sorrow of my own imprisonment, I should have the sorrow of his 
 death." Or perhaps some other good ministers had died lately, which had 
 been a great affliction to him: and, if this had died now, it would 
 have been a fresh grief to him, and <I>sorrow added to sorrow.</I> 

 4. Epaphroditus was willing to pay a visit to the Philippians, that he
 might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was 
 sick: "<I>That when you see him again you may rejoice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 that you may yourselves see how well he has recovered, and what reason 
 you have for the thankfulness and joy upon his account." He gave 
 himself the pleasure of comforting them by the sight of so dear a 
 friend. 

 5. Paul recommends him to their esteem and affection: "<I>Receive him
 therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such in 
 reputation:</I> account such men valuable, who are zealous and 
 faithful, and let them be highly loved and regarded. Show your joy and 
 respect by all the expressions of hearty affection and good opinion." 
 It seems he had caught his illness in the work of God: <I>It was for 
 the work of Christ that he was nigh to death, and to supply their lack 
 of service to him.</I> The apostle does not blame him for his 
 indiscretion in hazarding his life, but reckons they ought to love him 
 the more upon that account. Observe,

 (1.) Those who truly love Christ, and are hearty in the interests of 
 his kingdom, will think it very well worth their while to hazard their 
 health and life to do him service, and promote the edification of his 
 church. 

 (2.) They were to receive him with joy, as newly recovered from 
 sickness. It is an endearing consideration to have our mercies restored 
 to us after danger of removal, and should make them the more valued and 
 improved. What is given us in answer to prayer should be received with 
 great thankfulness and joy.</P>
