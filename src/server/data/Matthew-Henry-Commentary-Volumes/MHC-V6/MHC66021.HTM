 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto the prophecy of this book has presented to us a very 
 remarkable mixture of light and shade, prosperity and adversity, mercy 
 and judgment, in the conduct of divine Providence towards the church in 
 the world: now, at the close of all, the day breaks, and the shadows
 flee away; a new world now appears, the former having passed away. Some 
 are willing to understand all that is said in these last two chapters 
 of the state of the church even here on earth, in the glory of the 
 latter days; but others, more probably, take it as a representation of 
 the perfect and triumphant state of the church in heaven. Let but the 
 faithful saints and servants of God wait awhile, and they shall not 
 only see, but enjoy, the perfect holiness and happiness of that world.
 In this chapter you have, 

 I. An introduction to the vision of the new Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. The vision itself,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
 and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
 &nbsp; 2  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
 God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
 &nbsp; 3  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
 tabernacle of God <I>is</I> with men, and he will dwell with them, and
 they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,
 <I>and be</I> their God.
 &nbsp; 4  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
 shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
 there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
 &nbsp; 5  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
 things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true
 and faithful.
 &nbsp; 6  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
 beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of
 the fountain of the water of life freely.
 &nbsp; 7  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be
 his God, and he shall be my son.
 &nbsp; 8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
 murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
 all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
 fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a more general account of the happiness of the church of 
 God in the future state, by which it seems most safe to understand the 
 heavenly state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A new world now opens to our view 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I saw a new heaven and a new earth;</I> that is, a new universe; for 
 we suppose the world to be made up of heaven and earth. By the new 
 earth we may understand a new state for the bodies of men, as well as a 
 heaven for their souls. This world is not now newly created, but newly
 opened, and filled with all those who were the heirs of it. The new 
 heaven and the new earth will not then be distinct; the very earth of 
 the saints, their glorified bodies, will now be spiritual and heavenly, 
 and suited to those pure and bright mansions. To make way for the 
 commencement of this new world, the old world, with all its troubles 
 and commotions, <I>passed away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In this new world the apostle <I>saw the holy city, the new 
 Jerusalem, coming down from heaven,</I> not locally, but as to its 
 original: this new Jerusalem is the church of God in its new and 
 perfect state, <I>prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,</I> 
 beautified with all perfection of wisdom and holiness, meet for the 
 full fruition of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The blessed presence of God with his people is here proclaimed and 
 admired: <I>I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the 
 tabernacle of God is with men,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The presence of God with his church is the glory of the church. 

 2. It is matter of wonder that a holy God should ever dwell with any
 of the children of men. 

 3. The presence of God with his people in heaven will not be
 interrupted as it is on earth, but he will dwell with them continually.
 
 4. The covenant, interest, and relation, that there are now between God
 and his people, will be filled up and perfected in heaven. <I>They 
 shall be his people;</I> their souls shall be assimilated to him, 
 filled with all the love, honour, and delight in God which their 
 relation to him requires, and this will constitute their perfect 
 holiness; and he will be their God: <I>God himself will be their 
 God;</I> his immediate presence with them, his love fully manifested to 
 them, and his glory put upon them, will be their perfect happiness; 
 then he will fully answer the character of the relation on his part, as 
 they shall do on their part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This new and blessed state will be free from all trouble and
 sorrow; for, 

 1. All the effects of former trouble shall be done away. They have
 been often before in tears, by reason of sin, of affliction, of the 
 calamities of the church; but now <I>all tears shall be wiped away;</I> 
 no signs, no remembrance of former sorrows shall remain, any further 
 than to make their present felicity the greater. God himself, as their 
 tender Father, with his own kind hand, <I>shall wipe away the tears</I> 
 of his children; and they would not have been without those tears when 
 God shall come and wipe them away. 

 2. All the causes of future sorrow shall be for ever removed: <I>There
 shall be neither death nor pain;</I> and therefore <I>no sorrow nor 
 crying;</I> these are things incident to that state in which they were 
 before, but now all <I>former things have passed away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The truth and certainty of this blessed state are ratified by the
 word and promise of God, and ordered to be committed to writing, as 
 matter of perpetual record, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The subject-matter of this vision is so great, and of such great 
 importance to the church and people of God, that they have need of the 
 fullest assurances of it; and God therefore from heaven repeats and 
 ratifies the truth thereof. Besides, many ages must pass between the 
 time when this vision was given forth and the accomplishment of it, and 
 many great trials must intervene; and therefore God would have it 
 committed to writing, for perpetual memory, and continual use to his 
 people. Observe, 

 1. The certainty of the promise averred: <I>These words are faithful
 and true;</I> and it follows, <I>It is done,</I> is as sure as if it 
 were done already. We may and ought to take God's promise as present 
 payment; if he has said that he <I>makes all things new, it is 
 done.</I> 

 2. He gives us his titles of honour as a pledge or surety of the full 
 performance, even those titles of <I>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and 
 the end.</I> As it was his glory that he gave the rise and beginning to 
 the world and to his church, it will be his glory to finish the work 
 begin, and not to leave it imperfect. As his power and will were the
 first cause of all things, his pleasure and glory are the last end, and 
 he will not lose his design; for then he would no longer be the 
 <I>Alpha and Omega.</I> Men may begin designs which they can never 
 bring to perfection; but <I>the counsel of God shall stand,</I> and he 
 will do all his pleasure. 

 3. The desires of his people towards this blessed state furnish another
 evidence of the truth and certainty of it. They thirst after a state of 
 sinless perfection and the uninterrupted enjoyment of God, and God has 
 wrought in them these longing desires, which cannot be satisfied with 
 any thing else, and therefore would be the torment of the soul if they 
 were disappointed but it would be inconsistent with the goodness of 
 God, and his love to his people, to create in them holy and heavenly 
 desires, and then deny them their proper satisfaction; and therefore 
 they may be assured that, when they have overcome their present 
 difficulties, <I>he will give them of the fountain of the water of life 
 freely.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The greatness of this future felicity is declared and illustrated, 
 
 1. By the freeness of it--it is the free gift of God: <I>He gives of the
 water of life freely;</I> this will not make it less but more grateful 
 to his people. 

 2. The fulness of it. The people of God then lie at the fountain-head
 of all blessedness: they <I>inherit all things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 enjoying God, they enjoy all things. He is all in all. 

 3. By the tenure and title by which they enjoy this blessedness--by
 right of inheritance, as <I>the sons of God,</I> a title of all others 
 the most honourable, as resulting from so near and endeared a relation 
 to God himself, and the most sure and indefeasible, that can no more 
 cease than the relation from which it results. 

 4. By the vastly different state of the wicked. Their misery helps to
 illustrate the glory and blessedness of the saints, and the 
 distinguishing goodness of God towards them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) The sins of those who perish, among which are first mentioned 
 their cowardliness and unbelief. <I>The fearful</I> lead the van in 
 this black list. They durst not encounter the difficulties of religion, 
 and their slavish fear proceeded from their unbelief; but those who 
 were so dastardly as not to dare to take up the cross of Christ, and 
 discharge their duty to him, were yet so desperate as to run into all 
 manner of abominable wickedness--<I>murder, adultery, sorcery, 
 idolatry,</I> and <I>lying.</I> 

 (2.) Their punishment: <I>They have their part in the lake that burns 
 with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</I> 

 [1.] They could not burn at a stake for Christ, but they must burn in 
 hell for sin.

 [2.] They must die another death after their natural death; the agonies 
 and terrors of the first death will consign them over to the far 
 greater terrors and agonies of eternal death, to die and to be always 
 dying.

 [3.] This misery will be their proper part and portion, what they have 
 justly deserved, what they have in effect chosen, and what they have 
 prepared themselves for by their sins. Thus the misery of the damned 
 will illustrate the blessedness of those that are saved, and the 
 blessedness of the saved will aggravate the misery of those that are 
 damned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
 seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,
 saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.
 &nbsp; 10  And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
 mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
 descending out of heaven from God,
 &nbsp; 11  Having the glory of God: and her light <I>was</I> like unto a
 stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
 &nbsp; 12  And had a wall great and high, <I>and</I> had twelve gates, and
 at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
 <I>the names</I> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 13  On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the
 south three gates; and on the west three gates.
 &nbsp; 14  And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
 the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 &nbsp; 15  And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
 city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
 &nbsp; 16  And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as
 the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
 thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of
 it are equal.
 &nbsp; 17  And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred <I>and</I> forty
 <I>and</I> four cubits, <I>according to</I> the measure of a man, that is,
 of the angel.
 &nbsp; 18  And the building of the wall of it was <I>of</I> jasper: and the
 city <I>was</I> pure gold, like unto clear glass.
 &nbsp; 19  And the foundations of the wall of the city <I>were</I> garnished
 with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation <I>was</I>
 jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the
 fourth, an emerald;
 &nbsp; 20  The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
 chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a
 chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
 &nbsp; 21  And the twelve gates <I>were</I> twelve pearls; every several
 gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city <I>was</I> pure
 gold, as it were transparent glass.
 &nbsp; 22  And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and
 the Lamb are the temple of it.
 &nbsp; 23  And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
 shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
 <I>is</I> the light thereof.
 &nbsp; 24  And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the
 light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and
 honour into it.
 &nbsp; 25  And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for
 there shall be no night there.
 &nbsp; 26  And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations
 into it.
 &nbsp; 27  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
 defileth, neither <I>whatsoever</I> worketh abomination, or <I>maketh</I> a
 lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have already considered the introduction to the vision of the new 
 Jerusalem in a more general idea of the heavenly state; we now come to 
 the vision itself, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The person that opened the vision to the apostle--<I>one of the seven
 angels, that had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God has a variety of work and employment for his holy angels.
 Sometimes they are to sound the trumpet of divine Providence, and give 
 fair warning to a careless world; sometimes they are to pour out the 
 vials of God's anger upon impenitent sinners; and sometimes to discover 
 things of a heavenly nature to those that are <I>the heirs of 
 salvation.</I> They readily execute every commission they receive from 
 God; and, when this world shall be at an end, yet the angels shall be 
 employed by the great God in proper pleasant work to all eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place from which the apostle had this glorious view and 
 prospect. He was taken, in ecstasy, into <I>a high mountain.</I> From 
 such situations men usually have the most distinct views of adjacent 
 cities. Those who would have clear views of heaven must get as near 
 heaven as they can, into the mount of vision, the mount of meditation 
 and faith, whence, as from the top of Pisgah, they may behold the 
 goodly land of the heavenly Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The subject-matter of the vision--<I>the bride, the Lamb's wife</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 that is, the church of God in her glorious, perfect, triumphant state, 
 under the resemblance of Jerusalem, having the glory of God shining in 
 its lustre, as <I>uxor splendit radiis mariti--the bride comely through 
 the comeliness put on her by her husband;</I> glorious in her relation 
 to Christ, in his image now perfected in her, and in his favour shining 
 upon her. And now we have a large description of the church triumphant 
 under the emblem of a city, far exceeding in riches and splendour all 
 the cities of this world; and this new Jerusalem is here represented to 
 us both in the exterior and the interior part of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The exterior part of the city--<I>the wall</I> and <I>the gates,</I>
 the wall for security and the gates for entrance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The wall for security. Heaven is a safe state; those that are 
 there are enclosed with a wall, that separates them and secures them 
 from all evils and enemies: now here, in the account of the wall, we 
 observe, 

 [1.] The height of it, which, we are told, is very high, <I>seventy 
 yards</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 sufficient both for ornament and security. 

 [2.] The matter of it: <I>It was as jasper;</I> a wall all built of the 
 most precious stones, for firmness and lustre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This city has a wall that is impregnable as well as precious.

 [3.] The form of it was very regular and uniform: <I>It was 
 four-square, the length as large as the breadth.</I> In the new 
 Jerusalem all shall be equal in purity and perfection. There shall be 
 an absolute uniformity in the church triumphant, a thing wanted and 
 wished for on earth, but not to be expected till we come to heaven.

 [4.] The measure of the wall 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 <I>Twelve thousand furlongs</I> each way, each side, which is 
 forty-eight thousand furlongs in the whole compass, or fifteen hundred 
 German miles. Here is room sufficient for all the people of 
 God--<I>many mansions in their Father's house.</I> 

 [5.] The foundation of the wall, for heaven is a city that hath her 
 foundations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);
 
 the promise and power of God, and the purchase of Christ, are the
 strong foundations of the church's safety and happiness. The 
 foundations are described by their number--<I>twelve,</I> alluding to 
 the twelve apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 whose gospel doctrines are the foundations upon which the church is 
 built, <I>Christ himself being the chief corner-stone;</I> and, as to 
 the matter of these foundations, it was various and precious, set forth 
 by twelve sorts of precious stones, denoting the variety and excellency 
 of the doctrines of the gospel, or of the graces of the Holy Spirit, or 
 the personal excellencies of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The gates for entrance. Heaven is not inaccessible; there is a way 
 opened into the holiest of all; there is a free admission to all those 
 that are sanctified; they shall not find themselves shut out. Now, as 
 to these gates, observe, 

 [1.] Their number--<I>twelve gates,</I> answering to the twelve tribes 
 of Israel. All the true Israel of God shall have entrance into the new 
 Jerusalem, as every tribe had into the earthly Jerusalem.

 [2.] Their guards which were placed upon them--<I>twelve angels,</I> to 
 admit and receive the several tribes of the spiritual Israel and keep 
 out others.

 [3.] The inscription on the gates--<I>the names of the twelve 
 tribes,</I> to show that they have a right to the tree of life, and to 
 enter through the gates into the city.

 [4.] The situation of the gates. As the city had four equal sides, 
 answering to the four quarters of the world, east, west, north, and 
 south, so on each side there were three gates, signifying that from all 
 quarters of the earth there shall be some who shall get safely to 
 heaven and be received there, and that there is as free entrance from 
 one part of the world as from the other; <I>for in Christ there is 
 neither Jew nor Greek, Barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free.</I> Men of 
 all nations, and languages, who believe on Christ, have by him access 
 to God in grace here and in glory hereafter.

 [5.] The materials of these gates--they were all of pearls, and yet 
 with great variety: <I>Every gate one pearl,</I> either one single 
 pearl of that vast bigness, or one single sort of pearl. Christ is the 
 pearl of great price, and he is our way to God. There is nothing 
 magnificent enough in this world fully to set forth the glory of 
 heaven. Could we, in the glass of a strong imagination, contemplate 
 such a city as is here described, even as to the exterior part of it, 
 such a wall, and such gates, how amazing, how glorious, would the 
 prospect be! And yet this is but a faint and dim representation of what 
 heaven is in itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The interior part of the new Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:22-27"><I>v.</I> 22-27</A>.

 We have seen its strong wall, and stately gates, and glorious guards; 
 now we are to be led through the gates into the city itself; and the 
 first thing which we observe there is the street of the city, <I>which 
 is of pure gold, like transparent glass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The saints in heaven tread upon gold. The new Jerusalem has its several 
 streets. There is the most exact order in heaven: every saint has his
 proper mansion. There is converse in heaven: the saints are then at 
 rest, but it is not a mere passive rest; it is not a state of sleep and 
 inactivity, but a state of delightful motion: <I>The nations that are 
 saved walk in the light of it.</I> They walk with Christ in white. They 
 have communion not only with God, but with one another; and all their 
 steps are firm and clean. They are pure and clear <I>as gold and
 transparent glass.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The temple of the new Jerusalem, which was no material temple, 
 made with men's hands, as that of Solomon and Zerubbabel, but a temple 
 altogether spiritual and divine; <I>for the Lord God Almighty, and the 
 Lamb, are the temple thereof.</I> There the saints are above the need 
 of ordinances, which were the means of their preparation for heaven. 
 When the end is attained the means are no longer useful. Perfect and 
 immediate communion with God will more than supply the place of gospel 
 institutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The light of this city. Where there is no light, there can be no 
 lustre nor pleasure. Heaven is <I>the inheritance of the saints in 
 light.</I> But what is that light? There is no sun nor moon shining 
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is to behold the sun. What a 
 dismal world would this be if it were not for the light of the sun! 
 What is there in heaven that supplies the want of it? There is no want 
 of the light of the sun, <I>for the glory of God lightens that city, 
 and the Lamb is the light thereof.</I> God in Christ will be an 
 everlasting fountain of knowledge and joy to the saints in heaven; and, 
 if so, there is no need of the sun or moon, any more than we here need 
 to set up candles at noon day, when the sun shineth in its 
 strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The inhabitants of this city. They are described here several 
 ways. 

 [1.] By their numbers--whole nations of saved souls; some out of all 
 nations, and many out of some nations. All those multitudes who were 
 sealed on earth are saved in heaven.

 [2.] By their dignity--some of the kings and princes of the earth: 
 great kings. God will have some of all ranks and degrees of men to fill 
 the heavenly mansions, high and low; and when the greatest kings come 
 to heaven they will see all their former honour and glory swallowed up 
 of this heavenly glory that so much excels.

 [3.] Their continual accession and entrance into this city: <I>The 
 gates shall never be shut.</I> There is no night, and therefore no need 
 of shutting up the gates. Some one or other is coming in every hour and 
 moment, and those that are sanctified always find the gates open; they 
 have <I>an abundant entrance into the kingdom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The accommodations of this city: All the <I>glory and honour of 
 the nations shall be brought into it.</I> Whatever is excellent and 
 valuable in this world shall be there enjoyed in a more refined kind, 
 and to a far greater degree--brighter crowns, a better and more enduring
 substance, more sweet and satisfying feasts, a more glorious 
 attendance, a truer sense of honour and far higher posts of honour, a 
 more glorious temper of mind, and a form and a countenance more 
 glorious than ever were known in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The unmixed purity of all who belong to the new Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 [1.] There the saints shall have no impure thing remaining in them. In 
 the article of death they shall be cleansed from every thing that is of 
 a defiling nature. Now they feel a sad mixture of corruption with their 
 graces, which hinders them in the service of God, interrupts their 
 communion with him, and intercepts the light of his countenance; but, 
 at their entrance into the holy of holies, they are washed in the laver 
 of Christ's blood, and presented to the Father without spot. 

 [2.] There the saints shall have no impure persons admitted among them. 
 In the earthly Jerusalem there will be a mixed communion, after all the 
 care that can be taken. Some roots of bitterness will spring up to 
 trouble and defile Christian societies; but in the new Jerusalem there 
 is a society perfectly pure. <I>First,</I> Free from such as are openly 
 profane. There are none admitted into heaven who work abominations. In 
 the churches on earth sometimes abominable things are done, solemn 
 ordinances profaned and prostituted to men openly vicious, for worldly 
 ends; but no such abominations can have place in heaven.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Free from hypocrites, such as make lies, say they are 
 Jews, and are not, but do lie. These will creep into the churches of 
 Christ on earth, and may lie concealed there a long time, perhaps all 
 their days; but they cannot intrude into the new Jerusalem, which is 
 wholly reserved for those that are called, and chosen, and faithful, 
 who are all written, not only in the register if the visible church, 
 <I>but in the Lamb's book of life.</I></P>
