 In this chapter the apostle, 

 I. Considers the case of spiritual gifts, which were very plentifully
 poured out on the Corinthian church. He considers their original, that 
 they are from God; their variety and use, that they were all intended 
 for one and the same general end, the advancement of Christianity and 
 the church's edification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He illustrates this by an allusion to a human body, in which all
 the members have a mutual relation and subserviency, and each has its 
 proper place and use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:12-26">ver. 12-26</A>.

 III. He tells us that the church is the body of Christ, and the members
 are variously gifted for the benefit of the whole body, and each
 particular member, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>.
 
 And them, 

 IV. Closes with an exhortation to seek somewhat more beneficial than 
 these gifts,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now concerning spiritual <I>gifts,</I> brethren, I would not have
 you ignorant.
 &nbsp; 2  Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
 idols, even as ye were led.
 &nbsp; 3  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by
 the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <I>that</I> no man can
 say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 4  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
 &nbsp; 5  And there are differences of administrations, but the same
 Lord.
 &nbsp; 6  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same
 God which worketh all in all.
 &nbsp; 7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
 profit withal.
 &nbsp; 8  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
 another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
 &nbsp; 9  To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
 healing by the same Spirit;
 &nbsp; 10  To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
 another discerning of spirits; to another <I>divers</I> kinds of
 tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
 &nbsp; 11  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
 dividing to every man severally as he will.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle comes now to treat of spiritual gifts, which abounded in 
 the church of Corinth, but were greatly abused. What these gifts were 
 is at large told us in the body of the chapter; namely, extraordinary 
 offices and powers, bestowed on ministers and Christians in the first 
 ages, for conviction of unbelievers, and propagation of the gospel. 
 Gifts and graces, <B><I>charismata</I></B> and <B><I>charis,</I></B> 
 greatly differ. Both indeed were freely given of God. But where grace 
 is given it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are 
 bestowed for the advantage and salvation of others. And there may be 
 great gifts where there is not a dram of grace, but persons possessed 
 of them are utterly out of the divine favour. They are great instances 
 of divine benignity to men, but do not by themselves prove those who 
 have them to be the objects of divine complacency. This church was rich 
 in gifts, but there were many things scandalously out of order in it. 
 Now concerning these spiritual gifts, that is, the extraordinary powers 
 they had received from the Spirit,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle tells them he would not have them ignorant either of 
 their original or use. They came from God, and were to be used for him. 
 It would lead them far astray if they were ignorant of one or the other 
 of these. Note, Right information is of great use as to all religious 
 practice. It is wretched work which gifted men make who either do not 
 know or do not advert to the nature and right use of the gifts with 
 which they are endowed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts them in the mind of the sad state out of which they had 
 been recovered: <I>You were Gentiles, carried away to dumb idols, even 
 as you were led,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 While they were so, they could have no pretensions to be spiritual men, 
 nor to have spiritual gifts. While they were under the conduct of the 
 spirit of Gentilism, they could not be influenced by the Spirit of 
 Christ. If they well understood their former condition, they could not 
 but know that all true spiritual gifts were from God. Now concerning 
 this observe, 

 1. Their former character: they <I>were Gentiles.</I> Not God's
 peculiar people, but of the nations whom he had in a manner abandoned. 
 The Jews were, before, his chosen people, distinguished from the rest 
 of the world by his favour. To them the knowledge and worship of the 
 true God were in a manner confined. The rest of the world were 
 strangers to the covenant of promise, aliens from the commonwealth of 
 Israel, and in a manner without God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:12">Eph. ii. 12</A>.

 Such Gentiles were the body of the Corinthians, before their conversion
 to Christianity. What a change was here! Christian Corinthians were 
 once Gentiles. Note, It is of great use to the Christian, and a proper 
 consideration to stir him up both to duty and thankfulness, to think 
 what once he was: <I>You were Gentiles.</I> 

 2. The conduct they were under: <I>Carried away to these dumb idols,
 even as you were led.</I> They were hurried upon the grossest idolatry, 
 the worship even of stocks and stones, through the force of a vain 
 imagination, and the fraud of their priests practising on their 
 ignorance, for, whatever were the sentiments of their philosophers, 
 this was the practice of the herd. The body of the people paid their 
 homage and worship to dumb idols, <I>that had ears but could not hear, 
 and mouths but could not speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:5,6">Ps. cxv. 5, 6</A>.

 Miserable abjectness of mind! And those who despised these gross
 conceptions of the vulgar yet countenanced them by their practice. O 
 dismal state of Gentilism! Could the Spirit of God be among such
 stupid idolators, or they be influenced by it? How did the prince of 
 this world triumph in the blindness of mankind! How thick a mist had he 
 cast over their minds!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He shows them how they might discern those gifts that were from 
 the Spirit of God, true spiritual gifts: <I>No man, speaking by the 
 Spirit, calls Jesus accursed.</I> Thus did both Jews and Gentiles: they 
 blasphemed him as an impostor, and execrated his name, and deemed it 
 abominable. And yet many Jews, who were exorcists and magicians, went 
 about, pretending to work wonders by the Spirit of God (vid. 
 Lightfoot's <I>Hor&aelig; in loc.</I>), and many among the Gentiles
 pretended to inspiration. Now the apostle tells them none could act 
 under the influence, nor by the power, of the Spirit of God, who 
 disowned and blasphemed Christ: for the Spirit of God bore 
 uncontrollable witness to Christ by prophecy, miracles, his 
 resurrection from the dead, the success of his doctrine among men, and 
 its effect upon them; and could never so far contradict itself as to 
 declare him accursed. And on the other hand <I>no man could say Jesus 
 was the Lord</I> (that is, live by this faith, and work miracles to 
 prove it), <I>but it must be by the Holy Ghost.</I> To own this truth 
 before men, and maintain it to the death, and live under the influence 
 of it, could not be done without the sanctification of the Holy Ghost. 
 No man can call Christ <I>Lord,</I> with a believing subjection to him 
 and dependence upon him, unless that faith be wrought by the Holy 
 Ghost. No man can confess this truth in the day of trial but by the 
 Holy Ghost animating and encouraging him. Note, We have as necessary a 
 dependence on the Spirit's operation and influence for our 
 sanctification and perseverance as on the mediation of Christ for our 
 reconciliation and acceptance with God: and no man could confirm this 
 truth with a miracle but by the Holy Ghost. No evil spirit would lend 
 assistance, if it were in his power, to spread a doctrine and religion 
 so ruinous to the devil's kingdom. The substance of what the apostle 
 asserts and argues here is that whatever pretences there were to 
 inspiration or miracles, among those who were enemies to Christianity, 
 they could not be from the Spirit of God; but no man could believe this 
 with his heart, nor prove with a miracle that Jesus was Christ, but by 
 the Holy Ghost: so that the extraordinary operations and powers among 
 them did all proceed from the Spirit of God. He adds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. These spiritual gifts, though proceeding from the same Spirit, are 
 yet various. They have one author and original, but are themselves of 
 various kinds. A free cause may produce variety of effects; and the 
 same giver may bestow various gifts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>There are diversities of gifts,</I> such as revelations, tongues,
 prophecy, interpretations of tongues; <I>but the same Spirit.</I> There 
 are differences of administrations, or different offices, and officers 
 to discharge them, different ordinances and institutions (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>),

 but the same Lord, who appointed all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>There are diversities of operations,</I> or miraculous powers, 
 called <B><I>energemata dynameon</I></B>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as here <B><I>energemata,</I></B> <I>but it is the same God that 
 worketh all in all.</I> There are various gifts, administrations, and 
 operations, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit; that 
 is, from Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the spring and origin of all 
 spiritual blessings and bequests: all issue from the same fountain; all 
 have the same author. However different they may be in themselves, in 
 this they agree; all are from God. And several of the kinds are here 
 specified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 Several persons had their several gifts, some one, some another, all 
 from and by the same Spirit. To one was given the <I>word of 
 wisdom;</I> that is, say some, a knowledge of the mysteries of the 
 gospel, and ability to explain them, an exact understanding of the 
 design, nature, and doctrines, of the Christian religion. Others say an 
 uttering of grave sentences, like Solomon's proverbs. Some confine this 
 word of wisdom to the revelations made to and by the apostles.--<I>To 
 another the word of knowledge, by the same Spirit;</I> that is, say 
 some, the knowledge of mysteries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:13"><I>ch.</I> ii. 13</A>):
 
 wrapped up in the prophecies, types, and histories of the Old
 Testament: say others, a skill and readiness to give advice and counsel 
 in perplexed cases.--<I>To another faith, by the same Spirit;</I> that
 is, the faith of miracles, or a faith in the divine power and promise, 
 whereby they were enabled to trust God in any emergency, and go on in 
 the way of their duty, and own and profess the truths of Christ, 
 whatever was the difficulty or danger.--<I>To another the gift of
 healing, by the same Spirit;</I> that is, healing the sick, either by 
 laying on of hands, or anointing with oil, or with a bare word.--<I>To
 another the working of miracles;</I> the efficacies of powers, 
 <B><I>energemata dynameon,</I></B> such as raising the dead, restoring 
 the blind to sight, giving speech to the dumb, hearing to the deaf, and 
 the use of limbs to the lame.--<I>To another prophecy,</I> that is,
 ability to foretel future events, which is the more usual sense of 
 prophecy; or to explain scripture by a peculiar gift of the Spirit. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:24"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 24</A>.--

 <I>To another the discerning of Spirits,</I> power to distinguish
 between true and false prophets, or to discern the real and internal 
 qualifications of any person for an office, or to discover the inward 
 workings of the mind by the Holy Ghost, as Peter did those of Ananias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:3">Acts v. 3</A>.--

 <I>To another divers kinds of tongues,</I> or ability to speak
 languages by inspiration.--<I>To another the interpretation of 
 tongues,</I> or ability to render foreign languages readily and 
 properly into their own. With such variety of spiritual gifts were the 
 first ministers and churches blessed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The end for which these gifts were bestowed: <I>The manifestation of 
 the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The Spirit was manifested by the exercise of these gifts; his influence 
 and interest appeared in them. But they were not distributed for the 
 mere honour and advantage of those who had them, but for the benefit of 
 the church, to edify the body, and spread and advance the gospel. Note, 
 Whatever gifts God confers on any man, he confers them that he may do 
 good with them, whether they be common or spiritual. The outward gifts 
 of his bounty are to be improved for his glory, and employed in doing 
 good to others. No man has them merely for himself. They are a trust 
 put into his hands, to profit withal; and the more he profits others 
 with them, the more abundantly will they turn to his account in the 
 end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:17">Phil. iv. 17</A>.

 Spiritual gifts are bestowed, that men may with them profit the church
 and promote Christianity. They are not given for show, but for service; 
 not for pomp and ostentation, but for edification; not to magnify those 
 that have them, but to edify others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The measure and proportion in which they are given: <I>All these 
 worketh one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man as he will.</I> 
 It is according to the sovereign pleasure of the donor. What more free 
 than a gift? And shall not the Spirit of God do what he will with his 
 own? May he not give to what persons he pleases, and in what proportion 
 he pleases; one gift to one man, and another to another; to one more, 
 and another fewer, as he thinks fit? Is he not the best judge how his 
 own purpose shall be served, and his own donatives bestowed? It is not 
 as men will, nor as they may think fit, but as the Spirit pleases. 
 Note, The Holy Ghost is a divine person. He works divine effects and 
 divides divine gifts a he will, by his own power, and according to his 
 own pleasure, without dependence or control. But though he distributes 
 these gifts freely and uncontrollably, they are intended by him, not 
 for private honour and advantage, but for public benefit, for the 
 edification of the body, the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
 members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <I>is</I>
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
 <I>we be</I> Jews or Gentiles, whether <I>we be</I> bond or free; and have
 been all made to drink into one Spirit.
 &nbsp; 14  For the body is not one member, but many.
 &nbsp; 15  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not
 of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
 &nbsp; 16  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not
 of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
 &nbsp; 17  If the whole body <I>were</I> an eye, where <I>were</I> the hearing?
 If the whole <I>were</I> hearing, where <I>were</I> the smelling?
 &nbsp; 18  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the
 body, as it hath pleased him.
 &nbsp; 19  And if they were all one member, where <I>were</I> the body?
 &nbsp; 20  But now <I>are they</I> many members, yet but one body.
 &nbsp; 21  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of
 thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
 &nbsp; 22  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be
 more feeble, are necessary:
 &nbsp; 23  And those <I>members</I> of the body, which we think to be less
 honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our
 uncomely <I>parts</I> have more abundant comeliness.
 &nbsp; 24  For our comely <I>parts</I> have no need: but God hath tempered
 the body together, having given more abundant honour to that
 <I>part</I> which lacked:
 &nbsp; 25  That there should be no schism in the body; but <I>that</I> the
 members should have the same care one for another.
 &nbsp; 26  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with
 it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here makes out the truth of what was above asserted, and 
 puts the gifted men among the Corinthians in mind of their duty, by 
 comparing the church of Christ to a human body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By telling us that one body may have many members, and that the many 
 members of the same body make but one body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all members of that 
 one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ;</I> that is, 
 Christ mystical, as divines commonly speak. Christ and his church 
 making one body, as head and members, this body is made up of many 
 parts or members, yet but one body; for all the members are <I>baptized 
 into the same body, and made to drink of the same Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Jews and Gentiles, bond and free, are upon a level in this: all are 
 baptized into the same body, and made partakers of the same Spirit. 
 Christians become members of this body by baptism: they are baptized 
 into one body. The outward rite is of divine institution, significant 
 of the new birth, called therefore <I>the washing of regeneration,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5">Tit. iii. 5</A>.

 But it is by the Spirit, by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are
 made members of Christ's body. It is the Spirit's operation, signified 
 by the outward administration, that makes us members. And by communion 
 at the other ordinance we are sustained; but then it is not merely by 
 drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. The outward 
 administration is a means appointed of God for our participation in 
 this great benefit; but it is baptism by the Spirit, it is internal 
 renovation and drinking into one Spirit, partaking of his sanctifying 
 influence from time to time, that makes us true members of Christ's 
 body, and maintains our union with him. Being animated by one Spirit 
 makes Christians one body. Note, All who have the spirit of Christ, 
 without difference, are the members of Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, 
 bond or free; and none but such. And all the members of Christ make up 
 one body; the members many, but the body one. They are one body, 
 because they have one principle of life; all are quickened and animated 
 by the same Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Each member has its particular form, place, and use. 

 1. The meanest member makes a part of the body. The foot and ear are
 less useful, perhaps, than the hand and eye; but because one is not a 
 hand, and the other an eye, shall they say, therefore, that they do not 
 belong to the body?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 So every member of the body mystical cannot have the same place and 
 office; but what then? Shall it hereupon disown relation to the body? 
 Because it is not fixed in the same station, or favoured with the same 
 gifts as others, shall it say, "I do not belong to Christ?" No, the 
 meanest member of his body is as much a member as the noblest, and as 
 truly regarded by him. All his members are dear to him. 

 2. There must be a distinction of members in the body: <I>Were the
 whole body eye, where were the hearing? Were the whole ear, where were 
 the smelling?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>If all were one member, where were the body?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>They are many members,</I> and for that reason must have distinction 
 among them, <I>and yet are but one body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 One member of a body is not a body; this is made up of many; and among 
 these many there must be a distinction, difference of situation, shape, 
 use, &c. So it is in the body of Christ; its members must have 
 different uses, and therefore have different powers, and be in 
 different places, some having one gift, and others a different one.
 Variety in the members of the body contributes to the beauty of it.
 What a monster would a body be if it were all ear, or eye, or arm! So 
 it is for the beauty and good appearance of the church that there 
 should be diversity of gifts and offices in it. 

 3. The disposal of members in a natural body, and their situation, are
 as God pleases: <I>But now hath God set the members, every one of them, 
 in the body, as it hath pleased him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 We may plainly perceive the divine wisdom in the distribution of the 
 members; but it was made according to the counsel of his will; he 
 distinguished and distributed them as he pleased. So is it also in the 
 members of Christ's body: they are chosen out to such stations, and 
 endued with such gifts, as God pleases. He who is sovereign Lord of all 
 disposes his favours and gifts as he will. And who should gainsay his
 pleasure? What foundation is here for repining in ourselves, or envying 
 others? We should be doing the duties of our own place, and not 
 murmuring in ourselves, nor quarrelling with others, that we are not in 
 theirs. 

 4. All the members of the body are, in some respect, useful and
 necessary to each other: <I>The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no 
 need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of your:</I> 
 nay, those members of the body <I>which seem to be more feeble</I> (the 
 bowels, &c.) <I>are necessary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>);

 God has so fitted and tempered them together that they are all 
 necessary to one another, and to the whole body; there is no part 
 redundant and unnecessary. Every member serves some good purpose or 
 other: it is useful to its fellow-members, and necessary to the good 
 state of the whole body. Nor is there a member of the body of Christ 
 but may and ought to be useful to his fellow-members, and at some 
 times, and in some cases, is needful to them. None should despise and 
 envy another, seeing God has made the distinction between them as he 
 pleased, yet so as to keep them all in some degree of mutual 
 dependence, and make them valuable to each other, and concerned for 
 each other, because of their mutual usefulness. Those who excel in any 
 gift cannot say that they have no need of those who in that gift are 
 their inferiors, while perhaps, in other gifts, they exceed them. Nay, 
 the lowest members of all have their use, and the highest cannot do 
 well without them. The eye has need of the hand, and the head of the 
 feet. 

 5. Such is the man's concern for his whole body that <I>on the less
 honourable members more abundant honour is bestowed, and our uncomely 
 parts have more abundant comeliness.</I> Those parts which are not fit, 
 like the rest, to be exposed to view, which are either deformed or 
 shameful, we most carefully clothe and cover; whereas the comely parts 
 have no such need. The wisdom of Providence has so contrived and 
 tempered things that the most abundant regard and honour should be paid 
 to that which most wanted it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 So should the members of Christ's body behave towards their 
 fellow-members: instead of despising them, or reproaching them, for 
 their infirmities, they should endeavour to cover and conceal them, and 
 put the best face upon them that they can. 

 6. Divine wisdom has contrived and ordered things in this manner that
 the members of the body should not be schismatics, divided from each 
 other and acting upon separate interests, but well affected to each 
 other, tenderly concerned for each other, having a fellow-feeling of 
 each other's griefs and a communion in each other's pleasures and joys,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 God has tempered the members of the body natural in the manner 
 mentioned, that <I>there might be no schism in the body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 no rupture nor disunion among the members, nor so much as the least 
 mutual disregard. This should be avoided also in the spiritual body of 
 Christ. There should be no schism in this body, but the members should 
 be closely united by the strongest bonds of love. All decays of this
 affection are the seeds of schism. Where Christians grow cold towards 
 each other, they will be careless and unconcerned for each other. And 
 this mutual disregard is a schism begun. The members of the natural 
 body are made to have a care and concern for each other, to prevent a 
 schism in it. So should it be in Christ's body; the members should 
 sympathize with each other. As in the natural body the pain of the one 
 part afflicts the whole, the ease and pleasure of one part affects the 
 whole, so should Christians reckon themselves honoured in the honours 
 of their fellow-christians, and should suffer in their sufferings. 
 Note, Christian sympathy is a great branch of Christian duty. We should 
 be so far from slighting our brethren's sufferings that we should 
 suffer with them, so far from envying their honours that we should 
 rejoice with them and reckon ourselves honoured in them.</P>

 I. Here the apostle sums up the argument, and applies this similitude 
 to the church of Christ, concerning which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The relation wherein Christians stand to Christ and one another. The 
 church, or whole collective body of Christians, in all ages, is his 
 body. Every Christian is a member of his body, and every other 
 Christian stands related to him as a fellow-member 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular,</I> or 
 particular members. Each is a member of the body, not the whole body; 
 each stands related to the body as a part of it, and all have a common 
 relation to one another, dependence upon one another, and should have a 
 mutual care and concern. Thus are the members of the natural body, thus 
 should the members of the mystical body be, disposed. Note, Mutual 
 indifference, and much more contempt, and hatred, and envy, and strife, 
 are very unnatural in Christians. It is like the members of the same 
 body being destitute of all concern for one another, or quarrelling 
 with each other. This is the apostle's scope in this argument. He 
 endeavours in it to suppress the proud, vaunting, and contentious 
 spirit, that had prevailed among the Corinthians, by reason of their 
 spiritual gifts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The variety of offices instituted by Christ, and gifts or favours 
 dispensed by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>God hath set some in the church; first, apostles,</I> the chief 
 ministers entrusted with all the powers necessary to found a church, 
 and make an entire revelation of God's will. <I>Secondarily, 
 prophets,</I> or persons enabled by inspiration, as the evangelists 
 did. <I>Thirdly, teachers,</I> those who labour in word and doctrine, 
 whether with pastoral charge or without it. After that, 
 <I>miracles,</I> or miracle-workers. <I>The gifts of healing,</I> or 
 those who had power to heal diseases; <I>helps,</I> or such as had 
 compassion on the sick and weak, and ministered to them; 
 <I>governments,</I> or such as had the disposal of the charitable 
 contributions of the church, and dealt them out to the poor; 
 <I>diversities of tongues,</I> or such as could speak divers languages.
 Concerning all these observe, 

 (1.) The plenteous variety of these gifts and offices. What a multitude 
 are they! A good God was free in his communications to the primitive 
 church; he was no niggard of his benefits and favours. No, he provided 
 richly for them. They had no want, but a store-all that was necessary, 
 and even more; what was convenient for them too. 

 (2.) Observe the order of these offices and gifts. They are here placed 
 in their proper ranks. Those of most value have the first place.
 Apostles, prophets, and teachers, were all intended to instruct the 
 people, to inform them well in the things of God, and promote their 
 spiritual edification: without them, neither evangelical knowledge nor 
 holiness could have been promoted. But the rest, however fitted to 
 answer the great intentions of Christianity, had no such immediate 
 regard to religion, strictly so called. Note, God does, and we should, 
 value things according to their real worth: and the use of things is 
 the best criterion of their real worth. Those are most valuable that 
 best answer the highest purposes. Such were apostolical powers,
 compared with theirs who had only the gift of healing and miracles. 
 What holds the last and lowest rank in this enumeration is diversity of 
 tongues. It is by itself the most useless and insignificant of all 
 these gifts. Healing diseases, relieving the poor, helping the sick, 
 have their use: but how vain a thing is it to speak languages, if a man 
 does it merely to amuse or boast himself! This may indeed raise the
 admiration, but cannot promote the edification, of the hearers, nor do 
 them any good. And yet it is manifest from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23"><I>ch.</I> xiv.</A>

 that the Corinthians valued themselves exceedingly on this gift. Note,
 How proper a method it is to beat down pride to let persons know the 
 true value of what they pride themselves in! It is but too common a 
 thing for men to value themselves most on what is least worth: and it 
 is of great use to bring them to a sober mind by letting them know how 
 much they are mistaken. 

 (3.) The various distribution of these gifts, not all to one, nor to 
 every one alike. All members and officers had not the same rank in the 
 church, nor the same endowments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>):

 <I>Are all apostles? Are all prophets?</I> This were to make the church 
 a monster: all one as if the body were all ear or all eye. Some are fit 
 for one office and employment, and some for another; and the Spirit 
 distributes to every one as he will. We must be content with our own 
 rank and share, if they be lower and less than those of others. We must 
 not be conceited of ourselves, and despise others, if we are in the 
 higher rank and have greater gifts. Every member of the body is to 
 preserve its own rank, and do its own office; and all are to minister 
 to one another, and promote the good of the body in general, without 
 envying, or despising, or neglecting, or ill-using, any one particular 
 member. How blessed a constitution were the Christian church, if all 
 the members did their duty!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He closes this chapter with an advice (as the generality read it) 
 and a hint. 

 1. An advice to covet the best gifts, <B><I>charismata ta
 kreittona</I></B>--<I>dona potiora, pr&aelig;stantiora,</I> either the 
 most valuable in them selves or the most serviceable to others; and 
 these are, in truth, most valuable in themselves, though men may be apt 
 to esteem those most that will raise their fame and esteem highest. 
 Those are truly best by which God will be most honoured and his church 
 edified. Such gifts should be most earnestly coveted. Note, We should 
 desire that most which is best, and most worth. Grace is therefore to 
 be preferred before gifts; and, of gifts, those are to be preferred 
 which are of greatest use. But some read this passage, not as an 
 advice, but a charge: <B><I>zeloute,</I></B> <I>You are envious</I> at 
 each other's gifts. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 4</A>,

 the same word is thus translated. You quarrel and contend about them.
 This they certainly did. And this behaviour the apostle here
 reprehends, and labours to rectify. <I>Only of pride cometh
 contention.</I> These contests in the church of Corinth sprang from
 this original. It was a quarrel about precedency (as most quarrels
 among Christians are, with whatever pretences they are gilded over);
 and it is no wonder that a quarrel about precedence should extinguish
 charity. When all would stand in the first rank, no wonder if they
 jostle, or throw down, or thrust back, their brethren. Gifts may be
 valued for their use, but they are mischievous when made the fuel of
 pride and contention. This therefore the apostle endeavours to prevent.
 
 2. By giving them the hint of a more excellent way, namely, of charity,
 of mutual love and good-will. This was the only right way to quiet and 
 cement them, and make their gifts turn to the advantage and edification 
 of the church. This would render them kind to each other, and concerned 
 for each other, and therefore calm their spirits, and put an end to 
 their little piques and contests, their disputes about precedency. 
 Those would appear to be in the foremost rank, according to the 
 apostle, who had most of true Christian love. Note, True charity is 
 greatly to be preferred to the most glorious gifts. To have the heart 
 glow with mutual love is vastly better than to glare with the most
 pompous titles, offices, or powers.</P>
