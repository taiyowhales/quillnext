 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter chiefly consists of two parts. In the former the apostle 
 gives us several plain and practical directions, which more especially 
 tend to instruct Christians in their duty to one another, and to
 promote the communion of saints in love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 In the latter he revives the main design of the epistle, which was to
 fortify the Galatians against the arts of their judaizing teachers, and 
 confirm them in the truth and liberty of the gospel, for which purpose 
 he,

 I. Gives them the true character of these teachers, and shows them
 from what motives, and with what views, they acted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.
 
 And, 

 II. On the other hand he acquaints them with his own temper and
 behaviour. From both these they might easily see how little reason
 they had to slight him, and to fall in with them. And then he concludes 
 the epistle with a solemn benediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
 spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
 considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
 &nbsp; 2  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 3  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is
 nothing, he deceiveth himself.
 &nbsp; 4  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
 rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
 &nbsp; 5  For every man shall bear his own burden.
 &nbsp; 6  Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
 teacheth in all good things.
 &nbsp; 7  Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
 soweth, that shall he also reap.
 &nbsp; 8  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
 corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit
 reap life everlasting.
 &nbsp; 9  And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we
 shall reap, if we faint not.
 &nbsp; 10  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
 <I>men,</I> especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having, in the foregoing chapter, exhorted Christians <I>by
 love to serve one another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:13">
 <I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and also cautioned us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 against a temper which, if indulged, would hinder us from showing the 
 mutual love and serviceableness which he had recommended, in the 
 beginning of this chapter he proceeds to give some further directions, 
 which, if duly observed, would both promote the one and prevent the 
 other of these, and render our behaviour both more agreeable to our 
 Christian profession and more useful and comfortable to one another: 
 particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here taught to deal tenderly with those who are overtaken in 
 a fault, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He puts a common case: <I>If a man be overtaken in a fault,</I> that 
 is, be brought to sin by the surprise of temptation. It is one thing to 
 overtake a fault by contrivance and deliberation, and a full resolution 
 in sin, and another thing to be overtaken in a fault. The latter is
 the case here supposed, and herein the apostle shows that great 
 tenderness should be used. <I>Those who are spiritual,</I> by whom is 
 meant, not only the ministers (as if none but they were to be called 
 spiritual persons), but other Christians too, especially those of the 
 higher form in Christianity; these must <I>restore such a one with the 
 spirit of meekness.</I> Here observe, 

 1. The duty we are directed to--to restore such; we should labour, by
 faithful reproofs, and pertinent and seasonable councils, to bring them 
 to repentance. The original word, <B><I>katartizete,</I></B> signifies 
 <I>to set in joint,</I> as a dislocated bone; accordingly we should 
 endeavour to set them in joint again, to bring them to themselves, by 
 convincing them of their sin and error, persuading them to return to 
 their duty, comforting them in a sense of pardoning mercy thereupon, 
 and having thus recovered them, confirming our love to them. 

 2. The manner wherein this is to be done: <I>With the spirit of 
 meekness;</I> not in wrath and passion, as those who triumph in a 
 brother's falls, but with meekness, as those who rather mourn for them.
 Many needful reproofs lose their efficacy by being given in wrath; but 
 when they are managed with calmness and tenderness, and appear to 
 proceed from sincere affection and concern for the welfare of those to 
 whom they are given, they are likely to make a due impression. 

 3. A very good reason why this should be done with meekness:
 <I>Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</I> We ought to deal 
 very tenderly with those who are overtaken in sin, because we none of 
 us know but it may some time or other be our own case. We also may be 
 tempted, yea, and overcome by the temptation; and therefore, if we 
 rightly consider ourselves, this will dispose us to do by others as we 
 desire to be done by in such a case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here directed <I>to bear one another's burdens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 This may be considered either as referring to what goes before, and so 
 may teach us to exercise forbearance and compassion towards one 
 another, in the case of those weaknesses, and follies, and infirmities, 
 which too often attend us--that, though we should not wholly connive at
 them, yet we should not be severe against one another on account of 
 them; or as a more general precept, and so it directs us to sympathize 
 with one another under the various trials and troubles that we may meet 
 with, and to be ready to afford each other the comfort and counsel, the 
 help and assistance, which our circumstances may require. To excite us 
 hereunto, the apostle adds, by way of motive, that so we shall 
 <I>fulfil the law of Christ.</I> This is to act agreeably to the law of 
 his precept, which is the law of love, and obliges us to a mutual 
 forbearance and forgiveness, to sympathy with and compassion towards 
 each other; and it would also be agreeable to his pattern and example, 
 which have the force of a law to us. He bears with us under our 
 weaknesses and follies, he is <I>touched with a fellow-feeling of our 
 infirmities;</I> and therefore there is good reason why we should 
 maintain the same temper towards one another. Note, Though as 
 Christians we are freed from the law of Moses, yet we are under the law 
 of Christ; and therefore, instead of laying unnecessary burdens upon 
 others (as those who urged the observance of Moses's law did), it much 
 more becomes us to fulfil the law of Christ by bearing one another's 
 burdens. The apostle being aware how great a hindrance pride would be 
 to the mutual condescension and sympathy which he had been 
 recommending, and that a conceit of ourselves would dispose us to 
 censure and contemn our brethren, instead of bearing with their 
 infirmities and endeavouring to restore them when overtaken with a 
 fault, he therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 takes care to caution us against this; he supposes it as a very 
 possible thing (and it would be well if it were not too common) for a 
 man to think himself to be something--to entertain a fond opinion of 
 his own sufficiency, to look upon himself as wiser and better than 
 other men, and as fit to dictate and prescribe to them--when in truth 
 he is nothing, has nothing of substance or solidity in him, or that can 
 be a ground of the confidence and superiority which he assumes. To 
 dissuade us from giving way to this temper he tells us that such a one 
 does but deceive himself; while he imposes upon others, by pretending 
 to what he has not, he puts the greatest cheat upon himself, and sooner 
 or later will find the sad effects of it. This will never gain him that 
 esteem, either with God or good men, which he is ready to expect; he is 
 neither the freer from mistakes nor will he be the more secure against 
 temptations for the good opinion he has of his own sufficiency, but 
 rather the more liable to fall into them, and to be overcome by them; 
 for <I>he that thinks he stands has need to take heed lest he fall.</I> 
 Instead therefore of indulging such a vain-glorious humour, which is 
 both destructive of the love and kindness we owe to our 
 fellow-christians and also injurious to ourselves, it would much better 
 become us to accept the apostle's exhortation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:3">Phil. ii. 3</A>),

 <I>Do nothing through strife nor vain-glory; but in lowliness of mind 
 let each esteem others better than himself.</I> Note, Self-conceit is 
 but self-deceit: as it is inconsistent with that charity we owe to 
 others (for <I>charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:4">1 Cor. xiii. 4</A>),

 so it is a cheat upon ourselves; and there is not a more dangerous 
 cheat in the world than self-deceit. As a means of preventing this 
 evil,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are advised every one to prove his own work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 By our own work is chiefly meant our own actions or behaviour. These 
 the apostle directs us to prove, that is seriously and impartially to 
 examine them by the rule of God's word, to see whether or no they are 
 agreeable to it, and therefore such as God and conscience do approve. 
 This he represents as the duty of every man; instead of being forward 
 to judge and censure others, it would much more become us to search and 
 try our own ways; our business lies more at home than abroad, with 
 ourselves than with other men, <I>for what have we to do to judge 
 another man's servant?</I> From the connection of this exhortation with 
 what goes before it appears that if Christians did duly employ 
 themselves in this work they might easily discover those defects and 
 failings in themselves which would soon convince them how little reason 
 they have either to be conceited of themselves or severe in their 
 censures of others; and so it gives us occasion to observe that the 
 best way to keep us from being proud of ourselves is to prove our 
 ownselves: the better we are acquainted with our own hearts and ways, 
 the less liable shall we be to despise and the more disposed to 
 compassionate and help others under their infirmities and afflictions. 
 That we may be persuaded to this necessary and profitable duty of 
 proving our own work, the apostle urges two considerations very proper 
 for this purpose:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is the way to <I>have rejoicing in ourselves alone.</I> If we 
 set ourselves in good earnest to <I>prove our own work,</I> and, upon 
 the trial, can approve ourselves to God, as to our sincerity and 
 uprightness towards him, then may we expect to have comfort and peace 
 in our own souls, having the testimony of our own consciences for us 
 (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>),

 and this, he intimates, would be a much better ground of joy and
 satisfaction than to be able to rejoice <I>in another,</I> either in 
 the good opinion which others may have of us or in having gained over 
 others to our opinion, which the false teachers were wont to glory in 
 (as we see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 or by comparing ourselves with others, as, it should seem, some did, 
 who were ready to think well of themselves, because they were not so 
 bad as some others. Too many are apt to value themselves upon such 
 accounts as these; but the joy that results thence is nothing to that 
 which arises from an impartial trial of ourselves by the rule of God's 
 word, and our being able thereupon to approve ourselves to him. Note, 
 
 (1.) Though we have nothing in ourselves to boast of, yet we may have 
 the matter of rejoicing in ourselves: our works can merit nothing at 
 the hand of God; but, if our consciences can witness for us that they 
 are such as he for Christ's sake approves and accepts, we may upon good 
 ground rejoice therein.

 (2.) The true way to have <I>rejoicing in ourselves</I> is to be much 
 in <I>proving our own works,</I> in examining ourselves by the unerring 
 rule of God's word, and not by the false measures of what others are, 
 or may think of us.

 (3.) It is much more desirable to have matter of glorying in ourselves 
 than in another. If we have the testimony of our consciences that we
 are accepted of God, we need not much concern ourselves about what 
 others think or say of us; and without this the good opinion of others 
 will stand us in little stead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The other argument which the apostle uses to press upon us this duty 
 of proving our own work is that every man shall bear his own burden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 the meaning of which is that at the great day every one shall be 
 reckoned with according as his behaviour here has been. He supposes 
 that there is a day coming when we must all give an account of 
 ourselves to God; and he declares that then the judgment will proceed, 
 and the sentence pass, not according to the sentiments of the world 
 concerning us, or any ungrounded opinion we may have had of ourselves, 
 or upon our having been better or worse than others, but according as 
 our state and behaviour have really been in the sight of God. And, if 
 there be such an awful time to be expected, when he will <I>render to 
 every one according to his works,</I> surely there is the greatest 
 reason why we should prove our own works now: if we must certainly be 
 called to an account hereafter, surely we ought to be often calling 
 ourselves to an account here, to see whether or no we are such as God 
 will own and approve then: and, as this is our duty, so if it were more 
 our practice we should entertain more becoming thoughts both of 
 ourselves and our fellow-christians, and instead of bearing hard upon 
 one another, on account of any mistakes or failings we may be guilty 
 of, we should be more ready to fulfil that law of Christ by which we 
 must be judged in bearing one another's burdens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christians are here exhorted to be free and liberal in maintaining 
 their ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth, 
 in all good things.</I> Here we may observe, 

 1. The apostle speaks of it as a thing known and acknowledged, that, as
 there are some to be taught, so there are others who are appointed to 
 teach them. The office of the ministry is a divine institution, which 
 does not lie open in common to all, but is confined to those only whom 
 God has qualified for it and called to it: even reason itself directs 
 us to put a difference between the teachers and the taught (for, if all 
 were teachers, there would be none to be taught), and the scriptures 
 sufficiently declare that it is the will of God we should do so. 

 2. It is the word of God wherein ministers are to teach and instruct
 others; that which they are to preach is <I>the word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:2">2 Tim. iv. 2</A>.

 That which they are to declare is <I>the counsel of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>.
 
 They are not <I>lords of our faith, but helpers of our joy,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:24">2 Cor. i. 24</A>.

 It is the word of God which is the only rule of faith and life; this
 they are concerned to study, and to open, and improve, for the 
 edification of others, but they are no further to be regarded than as 
 they speak according to this rule. 

 3. It is the duty of those who are taught in the word to support those
 who are appointed to teach them; for they are <I>to communicate to them 
 in all good things,</I> freely and cheerfully to contribute, of the 
 good things with which God has blessed them, what is needful for their 
 comfortable subsistence. Ministers are <I>to give attendance to
 reading, to exhortation, to doctrine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:13">1 Tim. iv. 13</A>);

 they are not to <I>entangle themselves with the affairs of this 
 life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4">2 Tim. ii. 4</A>),

 and therefore it is but fit and equitable that, while they are 
 <I>sowing to others spiritual things, they should reap their carnal 
 things.</I> And this is the appointment of God himself; for as, under 
 the law, <I>those who ministered about holy things lived of the things 
 of the temple, so hath the Lord ordained that those who preach the 
 gospel should live of the gospel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:11,13,14">1 Cor. ix. 11, 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a caution to take heed of mocking God, or of deceiving 
 ourselves, by imagining that he can be imposed upon by mere pretensions 
 or professions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I> This may be considered as 
 referring to the foregoing exhortation, and so the design of it is to 
 convince those of their sin and folly who endeavoured by any plausible 
 pretences to excuse themselves from doing their duty in supporting 
 their ministers: or it may be taken in a more general view, as 
 respecting the whole business of religion, and so as designed to take 
 men off from entertaining any vain hopes of enjoying its rewards while 
 they live in the neglect of its duties. The apostle here supposes that 
 many are apt to excuse themselves from the work of religion, and 
 especially the more self-denying and chargeable parts of it, though at 
 the same time they may make a show and profession of it; but he assures 
 them that <I>this their way is their folly,</I> for, though hereby they 
 may possibly impose upon others, yet they do but deceive themselves if 
 they think to impose upon God, who is perfectly acquainted with their 
 hearts as well as actions, and, as he cannot be deceived, so he will 
 not be mocked; and therefore, to prevent this, he directs us to lay 
 down as a rule to ourselves, <I>That whatsoever a man soweth that shall 
 he also reap;</I> or that according as we behave ourselves now, so will 
 our account be in the great day. Our present time is seed-time: in the 
 other world there will be a great harvest; and, as the husbandman reaps 
 in the harvest according as he sows in the seedness, so we shall reap 
 then as we sow now. And he further informs us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that, as there are two sorts of seedness, sowing to the flesh and 
 sowing to the Spirit, so accordingly will the reckoning be hereafter: 
 <I>If we sow to the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption.</I> 
 If we sow the wind, we shall reap the whirlwind. Those who live a 
 carnal sensual life, who instead of employing themselves to the honour 
 of God and the good of others, spend all their thoughts, and care, and 
 time, about the flesh, must expect no other fruit of such a course than 
 corruption--a mean and short-lived satisfaction at present, and ruin 
 and misery at the end of it. But, on the other hand, <I>those who sow 
 to the Spirit,</I> who under the guidance and influence of the Spirit 
 do live a holy and spiritual life, a life of devotedness to God and of 
 usefulness and serviceableness to others, may depend upon it that <I>of 
 the Spirit they shall reap life everlasting</I>--they shall have the 
 truest comfort in their present course, and an eternal life and 
 happiness at the end of it. Note, Those who go about to mock God do but 
 deceive themselves. Hypocrisy in religion is the greatest folly as well 
 as wickedness, since the God we have to do with can easily see through 
 all our disguises, and will certainly deal with us hereafter, not 
 according to our professions, but our practices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Here is a further caution given us, <I>not to be weary in well 
 doing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 As we should not excuse ourselves from any part of our duty, so neither 
 should we grow weary in it. There is in all of us too great a proneness 
 to this; we are very apt to flag and tire in duty, yea to fall off from 
 it, particularly that part of it to which the apostle has here a 
 special regard, that of doing good to others. This therefore he would 
 have us carefully to watch and guard against; and he gives this very 
 good reason for it, because <I>in due season we shall reap, if we faint 
 not,</I> where he assures us that there is a recompence of reward in 
 reserve for all who sincerely employ themselves in well doing; that 
 this reward will certainly be bestowed on us in the proper season--if 
 not in this world, yet undoubtedly in the next; but then that it is 
 upon supposition that we faint not in the way of our duty; if we grow 
 weary of it, and withdraw from it, we shall not only miss of this 
 reward, but lose the comfort and advantage of what we have already 
 done; but, if we hold on and hold out in well-doing, though our reward 
 may be delayed, yet it will surely come, and will be so great as to 
 make us an abundant recompence for all our pains and constancy. Note,
 Perseverance in well-doing is our wisdom and interest, as well as our 
 duty, for to this only is the reward promised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Here is an exhortation to all Christians to do good in their 
 places 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:10">
 <I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>As we have therefore an opportunity,</I> &c. It is not enough that 
 we be good to others, if we would approve ourselves to be Christians 
 indeed. The duty here recommended to us is the same that is spoken of 
 in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1-10">foregoing verses</A>;

 and, as there the apostle exhorts us to sincerity and perseverance in 
 it, so here he directs us both as to the objects and rule of it. 

 1. The objects of this duty are more generally all men. We are not to
 confine our charity and beneficence within too narrow bounds, as the 
 Jews and judaizing Christians were apt to do, but should be ready to 
 extend it to all who partake of the same common nature with us, as far 
 as we are capable and they stand in need of us. But yet, in the 
 exercise of it, we are to have a special regard to the household of 
 faith, or to those who profess the same common faith, and are members 
 of the same body of Christ, with us: though others are not to be 
 excluded, yet these are to be preferred. The charity of Christians 
 should be extensive charity: but yet therein a particular respect is to 
 be had to good people. God does good to all, but in an especial manner 
 he is good to his own servants; and we must in doing good be 
 <I>followers of God as dear children.</I>

 2. The rule which we are to observe in doing good to others is <I>as we
 have opportunity,</I> which implies,

 (1.) That we should be sure to do it while we have opportunity, or
 while our life lasts, which is the only season wherein we are capable
 of doing good to others. If therefore we would behave ourselves aright
 in this matter, we must not, as too many do, neglect it in our 
 life-time, and defer it till we come to die, under a pretence of doing 
 something of this nature then: for, as we cannot be sure that we shall 
 then have an opportunity for it, so neither, if we should, have we any 
 ground to expect that what we do will be so acceptable to God, much 
 less that we can atone for our past neglects by leaving something 
 behind us for the good of others, when we can no longer keep it 
 ourselves. But we should take care to do good in our life-time, yea, to 
 make this the business of our lives. And,

 (2.) That we be ready to improve every opportunity for it: we should
 not content ourselves in having done some good already; but, whenever 
 fresh occasions offer themselves, as far as our capacity reaches we 
 should be ready to embrace them too, for we are directed to <I>give a 
 portion to seven and also to eight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:2">Eccl. xi. 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] As God has made it our duty to do good to others, so he takes care 
 in his providence to furnish us with opportunities for it. <I>The poor 
 we have always with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:11">Matt. xxvi. 11</A>.

 [2.] Whenever God gives us an opportunity of being useful to others, he
 expects we should improve it, according to our capacity and ability. 
 
 [3.] We have need of godly wisdom and discretion to direct us in the
 exercise of our charity or beneficence, and particularly in the choice 
 of the proper objects of it; for, though none who stand in need of us 
 are to be wholly overlooked, yet there is a difference to be made 
 between some and others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine
 own hand.
 &nbsp; 12  As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they
 constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer
 persecution for the cross of Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the
 law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in
 your flesh.
 &nbsp; 14  But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
 Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
 unto the world.
 &nbsp; 15  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing,
 nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
 &nbsp; 16  And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <I>be</I> on
 them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
 &nbsp; 17  From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body
 the marks of the Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 18  Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with your
 spirit. Amen.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having at large established the doctrine of the gospel, 
 and endeavoured to persuade these Christians to a behaviour agreeable 
 to it, seems as if he intended here to have put an end to the epistle, 
 especially when he had acquainted them that, as a particular mark of 
 his respect for them, he had written this large letter with his own 
 hand, and had not made use of another as his amanuensis, and only 
 subscribed his name to it, as he was wont to do in his other epistles: 
 but such is his affection to them such his concern to recover them from 
 the bad impressions made upon them by their false teachers, that he 
 cannot break off till he has once again given them the true character 
 of those teachers, and an account of his own contrary temper and 
 behaviour, that by comparing these together they might the more easily 
 see how little reason they had to depart from the doctrine he had 
 taught them and to comply with theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives them the true character of those teachers who were 
 industrious to seduce them, in several particulars. As, 

 1. They were men who <I>desired to make a fair show in the flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They were very zealous for the externals of religion, forward to 
 observe, and to oblige others to observe, the rites of the ceremonial 
 law, though at the same time they had little or no regard to real 
 piety; for, as the apostle says of them in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:13">following verse</A>,

 <I>neither do they themselves keep the law.</I> Proud, vain, and carnal
 hearts desire nothing more than to make a fair show in the flesh, and
 they can easily be content with so much religion as will help them to 
 keep up such a fair show; but frequently those have least of the 
 substance of religion who are most solicitous to make a show of it. 

 2. They were men who were afraid of suffering, for they constrained
 the Gentile Christians to be circumcised, <I>only lest they should 
 suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</I> It was not so much out 
 of a regard to the law as to themselves; they were willing to sleep in 
 a whole skin, and to save their worldly cargo, and cared not though 
 they made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. That which they 
 chiefly aimed at was to please the Jews, and to keep up their 
 reputation among them, and so to prevent the trouble that Paul, and 
 other faithful professors of the doctrine of Christ, lay open to. And, 
 
 3. Another part of their character was that they were men of a party
 spirit, and who had no further zeal for the law than as it subserved 
 their carnal and selfish designs; for they desired to have these 
 Christians circumcised, <I>that they might glory in their flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that they might say they had gained them over to their side, and made 
 proselytes of them, of which they carried the mark in their flesh. And 
 thus, while they pretended to promote religion, they were the greatest 
 enemies of it; for nothing has been more destructive to the interest of 
 religion than men-siding and party-making.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He acquaints us, on the other hand, with his own temper and 
 behaviour, or makes profession of his own faith, hope, and joy; 
 particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his principle glory was in the cross of Christ: <I>God 
 forbid,</I> says he, <I>that I should glory, save in the cross of our 
 Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 By the cross of Christ is here meant his sufferings and death on the 
 cross, or the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. This was 
 what the Jews stumbled at and the Greeks accounted foolishness; and the 
 judaizing teachers themselves, though they had embraced Christianity, 
 yet were so far ashamed of it that in compliance with the Jews, and to 
 avoid persecution from them, they were for mixing the observance of the 
 law of Moses with faith in Christ, as necessary to salvation. But Paul 
 had a very different opinion of it; he was so far from being offended 
 at the cross of Christ, or ashamed of it, or afraid to own it, that he 
 gloried in it; yea, he desired to glory in nothing else, and rejected 
 the thought of setting up anything in competition with it, as the 
 object of his esteem, with the utmost abhorrence; <I>God forbid,</I> 
 &c. This was the ground of all his hope as a Christian: this was the 
 doctrine which, as an apostle, he was resolved to preach; and, whatever 
 trials his firm adherence to it might bring upon him, he was ready, not 
 only to submit to them, but to rejoice in them. Note, The cross of 
 Christ is a good Christian's chief glory, and there is the greatest 
 reason why we should glory in it, for to it we owe all our joys and 
 hopes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he was dead to the world. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, 
 <I>the world was crucified to him, and he to the world;</I> he had 
 experienced the power and virtue of it in weaning him from the world, 
 and this was one great reason of his glorying in it. The false teachers 
 were men of a worldly temper, their chief concern was about their 
 secular interests, and therefore they accommodated their religion 
 thereunto. But Paul was a man of another spirit; as the world had no 
 kindness for him, so neither had he any great regard to it; he had got 
 above both the smiles and the frowns of it, and had become as 
 indifferent to it as one who is dying out of it. This is a temper of 
 mind that all Christians should be labouring after; and the best way to 
 attain it is to converse much with the cross of Christ. The higher 
 esteem we have of him the meaner opinion shall we have of the world, 
 and the more we contemplate the sufferings our dear Redeemer met with 
 from the world the less likely shall we be to be in love with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he did not lay the stress of his religion on one side or the 
 other of the contesting interests, but on sound Christianity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 There was at that time an unhappy division among Christians; 
 circumcision and uncircumcision had become names by which they were 
 distinguished from each other; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9,12"><I>ch.</I> ii. 9, 12</A>)

 the Jewish Christians are called <I>the circumcision,</I> and <I>those
 of the circumcision.</I> The false teachers were very zealous for 
 circumcision; yea, to such a degree as to represent it as necessary to 
 salvation, and therefore they did all they could to constrain the 
 Gentile Christians to submit to it. In this they had carried the matter 
 much further than others did; for, though the apostles connived at the 
 use of it among the Jewish converts, yet they were by no means for 
 imposing it upon the Gentiles. But what they laid so great a stress 
 upon Paul made very little account of. It was indeed of great 
 importance to the interest of Christianity that circumcision should not 
 be imposed on the Gentile converts, and therefore this he had set 
 himself with the utmost vigour to oppose; but as for mere circumcision 
 or uncircumcision, whether those who embraced the Christian religion 
 had been Jews or Gentiles, and whether they were for or against 
 continuing the use of circumcision, so that they did not place their 
 religion in it--this was comparatively a matter of little moment with
 him; for he very well knew that <I>in Jesus Christ,</I> that is, in his 
 account, or under the Christian dispensation, <I>neither circumcision 
 availed any thing nor uncircumcision,</I> as to men's acceptance with 
 God, <I>but a new creature.</I> Here he instructs us both wherein real 
 religion does not and wherein it does consist. It does not consist in 
 circumcision or uncircumcision, in our being in this or the other 
 denomination of Christians; but it consists in our being new creatures; 
 not in having a new name, or putting on a new face, but in our being 
 renewed in the spirit of our minds and having Christ formed in us: this 
 is of the greatest account with God, and so it was with the apostle. If 
 we compare this text with some others, we may more fully see what it is 
 that renders us most acceptable to God, and about which we should 
 therefore be chiefly concerned. Here we are told that it is <I>a new 
 creature,</I> and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6"><I>ch.</I> v. 6</A>
 
 that it is <I>faith which worketh by love,</I> and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:19">1 Cor. vii. 19</A>

 that it is <I>the keeping of the commandments of God,</I> from all 
 which it appears that it is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are 
 disposed and enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus and to live a life of 
 devotedness to God; and that where this inward, vital, practical 
 religion is wanting, no outward professions, nor particular names, will 
 ever stand us in any stead, or be sufficient to recommend us to him. 
 Were Christians duly concerned to experience this in themselves, and to 
 promote it in others, if it did not make them lay aside their 
 distinguishing names, yet it would at least take them off from laying 
 so great a stress upon them as they too often do. Note, Christians 
 should take care to lay the stress of their religion where God has laid 
 it, namely, on those things which are available to our acceptance with 
 him; so we see the apostle did, and it is our wisdom and interest 
 herein to follow his example. The apostle having shown what was of 
 chief consideration in religion, and what he laid the greatest stress 
 upon, namely, not a mere empty name or profession, but a sound and 
 saving change, in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>

 he pronounces a blessing upon all those who walk according to this 
 rule: <I>And as many as walk according to this rule peace be upon them, 
 and mercy upon the Israel of God.</I> The rule which he here speaks of 
 may signify more generally the whole word of God, which is the complete 
 and perfect rule of faith and life, or that doctrine of the gospel, or 
 way of justification and salvation, which he had laid down in this 
 epistle, namely, by faith in Christ without the works of the law; or it 
 may be considered as more immediately referring to the new creature, of 
 which he had just before been speaking. The blessings which he desires 
 for those who walk according to this rule, or which he gives them the 
 hope and prospect of (for the words may be taken either as a prayer or 
 a promise), are <I>peace and mercy</I>--peace with God and conscience, 
 and all the comforts of this life as far as they are needful for them, 
 and mercy, or an interest in the free love and favour of God in Christ, 
 which are the spring and fountain of all other blessings. A foundation
 is laid for these in that gracious change which is wrought in them; and 
 while they behave themselves as new creatures, and govern their lives 
 and hopes by the rule of the gospel, they may most assuredly depend 
 upon them. These, he declares, shall be the portion of <I>all the 
 Israel of God,</I> by whom he means all sincere Christians, whether 
 Jews or Gentiles, all who are Israelites indeed, who, though they may 
 not be the natural, yet are become the spiritual seed of Abraham; 
 these, being heirs of his faith, are also heirs together with him of 
 the same promise, and consequently entitled to the peace and mercy here 
 spoken of. The Jews and judaizing teachers were for confining these 
 blessings to such as were circumcised and kept the law of Moses; but, 
 on the contrary, the apostle declares that they belong to all who walk 
 according to the rule of the gospel, or of the new creature, even to 
 all the Israel of God, intimating that those only are the true Israel 
 of God who walk according to this rule, and not that of circumcision, 
 which they insisted so much upon, and therefore that this was the true 
 way to obtain peace and mercy. Note,

 (1.) Real Christians are such as walk by rule; not a rule of their own 
 devising, but that which God himself has prescribed to them. 

 (2.) Even those who walk according to this rule do yet stand in need of 
 the mercy of God. But, 

 (3.) All who sincerely endeavour to walk according to this rule may be 
 assured that peace and mercy will be upon them: this is the best way to 
 have peace with God, ourselves, and others; and hereupon, as we may be 
 sure of the favour of God now, so we may be sure that we shall find 
 mercy with him hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he had cheerfully suffered persecution for the sake of Christ 
 and Christianity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 As the cross of Christ, or the doctrine of salvation by a crucified 
 Redeemer, was what he chiefly gloried in, so he had been willing to run 
 all hazards rather than he would betray this truth, or suffer it to be 
 corrupted. The false teachers were afraid of persecution, and this was 
 the great reason why they were zealous for circumcision, as we see, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 But this was the least of Paul's concern; he was not moved at any of 
 the afflictions he met with, <I>nor did he count his life dear to him, 
 so that he might finish his course with joy, and the ministry which he 
 had received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24">Acts xx. 24</A>.

 He had already suffered much in the cause of Christ, for <I>he bore in
 his body the marks of the Lord Jesus,</I> the scars of those wounds 
 which he had sustained from persecuting enemies, for his steady 
 adherence to him, and that doctrine of the gospel which he had received 
 from him. As from this it appeared that he was firmly persuaded of the 
 truth and importance of it, and that he was far from being a favourer 
 of circumcision, as they had falsely reported him to be, so hereupon, 
 with a becoming warmth and vehemence, suitable to his authority as an 
 apostle and to the deep concern of mind he was under, he insists upon 
 it that no man should henceforth trouble him, namely by opposing his 
 doctrine or authority, or by any such calumnies and reproaches as had 
 been cast upon him; for as, both from what he had said and what he had 
 suffered, they appeared to be highly unjust and injurious, so also 
 those were very unreasonable who either raised or received them. Note,

 (1.) It may justly be presumed that men are fully persuaded of those 
 truths in the defence of which they are willing to suffer. And 

 (2.) It is very unjust to charge those things upon others which are 
 contrary not only to their profession, but their sufferings too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle, having now finished what he intended to write for the 
 conviction and recovery of the churches of Galatia, concludes the 
 epistle with his apostolical benediction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He calls them his brethren, wherein he shows his great humility, and 
 the tender affection he had for them, notwithstanding the ill treatment 
 he had met with from them; and takes his leave of them with this very 
 serious and affectionate prayer, that <I>the grace of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ may be with their spirit.</I> This was a usual farewell wish of 
 the apostle's, as we see,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20,1Co+16:23">Rom. xvi. 20, 24,
 and 1 Cor. xvi. 23</A>.

 And herein he prays that they might enjoy the favour of Christ, both in
 its special effects and its sensible evidences, that they might receive 
 from him all that grace which was needful to guide them in their way, 
 to strengthen them in their work, to establish them in their Christian 
 course, and to encourage and comfort them under all the trials of life 
 and the prospect of death itself. This is fitly called <I>the grace of 
 our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> as he is both the sole purchaser and the 
 appointed dispenser of it; and though these churches had done enough to 
 forfeit it, by suffering themselves to be drawn into an opinion and 
 practice highly dishonourable to Christ, as well as dangerous to them, 
 yet, out of his great concern for them, and knowing of what importance 
 it was to them, he earnestly desires it on their behalf; yea, that it 
 might <I>be with their spirit,</I> that they might continually 
 experience the influences of it upon their souls, disposing and 
 enabling them to act with sincerity and uprightness in religion. We 
 need desire no more to make us happy than the grace of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ. This the apostle begs for these Christians, and therein shows 
 us what we are chiefly concerned to obtain; and, both for their and our 
 encouragement to hope for it, he adds his <I>Amen.</I></P>
