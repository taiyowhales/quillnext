 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The famous story of St. Paul's conversion from being an outrageous
 persecutor of the gospel of Christ to be an illustrious professor and 
 preacher of it. 

 1. How he was first awakened and wrought upon by an appearance of
 Christ himself to him as he was going upon an errand of persecution to
 Damascus: and what a condition he was in while he lay under the power
 of those convictions and terrors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:10-19">ver. 10-19</A>.

 3. How he immediately commenced doctor, and preached the faith of
 Christ, and proved what he preached, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.

 5. How he was admitted among the brethren at Jerusalem: how he 
 preached, and was persecuted there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:26-30">ver. 26-30</A>.

 after this,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter
 against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
 &nbsp; 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues,
 that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women,
 he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly
 there shined round about him a light from heaven:
 &nbsp; 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
 Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
 &nbsp; 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am
 Jesus whom thou persecutest: <I>it is</I> hard for thee to kick
 against the pricks.
 &nbsp; 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou
 have me to do? And the Lord <I>said</I> unto him, Arise, and go into
 the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
 &nbsp; 7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless,
 hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
 &nbsp; 8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,
 he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought <I>him</I>
 into Damascus.
 &nbsp; 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
 drink.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We found mention made of Saul twice or thrice in the story of Stephen, 
 for the sacred penman longed to come to his story; and now we are come 
 to it, not quite taking leave of Peter but from henceforward being 
 mostly taken up with Paul the apostle of the Gentiles, as Peter was of 
 the circumcision. His name in Hebrew was <I>Saul--desired,</I> though as
 remarkably little in stature as his namesake king Saul was tall and 
 stately; one of the ancients calls him, <I>Homo tricubitalis--but four
 feet and a half in height;</I> his Roman name which he went by among 
 the citizens of Rome was <I>Paul--little.</I> He was born in Tarsus, a
 city of Cilicia, a free city of the Romans, and himself a freeman of 
 that city. His father and mother were both native Jews; therefore he 
 calls himself a <I>Hebrew of the Hebrews;</I> he was of the tribe of 
 Benjamin, which adhered to Judah. His education was in the schools of 
 Tarsus first, which was a little Athens for learning; there he 
 acquainted himself with the philosophy and poetry of the Greeks. Thence 
 he was sent to the university at Jerusalem, to study divinity and the 
 Jewish law. His tutor was Gamaliel, an eminent Pharisee. He had 
 extraordinary natural parts, and improved mightily in learning. He had 
 likewise a handicraft trade (being bred to tent-making), which was 
 common with those among the Jews who were bred scholars (as Dr. 
 Lightfoot saith), for the earning of their maintenance, and the 
 avoiding of idleness. This is the young man on whom the grace of God 
 wrought this mighty change here recorded, about a year after the 
 ascension of Christ, or little more. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How bad he was, how very bad, before his conversion; just before he 
 was an inveterate enemy to Christianity, did his utmost to root it out, 
 by persecuting all that embraced it. In other respects he was well 
 enough, as <I>touching the righteousness which is of the law, 
 blameless,</I> a man of no ill morals, but a blasphemer of Christ, a 
 persecutor of Christians, and injurious to both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>.

 And so ill informed was his conscience that he thought he ought to do
 what he did against the name of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:9"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 9</A>)

 and that he did God service in it, as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His general enmity and rage against the Christian religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 He <I>yet breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples 
 of the Lord.</I> The persons persecuted were the disciples of the Lord; 
 because they were so, under that character he hated and persecuted 
 them. The matter of the persecution was threatenings and slaughter. 
 There is persecution in threatenings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:17,21"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17, 21</A>);

 they terrify and break the spirit: and though we say, Threatened folks
 live long, yet those whom Saul threatened, if he prevailed not thereby 
 to frighten them from Christ, he slew them, he persecuted them to 
 death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:4"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 4</A>.

 His breathing out threatenings and slaughter intimates that it was 
 natural to him, and his constant business. He even breathed in this as 
 in his element. He breathed it out with heat and vehemence; his very 
 breath, like that of some venomous creatures, was pestilential. He 
 breathed death to the Christians, wherever he came; he puffed at them 
 in his pride 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:4,5">Ps. xii. 4, 5</A>),

 spit his venom at them in his rage. Saul yet breathing thus intimates, 
 
 (1.) That he still persisted in it; not satisfied with the blood of 
 those he had slain, he still cries, <I>Give, give.</I> 

 (2.) That he should shortly be of another mine; as yet he breathes out 
 threatenings and slaughter, but he has not long to live such a life as 
 this, that breath will be stopped shortly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His particular design upon the Christians at Damascus; thither was 
 the gospel now lately carried by those that fled from the persecution 
 at Stephen's death, and thought to be safe and quiet there, and were 
 connived at by those in power there: but Saul cannot be easy if he 
 knows a Christian is quiet; and therefore, hearing that the Christians 
 in Damascus were so, he resolves to give them disturbance. In order to 
 this, he applies to the high priest for a commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to go to Damascus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The high priest needed not to be stirred up to persecute the 
 Christians, he was forward enough to do it; but it seems the young 
 persecutor drove more furiously than the old one. Leaders in sin are 
 the worst of sinners; and the proselytes which the scribes and 
 Pharisees make often prove seven times more the children of hell than 
 themselves. He saith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:5"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 5</A>)

 that this commission was had from the whole estate of the elders: and
 proud enough this furious bigot was to have a commission directed to 
 him, with the seal of the great sanhedrim affixed to it. Now the 
 commission was to empower him to enquire among the synagogues, or 
 congregations, of the Jews that were at Damascus, whether there were 
 any that belonged to them that inclined to favour this new sect or 
 heresy, that believed in Christ; and if he found any such, whether men 
 or women, to bring them up prisoners to Jerusalem, to be proceeded 
 against according to law by the great council there. Observe,

 (1.) The Christians are here said to be <I>those of this way; those of 
 the way,</I> so it is in the original. Perhaps the Christians sometimes 
 called themselves so, from Christ <I>the Way;</I> or, because they 
 looked on themselves as but in the way, and not yet at home; or, the 
 enemies thus represented it as away by itself, a by-way, a party, a 
 faction. 

 (2.) The high priest and sanhedrim claimed a power over the Jews in all 
 countries, and had a deference paid to their authority in matters of 
 religion, by all their synagogues, even those that were not of the 
 jurisdiction of the civil government of the Jewish nation. And such a 
 sovereignty the Roman pontiff now claims as the Jewish pontiff then 
 did, though he has not so much to show for it. 

 (3.) By this commission, all that worshipped God in the way that they 
 called heresy, though agreeing exactly with the original institutes 
 even of the Jewish church, whether they were men or women, were to be 
 prosecuted. Even the weaker sex, who in a case of this nature might 
 deserve excuse, or at least compassion, shall find neither with Saul 
 any more than they do with the popish persecutors. 

 (4.) He was ordered to bring them all bound to Jerusalem as criminals 
 of the first magnitude, which, as it would be the more likely to 
 terrify them, so it would be to magnify Saul, as having the command of 
 the forces that were to carry them up, and opportunity of breathing out 
 threatenings and slaughter. Thus was Saul employed when the grace of 
 God wrought that great change in him. Let not us then despair of
 renewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let such 
 despair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin; for Paul 
 himself obtained mercy, that he might be a monument, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How suddenly and strangely a blessed change was wrought in him, not 
 in the use of any ordinary means, but by miracles. The conversion of 
 Paul is one of the wonders of the church. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The place and time of it: <I>As he journeyed, he came near to 
 Damascus;</I> and there, Christ met with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He was in the way, travelling upon his journey; not in the temple, 
 nor in the synagogue, nor in the meeting of the Christians, but by the 
 way. The work of conversion is not tied to the church, though 
 ordinarily public administrations are made use of. Some are reclaimed 
 in slumberings on the bed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15-17">Job xxxiii. 15-17</A>),

 and some in travelling upon the road alone: Thoughts are as free, and 
 there is as good an opportunity of communing with our own hearts there, 
 as upon the bed; and there the Spirit may set in with us, for that wind 
 blows where it listeth. Some observe that Saul was spoken to abroad in 
 the open air that there might be no suspicion of imposture, nor of a 
 trick put upon him in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was near Damascus, almost at his journey's end, ready to enter 
 the city, the chief city of Syria. Some observe that he who was to be 
 the apostle of the Gentiles was converted to the faith of Christ in a 
 Gentile country. Damascus had been infamous for persecuting God's 
 people formerly--they threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:3">Amos i. 3</A>),
 
 and now it was likely to be so again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He was in a wicked way, pursuing his design against the Christians 
 at Damascus, and pleasing himself with the thought that he should 
 devour this new-born child of Christianity there. Note, Sometimes the 
 grace of God works upon sinners when they are at the worst, and hotly 
 engaged in the most desperate sinful pursuits, which is much for the 
 glory both of God's pity and of his power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The cruel edict and decree he had with him drew near to be put in 
 execution; and now it was happily prevented, which may be considered, 
 
 [1.] As a great kindness to the poor saints at Damascus, who had notice
 of his coming, as appears by what Ananias said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 and were apprehensive of their danger from him, and trembled as poor 
 lambs at the approach of a ravening wolf; Saul's conversion was their 
 security for the present. Christ has many ways of delivering the godly 
 out of temptation, and sometimes does it by a change wrought in their 
 persecutors, either restraining their wrathful spirits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>)

 and mollifying them for a time, as the Old-Testament Saul, who relented 
 towards David more than once 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:16,26:21">1 Sam. xxiv. 16; xxvi. 21</A>),

 or renewing their spirits, and fixing upon them durable impressions, as 
 upon the New-Testament Saul here. 

 [2.] It was also a very great mercy to Saul himself to be hindered from 
 executing his wicked design, in which if he had now proceeded, perhaps 
 it had been the filling up of the measure of his iniquity. Note, It is 
 to be valued as a signal token of the divine favour if God, either by 
 the inward operations of his grace or the outward occurrences of his 
 providence, prevent us from prosecuting and executing a sinful purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32">1 Sam. xxv. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The appearance of Christ to him in his glory. Here it is only said
 that there <I>shone round about him a light from heaven;</I> but it 
 appears from what follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 that the Lord Jesus was in this light, and appeared to him by the way. 
 He saw that just One

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:14"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 14</A>),
 
 and see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:13"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 13</A>.

 Whether he saw him at a distance, as Stephen saw him, in the heavens,
 or nearer in the air, is not certain. It is not inconsistent with what 
 is said of the heavens receiving Christ till the end of time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21"><I>ch.</I> iii. 21</A>)

 to suppose that he did, upon such an extraordinary occasion as this,
 make a personal visit, but a very short one, to this lower world; it 
 was necessary to Paul's being an apostle that he should see the Lord, 
 and so he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1,15:8">1 Cor. ix. 1; xv. 8</A>.

 (1.) This light shone upon him 
 <I>suddenly</I>--<B><I>exaiphnes,</I></B> when Paul never thought of
 any such thing, and without any previous warning. Christ's
 manifestations of himself to poor souls are many times sudden and very 
 surprising, and he anticipates them with the blessings of his goodness.
 This the disciples that Christ called to himself found. <I>Or ever I 
 was aware,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:12">Cant. vi. 12</A>.

 (2.) It was a light from Heaven, the fountain of light, from the God of 
 heaven, the Father of lights. It was a light above the brightness of 
 the sun

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:13"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 13</A>),

 for it was visible at mid-day, and outshone the sun in his meridian
 strength and lustre,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:23">Isa. xxiv. 23</A>.

 (3.) It shone <I>round about him,</I> not in his face only, but on
 every side of him; let him turn which way he will, he finds himself 
 surrounded with the discoveries of it. And this was designed not only 
 to startle him, and awaken his attention (for well may he expect to 
 hear when he is thus made to see something very extraordinary), but to 
 signify the enlightening of his understanding with the knowledge of 
 Christ. The devil comes to the soul in darkness; by this he gets and 
 keeps possession of it. But Christ comes to the soul in light, for he 
 is himself the light of the world, bright and glorious to us, as light. 
 The first thing in this new creation, as in that of the world, is 
 light, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 Hence all Christians are said to be <I>children of the light and of the
 day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8">Eph. v. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The arresting of Saul, and his detachment: <I>He fell to the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Some think that he was on foot, and that this light, which perhaps was 
 accompanied with a thunderclap, so terrified him that he could not keep 
 his feet, but fell upon his face, usually a posture of adoration, but 
 here of astonishment. It is probable that he was mounted, as Balaam, 
 when he went to curse Israel, and perhaps better mounted than he; for 
 Saul was now in a public post, was in haste, and the journey was long, 
 so that it is not likely he should travel on foot. The sudden light 
 would frighten the beast he rode on, and make it throw him; and it was 
 God's good providence that his body got no hurt by the fall: but angels 
 had a particular charge concerning him, to keep all his bones, so that 
 not one of them was broken. It appears

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:14"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 14</A>)

 that all that were with him fell to the earth as well as he, but the
 design was upon him. This may be considered, 

 (1.) As the effect of Christ's appearing to him, and of the light which 
 shone round about him. Note, Christ's manifestations of himself to poor 
 souls are humbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of 
 themselves, and a humble submission to the will of God. Now <I>mine 
 eyes see thee,</I> saith Job, <I>I abhor myself. I saw the Lord,</I> 
 saith Isaiah, <I>sitting upon a throne, and I said, Woe is me, for I am 
 undone.</I> 

 (2.) As a step towards this intended advancement. He is designed not 
 only to be a Christian, but to be a minister, an apostle, a great 
 apostle, and therefore he must thus be cast down. Note, Those whom 
 Christ designs for the greatest honours are commonly first laid low.
 Those who are designed to excel in knowledge and grace are commonly 
 laid low first, in a sense of their own ignorance and sinfulness. Those 
 whom God will employ are first struck with a sense of their 
 unworthiness to be employed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The arraigning of Saul. Being by the fall taken into custody, and as 
 it were set to the bar, he heard a voice saying to him (and it was 
 distinguishing, to him only, for though those that were with him heard 
 a sound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 yet they knew not the words,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:9"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 9</A>),

 <I>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Saul not only saw a light from heaven, but heard a voice from 
 heaven; wherever the glory of God was seen, the word of God was heard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:18">Exod. xx. 18</A>);
 
 and to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:89">Num. vii. 89</A>);

 and to the prophets. God's manifestations of himself were never dumb 
 shows, for he magnifies his word above all his name, and what was seen 
 was alway designed to make way for what was said. Saul heard a voice. 
 Note, Faith comes by hearing; hence the Spirit is said to be received 
 by the hearing of faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:2">Gal. iii. 2</A>.

 The voice he heard was the voice of Christ. When he <I>saw that just
 One, he heard the voice of his mouth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:14"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 14</A>.

 Note, The word we hear is likely to profit us when we hear it as the 
 voice of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13">1 Thess. ii. 13</A>.

 <I>It is the voice of my beloved;</I> no voice but his can reach the
 heart. Seeing and hearing are the two learning senses; Christ here, by 
 both these doors, entered into Saul's heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he heard was very awakening.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He was called by his name, and that doubled: <I>Saul, Saul.</I> 
 Some think, in calling him Saul, he hints at that great persecutor of 
 David whose name he bore. He was indeed a second Saul, and such an 
 enemy to the Son of David as the other was to David. Calling him by his 
 name intimates the particular regard that Christ had to him: <I>I have 
 surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa. xlv. 4</A>.

 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:12">Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>.

 His calling him by name brought the conviction home to his conscience,
 and put it past dispute to whom the voice spoke this. Note, What God 
 speaks in general is then likely to do us good when we apply it to 
 ourselves, and insert our own names into the precepts and promises 
 which are expressed generally, as if God spoke to us by name, and when 
 he saith, <I>Ho, every one,</I> he had said, <I>Ho, such a one: Samuel, 
 Samuel; Saul, Saul.</I> The doubling of it, <I>Saul, Saul,</I> 
 intimates, <I>First,</I> The deep sleep that Saul was in; he needed to 
 be called again and again, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:29">Jer. xxii. 29</A>,

 <I>O earth, earth, earth. Secondly,</I> The tender concern that the
 blessed Jesus had for him, and for his recovery. He speaks as one in 
 earnest; it is like <I>Martha, Martha</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:41">Luke x. 41</A>),
 
 or <I>Simon, Simon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31">Luke xxii. 31</A>),
 
 or <I>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 He speaks to him as to one in imminent danger, at the pit's brink, and
 just ready to drop in: "<I>Saul, Saul,</I> dost thou know whither thou 
 art going, or what thou art doing?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The charge exhibited against him is, <I>Why persecutest thou 
 me?</I> Observe here, <I>First,</I> Before Saul was made a saint, he 
 was made to see himself a sinner, a great sinner, a sinner against 
 Christ. Now he was made to see that evil in himself which he never saw 
 before; sin revived and he died. Note, A humbling conviction of sin is 
 the first step towards a saving conversion from sin. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 He is convinced of one particular sin, which he was most notoriously 
 guilty of, and had justified himself in, and thereby way is made for 
 his conviction of all the rest. <I>Thirdly,</I> The sin he is convinced 
 of is persecution: <I>Why persecutest thou me?</I> It is a very 
 affectionate expostulation, enough to melt a heart of stone. Observe, 
 
 1. The person sinning: "It is thou; thou, that art not one of the
 ignorant, rude, unthinking crowd, that will run down any thing they 
 hear put into an ill name, but thou that hast had a liberal learned 
 education, has good parts and accomplishments, hast the knowledge of 
 the scriptures, which, if duly considered, would show thee the folly of 
 it. It is worse in thee than in another." 

 2. The person sinned against: "It is I, who never did thee any harm,
 who came from heaven to earth to do thee good, who was not long since 
 crucified for thee; and was not that enough, but must I afresh be 
 crucified by thee?" 

 3. The kind and continuance of the sin. It was persecution, and he was
 at this time engaged in it: "Not only thou hast persecuted, but thou 
 persecutest, thou persistest in it." He was not at this time hauling 
 any to prison, nor killing them; but this was the errand he came upon 
 to Damascus; he was now projecting it, and pleasing himself with the 
 thought of it. Note, Those that are designing mischief are, in God's
 account, doing mischief. 

 4. The question put to him upon it: "Why dost thou do it?"

 (1.) It is complaining language. "Why dealest thou thus unjustly, thus 
 unkindly, with my disciples?" Christ never complained so much of those 
 who persecuted him in his own person as he did here of those who 
 persecuted him in his followers. He complains of it as it was Saul's 
 sin: "Why art thou such an enemy to thyself, to thy God?" Note, The 
 sins of sinners are a very grievous burden to the Lord Jesus. He is 
 grieved for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5">Mark iii. 5</A>),

 he is pressed under them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13">Amos ii. 13</A>.

 (2.) It is convincing language: "Why dost thou thus: Canst thou give
 any good reason for it?" Note, It is good for us often to ask ourselves 
 why we do so and so, that we may discern what an unreasonable thing sin 
 is: and of all sins none so unreasonable, so unaccountable, as the sin 
 of persecuting the disciples of Christ, especially when it is 
 discovered to be, as certainly it is, persecuting Christ. Those have no 
 knowledge who eat up God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>.

 <I>Why persecutest thou me?</I> He thought he was persecuting only a
 company of poor, weak, silly people, that were an offence and eye-sore 
 to the Pharisees, little imagining that is was one in heaven that he 
 was all this while insulting; for surely, if he had known, he would not 
 have persecuted the Lord of glory. Note, Those who persecute the saints 
 persecute Christ himself, and he takes what is done against them as 
 done against himself, and accordingly will be the judgment in the great 
 day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:45">Matt. xxv. 45</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Saul's question upon his indictment, and the reply to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He makes enquiry concerning Christ: <I>Who art thou, Lord?</I> He 
 gives no direct answer to the charge preferred against him, being 
 convicted by his own conscience, and self-condemned. If God contend 
 with us for our sins, we are not able to answer for one of a thousand, 
 especially such a one as the sin of persecution. Convictions of sin, 
 when they are set home with power upon the conscience, will silence all 
 excuses and self-justifications. <I>Though I were righteous, yet would 
 I not answer.</I> But he desires to know who is his judge; the 
 compellation is respectful: <I>Lord.</I> He who had been a blasphemer 
 of Christ's name now speaks to him as his Lord. The question is proper: 
 <I>Who art thou?</I> This implies his present unacquaintedness with 
 Christ; he knew not his voice as his own sheep do, but he desired to be 
 acquainted with him; he is convinced by this light which encloses him 
 that it is one from heaven that speaks to him, and he has a veneration 
 for every thing that appears to him to come from heaven; and therefore, 
 <I>Lord, who art thou? What is thy name?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:17,Ge+32:29">Judg. xiii. 17; Gen. xxxii. 29</A>.
 
 Note, there is some hope of people when they begin to enquire after
 Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He has an answer immediately, in which we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ's gracious revelation of himself to him. He is always ready 
 to answer the serious enquiries of those who covet an acquaintance with 
 him: <I>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</I> The name of Jesus was not 
 unknown to him; his heart had risen against it many a time, and gladly 
 would he bury it in oblivion. He knew it was the name that he 
 persecuted, but little did he think to hear it from heaven, or from the 
 midst of such a glory as now shone round about him. Note, Christ brings 
 souls into fellowship with himself by manifesting himself to them. He 
 said, <I>First, I am Jesus, a Saviour; I am Jesus of Nazareth,</I> so 
 it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:8"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 8</A>.

 Saul used to call him so when he blasphemed him: "I am that very Jesus
 whom thou usedst to call in scorn <I>Jesus of Nazareth.</I>" And he 
 would show that now that he is in his glory he is not ashamed of his 
 humiliation. <I>Secondly, "I am that Jesus whom thou persecutest,</I> 
 and therefore it will be at thy peril if thou persist in this wicked 
 course." There is nothing more effectual to awaken and humble the soul 
 than to see sin to be against Christ, an affront to him, and a 
 contradiction to his designs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His gentle reproof of him: <I>It is hard for thee to kick against 
 the pricks,</I> or <I>goads</I>--to spurn at the spur. It is hard, it is
 in itself an absurd and evil thing, and will be of fatal consequence to 
 him that does it. Those kick at the goad that stifle and smother the 
 convictions of conscience, that rebel against God's truths and laws, 
 that quarrel with his providences, and that persecute and oppose his 
 ministers, because they reprove them, and their words are as goads and 
 as nails. Those that revolt more and more when they are stricken by
 the word or rod of God, that are enraged at reproofs and fly in the 
 face of their reprovers, kick against the pricks and will have a great 
 deal to answer for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. His surrender of himself to the Lord Jesus at length, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The frame and temper he was in, when Christ had been dealing with 
 him. 

 [1.] He trembled, as one in a great fright. Note, Strong convictions, 
 set home by the blessed Spirit, will make an awakened soul to tremble. 
 How can those choose but tremble that are made to see the eternal God 
 provoked against them, the whole creation at war with them, and their 
 own souls upon the brink of ruin! 

 [2.] He was astonished, was filled with amazement, as one brought into 
 a new world, that knew not where he was. Note, The convincing,
 converting, work of Christ is astonishing to the awakened soul, and 
 fills it with admiration. "What is this that God has done with me, and 
 what will he do?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His address to Jesus Christ, when he was in this frame: <I>Lord, 
 what wilt thou have me to do?</I> This may be taken, 

 [1.] As a serious request for Christ's teachings: "Lord, I see I have 
 hitherto been out of the way; thou hast shown me my error, set me to 
 rights; thou hast discovered sin to me, discover to me the way to 
 pardon and peace." It is like that, <I>Men and brethren, what must we 
 do?</I> Note, A serious desire to be instructed by Christ in the way of 
 salvation is an evidence of a good work begun in the soul. Or, 

 [2.] As a sincere resignation of himself to the direction and 
 government of the Lord Jesus. This was the first word that grace spoke 
 in Paul, and with this began a spiritual life: Lord Jesus, <I>What wilt 
 thou have me to do?</I> Did not he know what he had to do? Had he not 
 his commission in his pocket? And what had he to do but to execute it? 
 No, he had done enough of this work already, and resolves now to change 
 his master, and employ himself better. Now it is not, What will the 
 high priest and the elders have me to do? What will my own wicked 
 appetites and passions have me to do? But, <I>What wilt thou have me to 
 do?</I> The great change in conversion is wrought upon the will, and 
 consists in the resignation of that to the will of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The general direction Christ gave him, in answer to this: 
 <I>Arise, go into the city of Damascus,</I> which thou art now near to, 
 <I>and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</I> It is encouragement 
 enough to have further instruction promised him, but, 

 [1.] He must not have it yet; it shall be told him shortly what he must 
 do, but, for the present, he must pause upon what has been said to him, 
 and improve that. Let him consider awhile what he has done in 
 persecuting Christ, and be deeply humbled for that, and then he shall 
 be told what he has further to do. 

 [2.] He must not have it in this way, by a voice from heaven, for it is 
 plain that he cannot bear it; he trembles, and is astonished. He shall 
 be told therefore what he must do by a man like himself, whose terror 
 shall not make him afraid, nor his hand be heavy upon him, which Israel 
 desired at mount Sinai. Or, it is an intimation that Christ would take 
 some other time to manifest himself further to him, when he was more 
 composed, and this fright pretty well over. Christ manifests himself
 to his people by degrees; and both what he does and would he have them 
 to do, though they know not now, they shall know hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. How far his fellow travellers were affected with this, and what 
 impression it made upon them. They fell to the earth, as he did, but 
 rose without being bidden, which he did not, but lay still till it was 
 said to him, <I>Arise;</I> for he lay under a heavier load than any of 
 them did; but when they were up, 

 (1.) <I>They stood speechless,</I> as men in confusion, and that was 
 all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They were going on the same wicked errand that Paul was, and perhaps, 
 to the best of their power, were as spiteful as he; yet we do not find 
 that any of them were converted, though they saw the light, and were 
 struck down and struck dumb by it. No external means will of themselves 
 work a change in the soul, without the Spirit and grace of God, which 
 distinguish between some and others; among these that journeyed 
 together, one is taken, and the others left. <I>They stood 
 speechless;</I> none of them said, <I>Who art thou, Lord?</I> or, 
 <I>What wilt thou have me to do?</I> as Paul did, but none of God's 
 children are born dumb.

 (2.) <I>They heard a voice, but saw no man;</I> they heard Paul speak, 
 but saw not him to whom he spoke, nor heard distinctly what was said to 
 him: which reconciles it with what is said of this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:9"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 9</A>,

 where it is said, <I>They saw the light and were afraid</I> (which they
 might do and yet see no man in the light, as Paul did), and <I>that 
 they heard not the voice of him that spoke to Paul,</I> so as to 
 understand what he said, though they did hear a confused noise. Thus 
 those who came hither to be the instruments of Paul's rage against the 
 church serve for witnesses of the power of God over him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. What condition Saul was in after this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 (1.) <I>He arose from the earth,</I> when Christ commanded him, but 
 probably not without help, the vision had made him so faint and weak, I 
 will not say like Belshazzar, when the joints of his loins were loosed 
 and his knees smote one against another, but like Daniel, when upon the 
 sight of a vision no strength remained in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:16,17">Dan. x. 16, 17</A>.

 (2.) <I>When his eyes were opened,</I> he found that his sight was 
 gone, and <I>he saw no man,</I> none of the men that were with him, and 
 began now to be busy about him. It was not so much this glaring light 
 that, <I>by dazzling his eyes, had dimmed them--Nimium sensibile
 l&aelig;dit sensum;</I> for then those with him would have lost their 
 sight too; but it was a sight of Christ, whom the rest saw not, that 
 had this effect upon him. Thus a believing sight of the glory of God
 in the face of Christ dazzles the eyes to all things here below. 
 Christ, in order to the further discovery of himself and his gospel to 
 Paul, took him off from the sight of other things, which he must look 
 off, that he may look unto Jesus, and to him only. 

 (3.) <I>They led him by the hand into Damascus;</I> whether to a public 
 house, or to some friend's house, is not certain; but thus he who 
 thought to have led the disciples of Christ prisoners and captives to 
 Jerusalem was himself led a prisoner and a captive to Christ into 
 Damascus. He was thus taught what need he had of the grace of Christ to 
 lead his soul (being naturally blind and apt to mistake) into all 
 truth. 

 (4.) He lay <I>without sight,</I> and without food, <I>neither did eat 
 nor drink for three days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 I do not think, as some do, that now he had his rapture into the third 
 heavens, which he speaks of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:1-31">2 Cor. xii</A>.

 So far from this that we have reason to think he was all this time
 rather in the belly of hell, suffering God's terrors for his sins, 
 which were now set in order before him: he was in the dark concerning 
 his own spiritual state, and was so wounded in spirit for sin that he 
 could relish neither meat nor drink.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias;
 and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said,
 Behold, I <I>am here,</I> Lord.
 &nbsp; 11 And the Lord <I>said</I> unto him, Arise, and go into the street
 which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for
 <I>one</I> called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
 &nbsp; 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and
 putting <I>his</I> hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
 &nbsp; 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this
 man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind
 all that call on thy name.
 &nbsp; 15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen
 vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings,
 and the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 16 For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my
 name's sake.
 &nbsp; 17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and
 putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, <I>even</I>
 Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath
 sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with
 the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been
 scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was
 baptized.
 &nbsp; 19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was
 Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
 &nbsp; 20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that
 he is the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 21 But all that heard <I>him</I> were amazed, and said; Is not this
 he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,
 and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound
 unto the chief priests?
 &nbsp; 22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the
 Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>As for God, his work is perfect; if he begin, he will make an 
 end:</I> a good work was begun in Saul, when he was brought to Christ's 
 feet, in that word, <I>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</I> And 
 never did Christ leave any that were brought to that. Though Saul was 
 sadly mortified when he lay three days blind, yet he was not abandoned. 
 Christ here takes care of the work of his own hands. He that hath torn 
 will heal--that hath smitten will bind up--that hath convinced will
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ananias is here ordered to go and look after him, to heal and help 
 him; for he that causeth grief will have compassion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The person employed is <I>Ananias, a certain disciple at 
 Damascus,</I> not lately driven thither from Jerusalem, but a native of 
 Damascus; for it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:12"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 12</A>)

 <I>that he had a good report of all the Jews who dwelt there, as a
 devout man according to the law;</I> he had lately embraced the gospel, 
 and given up his name to Christ, and, as it should seem, officiated as 
 a minister, at least <I>pro hac vice--on this occasion,</I> though it
 does not appear that he was apostolically ordained. But why were not 
 some of the apostles from Jerusalem sent for upon this great occasion, 
 or Philip the evangelist, who had lately baptized the eunuch, and might 
 have been fetched hither by the Spirit in a little time? Surely, 
 because Christ would employ variety of hands in eminent services, that 
 the honours might not be monopolized nor engrossed by a few--because he
 would put work into the hands, and thereby put honour upon the heads, 
 of those that were mean and obscure, to encourage them--and because he
 would direct us to make much of the ministers that are where our lot is 
 cast, if they have ordained mercy to be faithful, though they are not 
 of the most eminent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The direction given him is to go and enquire at such a house, 
 probably an inn, for one <I>Saul of Tarsus.</I> Christ, in a vision, 
 called to Ananias by name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is probable it was not the first time that he had heard the words of 
 God, and seen the visions of the Almighty; for, without terror or 
 confusion, he readily answers, "<I>Behold I am here, Lord,</I> ready to 
 go wherever thou sendest me, and to do whatever thou biddest me." <I>Go 
 then,</I> saith Christ, <I>into the street which is called Straight, 
 and enquire in the house of Judas</I> (where strangers used to lodge) 
 <I>for one called Saul of Tarsus.</I> Note, Christ very well knows 
 where to find out those that are his, in their distresses: when their 
 relations, it may be, know not what is become of them, they have a 
 friend in heaven, that knows in what street, in what house, nay, and 
 which is more, in what frame they are: he knows their souls in 
 adversity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Two reasons are given him why he must go and enquire for this 
 stranger, and offer him his service--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because he prays, and his coming to him must answer his prayer. 
 This is a reason, 

 [1.] Why Ananias needed not to be afraid of him, as we find he was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 There is no question, saith Christ, but he is a true convert, <I>for 
 behold he prayeth. Behold</I> denotes the certainty of it: "Assure 
 thyself it is so; go and see." Christ was so pleased to find Paul 
 praying that he must have others to take notice of it: <I>Rejoice with 
 me, for I have found the sheep which I had lost.</I> It denotes also 
 the strangeness of it: "Behold, and wonder, that he who but the other 
 day breathed nothing but threatenings and slaughter, now breathes 
 nothing but prayer." But was it such a strange thing for Saul to pray? 
 Was he not a Pharisee? and have we not reason to think he did, as the 
 rest of them did, make long prayers in the synagogues and the corners 
 of the streets? Yes; but now he began to pray after another manner than 
 he had done; then he said his prayers, now he prayed them. Note, 
 Regenerating grace ever more sets people on praying; you may as soon 
 find a living man without breath as a living Christian without prayer; 
 if breathless, lifeless; and so, if prayerless, graceless. 

 [2.] As a reason why Ananias must go to him with all speed. It is no 
 time to linger, <I>for behold he prayeth:</I> if the child cry, the 
 tender nurse will hasten to it with the breast. Saul here, like 
 Ephraim, is bemoaning himself, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, 
 and kicking against the goad. "Oh! go to him quickly, and tell him he 
 is a dear son, a pleasant child, and <I>since I spoke against him,</I> 
 for persecuting me, <I>I do earnestly remember him still.</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18-20">Jer. xxxi. 18-20</A>.

 Observe what condition Saul was now in. He was under conviction of sin,
 trembling and astonished; the setting of sin in order before us should 
 drive us to prayer. He was under a bodily affliction, blind and sick; 
 and, <I>Is any afflicted? Let him pray.</I> Christ had promised him 
 that it should be further told him what he should do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and he prays that one may be sent to him to instruct him. Note, What 
 God has promised we must pray for; he will for this be enquired of, and 
 particularly for divine instruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because he hath seen in a vision such a man coming to him, to 
 restore him to his sight; and Ananias's coming to him must answer his 
 dream, for it was of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias,</I> and just such a 
 man as thou art, <I>coming in</I> seasonably for his relief, <I>and 
 putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight.</I> Now this 
 vision which Paul had may be considered, 

 [1.] As an immediate answer to his prayer, and the keeping up of that 
 communion with God which he had entered into by prayer. He had, in 
 prayer, spread the misery of his own case before God, and God presently 
 manifests himself and the kind intentions of his grace to him; and it 
 is very encouraging to know God's thoughts to us-ward. 

 [2.] As designed to raise his expectations, and to make Ananias's 
 coming more welcome to him. He would readily receive him as a messenger 
 from God when he was told beforehand, in vision, that one of that name 
 would come to him. See what a great thing it is to bring a spiritual
 physician and his patient together: here were two visions in order to 
 it. When God, in his providence, does it without visions, brings a 
 messenger to the afflicted soul, an interpreter, one among a thousand, 
 to show unto man his uprightness, it must be acknowledged with 
 thankfulness to his praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ananias objects against going to him, and the Lord answers the 
 objection. See how condescendingly the Lord admits his servant to 
 reason with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Ananias pleads that this Saul was a notorious persecutor of the 
 disciples of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 (1.) He had been so at Jerusalem: "<I>Lord, I have heard by many of 
 this man,</I> what a malicious enemy he is to the gospel of Christ: all 
 those that were scattered upon the late persecution, many of whom are 
 come to Damascus, tell <I>how much evil he hath done to thy saints in 
 Jerusalem,</I> that he was the most virulent, violent persecutor of 
 all, and a ringleader in the mischief--what havoc he has made in the
 church: there was no man they were more afraid of, no, not the high 
 priest himself, than of Saul; nay," 

 (2.) "His errand to Damascus at this time is to persecute us 
 Christians: <I>Here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all 
 that call on thy name,</I> to treat the worshippers of Christ as the 
 worst of criminals." Now, why does Ananias object this. Not, 
 "Therefore I do not owe him so much service. Why should I do him a
 kindness who has done and designed us so much unkindness?" No, Christ 
 has taught us another lesson, to render good for evil, and pray for our 
 persecutors; but if he be such a persecutor of Christians, 

 [1.] Will it be safe for Ananias to go to him? Will he not throw 
 himself like a lamb into the mouth of a lion? And, if he thus bring 
 himself into trouble, he will be blamed for his indiscretion.

 [2.] Will it be to any purpose to go to him? Can such a hard heart ever 
 be softened, or such an Ethiopian ever change his skin?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ overrules the objection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 "Do not tell me how bad he has been, I know it very well; but go thy 
 way with all speed, and give him all the help thou canst, <I>for he is 
 a chosen vessel,</I> or instrument, unto me; I design to put confidence 
 in him, and then thou needest not fear him." He was a vessel in which 
 the gospel-treasure should be lodged, in order to the conveyance of it 
 to many; an earthen vessel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:7">2 Cor. iv. 7</A>),

 but a chosen vessel. The vessel God uses he himself chooses; and it is 
 fit he should himself have the choosing of the instruments he employs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:16">John xv. 16</A>):

 <I>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</I> He is a vessel of 
 honour, and must not be neglected in his present forlorn condition, nor 
 thrown away as a despised broken vessel, or a vessel in which there is 
 no pleasure. He is designed,

 (1.) For eminent services: <I>He is to bear my name before the 
 Gentiles,</I> is to be the apostle of the Gentiles, and to carry the 
 gospel to heathen nations. Christ's name is the standard to which souls 
 must be gathered, and under which they must be enlisted, and Saul must 
 be a standard-bearer. He must bear Christ's name, must bear witness to 
 it before kings, king Agrippa and C&aelig;sar himself; nay, he must 
 bear it before the children of Israel, though there were so many hands 
 already at work about them.

 (2.) For eminent sufferings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's 
 sake.</I> He that has been a persecutor shall be himself persecuted.
 Christ's showing him this intimates either his bringing him to these 
 trials (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:3">Ps. lx. 3</A>),

 <I>Thou hast shown thy people hard things,</I> or his giving notice of 
 them beforehand, that they might be no surprise to him. Note, Those 
 that bear Christ's name must expect to bear the cross for his name; and 
 those that do most for Christ are often called out to suffer most for 
 him. Saul must suffer great things. This, one would think, was a cold
 comfort for a young convert; but it is only like telling a soldier of a 
 bold and brave spirit, when he is enlisted, that he shall take the 
 field, and enter upon action, shortly. Saul's sufferings for Christ
 shall redound so much to the honour of Christ and the service of the 
 church, shall be so balanced with spiritual comforts and recompensed 
 with eternal glories, that it is no discouragement to him to be told 
 how great things he must suffer for Christ's name's sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Ananias presently goes on Christ's errand to Saul, and with good 
 effect. He had started an objection against going to him, but, when an 
 answer was given to it, he dropped it, and did not insist upon it. When 
 difficulties are removed, what have we to do but to go on with our 
 work, and not hang upon an objection?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Ananias delivered his message to Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Probably he found him in bed, and applied to him as a patient.

 (1.) <I>He put his hands on him.</I> It was promised, as one of the 
 signs that should follow those that believe, that they should lay hands 
 on the sick, and they should recover 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:18">Mark xvi. 18</A>),

 and it was for that intent that he put his hands on him. Saul came to 
 lay violent hands upon the disciples at Damascus, but here a disciple 
 lays a helping healing hand upon him. <I>The blood-thirsty hate the 
 upright, but the just seek his soul.</I> 

 (2.) He called him <I>brother,</I> because he was made a partaker of 
 the grace of God, though not yet baptized; and his readiness to own him 
 as a brother intimated to him God's readiness to own him as a son, 
 though he had been a blasphemer of God and a persecutor of his 
 children. 

 (3.) He produces his commission from the same hand that had laid hold 
 on him by the way, and now had him in custody. "That <I>same Jesus that 
 appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest,</I> and convinced thee of 
 thy sin in persecuting him, has now sent me to thee to comfort thee." 
 <I>Una eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit--The hand that wounded
 heals.</I> "His light struck thee blind, but he <I>hath sent me to thee 
 that thou mightest receive thy sight;</I> for the design was not to 
 blind thine eyes, but to dazzle them, that thou mightest see things by 
 another light: he that then put clay upon thine eyes hath sent me to 
 wash them, that they may be cured." Ananias might deliver his message 
 to Saul very appositely in the prophet's words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1,2">Hos. vi. 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Come and turn to the Lord, for he hath torn and he will heal thee; 
 he hath smitten, and he will bind thee up; now after two days he will 
 revive thee, and the third day he will raise thee up, and thou shalt 
 live in his sight.</I> Corrosives shall be no more applied, but 
 lenitives. 

 (4.) He assures him that he shall not only have his sight restored, but 
 be filled with the Holy Ghost: he must himself be an apostle, and must 
 in nothing come behind the chief of the apostles, and therefore must 
 receive the Holy Ghost immediately, and not, as others did, by the 
 interposition of the apostles; and Ananias's putting his hands upon him 
 before he was baptized was for the conferring of the Holy Ghost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Ananias saw the good issue of his mission. 

 (1.) In Christ's favour to Saul. At the word of Ananias, Saul was 
 discharged from his confinement by the restoring of his sight; for 
 Christ's commission to open the prison to those that were bound 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>)

 is explained by the giving of sight to the blind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18,Isa+42:7">Luke iv. 18; Isa. xlii. 7</A>.
 
 Christ's commission is to open the blind eyes, and to bring out the 
 prisoners from the prison. Saul is delivered from the spirit of bondage 
 by receiving sight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 which was signified by the falling of scales from his eyes; and this 
 immediately, and forthwith: the cure was sudden, to show that it was 
 miraculous. This signified the recovering of him, 

 [1.] From the darkness of his unconverted state. When he persecuted
 the church of God, and walked in the spirit and way of the Pharisees, 
 he was blind; he saw not the meaning either of the law or of the 
 gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:9">Rom. vii. 9</A>.

 Christ often told the Pharisees that they were blind, and could not
 make them sensible of it; they said, <I>We see,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:41">John ix. 41</A>.

 Saul is saved from his Pharisaical blindness, by being made sensible of
 it. Note, Converting grace opens the eyes of the soul, and makes the
 scales to fall from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 18</A>),

 to open men's eyes, and turn them from darkness to light: this was what
 Saul was sent among the Gentiles to do, by the preaching of the gospel, 
 and therefore must first experience it in himself. 

 [2.] From the darkness of his present terrors, under the apprehension 
 of guilt upon his conscience, and the wrath of God against him. This 
 filled him with confusion, during those three days he sat in darkness, 
 like Jonah for three days in the belly of hell; but now the scales fell 
 from his eyes, the cloud was scattered, and the Sun of righteousness 
 rose upon his soul, with healing under his wings.

 (2.) In Saul's subjection to Christ: He was baptized, and thereby 
 submitted to the government of Christ, and cast himself upon the grace 
 of Christ. Thus he was entered into Christ's school, hired into his 
 family, enlisted under his banner, and joined himself to him for better 
 for worse. The point was gained: it is settled; Saul is now a disciple 
 of Christ, not only ceases to oppose him, but devotes himself entirely 
 to his service and honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The good work that was begun in Saul is carried on wonderfully; 
 this new-born Christian, though he seemed <I>as one born out of due 
 time,</I> yet presently comes to maturity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He received his bodily strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He had continued three days fasting, which, with the mighty weight that 
 was all that time upon his spirits, had made him very weak; but, 
 <I>when he had received meat, he was strengthened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The Lord is for the body, and therefore care must be taken of it, to 
 keep it in good plight, that it may be fit to serve the soul in God's 
 service, and that Christ may be magnified in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:20">Phil. i. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He associated with the disciples that were at Damascus, fell in with 
 them, conversed with them, went to their meetings, and joined in 
 communion with them. He had lately <I>breathed out threatenings and 
 slaughter against them,</I> but now breathes love and affection to 
 them. Now <I>the wolf dwells with the lamb,</I> and <I>the leopard lies 
 down with the kid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:6">Isa. xi. 6</A>.

 Note, Those that take God for their God take his people for their
 people. Saul associated with the disciples, because now he saw an 
 amiableness and excellency in them, because he loved them, and found 
 that he improved in knowledge and grace by conversing with them; and 
 thus he made profession of his Christian faith, and openly declared 
 himself a disciple of Christ, by associating with those that were his 
 disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>He preached Christ in the synagogues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 To this he had an extraordinary call, and for it an extraordinary 
 qualification, God having immediately revealed his Son to him and in 
 him, that he might preach him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15,16">Gal. i. 15, 16</A>.

 He was so full of Christ himself, that <I>the Spirit within him
 constrained him</I> to preach him to others, and, like Elihu, <I>to 
 speak that he might be refreshed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:20">Job xxxii. 20</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Where he preached--in the synagogues of the Jews, for they were to
 have the first offer made them. The synagogues were their places of 
 concourse; there he met with them together, and there they used to 
 preach against Christ and to punish his disciples, by the same token 
 that Paul himself <I>had punished them oft in every synagogue</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:11"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 11</A>),

 and therefore there he would face the enemies of Christ where they were
 most daring, and openly profess Christianity where he had most opposed 
 it. 

 (2.) What he preached: <I>He preached Christ.</I> When he began to be a 
 preacher, he fixed this for his principle, which he stuck to ever 
 after: <I>We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus our Lord;</I> 
 nothing but Christ, and him crucified. He preached concerning Christ, 
 <I>that he is the Son of God,</I> his beloved Son, in whom he is well 
 pleased, and with us in him, and not otherwise. 

 (3.) How people were affected with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>All that heard him were amazed, and said, "Is not this he that 
 destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem,</I> and now does 
 he call on this name himself, and persuade others to call upon it, and 
 strengthen the hands of those that do?" <I>Quantum mutatus ab illo--Oh
 how changed! Is Saul also among the prophets?</I> Nay, did he not come 
 hither for that intent, to seize all the Christians he could find, and 
 <I>bring them bound to the chief priests?</I> Yes, he did. Who would 
 have thought then that he would ever preach Christ as he does? 
 Doubtless this was looked upon by many as a great confirmation of the 
 truth of Christianity, that one who had been such a notorious 
 persecutor of it came, on a sudden, to be such an intelligent, 
 strenuous, and capacious preacher of it. This miracle upon the mind of 
 such a man outshone the miracles upon men's bodies; and giving a man 
 such another heart was more than giving men to speak with other 
 tongues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He confuted and confounded those that opposed the doctrine of 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He signalized himself, not only in the pulpit, but in the schools, and 
 showed himself supernaturally enabled, not only to preach the truth, 
 but to maintain and defend it when he had preached it.

 (1.) He increased in strength. He became more intimately acquainted 
 with the gospel of Christ, and his pious affections grew more strong.
 He grew more bold and daring and resolute in defence of the gospel: 
 <I>He increased the more</I> for the reflections that were cast upon 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 in which his new friends upbraided him as having been a persecutor, and 
 his old friends upbraided him as being now a turncoat; but Saul, 
 instead of being discouraged by the various remarks made upon his 
 conversion, was thereby so much the more emboldened, finding he had 
 enough at hand wherewith to answer the worst they could say to him.
 
 (2.) He ran down his antagonists, and <I>confounded the Jews who dwelt 
 in Damascus;</I> he silenced them, and shamed them--answered their
 objections to the satisfaction of all indifferent persons, and pressed 
 them with arguments which they could make no reply to. In all his 
 discourses with the Jews he was still <I>proving that this Jesus is 
 very Christ, is the Christ, the anointed of God, the true Messiah 
 promised to the fathers.</I> He was proving it, 
 <B><I>symbibazon</I></B>--<I>affirming it and confirming it,</I>
 teaching with persuasion. And we have reason to think he was 
 instrumental in converting many to the faith of Christ, and building up 
 the church at Damascus, which he went thither to make havoc of. Thus 
 <I>out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong 
 sweetness.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took
 counsel to kill him:
 &nbsp; 24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched
 the gates day and night to kill him.
 &nbsp; 25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let <I>him</I> down by
 the wall in a basket.
 &nbsp; 26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join
 himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and
 believed not that he was a disciple.
 &nbsp; 27 But Barnabas took him, and brought <I>him</I> to the apostles,
 and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and
 that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at
 Damascus in the name of Jesus.
 &nbsp; 28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
 disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
 &nbsp; 30 <I>Which</I> when the brethren knew, they brought him down to
 C&aelig;sarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
 &nbsp; 31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Jud&aelig;a and Galilee
 and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the
 Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Luke here makes no mention of Paul's journey into Arabia, which he 
 tells us himself was immediately after his conversion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:16,17">Gal. i. 16, 17</A>.
 
 As soon as God <I>had revealed his Son in him, that he might preach
 him, he went not up to Jerusalem,</I> to receive instructions from the 
 apostles (as any other convert would have done, that was designed for 
 the ministry), but he went to Arabia, where there was new ground to 
 break up, and where he would have opportunity of teaching, but not 
 learning; thence he returned to Damascus, and there, three years after 
 his conversion, this happened, which is here recorded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He met with difficulties at Damascus, and had a narrow escape of 
 being killed there. Observe, 
 
 1. What his danger was
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The Jews took counsel to kill him,</I> being more enraged at him 
 than at any other of the preachers of the gospel, not only because he 
 was more lively and zealous in his preaching than any of them, and more 
 successful, but because he had been such a remarkable deserter, and his 
 being a Christian was a testimony against them. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 <I>The Jews watched the gates day and night to kill him;</I> they 
 incensed the governor against him, as a dangerous man, who therefore 
 kept the city with a guard to apprehend him, at his going out or coming 
 in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:32">2 Cor. xi. 32</A>.

 Now Christ showed Paul <I>what great things he must suffer for his
 name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 when here was presently the government in arms against him, which was a 
 great thing, and, as all his other sufferings afterwards, helped to 
 make him considerable. Saul was no sooner a Christian than a preacher, 
 no sooner a preacher than a sufferer; so quickly did he rise to the 
 summit of his preferment. Note, Where God gives great grace he commonly 
 exercises it with great trials.
 
 2. How he was delivered.

 (1.) The design against him was discovered: <I>Their lying in wait was 
 known of Saul,</I> by some intelligence, whether from heaven or from 
 men we are not told. 

 (2.) The disciples contrived to help him away--hid him, it is likely, by
 day; and in the night, the gates being watched, that he could not get 
 away through them, <I>they let him down by the wall, in a basket,</I> 
 as he himself relates it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:33">2 Cor. xi. 33</A>),

 <I>so he escaped out of their hands.</I> This story, as it shows us 
 that when we enter into the way of God we must look for temptation, and 
 prepare accordingly, so it shows us <I>that the Lord knows how to 
 deliver the godly out of temptation, and will with the temptation also 
 make a way to escape, that we may</I> not be by it deterred nor driven 
 from the way of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He met with difficulties at Jerusalem the first time he went 
 thither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He came to Jerusalem. This is thought to be that journey to Jerusalem 
 of which he himself speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:18">Gal. i. 18</A>):

 <I>After three years I went up to Jerusalem,</I> saith he, <I>to see 
 Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</I> But I rather incline to 
 think that this was a journey before that, because <I>his coming in</I> 
 and <I>going out, his preaching and disputing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>),

 seem to be more than would consist with his fifteen days' stay (for
 that was no more) and to require a longer time; and, besides, now he 
 came a stranger, but then he came, <B><I>historesai 
 Petron</I></B>--<I>to confer with Peter,</I> as one he was intimate
 with; however, it might possibly be the same. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How shy his friends were of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>When he came to Jerusalem,</I> he did not go to the chief priests 
 and the Pharisees (he had taken his leave of them long since), but 
 <I>he assayed to join himself to the disciples.</I> Wherever he came, 
 he owned himself one of that despised persecuted people, and associated 
 with them. They were now in his eyes <I>the excellent ones of the 
 earth, in whom was all his delight.</I> He desired to be acquainted 
 with them, and to be admitted into communion with them; but they looked 
 strange upon him, shut the door against him, and would not go about any 
 of their religious exercises if he were by, for <I>they were afraid of 
 him.</I> Now might Paul be tempted to think himself in an ill case, 
 when the Jews had abandoned and persecuted him, and the Christians 
 would not receive and entertain him. Thus does he fall into divers 
 temptations, and needs the armour of righteousness, as we all do, both 
 on the right hand and on the left, that we may not be discouraged 
 either by the unjust treatment of our enemies or the unkind treatment 
 of our friends. 

 (1.) See what was the cause of their jealousy of him: <I>They believed 
 not that he was a disciple,</I> but only pretended to be so, and came 
 among them as a spy or an informer. They knew what a bitter persecutor
 he had been, with what fury he went to Damascus some time ago; they had 
 heard nothing of him since, and therefore thought he was but a wolf in 
 sheep's clothing. The disciples of Christ had need to be cautious whom 
 they admit into communion with them. <I>Believe not every spirit.</I> 
 There is need of the wisdom of the serpent, to keep the mean between 
 the extremes of suspicion on the one hand and credulity on the other; 
 yet methinks it is safer to err on the charitable side, because it is 
 an adjudged case that it is better the tares should be found among the 
 wheat than that the wheat should any of it be rooted up and thrown out 
 of the field. 

 (2.) See how it was removed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Barnabas took him to the apostles</I> themselves, who were not so 
 scrupulous as the inferior disciples, <I>to whom he first assayed to 
 join himself, and he declared to them,</I> 

 [1.] What Christ had done for him: <I>He had shown himself to him in 
 the way</I> and spoken to him; and what he said.

 [2.] What he had since done for Christ: <I>He had preached boldly at 
 Damascus in the name of Jesus.</I> How Barnabas came to know this, more 
 than the rest of them, we are not told; whether he had himself been at 
 Damascus, or had had letters thence, or discoursed with some of that 
 city, by which he came to the knowledge of this; or whether he had 
 formerly been acquainted with Paul in the Grecian synagogues, or at the 
 feet of Gamaliel, and had such an account of his conversion from 
 himself as he saw cause enough to give credit to: but so it was that, 
 being satisfied himself, he gave satisfaction to the apostles 
 concerning him, he having brought no testimonials from the disciples at 
 Damascus, thinking <I>he needed not, as some others, epistles of 
 commendation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:1">2 Cor. iii. 1</A>.

 Note, The introducing of a young convert into the communion of the
 faithful is a very good work, and one which, as we have opportunity, we 
 should be ready to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How sharp his enemies were upon him. 

 (1.) He was admitted into the communion of the disciples, which was no 
 little provocation to his enemies. It vexed the unbelieving Jews to see 
 Saul a trophy of Christ's victory, and a captive to his grace, who had 
 been such a champion for their cause--to see him <I>coming in, and
 going out, with the apostles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and to hear them glorying in him, or rather glorifying God in him. 

 (2.) He appeared vigorous in the cause of Christ, and this was yet more 
 provoking to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>He spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</I> Note, Those that 
 speak for Christ have reason to speak boldly; for they have a good 
 cause, and speak for one who will at last speak for himself and them 
 too. The Grecians, or Hellenist Jews, were most offended at him, 
 because he had been one of them; and they drew him into a dispute, in 
 which, no doubt, he was too hard for them, as he had been for the Jews 
 at Damascus. One of the martyrs said, Though she could not dispute for 
 Christ, she could die for Christ; but Paul could do both. Now the Lord 
 Jesus divided the spoils of the strong man armed in Saul. For that same 
 natural quickness and fervour of spirit which, while he was in 
 ignorance and unbelief, made him a furious bigoted persecutor of the 
 faith, made him a most zealous courageous defender of the faith. 

 (3.) This brought him into peril of his life, with which he narrowly 
 escaped: <I>The Grecians,</I> when they found they could not deal with 
 him in disputation, contrived to silence him another way; <I>they went 
 about to slay him,</I> as they did Stephen when <I>they could not 
 resist the Spirit by which he spoke,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:10"><I>ch.</I> vi. 10</A>.

 That is a bad cause that has recourse to persecution for its last
 argument. But notice was given of this conspiracy too, and effectual 
 care taken to secure this young champion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>When the brethren knew</I> what was designed against him <I>they 
 brought him down to Cesarea.</I> They remembered how the putting of 
 Stephen to death, upon his disputing with the Grecians, had been the 
 beginning of a sore persecution; and therefore were afraid of having 
 such a vein opened again, and hastened Paul out of the way. He that 
 flies may fight again. He that fled from Jerusalem might do service at
 Tarsus, the place of his nativity; and thither they desired him by all 
 means to go, hoping he might there go on in his work with more safety 
 than at Jerusalem. Yet it was also by direction from heaven that he
 left Jerusalem at this time, as he tells us himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:17"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 17, 18</A>),

 that Christ now appeared to him, and ordered him to <I>go quickly out
 of Jerusalem,</I> for he must be sent <I>to the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Those by whom God has work to do shall be protected from all the 
 designs of their enemies against them till it be done. Christ's 
 witnesses cannot be slain till they have <I>finished their 
 testimony.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The churches had now a comfortable gleam of liberty and peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Then had the churches rest. Then,</I> when Saul was converted, so 
 some; when that persecutor was taken off, those were quiet whom he used 
 to irritate, and then those were quiet whom he used to molest. Or, 
 <I>then,</I> when he had gone from Jerusalem, the fury of the Grecian 
 Jews was a little abated, and they were the more willing to bear with 
 the other preachers now that Saul had gone out of the way.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The churches had rest.</I> After a storm comes a calm. Though we 
 are always to expect troublesome times, yet we may expect that they 
 shall not last always. This was a breathing-time allowed them, to 
 prepare them for the next encounter. The churches that were already 
 planted were mostly in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, within the limits 
 of the holy land. There were the first Christian churches, where Christ 
 had himself laid the foundation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They made a good use of this lucid interval. Instead of growing more 
 secure and wanton in the day of their prosperity, they abounded more in 
 their duty, and made a good use of their tranquillity. 

 (1.) They <I>were edified,</I> were built up in their most holy faith; 
 the more free and constant enjoyment they had of the means of knowledge 
 and grace, the more they increased in knowledge and grace. 

 (2.) They <I>walked in the fear of the Lord</I>--were more exemplary
 themselves for a holy heavenly conversation. They so lived that all who 
 conversed with them might say, Surely the fear of God reigns in those 
 people.

 (3.) They <I>walked in the comfort of the Holy Ghost</I>--were not only
 faithful, but cheerful, in religion; they stuck to the ways of the 
 Lord, and sang in those ways. <I>The comfort of the Holy Ghost</I> was 
 their consolation, and that which they made their chief joy. They had 
 recourse to the comfort of the Holy Ghost, and lived upon that, not 
 only in days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and 
 prosperity. The comforts of the earth, when they had the most free and 
 full enjoyment of them, could not content them without the comfort of 
 the Holy Ghost. Observe the connection of these two: when they walked 
 <I>in the fear of the Lord,</I> then they walked <I>in the comfort of 
 the Holy Ghost.</I> Those are most likely to walk cheerfully that walk 
 circumspectly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God blessed it to them for their increase in number: They <I>were 
 multiplied.</I> Sometimes the church multiplies the more for its being 
 afflicted, as Israel in Egypt; yet if it were always so, the saints of 
 the Most High would be worn out. At other times its rest contributes to 
 its growth, as it enlarges the opportunity of ministers, and invites 
 those in who at first are afraid of suffering. Or, <I>then,</I> when 
 <I>they walked in the fear of God and his comforts, they were 
 multiplied.</I> Thus those that will not be won by the word may be won 
 by the conversation of professors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all
 <I>quarters,</I> he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
 &nbsp; 33 And there he found a certain man named &AElig;neas, which had
 kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
 &nbsp; 34 And Peter said unto him, &AElig;neas, Jesus Christ maketh thee
 whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
 &nbsp; 35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to
 the Lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The visit Peter made to the churches that were newly planted by the 
 dispersed preachers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 1. He <I>passed through all quarters.</I> As an apostle, he was not to 
 be the resident pastor of any one church, but the itinerant visitor of 
 many churches, to confirm the doctrine of inferior preachers, to confer 
 <I>the Holy Ghost on those that believed,</I> and to ordain ministers. 
 He passed <B><I>dia panton</I></B>--<I>among them all,</I> who
 pertained to the churches of Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, mentioned in 
 the foregoing chapter. He was, like his Master, always upon the remove, 
 and <I>went about doing good;</I> but still his head-quarters were at 
 Jerusalem, for there we shall find him imprisoned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 2</A>.

 <I>He came to the saints at Lydda.</I> This seems to be the same with
 <I>Lod,</I> a city in the tribe of Benjamin, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:12,Ezr+2:33">1 Chron. viii. 12; Ezra ii. 33</A>.

 The Christians are called <I>saints,</I> not only some particular
 eminent ones, as saint Peter and saint Paul, but every sincere
 professor of the faith of Christ. These are the saints on the earth,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:3">Ps. xvi. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cure Peter wrought on <I>Eneas,</I> a man that had been 
 bedridden eight years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 1. His case was very deplorable: <I>He was sick of the palsy,</I> a 
 dumb palsy, perhaps a dead palsy. The disease was extreme, for <I>he 
 kept his bed;</I> it was inveterate, for he kept his bed <I>eight 
 years;</I> and we may suppose that both he himself and all about him 
 despaired of relief for him, and concluded upon no other than that he 
 must still keep his bed till he removed to his grave. Christ chose such 
 patients as this, whose disease was incurable in a course of nature, to 
 show how desperate the case of fallen mankind was when he undertook 
 their cure. When we were without strength, as this poor man, <I>he sent 
 his word to heal us.</I> 
 
 2. His cure was very admirable,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 (1.) Peter interested Christ in his case, and engaged him for his 
 relief: <I>Eneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole.</I> Peter does not 
 pretend to do it himself by any power of his own, but declares it to be 
 Christ's act and deed, directs him to look up to Christ for help, and 
 assures him of an <I>immediate</I> cure--not, "He <I>will</I> make
 thee," but, "He <I>does</I> make thee, whole;" and a <I>perfect</I> 
 cure--not, "He makes thee <I>easy,</I>" but "He makes thee
 <I>whole.</I>" He does not express himself by way of prayer to Christ 
 that he would make him whole, but as one having authority from Christ, 
 and that knew his mind, he declares him made whole. 

 (2.) He ordered him to bestir himself, to exert himself: "<I>Arise and 
 make thy bed,</I> that all may see thou art thoroughly cured." Let none 
 say that because it is Christ that by the power of his grace works all 
 our works in us therefore we have no work, no duty, to do; for, though 
 Jesus Christ makes thee whole, yet thou must arise and make use of the 
 power he gives thee: "<I>Arise, and make thy bed,</I> to be to thee no 
 longer a bed of sickness, but a bed of rest." 

 (3.) Power went along with this word: he arose immediately, and no 
 doubt very willingly made his own bed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good influence this had upon many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>All that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the 
 Lord.</I> We can scarcely think that every individual person in those 
 countries took cognizance of the miracle, and was wrought upon by it; 
 but many, the generality of the people in the town of Lydda and in the 
 country of Saron, or Sharon, a fruitful plain or valley, of which it 
 was foretold, <I>Sharon shall be a fold of flocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:10">Isa. lxv. 10</A>.

 1. They all made enquiry into the truth of the miracle, did not
 overlook it, but saw him that was healed, and saw that it was a 
 miraculous cure that was wrought upon him by the power of Christ, in 
 his name, and with a design to confirm and ratify that doctrine of 
 Christ which was now preached to the world. 

 2. They all submitted to the convincing proof and evidence there was in
 this of the divine origin of the Christian doctrine, and <I>turned to 
 the Lord,</I> to the Lord Jesus. They turned from Judaism to 
 Christianity; they embraced the doctrine of Christ, and submitted to 
 his ordinances, and turned themselves over to him to be ruled and 
 taught and saved by him.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
 which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of
 good works and almsdeeds which she did.
 &nbsp; 37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and
 died: whom when they had washed, they laid <I>her</I> in an upper
 chamber.
 &nbsp; 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples
 had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men,
 desiring <I>him</I> that he would not delay to come to them.
 &nbsp; 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
 brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by
 him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas
 made, while she was with them.
 &nbsp; 40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed;
 and turning <I>him</I> to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she
 opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
 &nbsp; 41 And he gave her <I>his</I> hand, and lifted her up, and when he
 had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
 &nbsp; 42 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in
 the Lord.
 &nbsp; 43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with
 one Simon a tanner.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have another miracle wrought by Peter, for the confirming of 
 the gospel, and which exceeded the former--the raising of Tabitha to
 life when she had been for some time dead. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The life, and death, and character of Tabitha, on whom this miracle 
 was wrought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 1. She lived at Joppa, a sea-port town in the tribe of Dan, where Jonah 
 took shipping to go to Tarshish, now called <I>Japho.</I> 

 2. Her name was <I>Tabitha,</I> a Hebrew name, the Greek for which is
 <I>Dorcas,</I> both signifying a <I>doe,</I> or <I>hind,</I> or 
 <I>deer,</I> a pleasant creature. <I>Naphtali</I> is compared to <I>a 
 hind let loose, giving goodly words;</I> and the wife to the kind and 
 tender husband is as the loving <I>hind,</I> and as the pleasant 
 <I>roe,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>.

 3. She was a disciple, one that had embraced the faith of Christ and 
 was baptized; and not only so, but was eminent above many for works of 
 charity. She showed her faith by her works, her good works, which she 
 was full of, that is, in which she abounded. Her head was full of cares 
 and contrivances which way she should do good. She <I>devised liberal
 things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:8">Isa. xxxii. 8</A>.

 Her hands were full of good employment; she made a business of doing
 good, was never idle, having learned to <I>maintain good works</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:8">Tit. iii. 8</A>),

 to keep up a constant course and method of them. She was <I>full of 
 good works,</I> as a tree that is full of fruit. Many are full of good 
 words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great 
 doer, no great talker: <I>Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus--We do not
 talk great things, but we live them.</I> Among other good works, she 
 was remarkable for her <I>alms--deeds, which she did,</I> not only her
 works of piety, which are good works and the fruits of faith, but works 
 of charity and beneficence, flowing from love to her neighbour and a 
 holy contempt of this world. Observe, She is commended not only for the 
 alms which she gave, but for the alms--deeds which she did. Those that
 have not estates wherewith to give in charity may yet be able to do in 
 charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the 
 benefit of the poor. And those who will not do a charitable deed, 
 whatever they may pretend, if they were rich would not bestow a 
 charitable gift. She was full of alms--deeds, <B><I>hon
 epoiei</I></B>--<I>which she made;</I> there is an emphasis upon her
 <I>doing</I> them, because what her hand found to do of this kind she 
 did with all her might, and persevered in. They were alms--deeds, not
 which she purposed and designed and said she would do, but which she 
 did; not which she began to do, but which she did, which she went 
 through with, which she performed the doing of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:11,9:7">2 Cor. viii. 11; ix. 7</A>.

 This is the life and character of a certain disciple,; and should be of
 all the disciples of Christ; for, if we thus bear much fruit, then are 
 we his disciples indeed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:8">John xv. 8</A>.

 4. She was removed in the midst of her usefulness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>In those days she fell sick, and died.</I> It is promised to those 
 who consider the poor, not that they shall never be sick, but that the 
 Lord will <I>strengthen them upon the bed of languishing,</I> at least 
 with strength in their souls, and so will <I>make all their bed in 
 their sickness,</I> will make it easy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1,3">Ps. xli. 1, 3</A>.

 They cannot hope that they shall never die (<I>merciful men are taken
 away,</I> and merciful women too, witness Tabitha), but they may hope 
 that they shall <I>find mercy of the Lord in that day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:18">2 Tim. i. 18</A>.
 
 5. Her friends and those about her did not presently bury her, as
 usual, because they were in hopes Peter would come and raise her to 
 life again; but they <I>washed the dead body,</I> according to the 
 custom, which, it is said, was with warm water, which, if there were 
 any life remaining in the body, would recover it; so that this was done 
 to show that she was really and truly dead. They tried all the usual 
 methods to bring her to life, and could not. <I>Conclamatum est--the
 last cry was uttered.</I> They <I>laid her out</I> in her grave-clothes 
 <I>in an upper chamber,</I> which Dr. Lightfoot thinks was probably the 
 public meeting-room for the believers of that town; and they laid the 
 body there, that Peter, if he would come, might raise her to life the 
 more solemnly in that place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The request which her Christian friends sent to Peter to come to 
 them with all speed, not to attend the funeral, but, if it might be, to 
 prevent it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Lydda, where Peter now was, was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples at 
 Joppa had heard that Peter was there, and that he had raised Eneas from 
 a bed of languishing; and therefore they <I>sent him two men,</I> to 
 make the message the more solemn and respectful, <I>desiring him that 
 he would not delay to come to them;</I> not telling him the occasion, 
 lest he should modestly decline coming upon so great an errand as to 
 raise the dead: if they can but get him to them, they will leave it to 
 him. Their friend was dead, and it was too late to send for a 
 physician, but not too late to send for Peter. <I>Post mortem
 medicus--a physician after death,</I> is an absurdity, but not <I>Post
 mortem apostolus--an apostle after death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The posture in which he found the survivors, when he came to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Peter arose and went with them.</I> Though they did not tell him 
 what they wanted him for, yet he was willing to go along with them, 
 believing it was upon some good account or other that he was sent for. 
 Let not faithful ministers grudge to be at every body's beck, as far as 
 they have ability, when the great apostle <I>made himself the servant 
 of all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>.

 He found the corpse laid in the upper chamber, and attended by widows,
 probably such as were in the communion of the church, poor widows; 
 there they were,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Commending the deceased--a good work, when there was that in them
 which was truly commendable, and worthy of imitation, and when it is 
 done modestly and soberly, and without flattery of the survivors or any 
 sinister intention, but purely for the glory of God and the exciting of 
 others to that which is virtuous and praiseworthy. The commendation of 
 Tabitha was like her own virtues, not in word, but in deed. Here were 
 no encomiums of her in orations, nor poems inscribed to her memory; but 
 <I>the widows showed the coats and garments which she made</I> for 
 them, and bestowed upon them <I>while she was with them.</I> It was the 
 comfort of Job, while he lived, that the loins of the poor blessed him, 
 because they were warmed with the fleece of his sheep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:20">Job xxxi. 20</A>.

 And here it was the credit of Tabitha, when she was dead, that the
 backs of the widows praised her for the garments which she made them. 
 And those are certainly best praised <I>whose own works praise them in 
 the gates,</I> whether the words of others do or no. It is much more 
 honourable to clothe a company of decrepit widows with needful clothing 
 for night and day, who will pray for their benefactors when they do not 
 see them, than to clothe a company of lazy footmen with rich liveries, 
 who perhaps behind their backs will curse those that clothe them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:21">Eccl. vii. 21</A>);

 and it is what all that are wise and good will take a greater pleasure 
 in, for goodness is true greatness, and will pass better in the account 
 shortly. Observe, 

 (1.) Into what channel Tabitha turned much of her charity. Doubtless 
 there were other instances of her alms--deeds which she did, but this
 was now produced; she did, as it should seem with her own hands, 
 <I>make coats and garments</I> for poor widows, who perhaps with their 
 own labour could make a shift to get their bread, but could not earn 
 enough to buy clothes. And this is an excellent piece of charity, <I>If 
 thou seest the naked, that thou cover him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:7">Isa. lviii. 7</A>),

 and not think it enough to say, <I>Be ye warmed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16">James ii. 15, 16</A>.
 
 (2.) What a grateful sense the poor had of her kindness: <I>They showed 
 the coats,</I> not ashamed to own that they were indebted to her for 
 the clothes on their backs. Those are horribly ungrateful indeed who 
 have kindness shown them and will not make at least an acknowledgment 
 of it, by showing the kindness that is done them, as these widows here 
 did. Those who receive alms are not obliged so industriously to
 conceal it, as those are who give alms. When the poor reflect upon the
 rich as uncharitable and unmerciful, they ought to reflect upon 
 themselves, and consider whether they are not unthankful and 
 ungrateful. Their showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made 
 tended to the praise not only of her charity, but of her industry, 
 according to the character of the virtuous woman, that she <I>lays her 
 hands to the spindle,</I> or at least to the needle, and then 
 <I>stretches out her hand to the poor,</I> and <I>reaches forth her 
 hands to the needy,</I> of what she has worked; and, when God and the 
 poor have thus had their due, <I>she makes herself coverings of 
 tapestry</I> and <I>her</I> own <I>clothing is silk and purple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:19-22">Prov. xxxi. 19-22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were here lamenting the loss of her: The widows stood by Peter, 
 weeping. When the merciful are taken away, it should be laid to heart, 
 especially by those to whom they have been in a particular manner 
 merciful. They need not weep for her; she is taken from the evil to 
 come, <I>she rests from her labours and her works follow her,</I> 
 besides those she leaves behind her: but they weep for themselves and 
 for their children, who will soon find the want of such a good woman, 
 that has not left her fellow. Observe, They take notice of what good 
 Dorcas did <I>while she was with them,</I> but now she is gone from 
 them, and this is their grief. Those that are charitable will find that 
 the <I>poor they have always with them;</I> but it is well if those 
 that are poor find that they have always the charitable with them. We 
 must make a good use of the lights that yet a little while are with us, 
 because they will not be always with us, will not be long with us: and 
 when they are gone we shall think what they did when they were with us. 
 It should seem, the widows wept before Peter, as an inducement to him, 
 if he could do any thing, to have compassion on them and help them, and 
 restore one to them that used to have compassion on them. When 
 charitable people are dead, there is no praying them to life again; 
 but, when they are sick, this piece of gratitude is owing to them, to 
 pray for their recovery, that, if it be the will of God, those may be 
 spared to live who can ill be spared to die.</P>

 IV. The manner in which she was raised to life. 

 1. Privately: She was laid in the upper room where they used to have 
 their public meetings, and, it should seem, there was great crowding 
 about the dead body, in expectation of what would be done; <I>but Peter 
 put them all forth,</I> all the weeping widows, all but some few 
 relations of the family, or perhaps the heads of the church, to join 
 with him in prayer; as Christ did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:25">Matt. ix. 25</A>.

 Thus Peter declined every thing that looked like vainglory and
 ostentation; they came to see, but he did not come to be seen. He put 
 them all forth, that he might with the more freedom pour out his soul 
 before God in prayer upon this occasion, and not be disturbed with 
 their noisy and clamorous lamentations. 

 2. By prayer. In his healing Eneas there was an implied prayer, but in
 this greater work he addressed himself to God by solemn prayer, as 
 Christ when he raised Lazarus; but Christ's prayer was with the 
 authority of a Son, who <I>quickens whom he will;</I> Peter's with the 
 submission of a servant, who is under direction, and therefore he 
 <I>knelt down and prayed.</I> 

 3. By the word, a quickening word, a word which is spirit and life:
 <I>He turned to the body,</I> which intimates that when he prayed he 
 turned from it; lest the sight of it should discourage his faith, he 
 looked another way, to teach us, like Abraham, <I>against hope, to 
 believe in hope,</I> and overlook the difficulties that lie in the way, 
 <I>not considering the body as now dead,</I> lest we should <I>stagger 
 at the promise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:19,20">Rom. iv. 19, 20</A>.

 But, when he had prayed, he <I>turned to the body,</I> and spoke in his
 Master's name, according to his example: "<I>Tabitha, arise;</I> return 
 to life again." Power went along with this word, and she came to life, 
 <I>opened her eyes</I> which death had closed. Thus, in the raising of 
 dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of 
 the eyes of the mind,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 18</A>.

 When she saw Peter, she sat up, to show that she was really and truly
 alive; and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 <I>he gave her his hand and lifted her up,</I> not as if she laboured 
 under any remaining weakness, but thus he would as it were welcome her 
 to life again, and give her the right hand of fellowship among the 
 living, from whom she had been cut off. And, <I>lastly,</I> he
 <I>called the saints and widows,</I> who were all in sorrow for her 
 death, and <I>presented her alive</I> to them, to their great comfort, 
 particularly of the widows, who laid her death much to heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);
 
 to them he presented her, as Elijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:23">1 Kings xvii. 23</A>),
 
 and Elisha 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:36">2 Kings iv. 36</A>),
 
 and Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:15">Luke vii. 15</A>),

 presented the dead sons alive to their mothers. The greatest joy and
 satisfaction are expressed by life from the dead.</P>

 V. The good effect of this miracle. 

 1. Many were by it convinced of the truth of the gospel, that is was 
 from heaven, and not of men, and believed in the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 The thing was <I>known throughout all Joppa;</I> it would be in every 
 body's mouth quickly, and, it being a town of seafaring men, the notice 
 of it would be the sooner carried thence to other countries, and though 
 some never minded it many were wrought upon by it. This was the design 
 of miracles, to confirm a divine revelation. 

 2. Peter was hereby induced to continue some time in this city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 Finding that a door of opportunity was opened for him there, he tarried 
 there many days, till he was sent thence, and sent for thence upon 
 business to another place. He tarried not in the house of Tabitha, 
 though she was rich, lest he should seem to seek his own glory; but he 
 took up his lodgings with one Simon a tanner, an ordinary tradesman, 
 which is an instance of his condescension and humility: and hereby he 
 has taught us not to <I>mind high things, but to condescend to those of 
 low estate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16">Rom. xii. 16</A>.

 And, though Peter might seem to be buried in obscurity here in the
 house of a poor tanner by the sea-side, yet hence God fetched him to a 
 noble piece of service, which is recorded in the next chapter; for 
 <I>those that humble themselves shall be exalted.</I></P>
