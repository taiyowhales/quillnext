 We have here a further account of the travels of Paul, and his services 
 and sufferings for Christ. He was not like a candle upon a table, that 
 gives light only to one room, but like the sun that goes its circuit to 
 give light to many. He was called into Macedonia, a large kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:9"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 9</A>.

 He began with Philippi, because it was the first city he came to; but
 he must not confine himself to this. We have him here, 

 I. Preaching and persecuted at Thessalonica, another city of Macedonia, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. Preaching at Berea, where he met with an encouraging auditory, but
 was driven thence also by persecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 III. Disputing at Athens, the famous university of Greece

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>),

 and the account he gave of natural religion, for the conviction of
 those that were addicted to polytheism and idolatry, and to lead them
 to the Christian religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:22-31">ver. 22-31</A>),

 together with the success of this sermon,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
 they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
 &nbsp; 2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
 sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
 &nbsp; 3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
 and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach
 unto you, is Christ.
 &nbsp; 4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
 and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief
 women not a few.
 &nbsp; 5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto
 them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a
 company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the
 house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
 &nbsp; 6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
 brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have
 turned the world upside down are come hither also;
 &nbsp; 7 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
 decrees of C&aelig;sar, saying that there is another king, <I>one</I>
 Jesus.
 &nbsp; 8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
 they heard these things.
 &nbsp; 9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
 they let them go.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul's two epistles to the Thessalonians, the first two he wrote by 
 inspiration, give such a shining character of that church, that we 
 cannot but be glad here in the history to meet with an account of the 
 first founding of the church there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Paul's coming to Thessalonica, which was the chief city of 
 this country, called at this day <I>Salonech,</I> in the Turkish 
 dominions. Observe, 

 1. Paul went on with his work, notwithstanding the ill usage he had met
 with at Philippi; he did not fail, nor was discouraged. He takes notice 
 of this in his first epistle to the church here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1 Thess. ii. 2</A>):

 <I>After we were shamefully treated at Philippi, yet we were bold in 
 our God to speak unto you the gospel of God.</I> The opposition and 
 persecution that he met with made him the more resolute. Note of these
 things moved him; he could never have held out, and held on, as he did, 
 if he had not been animated by a spirit of power from on high. 

 2. He did but <I>pass through Amphipolis and Apollonia,</I> the former
 a city near Philippi, the latter near Thessalonica; doubtless he was 
 under divine direction, and was told by the Spirit (who, as the wind, 
 bloweth where he listeth) what places he should pass through, and what 
 he should rest in. Apollonia was a city of Illyricum, which, some 
 think, illustrates that of Paul, that he had preached the gospel 
 <I>from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:19">Rom. xv. 19</A>),

 that is, to the borders of Illyricum where he now was; and we may 
 suppose though he is said only to <I>pass through</I> these cities, yet 
 that he staid so long in them as to publish the gospel there, and to 
 prepare the way for the entrance of other ministers among them, whom he 
 would afterwards send.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His preaching to the Jews first, in their synagogue at 
 Thessalonica. He found a synagogue of the Jews there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which intimates that one reason why he passed through those other 
 cities mentioned, and did not continue long in them, was because there 
 were no synagogues in them. But, finding one in Thessalonica, by it he 
 made his entry. 

 1. It was always his manner to begin with the Jews, to make them the
 first offer of the gospel, and not to turn to the Gentiles till they 
 had refused it, that their mouths might be stopped from clamouring 
 against him because he preached to the Gentiles; for if they received 
 the gospel they would cheerfully embrace the new converts; if they 
 refused it, they might thank themselves if the apostles carried it to 
 those that would bid it welcome. That command of beginning at Jerusalem 
 was justly construed as a direction, wherever they came, to begin with 
 the Jews. 

 2. He met them in their synagogue on the sabbath day, in their place 
 and at their time of meeting, and thus he would pay respect to both. 
 Sabbaths and solemn assemblies are always very precious to those to 
 whom Christ is precious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.

 It is good being in the house of the Lord on his day. This was Christ's
 manner, and Paul's manner, and has been the manner of all the saints, 
 the <I>good old way</I> which they have walked in. 

 3. He <I>reasoned with them out of the scriptures.</I> They agreed with
 him to receive the scriptures of the Old Testament: so far they were of 
 a mind. But they received the scripture, and therefore thought they had 
 reason to reject Christ; Paul received the scripture, and therefore saw 
 great reason to embrace Christ. It was therefore requisite, in order to 
 their conviction, that he should, by reasoning with them, the Spirit 
 setting with him, convince them that his inferences from the scripture 
 were right and theirs were wrong. Note, The preaching of the gospel 
 should be both scriptural preaching and rational; such Paul's was, for 
 he <I>reasoned out of the scriptures:</I> we must take the scriptures 
 for our foundation, our oracle, and touchstone, and then reason out of 
 them and upon them, and against those who, though they pretend zeal for 
 the scriptures, as the Jews did, yet wrest them to their own 
 destruction. Reason must not be set up in competition with the
 scripture, but it must be made use of in explaining and applying the 
 scripture. 

 4. He continued to do this <I>three sabbath days</I> successively. If
 he could not convince them the first sabbath, he would try the second 
 and the third; for <I>precept must be upon precept, and line upon 
 line.</I> God waits for sinners' conversion, and so must his ministers; 
 all the labourers come not into the vineyard at the first hour, nor at 
 the first call, nor are wrought upon so suddenly as the jailer.

 5. The drift and scope of his preaching and arguing was to prove that
 <I>Jesus is the Christ;</I> this was that which he opened and alleged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He first explained his thesis, and opened the terms, and then alleged
 it, and laid it down, as that which he would abide by, and which he 
 summoned them in God's name to subscribe to. Paul had an admirable 
 method of discourse; and showed he was himself both well apprized of 
 the doctrine he preached and thoroughly understood it, and that he was 
 fully assured of the truth of it, and therefore he opened it like one 
 that believed it. He showed them,

 (1.) That it was necessary the Messiah should <I>suffer, and die, and 
 rise again,</I> that the Old-Testament prophecies concerning the 
 Messiah made it necessary he should. The great objection which the Jews 
 made against Jesus being the Messiah was his ignominious death and 
 sufferings. The <I>cross of Christ was to the Jews a 
 stumbling-block,</I> because it did by no means agree with the idea 
 they had framed of the Messiah; but Paul here alleges and makes it out 
 undeniably, not only that it was possible he might be the Messiah, 
 though he suffered, but that, being the Messiah, it was necessary he 
 should suffer. He could not be made perfect but by sufferings; for, if 
 he had not died, he could not have risen again from the dead. This was 
 what Christ himself insisted upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:26">Luke xxiv. 26</A>):

 <I>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into
 his glory?</I> And again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:26"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Thus it is written, and</I> therefore <I>thus it behoved Christ to 
 suffer, and to rise from the dead.</I> He must needs have suffered for 
 us, because he could not otherwise purchase redemption for us; and he 
 must needs have risen again because he could not otherwise apply the 
 redemption to us. 

 (2.) That Jesus is the Messiah: "<I>This Jesus whom I preach unto 
 you,</I> and call upon you to believe in, <I>is Christ,</I> is the 
 Christ, is the anointed of the Lord, is he that should come, and you 
 are to look for no other; for God has both by his word and by his works 
 (the two ways of his speaking to the children of men), by the 
 scriptures and by miracles, and the gift of the Spirit to make both 
 effectual, borne witness to him." Note, 

 [1.] Gospel ministers should preach Jesus; he must be their principal 
 subject; their business is to bring people acquainted with him. 

 [2.] That which we are to preach concerning Jesus is that he is Christ; 
 and therefore we may hope to be saved by him and are bound to be ruled 
 by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The success of his preaching there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. Some of the Jews believed, notwithstanding their rooted prejudices 
 against Christ and his gospel, and they <I>consorted with Paul and 
 Silas:</I> they not only associated with them as friends and 
 companions, but they gave up themselves to their direction, as their 
 spiritual guides; they put themselves into their possession as an 
 inheritance into the possession of the right owner, so the word 
 signifies; they first <I>gave themselves to the Lord,</I> and then to 
 them <I>by the will of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2 Cor. viii. 5</A>.

 They adhered to Paul and Silas, and attended them wherever they went.
 Note, Those that believe in Jesus Christ come into communion with his 
 faithful ministers, and associate with them.

 2. Many more of the devout Greeks, and of the chief women, embraced the 
 gospel. These were proselytes of the gate, the <I>godly among the 
 Gentiles</I> (so the Jews called them), such as, though they did not 
 submit to the law of Moses, yet renounced idolatry and immorality, 
 worshipped the true God only, and did not man any wrong. These were 
 <B><I>hoi sebomenoi Hellenes</I></B>--<I>the worshipping Gentiles;</I>
 as in America they call those of the natives that are converted to the 
 faith of Christ the <I>praying Indians.</I> These were admitted to join 
 with the Jews in their synagogue-worship. Of these <I>a great
 multitude believed,</I> more of them than of the thorough-paced Jews, 
 who were wedded to the ceremonial law. And not a few of the chief women 
 of the city, that were devout and had a sense of religion, embraced 
 Christianity. Particular notice is taken of this, for an example to the 
 ladies, the chief women, and an encouragement to them to employ 
 themselves in the exercises of devotion and to submit themselves to the 
 commanding power of Christ's holy religion, in all the instances of it; 
 for this intimates how acceptable it will be to God, what an honour to 
 Christ, and what great influence it may have upon many, besides the 
 advantages of it to their own souls. No mention is here made of their 
 preaching the gospel to the Gentile idolaters at Thessalonica, and yet 
 it is certain that they did, and that great numbers were converted; 
 nay, it should seem that of the Gentile converts that church was 
 chiefly composed, though notice is not taken of them here; for Paul 
 writes to the Christians there as having <I>turned to God from 
 idols</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9">1 Thess. i. 9</A>),

 and that at the first entering in of the apostles among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The trouble that was given to Paul and Silas at Thessalonica. 
 Wherever they preached, they were sure to be persecuted; bonds and 
 afflictions awaited them in every city. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who were the authors of their trouble: the <I>Jews who believed not, 
 who were moved with envy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Jews were in all places the most inveterate enemies to the 
 Christians, especially to those Jews that turned Christians, against 
 whom they had a particular spleen, as deserters. Now see what that 
 division was which Christ came to send upon earth; some of the Jews 
 believed the gospel and pitied and prayed for those that did not; while 
 those that did not envied and hated those that did. St. Paul in his
 epistle to this church takes notice of the rage and enmity of the Jews 
 against the preachers of the gospel, as their measure-filling sin. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who were the instruments of the trouble: the Jews made use of 
 <I>certain lewd persons of the baser sort,</I> whom they picked up and 
 got together, and who must undertake to give the sense of the city 
 against the apostles. All wise and sober people looked upon them with 
 respect, and valued them, and none would appear against them but such 
 as were the scum of the city, a company of vile men, that were given to 
 all manner of wickedness. Tertullian pleads this with those that 
 opposed Christianity, that the enemies of it were generally the worst 
 of men: <I>Tales semper nobis insecutores, injusti, impii, turpes, 
 quos, et ipsi damnare consuestis--Our persecutors are invariably unjust,
 impious, infamous, whom you yourselves have been accustomed to 
 condemn.</I>--Apologia, cap. 5. It is the honour of religion that those
 who hate it are generally the <I>lewd fellows of the baser sort,</I> 
 that are lost to all sense of justice and virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In what method they proceeded against them. 

 (1.) They <I>set the city in an uproar,</I> made a noise to put people 
 in a fright, and then every body ran to see what the matter was; they 
 began a riot, and then the mob was up presently. See who are the 
 troublers of Israel--not the faithful preachers of the gospel, but the
 enemies of it. See how the devil carries on his designs; he sets cities 
 in an uproar, sets souls in an uproar, and then fishes in troubled 
 waters. 

 (2.) They <I>assaulted the house of Jason,</I> where the apostles 
 lodged, with a design <I>to bring them out to the people,</I> whom they 
 had incensed and enraged against them, and by whom they hoped to see 
 them pulled to pieces. The proceedings here were altogether illegal; of 
 Jason's house must be searched, it ought to be done by the proper 
 officers, and not without a warrant: "A man's house," the law says, "is 
 his castle," and for them in a tumultuous manner to assault a man's 
 house, to put him and his family in fear, was but to show to what 
 outrages men are carried by a spirit of persecution. If men have 
 offended, magistrates are appointed to enquire into the offence, and to 
 judge of it; but to make the rabble judges and executioners too (as 
 these Jews designed to do) was to make truth fall in the street, to set 
 servants on horseback, and leave princes to walk as servants on the 
 earth--to depose equity, and enthrone fury.

 (3.) When they could not get the apostles into their hands (whom they
 would have punished as vagabonds, and incensed the people against as 
 strangers that came to spy out the land, and devour its strength, and 
 eat the bread out of their mouths), then they fall upon an honest 
 citizen of their own, who entertained the apostles in his house, his 
 name <I>Jason,</I> a converted Jew, and drew him out with some others 
 of the brethren to the rulers of the city. The apostles were advised to 
 withdraw, for they were more obnoxious, <I>Currenti cede furori--Retire
 before the torrent.</I> But their friends were willing to expose 
 themselves, being better able to weather this storm. <I>For a good 
 man,</I> for such good men as the apostles were, <I>some would even 
 dare to die.</I> 

 (4.) They accused them to the rulers, and represented them a dangerous 
 persons, not fit to be tolerated; the crime charged upon Jason is 
 receiving and harbouring the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 countenancing them and promoting their interest. And what was the 
 apostles' crime, that it should be no less than misprision of treason 
 to give them lodging? Two very black characters are here given them, 
 enough to make them odious to the people and obnoxious to the 
 magistrates, if they had been just:--

 [1.] That they were enemies to the public peace, and threw every thing 
 into disorder wherever they came: <I>Those that have turned the world 
 upside down are come hither also.</I> In one sense it is true that 
 wherever the gospel comes in its power to any place, to any soul, it 
 works such a change there, gives such a wide change to the stream, so 
 directly contrary to what it was, that it may be said to turn the world 
 upside down in that place, in that soul. The love of the world is 
 rooted out of the heart, and the way of the world contradicted in the 
 life; so that the world turned upside down there. But in the sense in 
 which they meant it, it is utterly false; they would have it thought 
 that the preachers of the gospel were incendiaries and mischief makers 
 wherever they came, that they sowed discord among relations, set 
 neighbours together by the ears, obstructed commerce, and inverted all 
 order and regularity. Because they persuaded people to turn from vice
 to virtue, from idols to the living and true God, from malice and envy 
 to love and peace, they are charged with turning the world upside down, 
 when it was only the kingdom of the devil in the world that they thus 
 overturned. Their enemies <I>set the city in an uproar,</I> and then
 laid the blame upon them; as Nero set Rome on fire, and then charged it 
 upon the Christians. If Christ's faithful ministers, even those that 
 are most quiet in the land, be thus invidiously misrepresented and 
 miscalled, let them not think it strange nor be exasperated by it; we 
 are not better than Paul and Silas, who were thus abused. The accusers 
 cry out, "They are <I>come hither also;</I> they have been doing all 
 the mischief they could in other places, and now they have brought the 
 infection hither; it is therefore time for us to bestir ourselves and 
 make head against them." 

 [2.] That they were enemies to the established government, and 
 disaffected to that, and their principles and practices were 
 destructive to monarchy and inconsistent with the constitution of the 
 state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 They all <I>do contrary to the decrees of C&aelig;sar;</I> not to any 
 particular decree, for there was as yet no law of the empire against 
 Christianity, but contrary to C&aelig;sar's power in general to make 
 decrees; for they say, <I>There is another king, one Jesus,</I> not 
 only a king of the Jews, as our Saviour was himself charged before 
 Pilate, but <I>Lord of all;</I> so Peter called him in the first sermon 
 he preached to the Gentiles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:36"><I>ch.</I> x. 36</A>.

 It is true the Roman government, both while it was a commonwealth and
 after it came into the C&aelig;sar's hands, was very jealous of any 
 governor under their dominion taking upon him the title of king, and 
 there was an express law against it. But Christ's <I>kingdom was not of 
 this world.</I> His followers said indeed, Jesus is a king, but not an 
 earthly king, not a rival with C&aelig;sar, nor his ordinances 
 interfering with the decrees of C&aelig;sar, but who had made it a law 
 of his kingdom to <I>render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are 
 C&aelig;sar's.</I> There was nothing in the doctrine of Christ that 
 tended to the dethroning of princes, nor the depriving them of any of 
 their prerogatives. The Jews knew this very well, and it was against 
 their consciences that they brought such a charge against the apostles; 
 and of all people it ill became the Jews to do it, who hated 
 C&aelig;sar and his government, and sought the ruin of him and it, and 
 who expected a Messiah that should be a temporal prince, and overturn 
 the thrones of kingdoms, and were therefore opposing our Lord Jesus 
 because he did not appear under that character. Thus those have been 
 most spiteful in representing God's faithful people as enemies to 
 C&aelig;sar, and hurtful to kings and provinces, who have been 
 themselves setting up <I>imperium in imperio--a kingdom within a
 kingdom,</I> a power not only in competition with C&aelig;sar's but 
 superior to it, that of the papal supremacy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The great uneasiness which this gave to this city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard 
 these things.</I> They had no ill opinion of the apostles or their 
 doctrine, could not apprehend any danger to the state from them, and 
 therefore were willing to connive at them; but, if they be represented 
 to them by the prosecutors as enemies to C&aelig;sar, they will be 
 obliged to take cognizance of them, and to suppress them, for fear of 
 the government, and this troubled them. Claudius, who then held the 
 reins of government, is represented by Suetonius as a man very jealous 
 of the least commotion and timorous to the last degree, which obliged 
 the rulers under him to be watchful against every thing that looked 
 dangerous, or gave the least cause of suspicion; and therefore it 
 troubled them to be brought under a necessity of disturbing good 
 men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The issue of this troublesome affair. The magistrates had no mind to 
 prosecute the Christians. Care was taken to secure the apostles; they 
 absconded, and fled, and kept out of their hands; so that nothing was 
 to be done but to discharge Jason and his friends upon bail, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The magistrates here were not so easily incensed against the apostles 
 as the magistrates at Philippi were, but were more considerate and of 
 better temper; so they <I>took security of Jason and the other,</I> 
 bound them to their good behavior; and perhaps they gave bond for Paul 
 and Silas, that they should be forthcoming when they were called for, 
 if any thing should afterwards appear against them. Among the 
 persecutors of Christianity, as there have been instances of the 
 madness and rage of brutes, so there have been likewise of the prudence 
 and temper of men; moderation has been a virtue.</P>

 night unto Berea: who coming <I>thither</I> went into the synagogue of
 the Jews.
 &nbsp; 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
 they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched
 the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women
 which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
 &nbsp; 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the
 word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither
 also, and stirred up the people.

 receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They had proceeded so far at Thessalonica that the foundations of a 
 church were laid, and others were raised up to carry on the work that 
 was begun, against whom the rulers and people were not so much 
 prejudiced as they were against Paul and Silas; and therefore when the 
 storm rose they withdrew, taking this as an indication to them that 
 they must quit that place for the present. That command of Christ to 
 his disciples, <I>When they persecute you in one city flee to 
 another,</I> intends their flight to be not so much for their own 
 safety ("flee to another, to hide there") as for the carrying on of
 their work ("flee to another, to preach there"), as appears by the
 reason given--<I>You shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till
 the Son of man come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23">Matt. x. 23</A>.

 Thus out of the eater came forth meat, and the devil was outshot in his
 own bow; he thought by persecuting the apostles to stop the progress of 
 the gospel, but it was so overruled as to be made to further it. See 
 here,

 1. The care that the brethren took of Paul and Silas, when they
 perceived how the plot was laid against them: They <I>immediately sent 
 them away by night,</I> incognito, <I>to Berea.</I> This could be no 
 surprise to the young converts; <I>For when we were with you</I> (saith 
 Paul to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:4">1 Thess. iii. 4</A>),

 when we came first among you, <I>we told you that we should suffer
 tribulation, even as it came to pass, and you know.</I> It should seem 
 that Paul and Silas would willingly have staid, and faced the storm, if 
 the brethren would have let them; but they would rather be deprived of 
 the apostles' help than expose their lives, which, it should seem, were 
 dearer to their friends than to themselves. They <I>sent them away by 
 night,</I> under the covert of that, as if they had been evil doers. 

 2. The constancy of Paul and Silas in their work. Though they fled
 from Thessalonica, they did not flee from the service of Christ. When 
 <I>they came to Berea, they went into the synagogue of the Jews,</I> 
 and made their public appearance there. Though the Jews at Thessalonica 
 had been their spiteful enemies, and, for aught they knew, the Jews at 
 Berea would be so too, yet they did not therefore decline paying their 
 respect to the Jews, either in revenge for the injuries they had 
 received or for fear of what they might receive. If others will not do 
 their duty to us, yet we ought to do ours to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good character of the Jews in Berea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica.</I> The Jews in 
 the synagogue at Berea were better disposed to receive the gospel than 
 the Jews in the synagogue at Thessalonica; they were not so bigoted and 
 prejudiced against it, not so peevish and ill-natured; they <I>were 
 more noble,</I> <B><I>eugenesteroi</I></B>--<I>better bred.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They had a freer thought, and lay more open to conviction, were 
 willing to hear reason, and admit the force of it, and to subscribe to 
 that which appeared to them to be truth, though it was contrary to 
 their former sentiments. This was more noble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had a better temper, were not so sour, and morose, and 
 ill-conditioned towards all that were not of their mind, As they were 
 ready to come into a unity with those that by the power of truth they 
 were brought to concur with, so they continued in charity with those 
 that they saw cause to differ from. This was more noble. They neither 
 prejudged the cause, nor were moved with envy at the managers of it, as 
 the Jews at Thessalonica were, but very generously gave both it and 
 them a fair hearing, without passion or partiality; for, 

 (1.) <I>They received the word with all readiness of mind;</I> they 
 were very willing to hear it, presently apprehended the meaning of it, 
 and did not shut their eyes against the light. <I>They attended to the 
 things that were spoken by Paul,</I> as Lydia did, and were very well 
 pleased to hear them. They did not pick quarrels with the word, nor 
 find fault, nor seek occasion against the preachers of it; but bade it 
 welcome, and put a candid construction upon every thing that was said. 
 Herein <I>they were more noble than the Jews in Thessalonica,</I> but 
 walked in the same spirit, and in the same steps, with the Gentiles 
 there, of whom it is said <I>that they received the word with joy of 
 the Holy Ghost,</I> and <I>turned to God from idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:6-9">1 Thess. i. 6-9</A>.
 
 This was true nobility. The Jews gloried much in their being Abraham's
 seed, thought themselves well-born and that they could not be better 
 born. But they are here told who among them were the most noble and
 the best-bred men--those that were most disposed to receive the gospel,
 and had the high and conceited thoughts in them subdued, and <I>brought 
 into obedience to Christ.</I> They were the most noble, and, if I may 
 so say, the most gentleman-like men. <I>Nobilitas sola est atque unica 
 virtus--Virtue and piety are true nobility,</I> true honour; and,
 without these, <I>Stemmata quid prosunt?--What are pedigrees and
 pompous titles worth?</I> 

 (2.) <I>They searched the scriptures daily whether those things were 
 so.</I> Their readiness of mind to receive the word was not such as 
 that they took things upon trust, swallowed them upon an implicit 
 faith: no; but since Paul reasoned out of the scriptures, and referred 
 them to the Old Testament for the proof of what he said, they had 
 recourse to their Bibles, turned to the places to which he referred 
 them, read the context, considered the scope and drift of them, 
 compared them with other places of scripture, examined whether Paul's 
 inferences from them were natural and genuine and his arguments upon 
 them cogent, and determined accordingly. Observe, 

 [1.] The doctrine of Christ does not fear a scrutiny. We that are 
 advocates for his cause desire no more than that people will not say, 
 <I>These things are not so,</I> till they have first, without prejudice 
 and partiality, examined whether they be so or no. 

 [2.] The New Testament is to be examined by the Old. The Jews received 
 the Old Testament, and those that did so, if they considered things 
 aright, could not but see cause sufficient to receive the New, because 
 in it they see all the prophecies and promises of the Old fully and 
 exactly accomplished. 

 [3.] Those that read and receive the scriptures must <I>search them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=joh+5:39">John v. 39</A>),

 must study them, and take pains in considering them, both that they may 
 find out the truth contained in them, and may not mistake the sense of 
 them and so run into error, or remain in it; and that they may find out 
 the whole truth contained in them, and may not rest in a superficial 
 knowledge, in the outward court of the scriptures, but may have an 
 intimate acquaintance with the mind of God revealed in them.

 [4.] Searching the scriptures must be our daily work. Those that heard 
 <I>the word in the synagogue on the sabbath day</I> did not think this 
 enough, but were searching it every day in the week, that they might 
 improve what they had heard the sabbath before, and prepare for what
 they were to hear the sabbath after. 

 [5.] Those are truly noble, and are in a fair way to be more and more 
 so, that make the scriptures their oracle and touchstone, and consult 
 them accordingly. Those that rightly study the scriptures, and 
 <I>meditate therein day and night,</I> have their minds filled with 
 noble thoughts, fixed to noble principles, and formed for noble aims 
 and designs. <I>These are more noble.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good effect of the preaching of the gospel at Berea: it had 
 the desired success; the people's hearts being prepared, a great deal 
 of work was done suddenly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. Of the Jews there were many that believed. At Thessalonica there 
 were only <I>some of them that believed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but at Berea, where they heard with unprejudiced minds, many believed, 
 many more Jews than at Thessalonica. Note, God gives grace to those 
 whom he first inclines to make a diligent use of the means of grace, 
 and particularly to search the scriptures. 

 2. Of the Greeks likewise, the Gentiles, many believed, both of <I>the
 honourable women,</I> the ladies of quality, <I>and of men not a 
 few,</I> men of the first rank, as should seem by their being mentioned 
 with the honourable women. The wives first embraced the gospel, and 
 then they persuaded their husbands to embrace it. <I>For what knowest 
 thou, O wife, but thou shalt save thy husband?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:16">1 Cor. vii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The persecution that was raised against Paul and Silas at Berea, 
 which forced Paul thence. 

 1. <I>The Jews at Thessalonica</I> were the mischief-makers at 
 <I>Berea.</I> They <I>had notice that the word of God was preached at 
 Berea</I> (for envy and jealousy bring quick intelligence), and 
 likewise that the Jews there were not so inveterately set against it as 
 they were. They came thither also, to turn the world upside down there, 
 <I>and they stirred up the people,</I> and incensed them against the 
 preachers of the gospel; as if they had such a commission from the 
 prince of darkness to go from place to place to oppose the gospel as 
 the apostles had to go from place to place to preach it. Thus we read 
 before that the Jews of Antioch and Iconium came to Lystra on purpose 
 to incense the people against the apostles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 19</A>.

 See how restless Satan's agents are in their opposition to the gospel
 of Christ and the salvation of the souls of men. This is an instance of 
 the enmity that is in the serpent's seed against the seed of the woman; 
 and we must not think it strange if persecutors at home extend their 
 rage to stir up persecution abroad. 

 2. This occasioned Paul's removal to Athens. By seeking to extinguish
 this divine fire which Christ had already kindled, they did but spread 
 it the further and the faster; so long Paul staid at Berea, and such 
 success he had there, that there were brethren there, and sensible 
 active men too, which appeared by the care they took of Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They were aware of the coming of the persecuting Jews from 
 Thessalonica, and that they were busy in irritating the people against 
 Paul; and, fearing what it would come to, they lost no time, but 
 <I>immediately sent Paul away,</I> against whom they were most 
 prejudiced and enraged, hoping that this would pacify them, while they 
 retained Silas and Timothy there still, who, now that Paul had broken 
 the ice, might be sufficient to carry on the work without exposing him.
 They <I>sent Paul to go even to the sea,</I> so some; <I>to go as it 
 were to the sea,</I> so we read it; <B><I>hos epi ten 
 thalassan.</I></B> He went out from Berea, in that road which went to 
 the sea, that the Jews, if they enquired after him, might think he had 
 gone to a great distance; but he went by land to Athens, in which there 
 was no culpable dissimulation at all. <I>Those that conducted Paul</I> 
 (as his guides and guards, he being both a stranger in the country and 
 one that had many enemies) <I>brought him to Athens.</I> The Spirit of 
 God, influencing his spirit, directed him to that famous city,--famous
 of old for its power and dominion, when the Athenian commonwealth coped 
 with the Spartan,--famous afterwards for learning; it was the
 rendezvous of scholars. Those who wanted learning went thither to show 
 it. It was a great university, much resorted to from all parts, and 
 therefore, for the better diffusing of gospel light, Paul is sent 
 thither, and is not ashamed nor afraid to show his face among the 
 philosophers there, and there to preach Christ crucified, though he 
 knew it would be as much foolishness to the Greeks as it was to the 
 Jews a stumbling-block. 

 3. He ordered <I>Silas and Timothy to come to him to Athens,</I> when
 he found there was a prospect of doing good there; or because, there 
 being none there that he knew, he was solitary and melancholy without 
 them. Yet it should seem that, great as was the haste he was in for
 them, he ordered Timothy to go about Thessalonica, to bring him an 
 account of the affairs of that church; for he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1,2">1 Thess. iii. 1, 2</A>),

 <I>We thought it good to be left at Athens alone, and sent Timotheus to 
 establish you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
 stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
 &nbsp; 17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and
 with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that
 met with him.
 &nbsp; 18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
 Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler
 say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods:
 because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
 &nbsp; 19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying,
 May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, <I>is?</I>
 &nbsp; 20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we
 would know therefore what these things mean.
 &nbsp; 21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
 their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some
 new thing.)
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A scholar that has acquaintance, and is in love, with the learning of 
 the ancients, would think he should be very happy if he were where Paul 
 now was, at Athens, in the midst of the various sects of philosophers, 
 and would have a great many curious questions to ask them, for the 
 explication of the remains we have of the Athenian learning; but Paul, 
 though bred a scholar, and an ingenious active man, does not make this 
 any of his business at Athens. He has other work to mind: it is not the 
 improving of himself in their philosophy that he aims at, he has 
 learned to call it a vain thing, and is above it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8">Col. ii. 8</A>);

 his business is, in God's name, to correct their disorders in religion, 
 and <I>to turn them from the service of idols,</I> and of Satan in 
 them, to the <I>service of the true and living God</I> in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the impression which the abominable ignorance and 
 superstition of the Athenians made upon Paul's spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 1. The account here given of that city: it was <I>wholly given to 
 idolatry.</I> This agrees with the account which the heathen writers 
 give of it, that there were more idols in Athens than there were in all 
 Greece besides put together, and that they had twice as many sacred 
 feasts as others had. Whatever strange gods were recommended to them, 
 they admitted them, and allowed them a temple and an altar, <I>so that 
 they had almost as many gods as men--facilius possis deum quam hominem
 invenire.</I> And this city, after the empire became Christian, 
 continued incurably addicted to idolatry, and all the pious edicts of 
 the Christian emperors could not root it out, till, by the irruption of 
 the Goths, that city was in so particular a manner laid waste that 
 there are now scarcely any remains of it. It is observable that there, 
 where human learning most flourished, idolatry most abounded, and the 
 most absurd and ridiculous idolatry, which confirms that of the 
 apostle, that when <I>they professed themselves to be wise they became 
 fools</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:22">Rom. i. 22</A>),

 and, in the business of religion, were of all other the most <I>vain in 
 their imaginations. The world by wisdom knew not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21">1 Cor. i. 21</A>.
 
 They might have reasoned against polytheism and idolatry; but, it 
 seems, the greatest pretenders to reason were the greatest slaves to 
 idols: so necessary was it to the re-establishing even of natural 
 religion that there should be a divine revelation, and that centering 
 in Christ. 

 2. The disturbance which the sight of this gave to Paul. Paul was not
 willing to appear publicly till Silas and Timothy came to him, that out 
 of the mouth of two or three witnesses the word might be established; 
 but in the mean time <I>his spirit was stirred within him.</I> He was 
 filled with concern for the glory of God, which he saw given to idols, 
 and with compassion to the souls of men, which he saw thus enslaved to 
 Satan, <I>and led captive by him at his will.</I> He beheld these 
 transgressors, and was grieved; and horror took hold of him. He had a 
 holy indignation at the heathen priests, that led the people such an 
 endless trace of idolatry, and at their philosophers, that knew better, 
 and yet never said a word against it, but themselves went down the 
 stream.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The testimony that he bore against their idolatry, and his 
 endeavours to bring them to the knowledge of the truth. He did not, as 
 Witsius observes, in the heat of his zeal break into the temples, pull 
 down their images, demolish their altars, or fly in the face of their 
 priests; nor did he run about the streets crying, "You are all the 
 bond-slaves of the devil," though it was too true; but he observed
 decorum, and kept himself within due bounds, doing that only which 
 became a prudent man. 

 1. He <I>went to the synagogue of the Jews,</I> who, though enemies to
 Christianity, were free from idolatry, and joined with them in that 
 among them which was good, and took the opportunity given him there of 
 disputing for Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He discoursed <I>with the Jews,</I> reasoned fairly with them, and put 
 it to them what reason they could give why, since they expected the 
 Messiah, they would not receive Jesus. There he met with the devout 
 persons that had forsaken the idol temples, but rested in the Jews' 
 synagogue, and he talked with these to lead them on to the Christian 
 church, to which the Jews' synagogue was but as a porch.

 2. He entered into conversation with all that came in his way about
 matters of religion: <I>In the market</I>--<B><I>en te agora,</I></B>
 in the exchange, or place of commerce, <I>he disputed daily,</I> as he 
 had occasion, <I>with those that met with him,</I> or that he happened 
 to fall into company with, that were heathen, and never came to the 
 Jews' synagogue. The zealous advocates for the cause of Christ will be 
 ready to plead it in all companies, as occasion offers. The ministers 
 of Christ must not think it enough to speak a good word for Christ once 
 a week, but should be daily speaking honourably of him to such as meet 
 with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The enquiries which some of the philosophers made concerning 
 Paul's doctrine. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they were that encountered him, that entered into discourse with 
 him, and opposed him: <I>He disputed with all that met him, in the 
 places of concourse,</I> or rather of discourse. Most took no notice of 
 him, slighted him, and never minded a word he said; but there were some 
 of the philosophers that thought him worth making remarks upon, an they 
 were those whose principles were most directly contrary to 
 Christianity. 

 (1.) <I>The Epicureans,</I> who <I>thought God altogether such a one as 
 themselves,</I> an idle inactive being, that minded nothing, nor put 
 any difference between good and evil. They would not own, either that 
 God made the world or that he governs it; nor that man needs to make 
 any conscience of what he says or does, having no punishment to fear 
 nor rewards to hope for, all which loose atheistical notions 
 Christianity is levelled against. The Epicureans indulged themselves in 
 all the pleasures of sense, and placed their happiness in them, in what 
 Christ has taught us in the first place to deny ourselves. 

 (2.) <I>The Stoics,</I> who thought themselves altogether as good as 
 God, and indulged themselves as much in the pride of life as the 
 Epicureans did in the lusts of the flesh and of the eye; they made 
 their virtuous man to be no way inferior to God himself, nay to be 
 superior. <I>Esse aliquid quo sapiens antecedat Deum--There is that in
 which a wise man excels God,</I> so Seneca: to which Christianity is 
 directly opposite, as it teaches us to deny ourselves and abase 
 ourselves, and to come off from all confidence in ourselves, that 
 Christ may be all in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What their different sentiments were of him; such there were as 
 there were of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 (1.) <I>Some called him a babbler,</I> and thought he spoke, without 
 any design, whatever came uppermost, as men of crazed imaginations do: 
 <I>What will this babbler say?</I> <B><I>ho spermologos 
 houtos</I></B>--<I>this scatterer of words,</I> that goes about,
 throwing here one idle word or story and there another, without any 
 intendment or signification; or, <I>this picker up of seeds.</I> Some 
 of the critics tell us that the term is used for <I>a little sort of 
 bird,</I> that is worth nothing at all, either for the spit or for the 
 cage, <I>that picks up the seeds that lie uncovered, either in the 
 field or by the way-side, and hops here and there for that 
 purpose--Avicula parva qu&aelig; semina in triviis dispersa colligere
 solet;</I> such a pitiful contemptible animal they took Paul to be, or 
 supposed he went from place to place venting his notions to get money, 
 a penny here and another there, as that bird picks up here and there a 
 grain. They looked upon him as an idle fellow, and regarded him, as we 
 say, no more than a ballad-singer. 

 (2.) <I>Others</I> called him <I>a setter forth of strange gods,</I> 
 and thought he spoke with design to make himself considerable by that 
 means. And, if he had strange gods to set forth, he could not bring 
 them to a better market than to Athens. He did not, as many did,
 directly set forth new gods, nor avowedly; but they thought he seemed 
 to do so, <I>because he preached unto then Jesus, and the 
 resurrection.</I> From his first coming among them he ever and anon 
 harped upon these two strings, which are indeed the principal doctrines 
 of Christianity--Christ and a future state--Christ our way, and heaven
 our end; and, though he did not call these gods, yet they thought he 
 meant to make them so. <B><I>Ton Iesoun kai ten anastasin,</I></B>
 "Jesus they took for a new god, and <I>anastasis,</I> the resurrection, 
 for a new goddess." Thus they lost the benefit of the Christian 
 doctrine by dressing it up in a pagan dialect, as if believing in 
 Jesus, and looking for the resurrection, were the worshipping of new 
 demons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The proposal they made to give him a free, full, fair, and public 
 hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 They had heard some broken pieces of his doctrine, and are willing to 
 have a more perfect knowledge of it.

 (1.) They look upon it as strange and surprising, and very different 
 from the philosophy that had for many ages been taught and professed at 
 Athens. "It is a new doctrine, which we do not understand the drift
 and design of. <I>Thou bringest certain strange things to our ears,</I> 
 which we never heard of before, and know not what to make of now." By 
 this it should seem that, among all the learned books they had, they 
 either had not, or heeded not, the books of Moses and the prophets, 
 else the doctrine of Christ would not have been so perfectly new and 
 strange to them. There was but one book in the world that was of divine 
 inspiration, and that was the only book they were strangers to, which, 
 if they would have given a due regard to it, would, in its very first 
 page, have determined that great controversy among them about the 
 origin of the universe. 

 (2.) They desired to know more of it, only because it was new and 
 strange: "<I>May we know what this new doctrine is?</I> Or, is it (like 
 the mysteries of the gods) to be kept as a profound secret? If it may 
 be, we would gladly know, and desire thee to tell us, <I>what these 
 things mean,</I> that we may be able to pass a judgment upon them." 
 This was a fair proposal; it was fit they should know what this 
 doctrine was before they embraced it; and they were so fair as not to 
 condemn it till they had had some account of it. 

 (3.) The place they brought him to, in order to this public declaration 
 of his doctrine; it was <I>to Areopagus,</I> the same word that is 
 translated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 <I>Mars' Hill;</I> it was the town-house, or guildhall of their city, 
 where the magistrates met upon public business, and the courts of 
 justice were kept; and it was as the theatre in the university, or the 
 schools, where learned men met to communicate their notions. The court 
 of justice which sat here was famous for its equity, which drew appeals 
 to it from all parts; if any denied a God, he was liable to the censure 
 of this court. Diagoras was by them put to death, as a contemner of the 
 gods; nor might any new God be admitted without their approbation.
 Hither they brought Paul to be tried, not as a criminal but as a 
 candidate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The general character of the people of that city given upon this 
 occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>All the Athenians,</I> that is natives of the place, and strangers 
 who sojourned there for their improvement, <I>spent their time in 
 nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing,</I> which 
 comes in as the reason why they were inquisitive concerning Paul's 
 doctrine, not because it was <I>good,</I> but because it was 
 <I>new.</I> It is a very sorry character which is here given of these 
 people, yet many transcribe it. 

 (1.) They were all for conversation. St. Paul exhorts his pupil to
 <I>give attendance to reading and meditation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:13,15">1 Tim. iv. 13, 15</A>),

 but these people despised those old-fashioned ways of getting 
 knowledge, and preferred that of telling and hearing. It is true that 
 good company is of great use to a man, and will polish one that has 
 laid a good foundation in study; but that knowledge will be very flashy 
 and superficial which is got by conversation only. 

 (2.) They affected novelty; they were for <I>telling and hearing some 
 new thing.</I> They were for new schemes and new notions in philosophy, 
 new forms and plans of government in politics, and, in religion, for 
 new gods that came newly up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>),

 new demons, new-fashioned images and altars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:10">2 Kings xvi. 10</A>);

 they were given to change. Demosthenes, an orator of their own, had
 charged this upon them long before, in one of his Philippics, that 
 their common question in the markets, or wherever they met, was 
 <B><I>ei ti le etai neoteron</I></B>--<I>whether there was any
 news.</I> 

 (3.) They meddled in other people's business, and were inquisitive 
 concerning that, and never minded their own. Tattlers are always 
 <I>busy bodies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13">1 Tim. v. 13</A>.

 (4.) <I>They spent their time in nothing else,</I> and a very 
 uncomfortable account those must needs have to make of their time who 
 thus spend it. Time is precious, and we are concerned to be good 
 husbands of it, because eternity depends upon it, and it is hastening 
 apace into eternity, but abundance of it is wasted in unprofitable 
 converse. To tell or hear the new occurrences of providence concerning 
 the public in our own or other nations, and concerning our neighbours 
 and friends, is of good use now and then; but to set up for 
 newsmongers, and to spend our time in nothing else, is to lose that 
 which is very precious for the gain of that which is worth little.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, <I>Ye</I>
 men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
 superstitious.
 &nbsp; 23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an
 altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore
 ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
 &nbsp; 24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that
 he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
 hands;
 &nbsp; 25 Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed
 any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
 things;
 &nbsp; 26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
 on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
 before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
 &nbsp; 27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
 after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of
 us:
 &nbsp; 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
 also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
 &nbsp; 29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
 to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
 graven by art and man's device.
 &nbsp; 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
 commandeth all men every where to repent:
 &nbsp; 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
 the world in righteousness by <I>that</I> man whom he hath ordained;
 <I>whereof</I> he hath given assurance unto all <I>men,</I> in that he hath
 raised him from the dead.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here St. Paul's sermon at Athens. Divers sermons we have had, 
 which the apostles preached to the Jews, or such Gentiles as had an 
 acquaintance with and veneration for the Old Testament, and were 
 worshippers of the true and living God; and all they had to do with 
 them was to open and allege <I>that Jesus is the Christ;</I> but here 
 we have a sermon to heathens, that worshipped false gods, and were 
 without the true God in the world, and to them the scope of their 
 discourse was quite different from what it was to the other. In the 
 former case their business was to lead their hearers by prophecies and 
 miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the 
 latter it was to lead them by the common works of providence to the 
 knowledge of the Creator, and the worship of him. One discourse of this 
 kind we had before to the rude idolaters of Lystra that deified the 
 apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>);

 this recorded here is to the more polite and refined idolaters at
 Athens, and an admirable discourse it is, and every way suited to his 
 auditory and the design he had upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down this, as the scope of his discourse, that he aimed to 
 bring them to <I>the knowledge of the only living and true God,</I> as 
 the sole and proper object of their adoration. He is here obliged to 
 lay the foundation, and to instruct them in the first principle of all 
 religion, that there is a God, and that God is but one. When he 
 preached against the gods they worshipped, he had no design to draw 
 them to atheism, but to the service of the true Deity. Socrates, who 
 had exposed the pagan idolatry, was indicted in this very court, and 
 condemned, not only because he did not esteem those to be gods whom the 
 city esteemed to be so, but because he introduced new demons; and this 
 was the charge against Paul. Now he tacitly owns the former part of the 
 charge, but guards against the latter, by declaring that he does not 
 introduce any new gods, but reduce them <I>to the knowledge of one God, 
 the Ancient of days.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows them that they needed to be instructed herein; for they had 
 lost the knowledge of the true God that made them, in the worship of 
 false gods that they had made (<I>Deos qui rogat ille facit--He who
 worships the gods makes them): I perceive that in all things you are 
 too superstitious.</I> The crime he charges upon them is giving that 
 glory to others which is due to God only, that they feared and 
 worshipped demons, spirits that they supposed inhabited the images to 
 which they directed their worship. "It is time for you to be told that 
 <I>there is but one God</I> who are multiplying deities above any of 
 your neighbours, and mingle your idolatries with all your affairs. 
 <I>You are in all things too 
 superstitious</I>--<B><I>deisidaimonesteroi,</I></B> you easily admit
 every thing that comes under a show of religion, but it is that which 
 corrupts it more and more; I bring you that which will reform it." 
 Their neighbours praised them for this as a pious people, but Paul 
 condemns them for it. Yet it is observable how he mollifies the charge, 
 does not aggravate it, to provoke them. He uses a word which among them 
 was taken in a good sense: <I>You are every way more than ordinarily 
 religious,</I> so some read it; <I>you are very devout in your way.</I> 
 Or, if it be taken in a bad sense, it is mitigated: "You are as it were 
 (<B><I>hos</I></B>) more superstitious than you need be;" and he says 
 no more than what he himself perceived; <B><I>theoro</I></B>--<I>I see
 it, I observe it.</I> They charged Paul with setting forth new demons: 
 "Nay," says he, "you have demons enough already; I will not add to the 
 number of them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shows them that they themselves had given a fair occasion for the 
 declaring of this one true God to them, by <I>setting up an altar,</I> 
 To <I>the unknown God,</I> which intimated an acknowledgment that there 
 was a God who was yet to them <I>an unknown God;</I> and it is sad to 
 think that at Athens, a place which was supposed to have the monopoly 
 of wisdom, the true God was an unknown God, the only God that was 
 unknown. "Now you ought to bed Paul welcome, for this is the God whom 
 he comes to make known to you, the God whom you tacitly complain that 
 you are ignorant of." There, where we are sensible we are defective and 
 come short, just there, the gospel takes us up, and carries us on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Various conjectures the learned have concerning this <I>altar 
 dedicated to the unknown God.</I> 

 [1.] Some think the meaning is, <I>To the God whose honour it is to be 
 unknown,</I> and that they intended the God of the Jews, whose name is 
 ineffable, and whose nature is unsearchable. It is probable they had 
 heard from the Jews, and from the writings of the Old Testament, of the 
 God of Israel, who had proved himself to be above all gods, but was
 <I>a God hiding himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>.

 The heathen called the Jews' God, <I>Deus incertus, incertum Mosis 
 Numen--an uncertain God, the uncertain Deity of Moses,</I> and the God
 without name. Now <I>this God,</I> says Paul, <I>this God, who cannot 
 by searching be found out to perfection, I now declare unto you.</I>

 [2.] Others think the meaning is, <I>To the God whom it is our
 unhappiness not to know,</I> which intimates that they would think it 
 their happiness to know him. Some tell us that upon occasion of a
 plague that raged at Athens, when they had sacrificed to all their gods 
 one after another for the staying of the plague, they were advised to 
 let some sheep go where they pleased, and, where they lay down, to 
 build an altar, <B><I>to prosekonti Theo</I></B>--<I>to the proper God,
 or the God to whom that affair of staying the pestilence did 
 belong;</I> and, because they knew not how to call him, they inscribed 
 it, <I>To the unknown God.</I> Others, from some of the best historians 
 of Athens, tell us they had many altars inscribed, <I>To the gods of 
 Asia, Europe, and Africa--To the unknown God:</I> and some of the
 neighbouring countries used to swear <I>by the God that was unknown at 
 Athens;</I> so Lucian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Observe, how modestly Paul mentions this. That he might not be 
 thought a spy, nor one that had intruded himself more than became a 
 stranger into the knowledge of their mysteries, he tells them that he 
 observed it <I>as he passed by, and saw their devotions,</I> or 
 <I>their sacred things.</I> It was public, and he could not forbear 
 seeing it, and it was proper enough to make his remarks upon the 
 religion of the place; and observe how prudently and ingeniously he 
 takes occasion from this to bring in his discourse of the true God. 
 
 [1.] He tells them that the God he preached to them was one that they 
 did already worship, and therefore he was not a setter forth of new or 
 strange gods: "As you have a dependence upon him, so he has had some 
 kind of homage from you." 

 [2.] He was one whom they ignorantly worshipped, which was a reproach 
 to them, who were famous all the world over for their knowledge. "Now," 
 says he, "I come to take away <I>that reproach,</I> that you may 
 worship him understandingly whom how you worship ignorantly; and it 
 cannot but be acceptable to have your blind devotion turned into a 
 reasonable service, that you may not worship <I>you know not 
 what.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He confirms his doctrine of one living and true God, by his works 
 of creation and providence: "The God whom I declare unto you to be the 
 sole object of your devotion, and call you to the worship of, is <I>the 
 God that made the world</I> and governs it; and, by the visible proofs 
 of these, you may be led to this invisible Being, and be convinced of 
 his <I>eternal power and Godhead.</I>" The Gentiles in general, and the 
 Athenians particularly, in their devotions were governed, not by their 
 philosophers, many of whom spoke clearly and excellently well of one 
 supreme <I>Numen,</I> of his infinite perfections and universal agency 
 and dominion (witness the writings of Plato, and long after of Cicero); 
 but by their poets, and their idle fictions. Homer's works were the
 Bible of the pagan theology, or demonology rather, not Plato's; and the 
 philosophers tamely submitted to this, rested in their speculations, 
 disputed them among themselves, and taught them to their scholars, but 
 never made the use they ought to have made of them in opposition to 
 idolatry; so little certainty were they at concerning them, and so 
 little impression did these things make upon them! Nay, they ran 
 themselves into the superstition of their country, and thought they 
 ought to do so. <I>Eamus ad communem errorem--Let us embrace the common
 error.</I> Now Paul here sets himself, in the first place, to reform 
 the philosophy of the Athenians (he corrects the mistakes of that), and 
 to give them right notions of <I>the one only living and true God,</I> 
 and then to carry the matter further than they ever attempted for the 
 reforming of their worship, and the bringing them off from their 
 polytheism and idolatry. Observe what glorious things Paul here says of 
 that God whom he served, and would have them to serve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He is the God that made the world, and all things therein; the 
 Father almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth.</I> This was admitted 
 by many of the philosophers; but those of Aristotle's school denied it, 
 and maintained "that the world was from eternity, and every thing 
 always was from eternity, and every thing always was what now it is." 
 Those of the school of Epicurus fancied "that the world was made by a 
 fortuitous concourse of atoms, which, having been in perpetual motion, 
 at length accidently jumped into this frame." Against both these Paul 
 here maintains that God by the operations of an infinite power, 
 according to the contrivance of an infinite wisdom, in the beginning of 
 time made the world and all things therein, the origin of which was 
 owing, not as they fancied to an eternal matter, but to an eternal 
 mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is therefore <I>Lord of heaven and earth,</I> that is, he is the 
 rightful owner, proprietor, and possessor, of all the beings, powers, 
 and riches of the upper and lower world, material and immaterial, 
 visible and invisible. This follows from his making heaven and earth. 
 If he created all, without doubt he has the disposing of all: and, 
 where he gives being, he has an indisputable right to give law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is, in a particular manner, the Creator of men, of all men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He made of one blood all nations of men.</I> He made the first man, 
 he makes every man, is the former of every man's body and the Father of 
 every man's spirit. He has made the nations of men, not only all men in 
 the nations, but as nations in their political capacity; he is their 
 founder, and disposed them into communities for their mutual 
 preservation and benefit. He made them all of one blood, of one and the 
 same nature; <I>he fashions their heart alike.</I> Descended from one 
 and the same common ancestor, in Adam they are all akin, so they are in 
 Noah, that hereby they might be engaged in mutual affection and 
 assistance, as fellow-creatures and brethren. <I>Have we not all one 
 Father? Hath not one God created us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10">Mal. ii. 10</A>.

 <I>He hath made them to dwell on all the face of the earth,</I> which,
 as a bountiful benefactor, <I>he has given,</I> with all its fulness, 
 <I>to the children of men.</I> He made them not to live in one place, 
 but to be dispersed over all the earth; one nation therefore ought not 
 to look with contempt upon another, as the Greeks did upon all other 
 nations; for those on all the face of the earth are of the same blood. 
 The Athenians boasted that they sprung out of their own earth, were 
 <I>aborigines,</I> and nothing akin by blood to any other nation, which 
 proud conceit of themselves the apostle here takes down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he is the great benefactor of the whole creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.</I> He not only 
 <I>breathed into the first man the breath of life,</I> but still 
 breathes it into every man. He gave us these souls he formed the spirit 
 of man within him. He not only gave us our life and breath, when he 
 brought us into being, but he is continually giving them to us; his 
 providence is a continued creation; he <I>holds our souls in life;</I> 
 every moment our breath goes forth, but he graciously gives it us again 
 the next moment; it is no only <I>his air that we breathe in, but it is 
 in his hand that our breath is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:23">Dan. v. 23</A>.

 He <I>gives to all the children of men their life and breath;</I> for 
 as the meanest of the children of men live upon him, and receive from 
 him, so the greatest, the wisest philosophers and mightiest potentates, 
 cannot live without him. <I>He gives to all,</I> not only to all the 
 children of men, but to the inferior creatures, to all animals, 
 <I>every thing wherein is the breath of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:17">Gen. vi. 17</A>);

 they have their life and breath from him, and where he gives life and
 breath he gives all things, all other things needful for the support of 
 life. <I>The earth is full of his goodness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:24,27">Ps. civ. 24, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That he is the sovereign disposer of all the affairs of the children 
 of men, according to the counsel of his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of 
 their habitation.</I> See here, 

 (1.) The sovereignty of God's disposal concerning us: he <I>hath 
 determined</I> every event, <B><I>horisas,</I></B> the matter is fixed; 
 the disposals of Providence are incontestable and must not be disputed, 
 unchangeable and cannot be altered. 

 (2.) The wisdom of his disposals; he hath <I>determined</I> what was 
 <I>before appointed.</I> The determinations of the Eternal Mind are not 
 sudden resolves, but the counterparts of an eternal counsel, the copies 
 of divine decrees. <I>He performeth the thing that is appointed for 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:14">Job xxiii. 14</A>.

 <I>Whatever comes forth from God was before all worlds hid in God.</I>

 (3.) The things about which his providence is conversant; these are
 time and place: the times and places of our living in this world are 
 determined and appointed by the God that made us. 

 [1.] <I>He has determined the times</I> that are concerning us. Times
 to us seem changeable, but God has fixed them. <I>Our times are in his
 hand,</I> to lengthen or shorten, embitter or sweeten, as he pleases. 
 He has appointed and determined the time of our coming into the world, 
 and the time of our continuance in the world; our time to be born, and 
 our time to die

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:1,2">Eccl. iii. 1, 2</A>),

 and all that little that lies between them--the time of all our
 concernments in this world. Whether they be prosperous times or 
 calamitous times, it is he that has determined them; and on him we must 
 depend, with reference to the times that are yet before us.

 [2.] He has also <I>determined and appointed the bounds of our 
 habitation.</I> He that <I>appointed the earth to be a habitation for 
 the children of men</I> has appointed to the children of men a 
 distinction of habitations upon the earth, has instituted such a thing 
 as property, to which he has set bounds to keep us from trespassing one 
 upon another. The particular habitations in which our lot is cast, the
 place of our nativity and of our settlement, are of God's determining 
 and appointing, which is a reason why we should accommodate ourselves 
 to the habitations we are in, and make the best of that which is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That <I>he is not far from every one of us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He is every where present, not only is <I>at our right hand, but has 
 possessed our reins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:13">Ps. cxxxix. 13</A>),

 has his eye upon us at all times, and knows us better than we know 
 ourselves. Idolaters made images of God, that they might have him with
 them in those images, the absurdity of which the apostle here shows; 
 for he in an infinite Spirit, <I>that is not far from any of us,</I> 
 and never the nearer, but in one sense the further off from us, for our 
 pretending to realize or presentiate him to ourselves by any image. He 
 is nigh unto us, both to receive the homage we render him and to give 
 the mercies we ask of him, wherever we are, though near no altar, 
 image, or temple. The Lord of all, as <I>he is rich</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:12">Rom. x. 12</A>),
 
 so <I>he is nigh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>),

 <I>to all that call upon him.</I> He that wills us to <I>pray every 
 where,</I> assures us that he is no where far from us; whatever 
 country, nation, or profession we are of, whatever our rank and 
 condition in the world are, be we in a palace or in a cottage, in a 
 crowd or in a corner, in a city or in a desert, in the depths of the 
 sea or afar off upon the sea, this is certain, <I>God is not far from 
 every one of us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That <I>in him we live, and move, and have our being,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We have a necessary and constant dependence upon his providence, as the 
 streams have upon the spring, and the beams upon the sun.

 (1.) <I>In him we live;</I> that is, the continuance of our lives is 
 owing to him and the constant influence of his providence; <I>he is our 
 life, and the length of our days.</I> It is not only owing to his 
 patience and pity that our forfeited lives are not cut off, but it is 
 owing to his power, and goodness, and fatherly care, that our frail 
 lives are prolonged. There needs not a positive act of his wrath to 
 destroy us; if he suspend the positive acts of his goodness, we die of 
 ourselves.

 (2.) <I>In him we move;</I> it is by the uninterrupted concourse of his 
 providence that our souls move in their outgoings and operations, that 
 our thoughts run to and fro about a thousand subjects, and our 
 affections run out towards their proper objects. It is likewise by him 
 that our souls move our bodies; we cannot stir a hand, or foot, or a 
 tongue, but by him, who, as he is the first cause, so he is the first 
 mover. 

 (3.) <I>In him we have our being;</I> not only from him we had it at 
 first, but in him we have it still; to his continued care and goodness 
 we owe it, not only that we have a being and are not sunk into 
 nonentity, but that we have our being, have this being, were and still 
 are of such a noble rank of beings, capable of knowing and enjoying 
 God; and are not thrust into the meanness of brutes, nor the misery of 
 devils.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. That upon the whole matter we are <I>God's offspring;</I> he is 
 <I>our Father that begat us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6,18">Deut. xxxii. 6, 18</A>),

 and he hath <I>nourished and brought us up as children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2">Isa. i. 2</A>.
 
 The confession of an adversary in such a case is always looked upon to 
 be of use as <I>argumentum ad hominem--an argument to the man,</I> and
 therefore the apostle here quotes a saying of one of the Greek poets, 
 Aratus, a native of Cilicia, Paul's countryman, who, in his 
 <I>Phenomena,</I> in the beginning of his book, speaking of the heathen 
 <I>Jupiter,</I> that is, in the poetical dialect, the supreme 
 <I>God,</I> says this of him, <B><I>tou gar kai genos 
 esmen</I></B>--<I>for we are also his offspring.</I> And he might have
 quoted other poets to the purpose of what he was speaking, that <I>in 
 God we live and move:</I>--</P>

 <P> 

 But he chooses this of Aratus, as having much in a little. By this it
 appears not only that Paul was himself a scholar, but that human 
 learning is both ornamental and serviceable to a gospel minister, 
 especially for the convincing of those that are without; for it enables 
 him to beat them at their own weapons, and to cut off Goliath's head 
 with his own sword. How can the adversaries of truth be beaten out of 
 their strong-holds by those that do not know them? It may likewise 
 shame God's professing people, who forget their relation to God, and 
 walk contrary to it, that a heathen poet could say of God, <I>We are 
 his offspring,</I> formed by him, formed for him, more the care of his 
 providence than ever any children were the care of their parents; and 
 therefore are obliged to obey his commands, and acquiesce in his 
 disposals, and <I>to be unto him for a name and a praise.</I> Since in 
 him and upon him we live, we ought to live to him; since in him we 
 move, we ought to move towards him; and since in him we have our being, 
 and from him we receive all the supports and comforts of our being, we 
 ought to consecrate our being to him, and to apply to him for a new 
 being, a better being, an eternal well-being.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From all these great truths concerning God, he infers the 
 absurdity of their idolatry, as the prophets of old had done. If this 
 be so, 

 1. Then God cannot be represented by an image. If we are <I>the
 offspring of God,</I> as we are spirits in flesh, then certainly he who 
 is <I>the Father of our spirits</I> (and they are the principal part of 
 us, and that part of us by which we are denominated God's offspring) is 
 himself a Spirit, and we ought not to think that the Godhead is <I>like 
 unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 We wrong God, and put an affront upon him, if we think so. God honoured 
 man in making his soul after his own likeness; but man dishonours God 
 if he makes him after the likeness of his body. The Godhead is 
 spiritual, infinite, immaterial, incomprehensible, and therefore it is 
 a very false and unjust conception which an image gives us of God, be 
 the matter ever so rich, <I>fold or silver;</I> be the shape ever so 
 curious, and be it ever so well <I>graven by art or man's device,</I> 
 its countenance, posture, or dress, ever so significant, it is a 
 teacher of lies. 

 2. Then <I>he dwells not in temples made with hands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He is not invited to any temple men can build for him, nor confined to 
 any. A temple brings him never the nearer to us, nor keeps him ever the 
 longer among us. A temple is convenient for us to come together in to 
 worship God; but God needs not any place of rest or residence, nor the 
 magnificence and splendour of any structure, to add to the glory of his 
 appearance. A pious, upright heart, <I>a temple not made with 
 hands,</I> but by <I>the Spirit of God,</I> is that which <I>he dwells 
 in,</I> and <I>delights to dwell in.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:27,Isa+66:1,2">1 Kings viii. 27; Isa. lxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 3. Then he is <I>not worshipped,</I> <B><I>therapeuetai</I></B>, he is
 <I>not served,</I> or <I>ministered unto, with men's hands, as though
 he needed any thing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He that made all, and maintains all, cannot be benefited by any of our
 services, nor needs them. If we receive and derive all from him, he is 
 all-sufficient, and therefore cannot but be self-sufficient, and 
 independent. What need can God have of our services, or what benefit 
 can he have by them, when he has all perfection in himself, and we have 
 nothing that is good but what we have from him? The philosophers, 
 indeed, were sensible of this truth, that God has no need of us or our 
 services; but the vulgar heathen built temples and offered sacrifices 
 to their gods, with an opinion that they needed houses and food. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:5-8,Ps+50:8">Job xxxv. 5-8; Ps. l. 8</A>,

 &c. 
 
 4. Then it concerns us all to enquire after God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>That they should seek the Lord,</I> that is, fear and worship him in 
 a right manner. Therefore God has kept the children of men in a 
 constant dependence upon him for life and all the comforts of life, 
 that he might keep them under constant obligations to him. We have 
 plain indications of God's presence among us, his presidency over us, 
 the care of his providence concerning us, and his bounty to us, that we 
 might be put upon enquiring, <I>Where is God our Maker, who giveth 
 songs in the night, who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, 
 and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10,11">Job xxxv. 10, 11</A>.
 
 Nothing, one would think, should be more powerful with us to convince
 us that there is a God, and to engage us to seek his honour and glory 
 in our services, and to seek our happiness in his favour and love, than 
 the consideration of our own nature, especially the noble powers and 
 faculties of our own souls. If we reflect upon these, and contemplate 
 these, we may perceive both our relation and obligation to a God above 
 us. Yet so dark is this discovery, in comparison with that by divine 
 revelation, and so unapt are we to receive it, that those who have no 
 other could but <I>haply feel after God</I> and <I>find him.</I> 

 (1.) It was very uncertain whether they could by this searching <I>find 
 out God;</I> it is but a peradventure: <I>if haply</I> they might. 

 (2.) If they did find out something of God, yet it was but some 
 confused notions of him; they did but feel after him, as men in the 
 dark, or blind men, who lay hold on a thing that comes in their way, 
 but know not whether it be that which they are in quest of or no. It is 
 a very confused notion which this poet of theirs has of the relation 
 between God and man, and very general, that <I>we are his 
 offspring:</I> as was also that of their philosophers. Pythagoras said, 
 <B><I>Theion genos esti brotoios</I></B>--<I>Men have a sort of a
 divine nature.</I> And Heraclitus (<I>apud Lucian</I>) being asked, 
 <I>What are men?</I> answered, <B><I>Theoi thnetoi</I></B>--<I>Mortal
 gods;</I> and, <I>What are the gods?</I> answered, <B><I>athanatoi 
 anthropoi</I></B>--<I>Immortal men.</I> And Pindar saith (<I>Nemean,
 Ode</I> 6), <B><I>En andron hen theon genos</I></B>--<I>God and man
 are near a-kin.</I> It is true that by the knowledge of ourselves we 
 may be led to the knowledge of God, but it is a very confused 
 knowledge. This is but feeling after him. We have therefore reason to 
 be thankful that by the gospel of Christ we have notices given us of 
 God much clearer than we could have by the light of nature; we do not 
 now feel after him, but <I>with open face behold, as in a glass, the 
 glory of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He proceeds to call them all to repent of their idolatries, and to 
 turn from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 This is the practical part of Paul's sermon before the university; 
 having declared God to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 he properly presses upon them <I>repentance towards God,</I> and would 
 also have taught them <I>faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> if 
 they had had the patience to hear him. Having shown them the absurdity 
 of their worshipping other gods, he persuades them to go on no longer 
 in that foolish way of worship, but to return from it to the living and 
 true God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The conduct of God towards the Gentile world before the gospel came 
 among them: <I>The times of this ignorance God winked at.</I> 

 (1.) They were times of great ignorance. Human learning flourished more 
 than ever in the Gentile world just before Christ's time; but in the 
 things of God they were grossly ignorant. Those are ignorant indeed who 
 either know not God or worship him ignorantly; idolatry was owing to 
 ignorance. 
 
 (2.) These times of ignorance God winked at. Understand it, 
 
 [1.] As an act of divine justice. God despised or neglected these times 
 of ignorance, and did not send them his gospel, as now he does. It was 
 very provoking to him to see his glory thus given to another; and he 
 detested and hated these times. So some take it. Or rather, 

 [2.] As an act of divine patience and forbearance. He winked at these 
 times; he did not restrain them from these idolatries by sending 
 prophets to them, as he did to Israel; he did not punish them in their 
 idolatries, as he did Israel; but gave them the gifts of his 
 providence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:16,17"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16, 17</A>.

 <I>These things thou hast done, and I kept silence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21">Ps. l. 21</A>.

 He did not give them such calls and motives to repentance as he does
 now. He <I>let them alone.</I> Because they did not improve the light
 they had, but were willingly ignorant, he did not send them greater 
 lights. Or, he was not quick and severe with them, but was
 long-suffering towards them, because they did it ignorantly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The charge God gave to the Gentile world by the gospel, which he now 
 sent among them: <I>He now commandeth all men every where to 
 repent</I>--to change their mind and their way, to be ashamed of their
 folly and to act more wisely, to break off the worship of idols and 
 bind themselves to the worship of the true God. Nay, it is to turn with 
 sorrow and shame from every sin, and with cheerfulness and resolution 
 to every duty. 

 (1.) This is God's command. It had been a great favour if he had only 
 told us that there was room left for repentance, and we might be 
 admitted to it; but he goes further, he interposes his own authority 
 for our good, and has made that our duty which is our privilege. 

 (2.) It is his command to <I>all men, every where,</I>--to men, and not
 to angels, that need it not,--to men, and not to devils, that are
 excluded the benefit of it,--to all men in all places; all men have
 made work for repentance, and have cause enough to repent, and all men 
 are invited to repent, and shall have the benefit of it. The apostles 
 are commissioned to preach this every where. The prophets were sent to 
 command the Jews to repent; but the apostles were sent to preach 
 <I>repentance and remission of sins to all nations.</I> 

 (3.) Now in gospel times it is more earnestly commanded, because more 
 encouraged than it had been formerly. Now the way of remission is more 
 opened than it had been, and the promise more fully confirmed; and 
 therefore now he expects we should all repent. "Now repent; now at 
 length, now in time, repent; for you have too long gone on in sin. Now 
 in time repent, for it will be too late shortly."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great reason to enforce this command, taken from the judgment to 
 come. God commands us to repent, <I>because he hath appointed a day in 
 which he will judge the world in righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and has now under the gospel made a clearer discovery of a state of 
 retribution in the other world than ever before. Observe, 

 (1.) The God that made the world will judge it; he that gave the 
 children of men their being and faculties will call them to an account 
 for the use they have made of them, and recompense them accordingly, 
 whether the body served the soul in serving God or the soul was a 
 drudge to the body in making provision for the flesh; and <I>every man 
 shall receive according to the things done in the body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:10">2 Cor. v. 10</A>.
 
 The God that now governs the world will judge it, will reward the
 faithful friends of his government and punish the rebels.

 (2.) There is a day appointed for this general review of all that men
 have done in time, and a final determination of their state for 
 eternity. The day is fixed in the counsel of God, and cannot be 
 altered; but it is his there, and cannot be known. A day of decision, a 
 day of recompence, a day that will put a final period to all the days 
 of time. 

 (3.) The world will be judged in righteousness; for God is not 
 unrighteous, who taketh vengeance; far be it from him that he should do 
 iniquity. His knowledge of all men's characters and actions is 
 infallibly true, and therefore his sentence upon them incontestably 
 just. And, as there will be no appeal from it, so there will be no 
 exception against it. 

 (4.) God will judge the world <I>by that man whom he hath ordained,</I> 
 who can be no other than the Lord Jesus, to whom all judgment is 
 committed. By him God made the world, by him he redeemed it, by him he
 governs it, and by him he will judge it.

 (5.) God's raising Christ from the dead is the great proof of his being 
 appointed and ordained the Judge of quick and dead. His doing him that 
 honour evidenced his designing him this honour. His raising him from 
 the dead was the beginning of his exaltation, his judging the world 
 will be the perfection of it; and he that begins will make an end. God 
 hath <I>given assurance unto all men,</I> sufficient ground for their 
 faith to build upon, both that there is a judgment to come and that 
 Christ will be their judge; the matter is not left doubtful, but is of 
 unquestionable certainty. Let all his enemies be assured of it, and 
 tremble before him; let all his friends be assured of it, and triumph 
 in him. 

 (6.) The consideration of the judgment to come, and of the great hand 
 Christ will have in that judgment, should engage us all to repent of 
 our sins and turn from them to God. This is the only way to make the 
 Judge our friend in that day, which will be a terrible day to all who 
 live and die impenitent; but true penitents will then <I>lift up their 
 heads with joy, knowing that their redemption draws nigh.</I></P>

 <I>matter.</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the issue of Paul's preaching at 
 Athens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Few were the better: the gospel had as little success at Athens as 
 any where; for the pride of the philosophers there, as of the Pharisees 
 at Jerusalem, prejudiced them against the gospel of Christ. 

 1. Some ridiculed Paul and his preaching. They heard him patiently till
 he came to speak of the resurrection of the dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and then some of them began to hiss him: they <I>mocked.</I> What he 
 had said before was somewhat like what they had sometimes heard in 
 their own schools, and some notion they had of a resurrection, as it 
 signifies a future state; but, if he speak of a <I>resurrection of the 
 dead,</I> though it be of the resurrection of Christ himself, it is 
 altogether incredible to them, and they cannot bear so much as to hear 
 of it, as being contrary to a principle of their philosophy: <I>A 
 privatione ad habitum non datur regressus--Life when once lost is
 irrecoverable.</I> They had deified their heroes after their death, but 
 never thought of their being raised from the dead, and therefore they 
 could by no means reconcile themselves to this doctrine of Christ's 
 being raised from the dead; how can this be? This great doctrine, which 
 is the saints' joy, is their jest; when it was but mentioned to them 
 they mocked, and made a laughing matter of it. We are not to think it 
 strange if sacred truths of the greatest certainty and importance are 
 made the scorn of profane wits. 

 2. Others were willing to take time to consider of it; they said, <I>We
 will hear thee again of this matter.</I> They would not at present 
 comply with what Paul said, nor oppose it; but <I>we will hear thee 
 again of this matter,</I> of the resurrection of the dead. It should 
 seem, they overlooked what was plain and uncontroverted, and shifted 
 off the application and the improvement of that, by starting objections 
 against what was disputable, and would admit a debate. Thus many lose 
 the benefit of the practical doctrine of Christianity, by wading beyond 
 their depth into controversy, or, rather, by objecting against that 
 which has some difficulty in it; whereas, if any man were disposed and 
 determined to <I>do the will of God,</I> as far as it is discovered to 
 him, he should <I>know of the doctrine of Christ,</I> that it is <I>of 
 God, and not of man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 Those that would not yield to the present convictions of the word
 thought to get clear of them, as Felix did, by putting them off to
 another opportunity; they will hear of it again some time or other, but
 they know not when; and thus the devil cozens them of all their time,
 by cozening them of the present time. 

 3. Paul thereupon left them for the present to consider of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>He departed from amongst them,</I> as seeing little likelihood of
 doing any good with them at this time; but, it is likely, with a 
 promise to those that were willing to hear him again that he would meet 
 them whenever they pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet there were some that were wrought upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 If some would not, others would. 

 1. There were certain men that adhered to him, and believed. When he 
 departed from amongst them, they would not part with him so; wherever 
 he went, they would follow him, with a resolution to adhere to the 
 doctrine he preached, which they believed.

 2. Two are particularly named; one was an eminent man, <I>Dionysius the
 Areopagite,</I> one of that high court or great council that sat in 
 Areopagus, or Mars' Hill--a judge, a senator, one of those before whom
 Paul was summoned to appear; his judge becomes his convert. The account 
 which the ancients give of this Dionysius is that he was bred at 
 Athens, had studied astrology in Egypt, where he took notice of the 
 miraculous eclipse at our Saviour's passion,--that, returning to
 Athens, he became a senator, disputed with Paul, and was by him 
 converted from his error and idolatry; and, being by him thoroughly 
 instructed, was made the first bishop of Athens. So <I>Eusebius, 
 lib.</I> 5, <I>cap.</I> 4; <I>lib.</I> 4, <I>cap.</I> 22. The <I>woman
 named Damaris</I> was, as some think, the wife of Dionysius; but, 
 rather, some other person of quality; and, though there was not so 
 great a harvest gathered in at Athens as there was at other places, 
 yet, these few being wrought upon there, Paul had no reason to say he 
 had <I>laboured in vain.</I></P>
