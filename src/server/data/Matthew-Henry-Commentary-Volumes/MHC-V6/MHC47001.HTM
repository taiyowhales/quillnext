 After the introduction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>)

 the apostle begins with the narrative of his troubles and God's
 goodness, which he had met with in Asia, by way of thanksgiving to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>),

 and for the edification of the Corinthians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 Then he attests his and his fellow-labourers' integrity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>),

 and afterwards vindicates himself from the imputation of levity and
 inconstancy,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
 Timothy <I>our</I> brother, unto the church of God which is at
 Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
 &nbsp; 2  Grace <I>be</I> to you and peace from God our Father, and <I>from</I>
 the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the introduction to this epistle, in which we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription; and therein, 

 1. The person from whom it was sent, namely, Paul, who calls himself
 <I>an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God.</I> The apostleship 
 itself was ordained by Jesus Christ, according to the will of God; and 
 Paul was called to it by Jesus Christ, according to the will of God. He 
 joins Timotheus with himself in writing this epistle; not because he 
 needed his assistance, but that out of the mouth of two witnesses the 
 word might be established; and this dignifying Timothy with the title 
 of <I>brother</I> (either in the common faith, or in the work of the 
 ministry) shows the humility of this great apostle, and his desire to 
 recommend Timothy (though he was then a young man) to the esteem of the 
 Corinthians, and give him a reputation among the churches. 

 2. The persons to whom this epistle was sent, namely, <I>the church of
 God at Corinth:</I> and not only to them, but also <I>to all the saints 
 in all Achaia,</I> that is, to all the Christians who lived in the 
 region round about. Note, In Christ Jesus no distinction is made 
 between the inhabitants of city and country; all Achaia stands upon a 
 level in his account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The salutation or apostolical benediction, which is the same as in 
 his former epistle; and therein the apostle desires the two great and 
 comprehensive blessings, grace and peace, for those Corinthians. These 
 two benefits are fitly joined together, because there is no good and 
 lasting peace without true grace; and both of them come <I>from God our 
 Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> who is the procurer and 
 dispenser of those benefits to fallen man, and is prayed to as God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Blessed <I>be</I> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
 &nbsp; 4  Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able
 to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
 wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
 &nbsp; 5  For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
 consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
 &nbsp; 6  And whether we be afflicted, <I>it is</I> for your consolation and
 salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same
 sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, <I>it
 is</I> for your consolation and salvation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the foregoing preface, the apostle begins with the narrative of 
 God's goodness to him and his fellow-labourers in their manifold 
 tribulations, which he speaks of by way of thanksgiving to God, and to 
 advance the divine glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:3-6"><I>v.</I> 3-6</A>);

 and it is fit that in all things, and in the first place, God be 
 glorified. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The object of the apostle's thanksgiving, to whom he offers up 
 blessing and praise, namely, the blessed God, who only is to be 
 praised, whom he describes by several glorious and amiable titles. 

 1. <I>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</I> <B> <I>ho
 Theos kai pater tou Kyriou hemon Iesou Christou.</I></B> God is the 
 Father of Christ's divine nature by eternal generation, of his human 
 nature by miraculous conception in the womb of the virgin, and of 
 Christ as God-man, and our Redeemer, by covenant-relation, and in and 
 through him as Mediator our God and our Father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>.

 In the Old Testament we often meet with this title, <I>The God of
 Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob,</I> to denote God's
 covenant-relation to them and their seed; and in the New Testament God
 is styled <I>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> to denote
 his covenant-relation to the Mediator and his spiritual seed. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16">Gal. iii. 16</A>.

 2. <I>The Father of mercies.</I> There is a multitude of tender mercies
 in God essentially, and all mercies are from God originally: mercy in
 his genuine offspring and his delight. <I>He delighteth in mercy,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18">Mic. vii. 18</A>.

 3. <I>The God of all comfort;</I> from his proceedeth the 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OMFORTER</FONT>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:26">John xv. 26</A>.

 He giveth the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 All our comforts come from God, and our sweetest comforts are in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons of the apostle's thanksgivings, which are these:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The benefits that he himself and his companions had received from 
 God; for God <I>had comforted</I> them <I>in all their 
 tribulations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 In the world they had trouble, but in Christ they had peace. The 
 apostles met with many tribulations, but they found comfort in them 
 all: their sufferings (which are called <I>the sufferings of 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 because Christ sympathized with his members when suffering for his 
 sake) did abound, but their consolation by Christ did abound also. 
 Note,

 (1.) Then are we qualified to receive the comfort of God's mercies when 
 we set ourselves to give him the glory of them. 

 (2.) Then we speak best of God and his goodness when we speak from our 
 own experience, and, in telling others, tell God also what he has done 
 for our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The advantage which others might receive; for God intended that they 
 <I>should be able to comfort others</I> in trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 by communicating to them their experiences of the divine goodness and 
 mercy; and the sufferings of good men have a tendency to this good end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 when they are endued with faith and patience. Note, 

 (1.) What favours God bestows on us are intended not only to make us
 cheerful ourselves, but also that we may be useful to others. 

 (2.) If we do imitate the faith and patience of good men in their
 afflictions, we may hope to partake of their consolations here and 
 their salvation hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And our hope of you <I>is</I> stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
 partakers of the sufferings, so <I>shall ye be</I> also of the
 consolation.
 &nbsp; 8  For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble
 which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure,
 above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
 &nbsp; 9  But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should
 not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
 &nbsp; 10  Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in
 whom we trust that he will yet deliver <I>us;</I>
 &nbsp; 11  Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift
 <I>bestowed</I> upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be
 given by many on our behalf.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle speaks for the encouragement and 
 edification of the Corinthians; and tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 of his persuasion or stedfast hope that they should receive benefit by 
 the troubles he and his companions in labour and travel had met with, 
 that their faith should not be weakened, but their consolations 
 increased. In order to this he tells them, 

 1. What their sufferings had been

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>We would not have you ignorant of our trouble.</I> It was convenient 
 for the churches to know what were the sufferings of their ministers. 
 It is not certain what particular troubles in Asia are here referred 
 to; whether the tumult raised by Demetrius at Ephesus, mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:24-41">Acts xix.</A>,

 or the fight with beasts at Ephesus, mentioned in the former epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32"><I>ch.</I> xv.</A>),

 or some other trouble; for the apostle was in deaths often. This
 however is evident, that they were great tribulations. They <I>were 
 pushed out of measure,</I> to a very extraordinary degree, above the 
 common strength of men, or of ordinary Christians, to bear up under 
 them, insomuch that they <I>despaired even of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and thought they should have been killed, or have fainted away and 
 expired.

 2. What they did in their distress: <I>They trusted in God.</I> And
 they were brought to this extremity in order <I>that they should not 
 trust in themselves but in God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, God often brings his people into great straits, that they may 
 apprehend their own insufficiency to help themselves, and may be 
 induced to place their trust and hope in his all-sufficiency. Our 
 extremity is God's opportunity. <I>In the mount will the Lord be 
 seen;</I> and we may safely trust in <I>God, who raiseth the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 God's raising the dead is a proof of his almighty power. He that can do 
 this can do any thing, can do all things, and is worthy to be trusted 
 in at all times. Abraham's faith fastened upon this instance of the 
 divine power: <I>He believed God who quickeneth the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17">Rom. iv. 17</A>.

 If we should be brought so low as to despair even of life, yet we may
 then trust in God, who can bring back not only from the gates, but from 
 the jaws, of death.

 3. What the deliverance was that they had obtained; and this was
 seasonable and continued. Their hope and trust were not in vain, nor 
 shall any who trust in him be ashamed. God had delivered them, and did 
 still deliver them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 <I>Having obtained help of God, they continued to that day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22">Acts xxvi. 22</A>.

 4. What use they made of this deliverance: <I>We trust that he will yet 
 deliver us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that God will deliver to the end, and <I>preserve to his heavenly
 kingdom.</I> Note, Past experiences are great encouragements to faith 
 and hope, and they lay great obligations to trust in God for time to 
 come. We reproach our experiences if we distrust God in future straits, 
 who hath delivered as in former troubles. David, even when a young man, 
 and when he had but a small stock of experiences, argued after the 
 manner of the apostle here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:37">1 Sam. xvii. 37</A>.

 5. What was desired of the Corinthians upon this account: <I>That they
 would help together by prayer for them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 by social prayer, agreeing and joining together in prayer on their 
 behalf. Note, our trusting in God must not supersede the use of any 
 proper and appointed means; and prayer is one of those means. We should 
 pray for ourselves and for one another. The apostle had himself a great 
 interest in the throne of grace, yet he desires the help of others' 
 prayers. If we thus help one another by our prayers, we may hope for an 
 occasion of <I>giving thanks by many</I> for answer of prayer. And it 
 is our duty not only to help one another with prayer, but in praise and 
 thanksgiving, and thereby to make suitable returns for benefits 
 received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience,
 that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom,
 but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the
 world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
 &nbsp; 13  For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read
 or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
 &nbsp; 14  As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your
 rejoicing, even as ye also <I>are</I> ours in the day of the Lord
 Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle in these verses attests their integrity by the sincerity of 
 their conversation. This he does not in a way of boasting and 
 vain-glory, but as one good reason for desiring the help of prayer, as 
 well as for the more comfortably trusting in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18">Heb. xiii. 18</A>),

 and for the necessary vindication of himself from the aspersions of 
 some persons at Corinth, who reproached his person and questioned his 
 apostleship. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He appeals to the testimony of conscience with rejoicing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 in which observe, 

 1. The witness appealed to, namely, conscience, which is instead of a 
 thousand witnesses. This God's deputy in the soul, and the voice of 
 conscience is the voice of God. They rejoiced in the testimony of 
 conscience, when their enemies reproached them, and were enraged 
 against them. Note, The testimony of conscience for us, if that be 
 right and upon good grounds, will be matter of rejoicing at all times 
 and in all conditions. 

 2. The testimony this witness gave. And here take notice, Conscience 
 witnessed,

 (1.) Concerning their conversation, their constant course and tenour of
 life: by that we may judge of ourselves, and not by this or that single 
 act. 

 (2.) Concerning the nature or manner of their conversation; that it was 
 in simplicity and godly sincerity. This blessed apostle was a true 
 Israelite, a man of plain dealing; you might know where to have him. He 
 was not a man who seemed to be one thing and was another, but a man of 
 sincerity.

 (3.) Concerning the principle they acted from in all their 
 conversation, both in the world and towards these Corinthians; and that 
 was not fleshly wisdom, nor carnal politics and worldly views, but it 
 was the grace of God, a vital gracious principle in their hearts, that 
 cometh from God, and tendeth to God. Then will our conversation be well 
 ordered when we live and act under the influence and command of such a 
 gracious principle in the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals to the knowledge of the Corinthians with hope and 
 confidence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Their conversation did in part fall under the observation of the 
 Corinthians; and these knew how they behaved themselves, <I>how holily, 
 and justly, and unblamably;</I> they never found any thing in them 
 unbecoming an honest man. This they had acknowledged in part already, 
 and he doubted not but they would still do so to the end, that is, that 
 they would never have any good reason to think or say otherwise of him, 
 but that he was an honest man. And so there would be mutual rejoicing 
 in one another. <I>We are your rejoicing, even as you also are ours in 
 the day of the Lord Jesus.</I> Note, It is happy when ministers and 
 people do rejoice in each other here; and this joy will be complete in 
 that day when the great Shepherd of the sheep shall appear.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before,
 that ye might have a second benefit;
 &nbsp; 16  And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of
 Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward
 Jud&aelig;a.
 &nbsp; 17  When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or
 the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
 that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
 &nbsp; 18  But <I>as</I> God <I>is</I> true, our word toward you was not yea and
 nay.
 &nbsp; 19  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you
 by us, <I>even</I> by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and
 nay, but in him was yea.
 &nbsp; 20  For all the promises of God in him <I>are</I> yea, and in him
 Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
 &nbsp; 21  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath
 anointed us, <I>is</I> God;
 &nbsp; 22  Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit
 in our hearts.
 &nbsp; 23  Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare
 you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
 &nbsp; 24  Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are
 helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here vindicates himself from the imputation of levity and 
 inconstancy, in that he did not hold his purpose of coming to them at 
 Corinth. His adversaries there sought all occasions to blemish his 
 character, and reflect upon his conduct; and, it seemed, they took hold 
 of this handle to reproach his person and discredit his ministry. Now, 
 for his justification,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He avers the sincerity of his intention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>),

 and he does this in confidence of their good opinion of him, and that 
 they would believe him, when he assured them he <I>was minded,</I> or 
 did really intend, <I>to come</I> to them, and that with the design, 
 not that he might receive, but that they might receive a <I>second 
 benefit,</I> that is, a further advantage by his ministry. He tells 
 them that he had not herein <I>used lightness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 that, as he aimed not at any secular advantage to himself (for his
 purpose was not <I>according to the flesh,</I> that is, with carnal 
 views and aims), so it was not a rash and inconsiderate resolution that 
 he had taken up, for he had laid his measures thus of <I>passing by 
 them to Macedonia, and coming again to them from Macedonia in his way 
 to Judea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and therefore they might conclude that it was for some weighty reasons 
 that he had altered his purpose; and that with him there was not yea 
 yea, and nay nay, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He was not to be accused of levity and inconstancy, nor a contradiction 
 between his words and intentions. Note, Good men should be careful to
 preserve the reputation of sincerity and constancy; they should not 
 resolve but upon mature deliberation, and they will not change their 
 resolves but for weighty reasons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He would not have the Corinthians to infer that his gospel was 
 false or uncertain, nor that it was contradictory in itself, nor unto 
 truth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 For if it had been so, that he had been fickle in his purposes, or even 
 false in the promises he made of coming to them (which he was not 
 justly to be accused of, and so some understand his expression, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 <I>Our word towards you was not yea and nay</I>), yet it would not 
 follow that the gospel preached not only by him, but also by others in 
 full agreement with him, was either false or doubtful. For <I>God is 
 true, and the Son of God, Jesus Christ,</I> is true. The true God, and 
 eternal life. Jesus Christ, whom the apostle preached, is not 
 <I>yea</I> and <I>nay,</I> but in him was <I>yea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 nothing but infallible truth. And the promises of God in Christ are not 
 yea and nay, but yea and amen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 There is an inviolable constancy and unquestionable sincerity and 
 certainty in all the parts of the gospel of Christ. If in the promises 
 that the ministers of the gospel make as common men, and about their 
 own affairs, they see cause sometimes to vary from them, yet the 
 promises of the gospel covenant, which they preach, stand firm and 
 inviolable. Bad men are false; good men are fickle; but <I>God is
 true,</I> neither fickle nor false. The apostle, having mentioned the 
 stability of the divine promises, makes a digression to illustrate this 
 great and sweet truth, that all the promises of God are yea and amen. 
 For, 
 
 1. They are the promises of the God of truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 of him <I>that cannot lie,</I> whose truth as well as mercy endureth 
 for ever. 
 
 2. They are made in Christ Jesus
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 the Amen, the true and faithful witness; he hath purchased and ratified 
 the covenant of promises, and is the <I>surety of the covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:22">Heb. vii. 22</A>.

 3. They are confirmed by the Holy Spirit. He does establish Christians
 in the faith of the gospel; he has anointed them with his sanctifying 
 grace, which in scripture is often compared to oil; he has sealed them, 
 for their security and confirmation; and he is given <I>as an earnest 
 in their hearts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 An earnest secures the promise, and is part of the payment. The 
 illumination of the Spirit is an earnest of everlasting life; and the 
 comforts of the Spirit are an earnest of everlasting joy. Note, The 
 veracity of God, the mediation of Christ, and the operation of the 
 Spirit, are all engaged that the promises shall be sure to all the 
 seed, and the accomplishment of them shall be to the <I>glory of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 for the glory of his rich and sovereign grace, and never-failing truth 
 and faithfulness.</P>

 III. The apostle gives a good reason why he did not come to Corinth, as 
 was expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It was that he might spare them. They ought therefore to own his 
 kindness and tenderness. He knew there were things amiss among them, 
 and such as deserved censure, but was desirous to show tenderness. He 
 assures them that this is the true reason, after this very solemn 
 manner: <I>I call God for a record upon my soul</I>--a way of speaking 
 not justifiable where used in trivial matters; but this was very 
 justifiable in the apostle, for his necessary vindication, and for the 
 credit and usefulness of his ministry, which was struck at by his 
 opposers. He adds, to prevent mistakes, that he did not pretend to have 
 any dominion over their faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Christ only is the Lord of our faith; he is the <I>author and finisher
 of our faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 He reveals to us what we must believe. Paul, and Apollos, and the rest
 of the apostles, were <I>but ministers by whom they believed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:5">1 Cor. iii. 5</A>),

 and so the <I>helpers of their joy,</I> even the joy of faith. For by
 faith we stand firmly, and live safely and comfortably. Our strength
 and ability are owing to faith, and our comfort and joy must flow from 
 faith.</P>
