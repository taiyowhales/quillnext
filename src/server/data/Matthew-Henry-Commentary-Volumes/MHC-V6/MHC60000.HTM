 epistles we have enrolled in the sacred canon of the scripture written 
 by Peter, who was a most eminent apostle of Jesus Christ, and whose 
 character shines brightly as it is described in the four Gospels and in 
 the Acts of the Apostles, but, as it is painted by the papists and 
 legendary writers, it represents a person of extravagant pride and 
 ambition. It is certain from scripture that Simon Peter was one of the 
 first of those whom our Lord called to be his disciples and followers, 
 that he was a person of excellent endowments, both natural and 
 gracious, of great parts and ready elocution, quick to apprehend and 
 bold to execute whatever he knew to be his duty. When our Saviour 
 called his apostles, and gave them their commission, he nominated him 
 first in the list; and by his behaviour towards him he seems to have 
 distinguished him as a special favourite among the twelve. Many 
 instances of our Lord's affection to him, both during his life and 
 after his resurrection, are upon record. But there are many things 
 confidently affirmed of this holy man that are directly false: as, That 
 he had a primacy and superior power over the rest of the apostles--that 
 he was more than their equal--that he was their prince, monarch, and 
 sovereign--and that he exercised a jurisdiction over the whole college 
 of the apostles: moreover, That he as the sole and universal pastor 
 over all the Christian world, the only vicar of Christ upon earth--that 
 he was for above twenty years bishop of Rome--that the popes of Rome 
 succeed to St. Peter, and derive from him a universal supremacy and 
 jurisdiction over all churches and Christians upon earth--and that all 
 this was by our Lord's ordering and appointment; whereas Christ never 
 gave him any pre-eminence of this kind, but positively forbade it, and 
 gave precepts to the contrary. The other apostles never consented to 
 any such claim. Paul declares himself <I>not a whit behind the very 
 chief apostles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5,12:11">2 Cor. xi. 5 and xii. 11</A>.

 Here is no exception of Peter's superior dignity, whom Paul took the
 freedom to blame, and <I>withstood him to the face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:11">Gal. ii. 11</A>.

 And Peter himself never assumed any thing like it, but modestly styles
 himself an <I>apostle of Jesus Christ;</I> and, when he writes to the
 presbyters of the church, he humbly places himself in the same rank
 with them: <I>The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an
 elder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>.

 The design of this first epistle is, 

 I. To explain more fully the doctrines of Christianity to these 
 newly-converted Jews. 

 II. To direct and persuade them to a holy conversation, in the faithful
 discharge of all personal and relative duties, whereby they would 
 secure their own peace and effectually confute the slanders and 
 reproaches of their enemies. 

 III. To prepare them for sufferings. This seems to be his principal
 intention; for he has something to this purport in every chapter, and 
 does, by a great variety of arguments, encourage them to patience and 
 perseverance in the faith, lest the persecutions and sad calamities 
 that were coming upon them should prevail with them to apostatize from 
 Christ and the gospel. It is remarkable that you find not so much as 
 one word savouring of the spirit and pride of a pope in either of these 
 epistles.</P>
