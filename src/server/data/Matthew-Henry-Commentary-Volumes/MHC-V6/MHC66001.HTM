 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
 show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
 and he sent and signified <I>it</I> by his angel unto his servant
 John:
 &nbsp; 2  Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
 Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What we may call the pedigree of this book. 

 1. It is <I>the revelation of Jesus Christ.</I> The whole Bible is so;
 for all revelation comes through Christ and all centres in him; and 
 especially <I>in these last days God has spoken to us by his Son,</I> 
 and concerning his Son. Christ, as the king of his church, has been 
 pleased thus far to let his church know by what rules and methods he 
 will proceed in his government; and, as the prophet of the church, he 
 has made known to us the things that shall be hereafter. 

 2. It is a revelation <I>which God gave unto Christ.</I> Though Christ 
 is himself God, and as such has light and life in himself, yet, as he 
 sustains the office of <I>Mediator between God and man,</I> he receives 
 his instructions from the Father. The human nature of Christ, though 
 endowed with the greatest sagacity, judgment, and penetration, could 
 not, in a way of reason, discover these great events, which not being 
 produced by natural causes, but wholly depending upon the will of God, 
 could be the object only of divine prescience, and must come to a 
 created mind only by revelation. Our Lord Jesus is the great trustee of 
 divine revelation; it is to him that we owe the knowledge we have of 
 what we are to expect from God and what he expects from us. 

 3. This revelation Christ <I>sent and signified by his angel.</I>
 Observe here the admirable order of divine revelation. God gave it to 
 Christ, and Christ employed an angel to communicate it to the churches. 
 The angels are God's messengers; they are ministering spirits to the 
 heirs of salvation. They are Christ's servants: principalities and 
 powers are subject to him; all the angels of God are obliged to worship 
 him. 

 4. The angels <I>signified it to the apostle John.</I> As the angels
 are the messengers of Christ, the ministers are the messengers of the 
 churches; what they receive from heaven, they are to communicate to the 
 churches. John was the apostle chosen for this service. Some think he 
 was the only one surviving, the rest having sealed their testimony with 
 their blood. This was to be the last book of divine revelation; and 
 therefore notified to the church by the last of the apostles. John was 
 the beloved disciple. He was, under the New Testament, as the prophet 
 Daniel under the Old, <I>a man greatly beloved.</I> He was the servant 
 of Christ; he was an apostle, an evangelist, and a prophet; he served 
 Christ in all the three extraordinary offices of the church. James was 
 an apostle, but not a prophet, nor an evangelist; Matthew was an 
 apostle and evangelist, but not a prophet; Luke was an evangelist, but 
 neither a prophet nor an apostle; but John was all three; and so Christ 
 calls him in an eminent sense his <I>servant John.</I> 

 5. John was to deliver this revelation to the church, to all his
 servants. For the revelation was not designed for the use of Christ's 
 extraordinary servants the ministers only, but for all his servants, 
 the members of the church; they have all a right to the oracles of God, 
 and all have their concern in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here we have the subject-matter of this revelation, namely, the 
 things that must shortly come to pass. The evangelists give us an 
 account of the things that are past; prophecy gives us an account of 
 things to come. These future events are shown, not in the clearest 
 light in which God could have set them, but in such a light as he saw 
 most proper, and which would best answer his wise and holy purposes. 
 Had they been as clearly foretold in all their circumstances as God 
 could have revealed them, the prediction might have prevented the 
 accomplishment; but they are foretold more darkly, to beget in us a 
 veneration for the scripture, and to engage our attention and excite 
 our enquiry. We have in this revelation a general idea of the methods 
 of divine providence and government in and about the church, and many 
 good lessons may be learned hereby. These events (it is said) were such
 as should come to pass not only <I>surely,</I> but <I>shortly;</I> that 
 is, they would begin to come to pass very shortly, and the whole would 
 be accomplished in a short time. For now the last ages of the world had 
 come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is an attestation of the prophecy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was signified to John, who bore record of the word of God, and of 
 the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. It is 
 observable that the historical books of the Old Testament have not 
 always the name of the historian prefixed to them, as in the books of 
 <I>Judges, Kings, Chronicles;</I> but in the prophetical books the name 
 is always prefixed, as <I>Isaiah, Jeremiah,</I> &c. So in the New 
 Testament, though John did not prefix his name to his first epistle, 
 yet he does to this prophecy, as ready to vouch and answer for the 
 truth of it; and he gives us not only his name, but his office. He was 
 one who bore record of the word of God in general, and of the testimony 
 of Jesus in particular, and of all things that he saw; he was an 
 eye-witness, and he concealed nothing that he saw. Nothing recorded in 
 this revelation was his own invention or imagination; but all was the 
 record of God and the testimony of Jesus; and, as he added nothing to 
 it, so he kept back no part of the counsels of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Blessed <I>is</I> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
 this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein:
 for the time <I>is</I> at hand.
 &nbsp; 4  John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <I>be</I> unto
 you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to
 come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
 &nbsp; 5  And from Jesus Christ, <I>who is</I> the faithful witness, <I>and</I>
 the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of
 the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
 his own blood,
 &nbsp; 6  And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;
 to him <I>be</I> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
 and they <I>also</I> which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
 shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
 &nbsp; 8  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
 Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
 Almighty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an apostolic benediction on those who should give a due 
 regard to this divine revelation; and this benediction is given more 
 generally and more especially.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. More generally, to all who either read or hear the words of the 
 prophecy. This blessing seems to be pronounced with a design to 
 encourage us to study this book, and not be weary of looking into it 
 upon account of the obscurity of many things in it; it will repay the 
 labour of the careful and attentive reader. Observe, 

 1. It is a blessed privilege to enjoy the oracles of God. This was one
 of the principal advantages the Jews had above the Gentiles. 

 2. It is a blessed thing to study the scriptures; those are well
 employed who search the scriptures. 

 3. It is a privilege not only to read the scriptures ourselves, but to
 hear them read by others, who are qualified to give us the sense of 
 what they read and to lead us into an understanding of them. 

 4. It is not sufficient to our blessedness that we read and hear the
 scriptures, but we must keep the things that are written; we must keep 
 them in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, and in practice, 
 and we shall be blessed in the deed. 

 5. The nearer we come to the accomplishment of the scriptures, the
 greater regard we shall give to them. The time is at hand, and we 
 should be so much the more attentive as we see the day approaching.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostolic benediction is pronounced more especially and 
 particularly to the seven Asian churches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 These seven churches are named in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 and distinct messages sent to each of them respectively in the chapters 
 following. The apostolic blessing is more expressly directed to these 
 because they were nearest to him, who was now in the isle of Patmos, 
 and perhaps he had the peculiar care of them, and superintendency over 
 them, not excluding any of the rest of the apostles, if any of them 
 were now living. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the blessing is which he pronounces on all the faithful in 
 these churches: <I>Grace and peace,</I> holiness and comfort. 
 <I>Grace,</I> that is, the good-will of God towards us and his good 
 work in us; and <I>peace,</I> that is, the sweet evidence and assurance 
 of this grace. There can be no true peace where there is not true 
 grace; and, where grace goes before, peace will follow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Whence this blessing is to come. In whose name does the apostle 
 bless the churches? In the name of God, of the whole Trinity; for this 
 is an act of adoration, and God only is the proper object of it; his 
 ministers must bless the people in no name but his alone. And here, 
 
 (1.) The Father is first named: God the Father, which may be taken 
 either essentially, for God as God, or personally, for the first person 
 in the ever-blessed Trinity, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ; and he is described as the Jehovah <I>who is, and who was, and 
 who is to come,</I> eternal, unchangeable, the same to the 
 Old-Testament church which was, and to the New-Testament church which
 is, and who will be the same to the church triumphant which is to come. 
 
 (2.) The Holy Spirit, called <I>the seven spirits,</I> not seven in 
 number, nor in nature, but the infinite perfect Spirit of God, in whom 
 there is a diversity of gifts and operations. He is before the throne; 
 for, as God made, so he governs, all things by his Spirit. 

 (3.) The Lord Jesus Christ. He mentions him after the Spirit, because 
 he intended to enlarge more upon the person of Christ, as God 
 manifested in the flesh, whom he had seen dwelling on earth before, and 
 now saw again in a glorious form. Observe the particular account we 
 have here of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 [1.] He <I>is the faithful witness;</I> he was from eternity a witness 
 to all the counsels of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>),

 and he was in time a faithful witness to the revealed will of God, who 
 has now spoken to us by his Son; upon his testimony we may safely 
 depend, for he is a faithful witness, cannot be deceived and cannot 
 deceive us.

 [2.] He is the first-begotten or first-born from the dead, or the first 
 parent and head of the resurrection, the only one who raised himself by 
 his own power, and who will by the same power raise up his people from 
 their graves to everlasting honour; for he has begotten them again to a 
 lively hope by his resurrection from the dead.

 [3.] He is the prince of the kings of the earth; from him they have 
 their authority; by him their power is limited and their wrath 
 restrained; by him their counsels are over-ruled, and to him they are 
 accountable. This is good news to the church, and it is good evidence 
 of the Godhead of Christ, who is King of kings and Lord of lords. 

 [4.] He is the great friend of his church and people, one who has done 
 great things for them, and this out of pure disinterested affection. He 
 has loved them, and, in pursuance of that everlasting love, he has, 
 <I>First, Washed them from their sins in his own blood.</I> Sins leave 
 a stain upon the soul, a stain of guilt and of pollution. Nothing can 
 fetch out this stain but the blood of Christ; and, rather than it 
 should not be washed out, Christ was willing to shed his own blood, to 
 purchase pardon and purity for them. <I>Secondly,</I> He has <I>made 
 them kings and priests to God and his Father.</I> Having justified and 
 sanctified them, he makes them kings to his Father; that is, in his 
 Father's account, with his approbation, and for his glory. As kings, 
 they govern their own spirits, conquer Satan, have power and prevalency 
 with God in prayer, and shall judge the world. He hath made them 
 priests, given them access to God, enabled them to enter into the 
 holiest and to offer spiritual and acceptable sacrifices, and has given 
 them an unction suitable to this character; and for these high honours 
 and favours they are bound to ascribe to him dominion and glory for 
 ever.

 [5.] He will be the Judge of the world: <I>Behold, he cometh, and every 
 eye shall see him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This book, the Revelation, begins and ends with a prediction of the 
 second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. We should set ourselves to 
 meditate frequently upon the second coming of Christ, and keep it in 
 the eye of our faith and expectation. John speaks as if he saw that
 day: "<I>Behold, he cometh,</I> as sure as if you beheld him with your 
 eyes. <I>He cometh with clouds,</I> which are his chariot and pavilion. 
 He will come publicly: <I>Every eye shall see him,</I> the eye of his 
 people, the eye of his enemies, every eye, yours and mine." He shall 
 come, to the terror of those who have pierced him and have not repented 
 and of all who have wounded and crucified him afresh by their apostasy 
 from him, and to the astonishment of the pagan world. For he comes to 
 take vengeance on those who know not God, as well as on those that obey 
 not the gospel of Christ.

 [6.] This account of Christ is ratified and confirmed by himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here our Lord Jesus justly challenges the same honour and power that is 
 ascribed to the Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He is the beginning and the end; all things are from him and for him; 
 he is the Almighty; he is the same eternal and unchangeable one. And
 surely whoever presumes to blot out one character of this name of 
 Christ deserves to have his name blotted out of the book of life. Those 
 that honour him he will honour; but those who despise him shall be 
 lightly esteemed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
 tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was
 in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for
 the testimony of Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 10  I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
 great voice, as of a trumpet,
 &nbsp; 11  Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
 What thou seest, write in a book, and send <I>it</I> unto the seven
 churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
 unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
 Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
 &nbsp; 12  And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
 turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
 &nbsp; 13  And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <I>one</I> like unto
 the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
 about the paps with a golden girdle.
 &nbsp; 14  His head and <I>his</I> hairs <I>were</I> white like wool, as white as
 snow; and his eyes <I>were</I> as a flame of fire;
 &nbsp; 15  And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
 furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
 &nbsp; 16  And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his
 mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <I>was</I> as
 the sun shineth in his strength.
 &nbsp; 17  And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
 his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first
 and the last:
 &nbsp; 18  I <I>am</I> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive
 for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
 &nbsp; 19  Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which
 are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
 &nbsp; 20  The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
 hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the
 angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which
 thou sawest are the seven churches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have now come to that glorious vision which the apostle had of the 
 Lord Jesus Christ, when he came to deliver this revelation to him, 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account given of the person who was favoured with this vision. 
 He describes himself, 

 1. By his present state and condition. He was <I>the brother and
 companion of these churches in tribulation, and in the kingdom and 
 patience of Christ.</I> He was, at their time, as the rest of true 
 Christians were, a persecuted man, banished, and perhaps imprisoned, 
 for his adherence to Christ. He was their <I>brother,</I> though an 
 apostle; he seems to value himself upon his relation to the church, 
 rather than his authority in it: Judas Iscariot may be an apostle, but 
 not a brother in the family of God. He was their companion: the 
 children of God should choose communion and society with each other. He 
 was their companion in tribulation: the persecuted servants of God did 
 not suffer alone, the same trials are accomplished in others. He was 
 their companion in patience, not only a sharer with them in suffering 
 circumstances, but in suffering graces: if we have the patience of the 
 saints, we should not grudge to meet with their trials. He was their 
 <I>brother and companion in the patience of the kingdom of Christ,</I> 
 a sufferer for Christ's cause, for asserting his kingly power over the 
 church and the world, and for adhering to it against all who would 
 usurp upon it. By this account he gives of his present state, he 
 acknowledges his engagements to sympathize with them, and to endeavour 
 to give them counsel and comfort, and bespeaks their more careful 
 attention to what he had to say to them from Christ their common Lord. 
 
 2. By the place where he was when he was favoured with this vision: he
 was in <I>the isle Patmos.</I> He does not say who banished him 
 thither. It becomes Christians to speak sparingly and modestly of their 
 own sufferings. Patmos is said to be an island in the Aegean Sea, One 
 of those called Cyclades, and was about thirty-five miles in compass; 
 but under this confinement it was the apostle's comfort that he did not 
 suffer as an evil-doer, but that it was for the testimony of Jesus, for 
 bearing witness to Christ as the Immanuel, the Saviour. This was a 
 cause worth suffering for; and the Spirit of glory and of God rested 
 upon this persecuted apostle. 

 3. The day and time in which he had this vision: it was <I>the Lord's
 day,</I> the day which Christ had separated and set apart for himself, 
 as the eucharist is called <I>the Lord's supper.</I> Surely this can be 
 no other than the Christian sabbath, the first day of the week, to be 
 observed in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ. Let us who call 
 him <I>our Lord</I> honour him on his own day, the day which the Lord 
 hath made and in which we ought to rejoice. 

 4. The frame that his soul was in at this time: <I>He was in the
 Spirit.</I> He was not only in a rapture when he received the vision, 
 but before he received it; he was in a serious, heavenly, spiritual 
 frame, under the blessed gracious influences of the Spirit of God. God 
 usually prepares the souls of his people for uncommon manifestations of 
 himself, by the quickening sanctifying influences of his good Spirit. 
 Those who would enjoy communion with God on the Lord's day must 
 endeavour to abstract their thoughts and affections from flesh and 
 fleshly things, and be wholly taken up with things of a spiritual 
 nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle gives an account of what he heard when thus in the 
 Spirit. An alarm was given as with the sound of a trumpet, and then 
 <I>he heard a voice,</I> the voice of Christ applying to himself the 
 character before given, <I>the first and the last,</I> and commanding 
 the apostle to commit to writing the things that were now to be 
 revealed to him, and to send it immediately <I>to the seven Asian 
 churches,</I> whose names are mentioned. Thus our Lord Jesus, the 
 captain of our salvation, gave the apostle notice of his glorious 
 appearance, as with the sound of a trumpet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have also an account of what he saw. <I>He turned to see the 
 voice,</I> whose it was and whence it came; and then a wonderful scene 
 of vision opened itself to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He saw a representation of the church under the emblem of <I>seven 
 golden candlesticks,</I> as it is explained in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:20">last verse of the chapter</A>.

 The churches are compared to candlesticks, because they hold forth the
 light of the gospel to advantage. The churches are not candles: Christ
 only is our light, and his gospel our lamp; but they receive their 
 light from Christ and the gospel, and hold it forth to others. They are 
 golden candlesticks, for they should be precious and pure, comparable 
 to fine gold; not only the ministers, but the members of the churches 
 ought to be such; their light should so shine before men as to engage 
 others to give glory to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He saw a representation of the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of the 
 golden candlesticks; for he has promised to be with his churches always 
 to the end of the world, filling them with light, and life, and love, 
 for he is the very animating informing soul of the church. And here we 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The glorious form in which Christ appeared in several particulars.
 
 [1.] He was <I>clothed with a garment down to the foot,</I> a princely 
 and priestly robe, denoting righteousness and honour. 

 [2.] <I>He was girt about with a golden girdle,</I> the breast-plate of 
 the high priest, on which the names of his people are engraven; he was 
 ready girt to do all the work of a Redeemer.

 [3.] <I>His head and hairs were white like wool or snow.</I> He was the 
 Ancient of days; his hoary head was no sign of decay, but was indeed a 
 crown of glory.

 [4.] <I>His eyes were as a flame of fire,</I> piercing and penetrating 
 into the very hearts and reins of men, scattering terrors among his 
 adversaries.

 [5.] <I>His feet were like unto fine burning brass,</I> strong and 
 stedfast, supporting his own interest, subduing his enemies, treading 
 them to powder.

 [6.] <I>His voice was as the sound of many waters,</I> of many rivers 
 falling in together. He can and will make himself heard to those who 
 are afar off as well as to those who are near. His gospel is a 
 profluent and mighty stream, fed by the upper springs of infinite 
 wisdom and knowledge.

 [7.] <I>He had in his right hand seven stars,</I> that is, the 
 ministers of the seven churches, who are under his direction, have all 
 their light and influence from him, and are secured and preserved by 
 him.

 [8.] <I>Out of his mouth went a two-edged sword,</I> his word, which 
 both wounds and heals, strikes at sin on the right hand and on the 
 left,

 [9.] <I>His countenance was as the sun shining,</I> its strength too 
 bright and dazzling for mortal eyes to behold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The impression this appearance of Christ made upon the apostle
 John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>He fell at the feet of Christ as dead;</I> he was overpowered with 
 the greatness of the lustre and glory in which Christ appeared, though 
 he had been so familiar with him before. How well is it for us that God 
 speaks to us by men like ourselves, whose terrors shall not make us 
 afraid, for none can see the face of God and live!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The condescending goodness of the Lord Jesus to his disciple:
 <I>He laid his hand upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He raised him up; he did not plead against him with his great power, 
 but he put strength into him, he spoke kind words to him.

 [1.] Words of comfort and encouragement: <I>Fear not.</I> He commanded 
 away the slavish fears of his disciple.

 [2.] Words of instruction, telling him particularly who he was that 
 thus appeared to him. And here he acquaints him, <I>First,</I> with his 
 divine nature: <I>The first and the last. Secondly,</I> With his former 
 sufferings: <I>I was dead;</I> the very same that his disciples saw 
 upon the cross dying for the sins of men. <I>Thirdly,</I> With his
 resurrection and life: "<I>I live, and am alive for evermore,</I> have 
 conquered death and opened the grave, and am partaker of an endless 
 life." <I>Fourthly,</I> With his office and authority: <I>I have the
 keys of hell and of death,</I> a sovereign dominion in and over the 
 invisible world, opening and none can shut, shutting so that none can 
 open, opening the gates of death when he pleases and the gates of the 
 eternal world, of happiness or misery, as the Judge of all, from whose 
 sentence there lies no appeal. <I>Fifthly,</I> With his will and 
 pleasure: <I>Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things 
 which are, and which shall be hereafter. Sixthly,</I> With the meaning 
 of the seven stars, that <I>they are the ministers of the churches;</I> 
 and of the seven candlesticks, that <I>they are the seven churches,</I> 
 to whom Christ would now send by him particular and proper 
 messages.</P>
