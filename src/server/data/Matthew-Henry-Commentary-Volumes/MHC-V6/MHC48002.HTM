 The apostle, in this chapter, continues the relation of his past life 
 and conduct, which he had begun in the former; and, by some further 
 instances of what had passed between him and the other apostles, makes 
 it appear that he was not beholden to them either for his knowledge of 
 the gospel or his authority as an apostle, as his adversaries would 
 insinuate; but, on the contrary, that he was owned and approved even by 
 them, as having an equal commission with them to this office. 

 I. He particularly informs them of another journey which he took to
 Jerusalem many years after the former, and how he behaved himself at
 that time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.
 
 And, 

 II. Gives them an account of another interview he had with the apostle
 Peter at Antioch, and how he was obliged to behave himself towards him
 there. From the subject-matter of that conversation, he proceeds to
 discourse on the great doctrine of justification by faith in Christ,
 without the works of the law, which it was the main design of this 
 epistle to establish, and which he enlarges more upon in the two 
 following chapters.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
 Barnabas, and took Titus with <I>me</I> also.
 &nbsp; 2  And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
 gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them
 which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had
 run, in vain.
 &nbsp; 3  But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
 compelled to be circumcised:
 &nbsp; 4  And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
 came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
 Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
 &nbsp; 5  To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for a hour;
 that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
 &nbsp; 6  But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they
 were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:)
 for they who seemed <I>to be somewhat</I> in conference added nothing
 to me:
 &nbsp; 7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the
 uncircumcision was committed unto me, as <I>the gospel</I> of the
 circumcision <I>was</I> unto Peter;
 &nbsp; 8  (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship
 of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the
 Gentiles:)
 &nbsp; 9  And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars,
 perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and
 Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we <I>should go</I> unto
 the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
 &nbsp; 10  Only <I>they would</I> that we should remember the poor; the same
 which I also was forward to do.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem, by the account Paul gives of himself in this chapter, 
 that, from the very first preaching and planting of Christianity, there 
 was a difference of apprehension between those Christians who had first 
 been Jews and those who had first been Gentiles. Many of those who had 
 first been Jews retained a regard to the ceremonial law, and strove to 
 keep up the reputation of that; but those who had first been Gentiles 
 had no regard to the law of Moses, but took pure Christianity as 
 perfective of natural religion, and resolved to adhere to that. Peter 
 was the apostle to them; and the ceremonial law, though dead with 
 Christ, yet not being as yet buried, he connived at the respect kept up 
 for it. But Paul was the apostle of the Gentiles; and, though he was a 
 Hebrew of the Hebrews, yet he adhered to pure Christianity. Now in this 
 chapter he tells us what passed between him and the other apostles, and 
 particularly between him and Peter hereupon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses he informs us of another journey which he took to
 Jerusalem, and of what passed between him and the other apostles there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:1-10"><I>v.</I> 1-10</A>.
 
 Here he acquaints us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With some circumstances relating to this his journey thither. As 
 particularly, 

 1. With the time of it: that it was not till <I>fourteen years</I>
 after the former (mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>),

 or, as others choose to understand it, from his conversion, or from the
 death of Christ. It was an instance of the great goodness of God that 
 so useful a person was for so many years preserved in his work. And it 
 was some evidence that he had no dependence upon the other apostles, 
 but had an equal authority with them, that he had been so long absent 
 from them, and was all the while employed in preaching and propagating 
 pure Christianity, without being called into question by them for it, 
 which it may be thought he would have been, had he been inferior to 
 them, and his doctrine disapproved by them. 

 2. With his companions in it: <I>he went up with Barnabas, and took 
 with him Titus also.</I> If the journey here spoken of was the same 
 with that recorded

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:36-41">Acts xv.</A>

 (as many think), then we have a plain reason why Barnabas went along
 with him; for he was chosen by the Christians at Antioch to be his 
 companion and associate in the affair he went about. But, as it does 
 not appear that Titus was put into the same commission with him, so the 
 chief reason of his taking him along with him seems to have been to let 
 those at Jerusalem see that he was neither ashamed nor afraid to own 
 the doctrine which he had constantly preached; for though Titus had now 
 become not only a convert to the Christian faith, but a preacher of it 
 too, yet he was by birth a Gentile and uncircumcised, and therefore, by 
 making him his companion, it appeared that their doctrine and practice 
 were of a piece, and that as he had preached the non-necessity of 
 circumcision, and observing the law of Moses, so he was ready to own 
 and converse with those who were uncircumcised. 

 3. With the reason of it, which was a divine revelation he had
 concerning it: <I>he went up be revelation;</I> not of his own head, 
 much less as being summoned to appear there, but by special order and 
 direction from Heaven. It was a privilege with which this apostle was 
 often favoured to be under a special divine direction in his motions 
 and undertakings; and, though this is what we have no reason to expect, 
 yet it should teach us, in every thing of moment we go about, to 
 endeavour, as far as we are capable, to see our way made plain before 
 us, and to commit ourselves to the guidance of Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives us an account of his behaviour while he was at Jerusalem, 
 which was such as made it appear that he was not in the least inferior 
 to the other apostles, but that both his authority and qualifications 
 were every way equal to theirs. He particularly acquaints us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That <I>he there communicated the gospel to them, which he preached 
 among the Gentiles, but privately,</I> &c. Here we may observe both the 
 faithfulness and prudence of our great apostle. 

 (1.) His faithfulness in giving them a free and fair account of the
 doctrine which he had all along preached among the Gentiles, and was 
 still resolved to preach--that of pure Christianity, free from all 
 mixtures of Judaism. This he knew was a doctrine that would be
 ungrateful to many there, and yet he was not afraid to own it, but in a 
 free and friendly manner lays it open before them and leaves them to 
 judge whether or no it was not the true gospel of Christ. And yet, 

 (2.) He uses prudence and caution herein, for fear of giving offence. 
 He chooses rather to do it in a more private than in a public way, and 
 <I>to those that were of reputation,</I> that is, to the apostles 
 themselves, or to the chief among the Jewish Christians, rather than 
 more openly and promiscuously to all, because, when he came to 
 Jerusalem, <I>there were multitudes that believed, and yet continued 
 zealous for the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:20">Acts xxi. 20</A>.

 And the reason of this his caution was <I>lest he should run, or had
 run, in vain,</I> lest he should stir up opposition against himself and 
 thereby either the success of his past labours should be lessened, or 
 his future usefulness be obstructed; for nothing more hinders the 
 progress of the gospel than differences of opinion about the doctrines 
 of it, especially when they occasion quarrels and contentions among the 
 professors of it, as they too usually do. It was enough to his purpose 
 to have his doctrine owned by those who were of greatest authority, 
 whether it was approved by others or not. And therefore, to avoid 
 offence, he judges it safest to communicate it privately to them, and 
 not in public to the whole church. This conduct of the apostle may 
 teach all, and especially ministers, how much need they have of 
 prudence, and how careful they should be to use it upon all occasions, 
 as far as is consistent with their faithfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That in his practice he firmly adhered to the doctrine which he had 
 preached. Paul was a man of resolution, and would adhere to his 
 principles; and therefore, though he had Titus with him, who was a 
 Greek, yet he would not suffer him to be circumcised, because he would 
 not betray the doctrine of Christ, as he had preached it to the 
 Gentiles. It does not appear that the apostles at all insisted upon 
 this; for, though they connived at the use of circumcision among the 
 Jewish converts, yet they were not for imposing it upon the Gentiles. 
 But there were others who did, whom the apostle here calls <I>false 
 brethren,</I> and concerning whom he informs us that they were 
 <I>unawares brought in,</I> that is, into the church, or into their 
 company, and that they came only to <I>spy out their liberty which they 
 had in Christ Jesus,</I> or to see whether Paul would stand up in 
 defence of that freedom from the ceremonial law which he had taught as 
 the doctrine of the gospel, and represented as the privilege of those 
 who embraced the Christian religion. Their design herein was <I>to 
 bring them into bondage,</I> which they would have effected could they 
 have gained the point they aimed at; for, had they prevailed with Paul 
 and the other apostles to have circumcised Titus, they would easily 
 have imposed circumcision upon other Gentiles, and so have brought them 
 under the bondage of the law of Moses. But Paul, seeing their design, 
 would by no means yield to them; he would not <I>give place by 
 subjection, no, not for an hour,</I> not in this one single instance; 
 and the reason of it was <I>that the truth of the gospel might continue 
 with them</I>--that the Gentile Christians, and particularly the
 Galatians, might have it preserved to them pure and entire, and not 
 corrupted with the mixtures of Judaism, as it would have been had he 
 yielded in this matter. Circumcision was at that time a thing 
 indifferent, and what in some cases might be complied with without sin; 
 and accordingly we find even Paul himself sometimes giving way to it, 
 as in the case of Timothy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:3">Acts xvi. 3</A>.

 But when it is insisted on as necessary, and his consenting to it,
 though only in a single instance, is likely to be improved as giving 
 countenance to such an imposition, he has too great a concern for the 
 purity and liberty of the gospel, to submit to it; he would not yield 
 to those who were for the Mosaic rites and ceremonies, but would stand 
 fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, which conduct 
 of his may give us occasion to observe that what under some 
 circumstances may lawfully be complied with, yet, when that cannot be 
 done without betraying the truth, or giving up the liberty, of the 
 gospel, it ought to be refused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, though he conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not 
 receive any addition to his knowledge or authority from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 By <I>those who seemed to be somewhat</I> he means the other apostles, 
 particularly James, Peter, and John, whom he afterwards mentions by 
 name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 And concerning these he grants that they were deservedly had in 
 reputation by all, that they were looked upon (and justly too) as 
 pillars of the church, who were set not only for its ornament, but for 
 its support, and that on some accounts they might seem to have the 
 advantage of him, in that they had seen Christ in the flesh, which he 
 had not, and were apostles before him, yea, even while he continued a 
 persecutor. But yet, <I>whatever they were, it was no matter to 
 him.</I> This was no prejudice to his being equally an apostle with 
 them; for God does not accept the persons of men on the account of any 
 such outward advantages. As he had called them to this office, so he 
 was at liberty to qualify others for it, and to employ them in it. And 
 it was evident in this case that he had done so; for <I>in conference 
 they added nothing to him,</I> they told him nothing but what he before 
 knew by revelation, nor could they except against the doctrine which he 
 communicated to them, whence it appeared that he was not at all 
 inferior to them, but was as much called and qualified to be an apostle 
 as they themselves were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That the issue of this conversation was that the other apostles were 
 fully convinced of his divine mission and authority, and accordingly 
 acknowledged him as their fellow-apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.

 They were not only satisfied with his doctrine, but they saw a divine 
 power attending him, both in preaching it and in working miracles for 
 the confirmation of it: <I>that he who wrought effectually in Peter to 
 the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in him towards 
 the Gentiles.</I> And hence they justly concluded <I>that the gospel of 
 the uncircumcision was committed to Paul, as the gospel of the 
 circumcision was to Peter.</I> And therefore, <I>perceiving the grace 
 that was given to him</I> (that he was designed to the honour and 
 office of an apostle as well as themselves) <I>they gave unto him and 
 Barnabas the right hand of fellowship,</I> a symbol whereby they 
 acknowledged their equality with them, and agreed that <I>these should 
 go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the 
 circumcision,</I> as judging it most agreeable to the mind of Christ, 
 and most conducive to the interest of Christianity, so to divide their 
 work. And thus this meeting ended in an entire harmony and agreement; 
 they approved both Paul's doctrine and conduct, they were fully 
 satisfied in him, heartily embraced him as an apostle of Christ, and 
 had nothing further to add, <I>only that they would remember the 
 poor,</I> which of his own accord <I>he was very forward to do.</I> The 
 Christians of Judea were at that time labouring under great wants and 
 difficulties; and the apostles, out of their compassion to them and 
 concern for them, recommend their case to Paul, that he should use his 
 interest with the Gentile churches to procure a supply for them. This 
 was a reasonable request; <I>for, if the Gentiles were made partakers 
 of their spiritual things, it was their duty to minister to them in 
 carnal things,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:27">Rom. xv. 27</A>.

 And he very readily falls in with it, whereby he showed his charitable
 and catholic disposition, how ready he was to own the Jewish converts 
 as brethren, though many of them could scarcely allow the like favour 
 to the converted Gentiles, and that mere difference of opinion was no 
 reason with him why he should not endeavour to relieve and help them.
 Herein he has given us an excellent pattern of Christian charity, and 
 has taught us that we should by no means confine it to those who are 
 just of the same sentiments with us, but be ready to extend it to all 
 whom we have reason to look upon as the disciples of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the
 face, because he was to be blamed.
 &nbsp; 12  For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
 Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
 himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
 &nbsp; 13  And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch
 that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
 &nbsp; 14  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to
 the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before <I>them</I> all, If
 thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not
 as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do
 the Jews?
 &nbsp; 15  We <I>who are</I> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the
 Gentiles,
 &nbsp; 16  Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
 but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus
 Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and
 not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no
 flesh be justified.
 &nbsp; 17  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we
 ourselves also are found sinners, <I>is</I> therefore Christ the
 minister of sin? God forbid.
 &nbsp; 18  For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make
 myself a transgressor.
 &nbsp; 19  For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live
 unto God.
 &nbsp; 20  I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
 but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
 flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
 gave himself for me.
 &nbsp; 21  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness
 <I>come</I> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the account which Paul gives of what passed between him and the 
 other apostles at Jerusalem, the Galatians might easily discern both 
 the falseness of what his enemies had insinuated against him and their 
 own folly and weakness in departing from that gospel which he had 
 preached to them. But to give the greater weight to what he had already 
 said, and more fully to fortify them against the insinuations of the 
 judaizing teachers, he acquaints them with another interview which he 
 had with the apostle Peter at Antioch, and what passed between them 
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>.

 Antioch was one of the chief churches of the Gentile Christians, as 
 Jerusalem was of those Christians who turned from Judaism to the faith 
 of Christ. There is no colour of reason for the supposition that Peter 
 was bishop of Antioch. If he had, surely Paul would not have withstood 
 him in his own church, as we here find he did; but, on the contrary, it 
 is here spoken of as an occasional visit which he made thither. In 
 their other meeting, there had been good harmony and agreement. Peter 
 and the other apostles had both acknowledged Paul's commission and 
 approved his doctrine, and they parted very good friends. But in this 
 Paul finds himself obliged to oppose Peter, for <I>he was to be 
 blamed,</I> a plain evidence that he was not inferior to him, and 
 consequently of the weakness of the pope's pretence to supremacy and 
 infallibility, as the successor of Peter. Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Peter's fault. When he came among the Gentile churches, he complied 
 with them, and did eat with them, though they were not circumcised, 
 agreeably to the instructions which were given in particular to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9-16">Acts x.</A>),

 when he was warned by the heavenly vision <I>to call nothing common or
 unclean.</I> But, when there came some Jewish Christians from
 Jerusalem, he grew more shy of the Gentiles, only to humour those of 
 the circumcision and for fear of giving them offence, which doubtless 
 was to the great grief and discouragement of the Gentile churches. Then 
 <I>he withdrew, and separated himself.</I> His fault herein had a bad 
 influence upon others, for <I>the other Jews also dissembled with 
 him;</I> though before they might be better disposed, yet now, from his 
 example, they took on them to scruple eating with the Gentiles, and 
 pretended they could not in conscience do it, because they were not 
 circumcised. And (would you think it?) Barnabas himself, one of the 
 apostles of the Gentiles, and one who had been instrumental in planting 
 and watering the churches of the Gentiles, <I>was carried away with 
 their dissimulation.</I> Here note, 

 (1.) The weakness and inconstancy of the best of men, when left to 
 themselves, and how apt they are to falter in their duty to God, out of 
 an undue regard to the pleasing of men. And, 

 (2.) The great force of bad examples, especially the examples of great 
 men and good men, such as are in reputation for wisdom and honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rebuke which Paul gave him for his fault. Notwithstanding 
 Peter's character, yet, when he observes him thus behaving himself to 
 the great prejudice both of the truth of the gospel and the peace of 
 the church, he is not afraid to reprove him for it. Paul adhered 
 resolutely to his principles, when others faltered in theirs; he was as 
 good a Jew as any of them (for he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews), but he 
 would magnify his office as the apostle of the Gentiles, and therefore 
 would not see them discouraged and trampled upon. <I>When he saw that 
 they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the 
 gospel</I>--that they did not live up to that principle which the gospel
 taught, and which they had professed to own and embrace, namely, that 
 by the death of Christ the partition-wall between Jew and Gentile was 
 taken down, and the observance of the law of Moses was no longer in 
 force--when he observed this, as Peter's offence was public, so he
 publicly reproved him for it: <I>He said unto him before them all, If 
 thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as 
 do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the 
 Jews?</I> Herein one part of his conduct was a contradiction to the 
 other; for if he, who was a Jew, could himself sometimes dispense with 
 the use of the ceremonial law, and live after the manner of the 
 Gentiles, this showed that he did not look upon the observance of it as 
 still necessary, even for the Jews themselves; and therefore that he 
 could not, consistently with his own practice, impose it upon the 
 Gentile Christians. And yet Paul charges him with this, yea, represents 
 him as compelling the Gentiles to live as did the Jews--not by open
 force and violence, but this was the tendency of what he did; for it 
 was in effect to signify this, that the Gentiles must comply with the 
 Jews, or else not be admitted into Christian communion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul having thus established his character and office, and 
 sufficiently shown that he was not inferior to any of the apostles, no, 
 not to Peter himself, from the account of the reproof he gave him he 
 takes occasion to speak of that great fundamental doctrine of the 
 gospel--That justification is only by faith in Christ, and not by the
 works of the law (though some think that all he says to the end of the 
 chapter is what he said to Peter at Antioch), which doctrine condemned 
 Peter for his symbolizing with the Jews. For, if it was the principle 
 of his religion that the gospel is the instrument of our justification 
 and not the law, then he did very ill in countenancing those who kept 
 up the law, and were for mixing it with faith in the business of our 
 justification. This was the doctrine which Paul had preached among the 
 Galatians, to which he still adhered, and which it is his great 
 business in this epistle to mention and confirm. Now concerning this 
 Paul acquaints us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With the practice of the Jewish Christians themselves: "<I>We,</I>" 
 says he, "<I>who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the 
 Gentiles</I> (even we who have been born and bred in the Jewish 
 religion, and not among the impure Gentiles), <I>knowing that a man is 
 not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus 
 Christ, even we ourselves have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might 
 be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the 
 law.</I> And, if we have thought it necessary to seek justification by 
 the faith of Christ, why then should we hamper ourselves with the law? 
 What did we believe in Christ for? Was it not that we might be 
 justified by the faith of Christ? And, if so, is it not folly to go 
 back to the law, and to expect to be justified either by the merit of 
 moral works or the influence of any ceremonial sacrifices or 
 purifications? And if it would be wrong in us who are Jews by nature to 
 return to the law, and expect justification by it, would it not be much 
 more so to require this of the Gentiles, who were never subject to it, 
 since <I>by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified?</I>" To 
 give the greater weight to this he adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 "<I>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also 
 are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin?</I> If, while we seek 
 justification by Christ alone, and teach others to do so, we ourselves 
 are found giving countenance or indulgence to sin, or rather are 
 accounted sinners of the Gentiles, and such as it is not fit to have 
 communion with, unless we also observe the law of Moses, <I>is Christ 
 the minister of sin?</I> Will it not follow that he is so, if he engage 
 us to receive a doctrine that gives liberty to sin, or by which we are 
 so far from being justified that we remain impure sinners, and unfit to 
 be conversed with?" This, he intimates, would be the consequence, but 
 he rejects it with abhorrence: "<I>God forbid,</I>" says he, "that we 
 should entertain such a thought of Christ, or of his doctrine, that 
 thereby he should direct us into a way of justification that is 
 defective and ineffectual, and leave those who embrace it still 
 unjustified, or that would give the least encouragement to sin and 
 sinners." This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and it would be 
 very injurious to them also. "<I>For,</I>" says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 "<I>if I build again the things which I destroyed</I>--if I (or any
 other), who have taught that the observance of the Mosaic law is not 
 necessary to justification, should now, by word or practice, teach or 
 intimate that it is necessary--<I>I make myself a transgressor;</I> I 
 own myself to be still an impure sinner, and to remain under the guilt 
 of sin, notwithstanding my faith in Christ; or I shall be liable to be 
 charged with deceit and prevarication, and acting inconsistently with 
 myself." Thus does the apostle argue for the great doctrine of 
 justification by faith without the works of the law from the principles 
 and practice of the Jewish Christians themselves, and from the 
 consequences that would attend their departure from it, whence it 
 appeared that Peter and the other Jews were much in the wrong in 
 refusing to communicate with the Gentile Christians, and endeavouring 
 to bring them under the bondage of the law.</P>

 2. He acquaints us what his own judgment and practice were. 

 (1.) That he was dead to the law. Whatever account others might make of 
 it, yet, for his part, he was dead to it. He knew that the moral law 
 denounced a curse against all that continue not in all things written 
 therein, to do them; and therefore he was dead to it, as to all hope of 
 justification and salvation that way. And as for the ceremonial law, he 
 also knew that it was now antiquated and superseded by the coming of 
 Christ, and therefore, the substance having come, he had no longer any 
 regard to the shadow. He was thus dead to the law, <I>through the law 
 itself;</I> it discovered itself to be at an end. By considering the 
 law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the 
 works of it (since none could perform a perfect obedience to it) and 
 that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and purifications 
 of it, since they were done away in Christ, and a period was put to 
 them by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us; and therefore, the 
 more he looked into it the more he saw that there was no occasion for 
 keeping up that regard to it which the Jews pleaded for. But, though he 
 was thus <I>dead to the law,</I> yet he did not look upon himself as 
 <I>with law.</I> He had renounced all hopes of justification by the 
 works of it, and was unwilling any longer to continue under the bondage 
 of it; but he was far from thinking himself discharged from his duty to 
 God; on the contrary, he was dead to the law, <I>that he might live 
 unto God.</I> The doctrine of the gospel, which he had embraced, 
 instead of weakening the bond of duty upon him, did but the more 
 strengthen and confirm it; and therefore, though he was dead to the 
 law, yet it was only in order to his living a new and better life to 
 God (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4,6">Rom. vii. 4, 6</A>),

 such a life as would be more agreeable and acceptable to God than his 
 observance of the Mosaic law could now be, that is, a life of faith in 
 Christ, and, under the influence thereof, of holiness and righteousness 
 towards God. Agreeably hereunto he acquaints us, 

 (2.) That, as he was dead to the law, so he was alive unto God through 
 Jesus Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I am crucified with Christ,</I> &c. And here in his own person he 
 gives us an excellent description of the mysterious life of a believer.
 
 [1.] He is crucified, and yet he lives; the old man is crucified
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:6">Rom. vi. 6</A>),

 but the new man is living; he is dead to the world, and dead to the 
 law, and yet alive to God and Christ; sin is mortified, and grace 
 quickened. 

 [2.] <I>He lives, and yet not he.</I> This is strange: <I>I live, and
 yet not I;</I> he lives in the exercise of grace; he has the comforts 
 and the triumphs of grace; and yet that grace is not from himself, but 
 from another. Believers see themselves living in a state of
 dependence. 

 [3.] <I>He is crucified with Christ,</I> and yet <I>Christ lives in
 him;</I> this results from his mystical union with Christ, by means of 
 which he is interested in the death of Christ, so as by virtue of that 
 to die unto sin; and yet interested in the life of Christ, so as by 
 virtue of that to live unto God. 

 [4.] <I>He lives in the flesh,</I> and yet <I>lives by faith;</I> to
 outward appearance he lives as other people do, his natural life is 
 supported as others are; yet he has a higher and nobler principle that 
 supports and actuates him, that of faith in Christ, and especially as 
 eyeing the wonders of his love in giving himself for him. Hence it is
 that, though he lives in the flesh, yet he does not live after the 
 flesh. Note, Those who have true faith live by that faith; and the 
 great thing which faith fastens upon is Christ's loving us and giving 
 himself for us. The great evidence of Christ's loving us is his giving 
 himself for us; and this is that which we are chiefly concerned to mix 
 faith with, in order to our living to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The apostle concludes this discourse with acquainting us 
 that by the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ, without the 
 works of the law (which he asserted, and others opposed), he avoided 
 two great difficulties, which the contrary opinion was loaded with:--

 1. <I>That he did not frustrate the grace of God,</I> which the
 doctrine of the justification by the works of the law did; for, as he 
 argues 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:6">Rom. xi. 6</A>),
 
 <I>If it be of works, it is no more of grace.</I>
 
 2. That he did not frustrate the death of Christ; whereas, <I>if 
 righteousness come by</I> the law, then it must follow <I>that Christ 
 has died in vain;</I> for, if we look for salvation by the law of 
 Moses, then we render the death of Christ needless: for to what purpose 
 should he be appointed to die, if we might have been saved without 
 it?</P>
