 Paul's epistles were directed to churches; now follow some to 
 particular persons: two to Timothy, one to Titus, and another to 
 Philemon--all three ministers. Timothy and Titus were evangelists, an 
 inferior order to the apostles, as appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>,

 <I>Some prophets, some apostles, some evangelists.</I> Their commission
 and work was much the same with that of the apostles, to plant 
 churches, and water the churches that were planted; and accordingly 
 they were itinerants, as we find Timothy was. Timothy was first 
 converted by Paul, and therefore he calls him his <I>own son in the 
 faith:</I> we read of his conversion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:3">Acts xvi. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these two epistles is to direct Timothy how to discharge 
 his duty as an evangelist at Ephesus, where he now was, and where Paul 
 ordered him for some time to reside, to perfect the good work which he 
 had begun there. As for the ordinary pastoral charge of that church, he
 had very solemnly committed it to the presbytery, as appears from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>,

 where he charges the presbyters <I>to feed the flock of God, which he 
 had purchased with his own blood.</I></P>
