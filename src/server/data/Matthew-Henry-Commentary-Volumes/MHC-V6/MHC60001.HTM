 The apostle describes the persons to whom he writes, and salutes them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 blesses God for their regeneration to a lively hope of eternal
 salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 in the hope of this salvation he shows they had great cause of
 rejoicing, though for a little while they were in heaviness and
 affliction, for the trial of their faith, which would produce joy
 unspeakable and full of glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 This is that salvation which the ancient prophets foretold and the
 angels desire to look into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 He exhorts them to sobriety and holiness, which he presses from the
 consideration of the blood of Jesus, the invaluable price of man's 
 redemption 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>),

 and to brotherly love, from the consideration of their regeneration,
 and the excellency of their spiritual state,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
 throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
 &nbsp; 2  Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
 through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
 sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
 peace, be multiplied.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this inscription we have three parts:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The author of it, described, 

 1. By his name--<I>Peter.</I> His first name was <I>Simon,</I> and
 Jesus Christ gave him the surname of <I>Peter,</I> which signifies <I>a 
 rock,</I> as a commendation of his faith, and to denote that he should 
 be an eminent pillar in the church of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Gal. ii. 9</A>.

 2. By his office--<I>an apostle of Jesus Christ.</I> The word signifies
 <I>one sent, a legate, a messenger,</I> any one sent in Christ's name 
 and about his work; but more strictly it signifies the highest office 
 in the Christian church. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:28">1 Cor. xii. 28</A>,

 <I>God hath set some in the church, first apostles.</I> Their dignity
 and pre-eminence lay in these things:--They were immediately chosen by 
 Christ himself,--they were first witnesses, then preachers, of the 
 resurrection of Christ, and so of the entire 
 gospel-dispensation,--their gifts were excellent and 
 extraordinary,--they had a power of working miracles, not at all times, 
 but when Christ pleased,--they were led into all truth, were endowed 
 with the spirit of prophecy, and they had an extent of power and 
 jurisdiction beyond all others; every apostle was a universal bishop in 
 all churches, and over all ministers. In this humble manner Peter, 

 (1.) Asserts his own character as an apostle. Hence learn, A man may 
 lawfully acknowledge, and sometimes is bound to assert, the gifts and 
 graces of God to him. To pretend to what we have not is hypocrisy; and 
 to deny what we have is ingratitude. 

 (2.) He mentions his apostolical function as his warrant and call to 
 write this epistle to these people. Note, It concerns all, but
 especially ministers, to consider well their warrant and call from God 
 to their work. This will justify them to others, and give them inward 
 support and comfort under all dangers and discouragements.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons to whom this epistle was addressed, and they are 
 described,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By their external condition--<I>Strangers dispersed throughout
 Pontus, Galatia,</I> &c. They were chiefly Jews, descended (as Dr. 
 Prideaux thinks) from those Jews who were translated from Babylon, by 
 order of Antiochus king of Syria, about two hundred years before the 
 coming of Christ, and placed in the cities of Asia Minor. It is very 
 likely that our apostle had been among them, and converted them, being 
 the apostle of the circumcision, and that he afterwards wrote this 
 epistle to them from Babylon, where multitudes of the Jewish nation 
 then resided. At present, their circumstances were poor and afflicted. 
 
 (1.) The best of God's servants may, through the hardships of times and 
 providences, be dispersed about, and forced to leave their native 
 countries. Those of whom the world was not worthy have been forced to 
 wander in mountains, in dens and caves of the earth. 

 (2.) We ought to have a special regard to the dispersed persecuted 
 servants of God. These were the objects of this apostle's particular
 care and compassion. We should proportion our regard to the excellency 
 and to the necessity of the saints. 

 (3.) The value of good people ought not to be estimated by their 
 present external condition. Here was a set of excellent people, beloved 
 of God, and yet strangers, dispersed and poor in the world; the eye of 
 God was upon them in all their dispersions, and the apostle was 
 tenderly careful to write to them for their direction and 
 consolation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are described by their spiritual condition: <I>Elect according 
 to the foreknowledge of God the Father,</I> &c. These poor strangers, 
 who were oppressed and despised in the world, were nevertheless in high 
 esteem with the great God, and in the most honourable state that any 
 person can be in during this life; for they were,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.</I> 
 Election is either to an office: so Saul was the man whom the Lord 
 chose to be king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:24">1 Sam. x. 24</A>),

 and our Lord says to his apostles, <I>Have not I chosen you twelve?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:70">John vi. 70</A>);

 or it is to a church-state, for the enjoyment of special privileges:
 thus Israel was God's elect 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:6">Deut. vii. 6</A>),

 <I>For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God; the Lord thy God
 hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people 
 that are upon the face of the earth;</I> or it is to eternal salvation: 
 <I>God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through 
 sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</I> This is the 
 election here spoken of, importing God's gracious decree or resolution 
 to save some, and bring them, through Christ, by proper means, to 
 eternal life.

 [1.] This election is said to be <I>according to the foreknowledge of 
 God.</I> Foreknowledge may be taken in two ways:--<I>First,</I> for 
 mere prescience, foresight, or understanding, that such a thing will 
 be, before it comes to pass. Thus a mathematician certainly foreknows 
 that at such a time there will be an eclipse. This sort of 
 foreknowledge is in God, who at one commanding view sees all things 
 that ever were, or are, or ever will be. But such a prescience is not 
 the cause why any thing is so or so, though in the event it certainly 
 will be so, as the mathematician who foresees an eclipse does not 
 thereby cause that eclipse to be. <I>Secondly,</I> Foreknowledge 
 sometimes signifies counsel, appointment, and approbation. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>,

 <I>Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
 God.</I> The death of Christ was not only foreseen, but fore-ordained, 
 as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Take it thus here; so the sense is, <I>elect according to the counsel, 
 ordination, and free grace of God.</I>

 [2.] It is added, according to the foreknowledge of <I>God the 
 Father.</I> By the Father we are here to understand the first person of 
 the blessed Trinity. There is an order among the three persons, though
 no superiority; they are equal in power and glory, and there is an 
 agreed economy in their works. Thus, in the affair of man's redemption, 
 election is by way of eminency ascribed to the Father, as 
 reconciliation is to the Son and sanctification to the Holy Ghost, 
 though in each of these one person is not so entirely interested as to 
 exclude the other two. Hereby the persons of the Trinity are more 
 clearly discovered to us, and we are taught what obligations we are 
 under to each of them distinctly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were elect <I>through sanctification of the Spirit, unto 
 obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</I> The end and 
 last result of election is eternal life and salvation; but, before this 
 can be accomplished, every elect person must be sanctified by the 
 Spirit, and justified by the blood of Jesus. God's decree for man's 
 salvation always operates through sanctification of the Spirit and 
 sprinkling of the blood of Jesus. By sanctification here understand, 
 not a federal sanctification only, but a real one, begun in 
 regeneration, whereby we are renewed after the image of God and made 
 new creatures, and carried on in the daily exercise of holiness, 
 mortifying our sins more and more, and living to God in all the duties 
 of a Christian life, which is here summed up in one word, 
 <I>obedience,</I> comprehending all the duties of Christianity. By 
 <I>the Spirit</I> some would have the apostle to mean the spirit of 
 man, the subject sanctified. The legal or typical sanctification 
 operated no further than the purifying of the flesh, but the Christian 
 dispensation takes effect upon the spirit of man, and purifies that. 
 Others, with better reason, think that by spirit is meant the Holy 
 Ghost, the author of sanctification. He renews the mind, mortifies our 
 sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:13">Rom. viii. 13</A>),

 and produces his excellent fruits in the hearts of Christians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:22,23">Gal. v. 22, 23</A>.

 This sanctification of the Spirit implies the use of means. <I>Sanctify 
 them through thy truth; thy word is truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John xvii. 17</A>.

 <I>Unto obedience.</I> This word, as it is pointed in our translation,
 is referred to what goes before it, and denotes the end of
 sanctification, which is, to bring rebellious sinners to obedience
 again, to universal obedience, to obey the truth and gospel of Christ:
 <I>You have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
 Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They were elected also to the <I>sprinkling of the blood of 
 Jesus.</I> They were designed by God's decree to be sanctified by the 
 Spirit, and to be purified by the merit and blood of Christ. Here is a 
 manifest allusion to the typical sprinklings of blood under the law, 
 which language these Jewish converts understood very well. The blood of 
 the sacrifices must not only be shed but sprinkled, to denote that the 
 benefits designed thereby are applied and imputed to the offerers. Thus 
 the blood of Christ, the grand and all-sufficient sacrifice, typified 
 by the legal sacrifices, was not only shed, but must be sprinkled and 
 communicated to every one of these elect Christians, <I>that through 
 faith in his blood they may obtain remission of sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25">Rom. iii. 25</A>.
 
 This blood of sprinkling justifies before God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:9">Rom. v. 9</A>),

 seals the covenant between God and us, of which the Lord's supper is a 
 sign

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:20">Luke xxii. 20</A>),
 
 cleanses from all sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1 John i. 7</A>),

 and admits us into heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19">Heb. x. 19</A>.

 Note,

 [1.] God hath elected some to eternal life, some, not all; persons, not
 qualification. 

 [2.] All that are chosen to eternal life as the end are chosen to 
 obedience as the way. 

 [3.] Unless a person be sanctified by the Spirit, and sprinkled with 
 the blood of Jesus, there will be no true obedience in the life. 

 [4.] There is a consent and co-operation of all the persons of the 
 Trinity in the affair of man's salvation, and their acts are 
 commensurate one to another: whoever the Father elects the Spirit 
 sanctifies unto obedience, and the Son redeems and sprinkles with his 
 blood. 

 [5.] The doctrine of the Trinity lies at the foundation of all revealed 
 religion. If you deny the proper deity of the Son and Holy Spirit, you 
 invalidate the redemption of the one and the gracious operations of the 
 other, and by this means destroy the foundation of your own safety and 
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The salutation follows: <I>Grace unto you, and peace be 
 multiplied.</I> The blessings desired for them are <I>grace and 
 peace.</I> 

 1. <I>Grace</I>--the free favour of God, with all its proper effects,
 pardoning, healing, assisting, and saving. 

 2. <I>Peace.</I> All sorts of peace may be here intended, domestic,
 civil, ecclesiastical peace in the church, and spiritual peace with 
 God, with the feeling of it in our own consciences. 

 3. Here is the request or prayer, in relations to these blessings--that
 they may be multiplied, which implies that they were already possessed 
 in some degree of these blessings, and he wishes them the continuation, 
 the increase, and the perfection of them. Learn,

 (1.) Those who possess spiritual blessings in their own souls earnestly 
 desire the communication of the same to others. The grace of God is a 
 generous, not a selfish principle. 

 (2.) The best blessings we can desire for ourselves, or one for 
 another, are grace and peace, with the multiplication of them; 
 therefore the apostles so often make this their prayer in the beginning 
 and end of their epistles. 

 (3.) Solid peace cannot be enjoyed where there is no true grace; first 
 grace, then peace. Peace without grace is mere stupidity; but grace may 
 be true where there is for a time no actual peace; as Heman was 
 distracted with terror, and Christ was once in an agony. 

 (4.) The increase of grace and peace, as well as the first gift of 
 them, is from God. Where he gives true grace he will give more grace; 
 and every good man earnestly desires the improvement and multiplication 
 of these blessings in himself and others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Blessed <I>be</I> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto
 a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
 &nbsp; 4  To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
 fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,
 &nbsp; 5  Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
 ready to be revealed in the last time.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We come now to the body of the epistle, which begins with,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A congratulation of the dignity and happiness of the state of these 
 believers, brought in under the form of a thanksgiving to God. Other 
 epistles begin in like manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:3,Eph+1:3">2 Cor. i. 3; Eph. i. 3</A>.
 
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty performed, which is blessing God. A man blesses God by a 
 just acknowledgment of his excellency and blessedness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The object of this blessing described by his relation to Jesus 
 Christ: <I>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> Here are 
 three names of one person, denoting his threefold office. 

 (1.) He is <I>Lord,</I> a universal king or sovereign.

 (2.) <I>Jesus,</I> a priest or Saviour. 

 (3.) <I>Christ,</I> a prophet, anointed with the Spirit and furnished 
 with all gifts necessary for the instruction, guidance, and salvation 
 of his church. This God, so blessed, is the God of Christ according to 
 his human nature, and his Father according to his divine nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reasons that oblige us to this duty of blessing God, which are 
 comprised in <I>his abundant mercy.</I> All our blessings are owing to 
 God's mercy, not to man's merit, particularly regeneration. He <I>hath 
 begotten us again,</I> and this deserves our thanksgiving to God, 
 especially if we consider the fruit it produces in us, which is that 
 excellent grace of hope, and that not such a vain, dead, perishing hope 
 as that of worldlings and hypocrites, but a lively hope, a living, 
 strong, quickening, and durable hope, as that hope must needs be that 
 has such a solid foundation as <I>the resurrection of Jesus Christ from 
 the dead.</I> Learn, 

 (1.) A good Christian's condition is never so bad but he has great 
 reason still to bless God. As a sinner has always reason to mourn, 
 notwithstanding his present prosperity, so good people, in the midst of 
 their manifold difficulties, have reason still to rejoice and bless 
 God. 

 (2.) In our prayers and praises we should address God as <I>the Father 
 of our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> it is only through him that we and our 
 services are accepted. 

 (3.) The best of men owe their best blessings to the abundant mercy of 
 God. All the evil in the world is from man's sin, but all the good in 
 it is from <I>God's mercy.</I> Regeneration is expressly ascribed to 
 the abundant mercy of God, and so are all the rest; we subsist entirely 
 upon divine mercy. Of the nature of regeneration, see on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:3">John iii. 3</A>.

 (4.) Regeneration produces a lively hope of eternal life. Every
 unconverted person is a hopeless creature; whatever he pretends to of 
 that kind is all confidence and presumption. The right Christian hope 
 is what a man is begotten again unto by the Spirit of God; it is not 
 from nature, but free grace. Those who are begotten to a new and 
 spiritual life are begotten to a new and spiritual hope. 

 (5.) The hope of a Christian has this excellency, it is a living hope. 
 The hope of eternal life in a true Christian is a hope that keeps him 
 alive, quickens him, supports him, and conducts him to heaven. Hope
 invigorates and spirits up the soul to action, to patience, to 
 fortitude, and perseverance to the end. The delusive hopes of the 
 unregenerate are vain and perishing; the hypocrite and his hope expire 
 and die both together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:8">Job xxvii. 8</A>.

 (6.) <I>The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</I> is the
 ground or foundation of a Christian's hope. The resurrection of Christ 
 is the act of the Father as a Judge, of the Son as a conqueror. His 
 resurrection demonstrates that the Father accepts his death in full 
 discharge for our ransom, that he is victorious over death, the grave, 
 and all our spiritual enemies; and it is also an assurance of our own 
 resurrection. There being an inseparable union between Christ and his 
 flock, they rise by virtue of his resurrection as a head, rather than 
 by virtue of his power as a Judge. <I>We have risen with Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1">Col. iii. 1</A>.

 From all this taken together, Christians have two firm and solid
 foundations whereon to build their hope of eternal life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having congratulated these people on their new birth, and the hope 
 of everlasting life, the apostle goes on to describe that life under 
 the notion of <I>an inheritance,</I> a most proper way of speaking to 
 these people; for they were poor and persecuted, perhaps turned out of 
 their inheritances to which they were born; to allay this grievance, he 
 tells them they were new-born to a new inheritance, infinitely better
 than what they had lost. Besides, they were most of them Jews, and so 
 had a great affection to the land of Canaan, as the land of their 
 inheritance, settled upon them by God himself; and to be driven out 
 from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord was looked upon as a sore 
 judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.

 To comfort them under this they are put in mind of a noble inheritance
 reserved in heaven for them, such a one that the land of Canaan was but 
 a mere shadow in comparison with it. Here note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Heaven is the undoubted inheritance of all the children of God; all 
 that are born again are born to an inheritance, as a man makes his 
 child his heir; the apostle argues, <I>If children, then heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>.

 God giveth his gifts unto all, but the inheritance to none but his
 children; those that are his sons and daughters by regeneration and 
 adoption receive the promise of eternal inheritance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:15">Heb. ix. 15</A>.
 
 This inheritance is not our purchase, but our Father's gift; not wages
 that we merit, but the effect of grace, which first makes us children 
 and then settles this inheritance upon us by a firm unalterable 
 covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The incomparable excellencies of this inheritance, which are 
 four:--

 (1.) It is incorruptible, in which respect it is like its Maker, who is
 called the <I>incorruptible God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23">Rom. i. 23</A>.

 All corruption is a change from better to worse, but heaven is without
 change and without end; the house is eternal in the heavens, and the 
 possessors must subsist for ever, <I>for their corruptible must put on 
 incorruption,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:53">1 Cor. xv. 53</A>.

 (2.) This inheritance is undefiled, like the great high priest that is
 now in possession of it, who is <I>holy, harmless, and undefiled,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:26">Heb. vii. 26</A>.

 Sin and misery, the two grand defilements that spoil this world, and
 mar its beauty, have no place there. 

 (3.) It fadeth not away, but always retains its vigour and beauty, and 
 remains immarcescible, ever entertaining and pleasing the saints who 
 possess it, without the least weariness or distaste. 

 (4.) "<I>Reserved in heaven for you,</I>" which expression teaches us,

 [1.] That it is a glorious inheritance, for it is in heaven, and all 
 that is there is glorious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:18">Eph. i. 18</A>.

 [2.] It is certain, a reversion in another world, safely kept and 
 preserved till we come to the possession of it. 

 [3.] The persons for whom it is reserved are described, not by their 
 names, but by their character: <I>for you,</I> or us, or every one that 
 is <I>begotten again to a lively hope.</I> This inheritance is 
 preserved for them, and none but them; all the rest will be shut out 
 for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This inheritance being described as future, and distant both in 
 time and place, the apostle supposes some doubt or uneasiness yet to 
 remain upon the minds of these people, whether they might not possibly 
 fall short by the way. "Though the happiness be safe in heaven, yet we 
 are still upon earth, liable to abundance of temptations, miseries, and 
 infirmities. Are we in such a safe state that we shall certainly come 
 thither?" To this he answers that they should be safely guarded and 
 conducted thither; they should be kept and preserved from all such 
 destructive temptations and injuries as would prevent their safe 
 arrival at eternal life. The heir to an earthly estate has no assurance 
 that he shall live to enjoy it, but the heirs of heaven shall certainly 
 be conducted safely to the possession of it. The blessing here promised 
 is preservation: You <I>are kept;</I> the author of it is <I>God;</I> 
 the means in us made use of for that end are our own <I>faith</I> and 
 care; the end to which we are preserved is <I>salvation;</I> and the 
 time when we shall see the safe end and issue of all is <I>the last 
 time.</I> Note, 

 1. Such is the tender care of God over his people that he not only
 gives them grace, but preserves them unto glory. Their being kept 
 implies both danger and deliverance; they may be attacked, but shall 
 not be overcome. 

 2. The preservation of the regenerate to eternal life is the effect of
 God's power. The greatness of the work, the number of enemies, and our 
 own infirmities, are such that no power but what is almighty can 
 preserve the soul through all unto salvation; therefore the scripture 
 often represents man's salvation as the effect of divine power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9,Ro+14:4">2 Cor. xii. 9; Rom. xiv. 4</A>.

 3. Preservation by God's power does not supersede man's endeavour and
 care for his own salvation; here are God's power and man's faith, which 
 implies an earnest desire of salvation, a reliance upon Christ 
 according to his invitations and promises, a vigilant care to do every 
 thing pleasing to God and avoid whatever is offensive, an abhorrence of 
 temptations, a <I>respect to the recompence of reward,</I> and 
 persevering diligence in prayer. By such a patient, operating, 
 conquering faith, we are kept under the assistance of divine grace, 
 unto salvation; faith is a sovereign preservative of the soul through a 
 state of grace unto a state of glory.

 4. This salvation is <I>ready to be revealed in the last time.</I> Here
 are three things asserted about the salvation of the saints:--

 (1.) That it is now prepared, and made ready, and reserved in heaven
 for them.

 (2.) Though it be made ready now, yet it is in a great measure hidden
 and unrevealed at present, not only to the ignorant, blind world, that 
 never enquire after it, but even to the heirs of salvation themselves.
 <I>It does not yet appear what we shall be,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>.

 (3.) That it shall be fully and completely <I>revealed in the last
 time,</I> or at the last day of judgment. <I>Life and immortality are 
 now brought to light by the gospel,</I> but this life will be revealed 
 more gloriously at death, when the soul shall be admitted into the 
 presence of Christ, and behold his glory; and even beyond this there 
 will be a further and a final revelation of the amplitude and 
 transcendency of the saints' felicity at the last day, when their 
 bodies shall be raised and re-united to their souls, and judgment shall 
 pass upon angels and men, and Christ shall publicly honour and applaud 
 his servants in the face of all the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first word, <I>wherein,</I> refers to the apostle's foregoing 
 discourse about the excellency of their present state, and their grand 
 expectations for the future. "In this condition <I>you greatly rejoice, 
 though now for a season,</I> or a little while, <I>if need be, you are 
 made sorrowful through manifold temptations,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle grants they were in great affliction, and propounds 
 several things in mitigation of their sorrows. 

 1. Every sound Christian has always something wherein he may greatly
 rejoice. Great rejoicing contains more than an inward placid serenity 
 of mind or sensation of comfort; it will show itself in the countenance 
 and conduct, but especially in praise and gratitude. 

 2. The chief joy of a good Christian arises from things spiritual and
 heavenly, from his relation to God and to heaven. In these every sound 
 Christian greatly rejoices; his joy arises from his treasure, which 
 consists of matters of great value, and the title to them is sure. 

 3. The best Christians, those who have reason greatly to rejoice, may
 yet be in great heaviness through manifold temptations. All sorts of 
 adversities are temptations, or trials of faith, patience, and 
 constancy. These seldom go singly, but are manifold, and come from 
 different quarters, the effect of all which is great heaviness. As men, 
 we are subject to sorrows, personal and domestic. As Christians, our 
 duty to God obliges us to frequent sorrow: and our compassion towards 
 the miserable, the dishonour done to God, the calamities of his church, 
 and the destruction of mankind, from their own folly and from divine 
 vengeance, raise, in a generous and pious mind, almost continual 
 sorrow. <I>I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:2">Rom. ix. 2</A>.

 4. The afflictions and sorrows of good people are but for a little
 while, they are but for a season; though they may be smart, they are 
 but short. Life itself is but for a little while, and the sorrows of it 
 cannot survive it; the shortness of any affliction does much abate the 
 heaviness of it. 

 5. Great heaviness is often necessary to a Christian's good: <I>If
 need be, you are in heaviness.</I> God does not afflict his people 
 willingly, but acts with judgment, in proportion to our needs. There is 
 a conveniency and fitness, nay, an absolute necessity in the case, for 
 so the expression signifies: <I>it must be;</I> therefore no man should 
 be <I>moved by these afflictions. For yourselves know that we are 
 appointed thereunto,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3">1 Thess. iii. 3</A>.

 These troubles, that lie heavy, never come upon us but when we have
 need, and never stay any longer than needs must.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He expresses the end of their afflictions and the ground of their 
 joy under them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The end of good people's afflictions is <I>the trial of their
 faith.</I> As to the nature of this trial, it is <I>much more precious 
 than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire.</I> The 
 effect of the trial is this, it will <I>be found unto praise, honour, 
 and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</I> Note, 

 1. The afflictions of serious Christians are designed for the trial of
 their faith. God's design in afflicting his people is their probation, 
 not their destruction; their advantage, not their ruin: a <I>trial,</I> 
 as the word signifies, is an experiment or search made upon a man, by 
 some affliction, to prove the value and strength of his faith. This 
 trial is made upon faith principally, rather than any other grace, 
 because the trial of this is, in effect, the trial of all that is good 
 in us. Our Christianity depends upon our faith; if this be wanting, 
 there is nothing else that is spiritually good in us. Christ prays for 
 this apostle, <I>that his faith might not fail;</I> if that be 
 supported, all the rest will stand firm; the faith of good people is 
 tried, that they themselves may have the comfort of it, God the glory 
 of it, and others the benefit of it. 

 2. A tried faith is much more precious than tried gold. Here is a
 double comparison of faith and gold, and the trial of the one with the 
 trial of the other. Gold is the most valuable, pure, useful, and 
 durable, of all the metals; so is faith among the Christian virtues; it 
 lasts till it brings the soul to heaven, and then it issues in the 
 glorious fruition of God for ever. The trial of faith is much more
 precious than the trial of gold; in both there is a purification, a 
 separation of the dross, and a discovery of the soundness and goodness 
 of the things. Gold does not increase and multiply by trial in the 
 fire, it rather grows less; but <I>faith</I> is established, improved, 
 and multiplied, by the oppositions and afflictions that it meets with. 
 <I>Gold</I> must perish at last--<I>gold that perisheth;</I> but 
 <I>faith</I> never will. <I>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>.

 The trial of faith will be found to praise, and honour, and glory.
 Honour is properly that esteem and value which one has with another,
 and so God and man will honour the saints. Praise is the expression or
 declaration of that esteem; so Christ will commend his people in the
 great day, <I>Come, you blessed of my Father,</I> &c. Glory is that
 lustre wherewith a person, so honoured and praised, shines in heaven.
 <I>Glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:10">Rom. ii. 10</A>.

 If a tried faith be found to praise, honour, and glory, let this
 recommend faith to you, as much more precious than gold, though it be 
 assaulted and tried by afflictions. If you make your estimate either 
 from present use or the final event of both, this will be found true, 
 however the world may take it for an incredible paradox. 

 4. Jesus Christ will appear again in glory, and, when he does so, the
 saints will appear with him, and their graces will appear illustrious; 
 and the more they have been tried the more bright they will then 
 appear. The trial will soon be over, but the glory, honour, and praise 
 will last to eternity. This should reconcile you to your present 
 afflictions: <I>they work for you a far more exceeding and eternal 
 weight of glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He particularly commends the faith of these primitive Christians 
 upon two accounts:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The excellency of its object, the unseen Jesus. The apostle had seen 
 our Lord in the flesh, but these dispersed Jews never did, and yet they 
 believed in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It is one thing to believe God, or Christ (so the devils believe), and 
 another thing to believe in him, which denotes subjection, reliance, 
 and expectation of all promised good from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. On account of two notable productions or effects of their faith, 
 <I>love</I> and <I>joy,</I> and this joy so great as to be above 
 description: <I>You rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of 
 glory.</I> Learn,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The faith of a Christian is properly conversant about things 
 revealed, but not seen. Sense converses with things sensible and 
 present; reason is a higher guide, which by sure deductions can infer 
 the operation of causes, and the certainty of events; but faith ascends 
 further still, and assures us of abundance of particulars that sense 
 and reason could never have found out, upon the credit of revelation; 
 it is <I>the evidence of things not seen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) True faith is never alone, but produces a strong love to Jesus 
 Christ. True Christians have a sincere love to Jesus, because they 
 believe in him. This love discovers itself in the highest esteem for 
 him, affectionate desires after him, willingness to be dissolved to be 
 with him, delightful thoughts, cheerful services and sufferings, 
 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Where there are true faith and love to Christ there is, or may be, 
 <I>joy unspeakable and full of glory.</I> This joy is inexpressible, it 
 cannot be described by words; the best discovery is by an experimental 
 taste of it; it is <I>full of glory,</I> full of heaven. There is much 
 of heaven and the future glory in the present joys of improved 
 Christians; their faith removes the causes of sorrow, and affords the 
 best reasons for joy. Though good people sometimes walk in darkness, it 
 is often owing to their own mistakes and ignorance, or to a fearful or 
 melancholy disposition, or to some late sinful conduct, or perhaps to 
 some sad occurrence of providence, that sinks their comfort for the 
 present, yet they have reason to rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the 
 God of their salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:18">Heb. iii. 18</A>.

 Well might these primitive Christians rejoice with the joy unspeakable,
 since they were every day <I>receiving the end of their faith, the
 salvation of their souls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note,

 [1.] The blessing they were receiving: <I>The salvation of their
 souls</I> (the more noble part being put for the whole man), which 
 salvation is here called <I>the end of their faith,</I> the end wherein 
 faith terminates: faith helps to save the soul, then it has done its 
 work, and ceases for ever. 

 [2.] He speaks of the present time: You are now actually <I>receiving 
 the end of your faith,</I> &c. 

 [3.] The word used alludes to the games at which the conqueror received 
 or bore away from the judge of the contest a crown or reward, which he 
 carried about in triumph; so the salvation of the soul was the prize 
 these Christians sought for, the crown they laboured for, the end they 
 aimed at, which came nearer and more within their reach every day.
 Learn, <I>First,</I> Every faithful Christian is daily receiving the 
 salvation of his soul; salvation is one permanent thing, begun in this 
 life, not interrupted by death, and continued to all eternity. These 
 believers had the beginnings of heaven in the possession of holiness 
 and a heavenly mind, in their duties and communion with God, in the 
 earnest of the inheritance, and the witness of the divine Spirit. This 
 was properly urged to these distressed people; they were on the losing 
 side in the world, but the apostle puts them in the mind of what they 
 were receiving; if they lost an inferior good, they were all the while 
 receiving the salvation of their souls. <I>Secondly,</I> It is lawful
 for a Christian to make the salvation of his soul his end; the glory of 
 God and our own felicity are so connected that if we regularly seek the 
 one we must attain the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
 diligently, who prophesied of the grace <I>that should come</I> unto
 you:
 &nbsp; 11  Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
 which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
 sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
 &nbsp; 12  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but
 unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
 you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy
 Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to
 look into.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having described the persons to whom he wrote, and declared 
 to them the excellent advantages they were under, goes on to show them 
 what warrant he had for what he had delivered; and because they were 
 Jews, and had a profound veneration for the Old Testament, he produces 
 the authority of the prophets to convince them that the doctrine of 
 salvation by faith in Jesus Christ was no new doctrine, but the same 
 which the old prophets did enquire and search diligently into.
 Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who made this diligent search--<I>the prophets,</I> who were persons
 inspired by God either to do or to say things extraordinary, above the 
 reach of their own studies and abilities, as foretelling things to 
 come, and revealing the will of God, by the direction of the Holy 
 Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The object of their search, which was <I>salvation,</I> and <I>the 
 grace of God which should come unto you;</I> the general salvation of 
 men of all nations by Jesus Christ, and more especially the salvation 
 afforded to the Jews, <I>the grace that should come to them</I> from 
 him who was <I>not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel.</I> They foresaw glorious times of light, grace, and comfort, 
 coming upon the church, which made the prophets and righteous men 
 desire to see and hear the things which came to pass in the days of the 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The manner of their enquiry: they <I>enquired and searched 
 diligently.</I> The words are strong and emphatic, alluding to miners, 
 who dig to the bottom, and break through not only the earth, but the 
 rock, to come to the ore; so these holy prophets had an earnest desire 
 to know, and were proportionably diligent in their enquiries after the 
 grace of God, which was to be revealed in the days of the Messiah: 
 their being inspired did not make their industrious search needless; 
 for, notwithstanding their extraordinary assistance from God, they were 
 obliged to make use of all the ordinary methods of improvement in 
 wisdom and knowledge. Daniel was a man greatly beloved and inspired, 
 yet he understood by books and study the computations of time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2"><I>ch.</I> ix. 2</A>.

 Even their own revelation required their study, meditation, and prayer;
 for many prophecies had a double meaning: in their first intention they 
 aimed at some person or event near at hand, but their ultimate design 
 was to describe the person, sufferings, or kingdom of Christ. Observe, 
 
 1. The doctrine of man's salvation by Jesus Christ has been the study
 and admiration of the greatest and wisest of men; the nobleness of the 
 subject, and their own concern in it, have engaged them, with most 
 accurate attention and seriousness to search into it. 

 2. A good man is much affected and pleased with the grace and mercy of
 God to others, as well as to himself. <I>The prophets</I> were highly 
 delighted with the prospects of mercy to be shown both to Jews and 
 Gentiles at the coming of Christ. 

 3. Those who would be acquainted with this great salvation, and the
 grace that shines therein, must enquire and search diligently into it: 
 if it was necessary for an inspired prophet to do so, much more for 
 persons so weak and injudicious as we are. 

 4. The grace that came by the gospel excels all that was before it; the
 gospel dispensation is more glorious, evident, intelligible, extensive, 
 and effectual, than any dispensation that ever did precede it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The particular matters which the ancient prophets chiefly searched 
 into, which are expressed in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Jesus Christ was the main subject of their studies; and, in relation to 
 him, they were most inquisitive into,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His humiliation and death, and the glorious consequences of it: 
 <I>The sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow.</I> 
 This enquiry would lead them into a view of the whole gospel, the sum 
 whereof is this, <I>that Christ Jesus was delivered for our offences 
 and raised again for our justification.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The time, and the manner of the times, wherein the Messiah was to 
 appear. Undoubtedly these holy prophets earnestly desired to see the 
 days of the Son of man; and therefore, next to the thing itself, their 
 minds were set upon the time of its accomplishment, so far as the 
 Spirit of Christ, which was in them, had signified any thing towards 
 that purpose. The nature of the times was also under their strict 
 consideration, whether they would be quiet or troublesome times, times 
 of peace or times of war. Learn,

 (1.) Jesus Christ had a being before his incarnation; for his Spirit 
 did then exist in the prophets, and therefore he whose that Spirit then 
 was must be in being also. 

 (2.) The doctrine of the Trinity was not wholly unknown to the faithful 
 in the Old Testament. The prophets knew that they were inspired by a 
 Spirit that was in them; this Spirit they knew to be the Spirit of 
 Christ, and consequently distinct from Christ himself: here is a 
 plurality of persons, and from other parts of the Old Testament a 
 Trinity may be collected. 

 (3.) The works here ascribed to the Holy Ghost prove him to be God. He 
 <I>did signify,</I> discover, and manifest to the prophets, many 
 hundred years <I>beforehand, the sufferings of Christ,</I> with a 
 multitude of particular circumstances attending them; and he did also 
 <I>testify,</I> or give proof and evidence beforehand, of the certainty 
 of that event, by inspiring the prophets to reveal it, to work miracles 
 in confirmation of it, and by enabling the faithful to believe it.
 These works prove the Spirit of Christ to be God, since he is possessed 
 of almighty power and infinite knowledge. 

 (4.) From the example of Christ Jesus learn to expect a time of 
 services and sufferings before you are received to glory. It was so 
 with him, and <I>the disciple is not above his Lord.</I> The suffering 
 time is but short, but the glory is everlasting; let the suffering 
 season be ever so sharp and severe, it shall not hinder, but <I>work 
 for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The success with which their enquiries were crowned. Their holy 
 endeavours to inform themselves were not slighted, for God gave them a 
 satisfactory revelation to quiet and comfort their minds. They were 
 informed that these things should not come to pass in their time, but 
 yet all was firm and certain, and should come to pass in the times of 
 the apostles: <I>Not unto themselves, but to us;</I> and we must report 
 them, under the infallible direction of the Holy Ghost, to all the 
 world. <I>Which things the angels,</I> &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 You have here three sorts of students, or enquirers into the great 
 affair of man's salvation by Jesus Christ:--

 1. <I>The prophets,</I> who <I>searched diligently</I> into it. 

 2. The apostles, who consulted all the prophecies, and were witnesses
 of the accomplishment of them, and so reported what they knew to others 
 in the preaching of the gospel. 

 3. The angels, who most attentively pry into these matters. Learn,

 (1.) A diligent endeavour after the knowledge of Christ and our duty
 will certainly be answered with good success. The prophets are answered 
 with a revelation. Daniel studies, and receives information: the 
 Bereans search the scriptures, and are confirmed. 

 (2.) The holiest and best of men sometimes have their lawful and pious 
 requests denied. It was both lawful and pious for these prophets to 
 desire to know more than they were permitted to know about the time of 
 the appearance of Christ in the world, but they were denied. It is 
 lawful and pious for good parents to pray for their wicked children, 
 for the poor to pray against poverty, for a good man to pray against 
 death; yet, in these honest requests, they often are denied. God is 
 pleased to answer our necessities rather than our requests. 

 (3.) It is the honour and practice of a Christian to be useful to 
 others, in many cases, rather than to himself. The prophets ministered 
 to others, not unto themselves. <I>None of us liveth to himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:7">Rom. xiv. 7</A>.

 Nothing is more contrary to man's nature nor to Christian principles 
 than for a man to make himself his own end, and live to himself.

 (4.) The revelations of God to his church, though gradual, and given by
 parcels, are all perfectly consistent; the doctrine of the prophets and 
 that of the apostles exactly agree, as coming from the same Spirit of 
 God. 

 (5.) The efficacy of the evangelical ministry depends upon the Holy 
 Ghost sent down from heaven. The gospel is the ministration of the
 Spirit; the success of it depends upon his operation and blessing.
 
 (6.) The mysteries of the gospel, and the methods of man's salvation, 
 are so glorious that the blessed angels earnestly desire to look into 
 them; they are curious, accurate, and industrious in prying into them; 
 they consider the whole scheme of man's redemption with deep attention 
 and admiration, particularly the points the apostle had been 
 discoursing of: <I>Which things the angels desire to</I> stoop down and 
 <I>look into,</I> as <I>the cherubim</I> did continually <I>towards the 
 mercy-seat.</I></P>

 he had before described, thereby instructing us that Christianity is a 
 doctrine according to godliness, designed to make us not only wiser,

 great work to do; as the traveller, the racer, the warrior, and the 
 labourer, gather in, and gird up, their long and loose garments, that 
 they may be more ready, prompt, and expeditious in their business, so 
 do you by your minds, your inner man, and affections seated there: 
 <I>gird them,</I> gather them in, let them not hang loose and neglected 
 about you; restrain their extravagances, and let the loins or strength 
 and vigour of your minds be exerted in your duty; disengage yourselves 
 from all that would hinder you, and go on resolutely in your obedience.
 <I>Be sober,</I> be vigilant against all your spiritual dangers and 
 enemies, and be temperate and modest in eating, drinking, apparel, 
 recreation, business, and in the whole of your behaviour. Be 
 sober-mined also in opinion, as well as in practice, and humble in your 
 judgment of yourselves." <I>And hope to the end, for the grace that is 
 to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</I> Some refer 
 this to the last judgment, as if the apostle directed their hope to the 
 final revelation of Jesus Christ; but it seems more natural to take it, 
 as it might be rendered, "<I>Hope perfectly,</I> or <I>thoroughly, for 
 the grace that is brought to you</I> in or by <I>the revelation of 
 Jesus Christ;</I> that is, by the gospel, <I>which brings life and 
 immortality to light.</I> Hope perfectly, trust without doubting to 
 that grace which is now offered to you by the gospel." Learn,

 (1.) The main work of a Christian lies in the right management of his 
 heart and mind; the apostle's first direction is to gird up the loins 
 of the mind. 

 (2.) The best Christians have need to be exhorted to sobriety. These
 excellent Christians are put in mind of it; it is required of a bishop 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:2">1 Tim. iii. 2</A>),
 
 of aged men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:2">Tit. ii. 2</A>),

 the young women are to be taught it, and the young men are directed to 
 be sober-minded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:4,6">Tit. ii. 4, 6</A>.

 (3.) A Christian's work is not over as soon as he has got into a state
 of grace; he must still hope and strive for more grace. When he has 
 entered the strait gate, he must still walk in the narrow way, and gird 
 up the loins of his mind for that purpose. 

 (4.) A strong and perfect trust in God's grace is very consistent with 
 our best endeavours in our duty; we must hope perfectly, and yet gird 
 up our loins, and address ourselves vigorously to the work we have to 
 do, encouraging ourselves from the grace of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>As obedient children,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 These words may be taken as a rule of holy living, which is both 
 positive--"You ought to live <I>as obedient children,</I> as those whom 
 God hath adopted into his family, and regenerated by his grace;" and 
 negative--"You must <I>not fashion yourselves according to the former 
 lusts, in your ignorance.</I>" Or the words may be taken as an argument 
 to press them to holiness from the consideration of what they now are, 
 children of obedience, and what they were when they lived in lust and 
 ignorance. Learn,

 (1.) The children of God ought to prove themselves to be such by their 
 obedience to God, by their present, constant, universal obedience. 

 (2.) The best of God's children have had their times of lust and 
 ignorance; the time has been when the whole scheme of their lives, 
 their way and fashion, was to accommodate and gratify their unlawful 
 desires and vicious appetites, being grossly ignorant of God and 
 themselves, of Christ and the gospel. 

 (3.) Persons, when converted, differ exceedingly from what they were 
 formerly. They are people of another fashion and manner from what they 
 were before; their inward frame, behaviour, speech, and conversation, 
 are much altered from what they were in times past. 

 (4.) The lusts and extravagances of sinners are both the fruits and the 
 signs of their ignorance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>But as he who hath called you,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Here is a noble rule enforced by strong arguments: <I>Be you holy in
 all manner of conversation.</I> Who is sufficient for this? And yet it 
 is required in strong terms, and enforced by three reasons, taken from 
 the grace of God in calling us,--from his command, <I>it is 
 written,</I>--and from his example. <I>Be you holy, for I am holy.</I> 
 Learn, 

 (1.) The grace of God in calling a sinner is a powerful engagement to 
 holiness. It is a great favour to be called effectually by divine grace 
 out of a state of sin and misery into the possession of all the 
 blessings of the new covenant; and great favours are strong 
 obligations; they enable as well as oblige to be holy. 

 (2.) Complete holiness is the desire and duty of every Christian. Here 
 is a two-fold rule of holiness:

 [1.] It must, for the extent of it, be universal. We must <I>be 
 holy,</I> and be so <I>in all manner of conversation;</I> in all civil 
 and religious affairs, in every condition, prosperous or reverse; 
 towards all people, friends and enemies; in all our intercourse and 
 business still we must be holy.

 [2.] For the pattern of it. We must <I>be holy, as God is holy:</I> we 
 must imitate him, though we can never equal him. He is perfectly, 
 unchangeably, and eternally holy; and we should aspire after such a 
 state. The consideration of the holiness of God should oblige as to the 
 highest degree of holiness we can attain unto. 

 (3.) The written word of God is the surest rule of a Christian's life, 
 and by this rule we are commanded to be holy every way. 

 (4.) The Old-Testament commands are to be studied and obeyed in the 
 times of the New Testament; the apostle, by virtue of a command 
 delivered several times by Moses, requires holiness in all 
 Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>If you call on the Father,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The apostle does not there express any doubt at all whether these 
 Christians would call upon their heavenly Father, but supposes they 
 would certainly do it, and from this argues with them to <I>pass the 
 time of their sojourning here in fear:</I> "If you own the great God as 
 a Father and a Judge, you ought to live the time of your sojourning
 here in his fear." Learn,

 (1.) All good Christians look upon themselves in this world as pilgrims
 and strangers, as strangers in a distant country, passing to another, 
 to which they properly belong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:12,Heb+11:13">Ps. xxxix. 12; Heb. xi. 13</A>.

 (2.) The whole time of our sojourning here is to be passed in the fear
 of God. 

 (3.) The consideration of God as a Judge is not improper for those who 
 can truly call him Father. Holy confidence in God as a Father, an awful 
 fear of him as a Judge, are very consistent; to regard God as a Judge 
 is a singular means to endear him to us as a Father.

 (4.) The judgment of God will be without respect of persons: 
 <I>According to every man's work.</I> No external relation to him will 
 protect any; the Jew may call God Father and Abraham father, but God 
 will not respect persons, nor favour their cause, from personal 
 considerations, but judge them according to their work. The works of 
 men will in the great day discover their persons; God will make all the 
 world to know who are his by their works. We are obliged to faith, 
 holiness, and obedience, and our works will be an evidence whether we 
 have complied with our obligations or not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The apostle having extorted them to <I>pass the time of their 
 sojourning in the fear of God</I> from this consideration, that they 
 <I>called on the Father,</I> he adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 a second argument: <I>Because</I> or <I>forasmuch as you were not 
 redeemed with corruptible things,</I> &c. Herein he puts them in mind, 
 
 (1.) That they were redeemed, or bought back again, by a ransom paid to 
 the Father.

 (2.) What the price paid for their redemption was: <I>Not with 
 corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of 
 Christ.</I> 

 (3.) From what they were redeemed: <I>From a vain conversation received 
 by tradition.</I> 

 (4.) They knew this: <I>Forasmuch as you know,</I> and cannot pretend 
 ignorance of this great affair. Learn,

 [1.] The consideration of our redemption ought to be a constant and 
 powerful inducement to holiness, and the fear of God.

 [2.] God expects that a Christian should live answerably to what he 
 knows, and therefore we have great need to be put in mind of what we 
 already know, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:4">Ps. xxxix. 4</A>.

 [3.] Neither silver nor gold, nor any of the corruptible things of this
 world, can redeem so much as one soul. They are often snares, 
 temptations, and hindrances to man's salvation, but they can by no 
 means purchase or procure it; they are corruptible, and therefore 
 cannot redeem an incorruptible and immortal soul. 

 [4.] The blood of Jesus Christ is the only price of man's redemption. 
 The redemption of man is real, not metaphorical. We are bought with a 
 price, and the price is equal to the purchase, for it is the precious 
 blood of Christ; it is the blood of an innocent person, a lamb without 
 blemish and without spot, whom the paschal lamb represented, and of an 
 infinite person, being the Son of God, and therefore it is called the 
 blood of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>.

 [5.] The design of Christ in shedding his most precious blood was to
 redeem us, not only from eternal misery hereafter, but from a vain 
 conversation in this world. That conversation is vain which is empty, 
 frivolous, trifling, and unserviceable to the honour of God, the credit 
 of religion, the conviction of unbelievers, and the comfort and 
 satisfaction of a man's own conscience. Not only the open wickedness, 
 but the vanity and unprofitableness of our conversation are highly 
 dangerous. 

 [6.] A man's conversation may carry an appearance of devotion, and may 
 plead antiquity, custom, and tradition, in its defence, and yet after 
 all be a most vain conversation. The Jews had a deal to say from these 
 heads, for all their formalities; and yet their conversation was so 
 vain that only the blood of Christ could redeem them from it. Antiquity 
 is no certain rule of verity, nor is it a wise resolution, "I will live 
 and die in such a way, because my forefathers did so."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Having mentioned the price of redemption, the apostle goes on to 
 speak of some things relating both to the Redeemer and the redeemed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The Redeemer is further described, not only as a Lamb without 
 spot, but as one, 

 [1.] That was <I>fore-ordained before the foundation of the world,</I> 
 fore-ordained or foreknown. When prescience is ascribed to God, it 
 implies more than bare prospect or speculation. It imports an act of 
 the will, a resolution that the thing shall be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 God did not only foreknow, but determine and decree, that his Son
 should die for man, and this decree was before the foundation of the 
 world. Time and the world began together; before the commencement of 
 time there was nothing but eternity.

 [2.] That was <I>manifested in these last days for them.</I> He was 
 manifested or demonstrated to be that Redeemer whom God had 
 fore-ordained. He was manifested by his birth, by his Father's 
 testimony, and by his own works, especially by his resurrection from
 the dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>.

 "This was done in these last times of the New Testament and of the 
 gospel, for you, you Jews, you sinners, you afflicted ones; you have 
 the comfort of the manifestation and appearance of Christ, if you 
 believe on him."

 [3.] That was raised from the dead by the Father, who gave him glory.
 The resurrection of Christ, considered as an act of power, is common to 
 all the three persons, but as an act of judgment it is peculiar to the 
 Father, who as a Judge released Christ, raised him from the grave, and 
 gave him glory, proclaimed him to all the world to be his Son by his 
 resurrection from the dead, advanced him to heaven, crowned him with 
 glory and honour, invested him with all power in heaven and earth, and 
 glorified him with that glory which he had with God before the world 
 was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The redeemed are also described here by their faith and hope, the 
 cause of which is Jesus Christ: "<I>You do by him believe in God</I>--by
 him as the author, encourager, support, and finisher of your faith; 
 your faith and hope now may be in God, as reconciled to you by Christ 
 the Mediator."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) From all this we learn, 

 [1.] The decree of God to send Christ to be a Mediator was from 
 everlasting, and was a just and merciful decree, which yet does not at 
 all excuse man's sin in crucifying him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 God had purposes of special favour towards his people long before he
 made any manifestations of such grace to them.

 [2.] Great is the happiness of the last times in comparison with what 
 the former ages of the world enjoyed. The clearness of light, the 
 supports of faith, the efficacy of ordinances, and the proportion of 
 comforts--these are all much greater since the manifestation of Christ 
 than they were before. Our gratitude and services should be suitable
 to such favours. 

 [3.] The redemption of Christ belongs to none but true believers. A 
 general impetration is asserted by some and denied by others, but none 
 pretend to a general application of Christ's death for the salvation of 
 all. Hypocrites and unbelievers will be ruined for ever,
 notwithstanding the death of Christ. 

 [4.] God in Christ is the ultimate object of a Christian's faith, which 
 is strongly supported by the resurrection of Christ, and the glory that 
 did follow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He exhorts them to brotherly love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He supposes that the gospel had already had such an effect upon them 
 as to purify their souls while they obeyed it through the Spirit, and 
 that it had produced at least an <I>unfeigned love of the brethren;</I> 
 and thence he argues with them to proceed to a higher degree of 
 affection, to love one another with a pure heart fervently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Learn, 

 (1.) It is not to be doubted but that every sincere Christian purifies 
 his soul. The apostle takes this for granted: <I>Seeing you have,</I> 
 &c. To purify the soul supposes some great uncleanness and defilement 
 which had polluted it, and that this defilement is removed. Neither
 the Levitical purifications under the law, nor the hypocritical 
 purifications of the outward man, can effect this. 

 (2.) The word of God is the great instrument of a sinner's 
 purification: <I>Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the 
 truth.</I> The gospel is called truth, in opposition to types and 
 shadows, to error and falsehood. This truth is effectual to purify the 
 soul, if it be obeyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John xvii. 17</A>.

 Many hear the truth, but are never purified by it, because they will 
 not submit to it nor obey it. 

 (3.) The Spirit of God is the great agent in the purification of man's 
 soul. The Spirit convinces the soul of its impurities, furnishes those 
 virtues and graces that both adorn and purify, such as faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9">Acts xv. 9</A>),
 
 hope

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:3">1 John iii. 3</A>),
 
 the fear of God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:9">Ps. xxxiv. 9</A>),

 and the love of Jesus Christ. The Spirit excites our endeavours, and
 makes them successful. The aid of the Spirit does not supersede our own 
 industry; these people purified their own souls, but it was through the 
 Spirit. 

 (4.) The souls of Christians must be purified before they can so much 
 as love one another unfeignedly. There are such lusts and partialities 
 in man's nature that without divine grace we can neither love God nor 
 one another as we ought to do; there is no charity but out of a pure 
 heart. 

 (5.) It is the duty of all Christians sincerely and fervently to love 
 one another. Our affection to one another must be sincere and real, and 
 it must be fervent, constant, and extensive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He further presses upon Christians the duty of loving one another 
 with a pure heart fervently from the consideration of their spiritual 
 relation; they are all <I>born again, not of corruptible seed, but 
 incorruptible,</I> &c. Hence we may learn, 

 (1.) That all Christians are born again. The apostle speaks of it as 
 what is common to all serious Christians, and by this they are brought 
 into a new and a near relation to one another, they become brethren by 
 their new birth. 

 (2.) The word of God is the great means of regeneration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:18">Jam. i. 18</A>.

 The grace of regeneration is conveyed by the gospel. 

 (3.) This new and second birth is much more desirable and excellent 
 than the first. This the apostle teaches by preferring the 
 incorruptible to the corruptible seed. By the one we become the 
 children of men, by the other the sons and daughters of the Most High.
 The word of God being compared to seed teaches us that though it is 
 little in appearance, yet it is wonderful in operation, though it lies 
 hid awhile, yet it grows up and produces excellent fruit at last. 

 (4.) Those that are regenerate should love one another with a pure 
 heart fervently. Brethren by nature are bound to love one another; but 
 the obligation is double where there is a spiritual relation: they are 
 under the same government, partake of the same privileges, and have 
 embarked in the same interest. 

 (5.) The word of God lives and abides for ever. This word is a living
 word, or a lively word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>.

 It is a means of spiritual life, to begin it and preserve in it, 
 animating and exciting us in our duty, till it brings us to eternal 
 life: and it is abiding; it remains eternally true, and abides in the 
 hearts of the regenerate for ever.</P>

 word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having given an account of the excellency of the renewed 
 spiritual man as born again, not of corruptible but incorruptible seed, 
 he now sets before us the vanity of the natural man, taking him with 
 all his ornaments and advantages about him: <I>For all flesh is as 
 grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass;</I> and nothing 
 can make him a solid substantial being, but the being born again of the 
 incorruptible seed, the word of God, which will transform him into a 
 most excellent creature, whose glory will not fade like a flower, but 
 shine like an angel; and this word is daily set before you in the 
 preaching of the gospel. Learn, 

 1. Man, in his utmost flourish and glory, is still a withering, fading,
 dying creature. Take him singly, all flesh is grass. In his entrance 
 into the world, in his life and in his fall, he is similar to grass,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:2,Isa+40:6,7">Job xiv. 2; Isa. xl. 6, 7</A>.

 Take him in all his glory, even this is as the flower of grass; his 
 wit, beauty, strength, vigour, wealth, honour--these are but as the 
 flower of grass, which soon withers and dies away. 

 2. The only way to render this perishing creature solid and 
 incorruptible is for him to entertain and receive the word of God; for 
 this remains everlasting truth, and, if received, will preserve him to 
 everlasting life, and abide with him for ever. 

 3. The prophets and apostles preached the same doctrine. This word
 which Isaiah and others delivered in the Old Testament is the same 
 which the apostles preached in the New.</P>
