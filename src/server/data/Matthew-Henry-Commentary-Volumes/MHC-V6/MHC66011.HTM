 In this chapter we have an account, 

 I. Of the measuring--reed given to the apostle, to take the dimensions
 of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Of the two witnesses of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:3-13">ver. 3-13</A>.

 III. Of the sounding of the seventh trumpet, and what followed upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:14-19">ver. 14</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
 stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the
 altar, and them that worship therein.
 &nbsp; 2  But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
 measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy
 city shall they tread under foot forty <I>and</I> two months.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prophetical passage about measuring the temple is a plain 
 reference to what we find in Ezekiel's vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+40:3">Ezek. xl. 3</A>,

 &c. But how to understand either the one or the other is not so easy.
 It should seem the design of measuring the temple in the former case 
 was in order to the rebuilding of it, and that with advantage; the 
 design of this measurement seems to be either, 

 1. For the preservation of it in those times of public danger and
 calamity that are here foretold; or, 

 2. For its trial; that it may be seen how far it agrees with the 
 standard, or pattern, in the mount; or,

 3. For its reformation; that what is redundant, deficient, or changed,
 may be regulated according to the true model. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How much was to be measured. 

 1. <I>The temple;</I> the gospel church in general, whether it be so 
 built, so constituted, as the gospel rule directs, whether it be too 
 narrow or too large, the door too wide or too strait. 

 2. <I>The altar.</I> That which was the place of the most solemn acts 
 of worship may be put for religious worship in general; whether the 
 church has the true altars, both as to substance and situation: as to 
 substance, whether they take Christ for their altar, and lay down all 
 their offerings there; and in situation, whether the altar be in the 
 holiest; that is, whether they worship God in the Spirit and in truth. 
 
 3. The worshippers too must be measured, whether they make God's glory
 their end and his word their rule, in all their acts of worship; and 
 whether they come to God with suitable affections, and whether their 
 <I>conversation be as becomes the gospel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was not to be measured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and why it should be left out.
 
 1. What was not to be measured: <I>The court which is without the 
 temple measure it not.</I> Some say that Herod, in the additions made 
 to the temple, built an outer court, and called it <I>the court of the 
 Gentiles.</I> Some tell us that Adrian built the city and an outer 
 court, and called it <I>&AElig;lia,</I> and gave it to the Gentiles. 

 2. Why was not the outer court measured? This was no part of the 
 temple, according to the model either of Solomon or Zerubbabel, and 
 therefore God would have no regard to it. He would not mark it out for 
 preservation; but as it was designed for the Gentiles, to bring pagan 
 ceremonies and customs and to annex them to the gospel churches, so 
 Christ abandoned it to them, to be used as they pleased; and both that 
 and the city were trodden under foot for a certain time--<I>forty and 
 two months,</I> which some would have to be the whole time of the reign 
 of antichrist. Those who worship in the outer court are either such as 
 worship in a false manner or with hypocritical hearts; and these are 
 rejected of God, and will be found among his enemies. 

 3. From the whole observe,

 (1.) God will have a temple and an altar in the world, till the end of 
 time. 

 (2.) He has a strict regard to this temple, and observes how every 
 thing is managed in it. 

 (3.) Those who worship in the outer court will be rejected, and only 
 those who worship within the veil accepted.

 (4.) The holy city, the visible church, is very much trampled upon in 
 the world. But, 

 (5.) The desolations of the church are for a limited time, and for a 
 short time, and she shall be delivered out of all her troubles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  And I will give <I>power</I> unto my two witnesses, and they shall
 prophesy a thousand two hundred <I>and</I> threescore days, clothed in
 sackcloth.
 &nbsp; 4  These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks
 standing before the God of the earth.
 &nbsp; 5  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
 mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt
 them, he must in this manner be killed.
 &nbsp; 6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days
 of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to
 blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they
 will.
 &nbsp; 7  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
 that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against
 them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
 &nbsp; 8  And their dead bodies <I>shall lie</I> in the street of the great
 city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our
 Lord was crucified.
 &nbsp; 9  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
 shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not
 suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
 &nbsp; 10  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,
 and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because
 these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
 &nbsp; 11  And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God
 entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear
 fell upon them which saw them.
 &nbsp; 12  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,
 Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and
 their enemies beheld them.
 &nbsp; 13  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the
 tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of
 men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave
 glory to the God of heaven.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this time of treading down, God has reserved to himself his faithful 
 witnesses, who will not fail to attest the truth of his word and 
 worship, and the excellency of his ways. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The number of these witnesses: it is but a small number and yet it 
 is sufficient. 

 1. It is but small. Many will own and acknowledge Christ in times of
 prosperity who will desert and deny him in times of persecution; one
 witness, when the cause is upon trial, is worth many at other times. 

 2. It is a sufficient number; for in the mouth of two witnesses every
 cause shall be established. Christ sent out his disciples two by two, 
 to preach the gospel. Some think these two witnesses are Enoch and 
 Elias, who are to return to the earth for a time: others, the church of 
 the believing Jews and that of the Gentiles: it should rather seem that 
 they are God's eminent faithful ministers, who shall not only continue 
 to profess the Christian religion, but to preach it, in the worst of 
 times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The time of their prophesying, or bearing their testimony for 
 Christ. <I>A thousand two hundred and threescore days;</I> that is (as 
 many think), to the period of the reign of antichrist; and, if the 
 beginning of that interval could be ascertained, this number of 
 prophetic days, taking a day for a year, would give us a prospect when 
 the end shall be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their habit, and posture: they prophesy in sackcloth, as those 
 that are deeply affected with the low and distressed state of the 
 churches and interest of Christ in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How they were supported and supplied during the discharge of their 
 great and hard work: they stood before the God of the whole earth, and 
 he gave them power to prophesy. He made them to be like Zerubbabel and 
 Joshua, the two olive-trees and candlestick in the vision of Zechariah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>,

 &c. God gave them the oil of holy zeal, and courage, and strength, and
 comfort; he made them olive-trees, and their lamps of profession were 
 kept burning by the oil of inward gracious principles, which they 
 received from God. They had oil not only in their lamps, but in their 
 vessels--habits of spiritual life, light, and zeal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Their security and defence during the time of their prophesying: 
 <I>If any attempted to hurt them, fire proceeded out of their mouths, 
 and devoured them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Some think this alludes to Elias's calling for the fire from heaven, to 
 consume the captains and their companies that came to seize him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:12">2 Kings i. 12</A>.
 
 God promised the prophet Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:14"><I>ch.</I> v. 14</A>),

 <I>Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people
 shall be wood, and it shall devour them.</I> By their praying and 
 preaching, and courage in suffering, they shall gall and wound the very 
 hearts and consciences of many of their persecutors, who shall go away 
 self-condemned, and be even terrors to themselves; like Pashur, at the 
 words of the prophet Jeremiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:4"><I>ch.</I> xx. 4</A>.

 They shall have that free access to God, and that interest in him,
 that, at their prayers, God will inflict plagues and judgments upon
 their enemies, as he did on Pharaoh, <I>turning their rivers into
 blood,</I> and restraining the dews of heaven, shutting heaven up, that
 no rain shall fall for many days, as he did at the prayers of Elias,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1">1 Kings xvii. 1</A>.

 God has ordained his arrows for the persecutors, and is often plaguing
 them while they are persecuting his people; they find it hard work to 
 <I>kick against the pricks.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The slaying of the witnesses. To make their testimony more strong, 
 they must seal it with their blood. Here observe, 

 1. The time when they should be killed: <I>When they have finished 
 their testimony.</I> They are immortal, they are invulnerable, till 
 their work be done. Some think it ought to be rendered, <I>when they 
 were about to finish their testimony.</I> When they had prophesied in 
 sackcloth the greatest part of the 1260 years, then they should feel 
 the last effect of antichristian malice.

 2. The enemy that should overcome and slay them--<I>the beast that
 ascendeth out of the bottomless pit.</I> Antichrist, the great 
 instrument of the devil, should make war against them, not only with 
 the arms of subtle and sophistical learning, but chiefly with open 
 force and violence; and God would permit his enemies to prevail against 
 his witnesses for a time.

 3. The barbarous usage of these slain witnesses; the malice of their
 enemies was not satiated with their blood and death, but pursued even 
 their dead bodies.

 (1.) They would not allow them a quiet grave; their bodies were cast 
 out in the open street, the high street of Babylon, or in the high road 
 leading to the city. This city is spiritually called Sodom for 
 monstrous wickedness, and Egypt for idolatry and tyranny; and here 
 Christ in his mystical body has suffered more than in any place in the 
 world. 

 (2.) Their dead bodies were insulted by the inhabitants of the earth, 
 and their death was a matter of mirth and joy to the antichristian 
 world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They were glad to be rid of these witnesses, who by their doctrine and 
 example had teased, terrified, and tormented the consciences of their 
 enemies; these spiritual weapons cut wicked men to the heart, and fill 
 them with the greatest rage and malice against the faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The resurrection of these witnesses, and the consequences thereof. 
 Observe, 

 1. The time of their rising again; after they had lain dead <I>three 
 days and a half</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 a short time in comparison of that in which they had prophesied. Here 
 may be a reference to the resurrection of Christ, who is <I>the 
 resurrection and the life. Thy dead men shall live, together with my 
 dead body shall they arise.</I> Or there may be a reference to the 
 resurrection of Lazarus on the fourth day, when they thought it 
 impossible. God's witnesses may be slain, but they shall rise again: 
 not in their persons, till the general resurrection, but in their 
 successors. God will revive his work, when it seems to be dead in the 
 world. 

 2. The power by which they were raised: <I>The spirit of life from God 
 entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.</I> God put not only 
 life, but courage into them. God can make the dry bones to life; it is 
 the Spirit of life from God that quickens dead souls, and shall quicken 
 the dead bodies of his people, and his dying interest in the world. 

 3. The effect of their resurrection upon their enemies: <I>Great fear
 fell upon them.</I> The reviving of God's work and witnesses will 
 strike terror into the souls of his enemies. Where there is guilt, 
 there is fear; and a persecuting spirit, though cruel, is not a 
 courageous, but a cowardly spirit. Herod feared John the Baptist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The ascension of the witnesses into heaven and the consequences 
 thereof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Their ascension. By heaven we may understand either some more 
 eminent station in the church, the kingdom of grace in this world, or a 
 high place in the kingdom of glory above. The former seems to be the
 meaning: <I>They ascended to heaven in a cloud</I> (in a figurative, 
 not in a literal sense) <I>and their enemies saw them.</I> It will be 
 no small part of the punishment of persecutors, both in this world and 
 at the great day, that they shall see the faithful servants of God 
 greatly honoured and advanced. To this honour they did not attempt to 
 ascend, till God called them, and said, <I>Come up hither.</I> The 
 Lord's witnesses must wait for their advancement, both in the church 
 and in heaven, till God calls them; they must not be weary of suffering 
 and service, nor too hastily grasp at the reward; but stay till their 
 Master calls them, and then they may gladly ascend to him. 

 2. The consequences of their ascension--a mighty shock and convulsion 
 in the antichristian empire and the fall of <I>a tenth part of the 
 city.</I> Some refer this to the beginning of the reformation from 
 popery, when many princes and states fell off from their subjection to 
 Rome. This great work met with great opposition; all the western world
 felt a great concussion, and the antichristian interest received a 
 great blow, and lost a great deal of ground and interest,

 (1.) By the sword of war, which was then drawn; and many of those who 
 fought under the banner of antichrist were slain by it. 

 (2.) By the sword of the Spirit: <I>The fear of God fell upon many.</I> 
 They were convinced of their errors, superstition, and idolatry; and by 
 true repentance, and embracing the truth, <I>they gave glory to the God 
 of heaven.</I> Thus, when God's work and witnesses revive, the devil's 
 work and witnesses fall before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  The second woe is past; <I>and,</I> behold, the third woe cometh
 quickly.
 &nbsp; 15  And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices
 in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become <I>the
 kingdoms</I> of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for
 ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 16  And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on
 their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
 &nbsp; 17  Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art,
 and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
 great power, and hast reigned.
 &nbsp; 18  And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
 time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
 shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the
 saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
 shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
 &nbsp; 19  And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was
 seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
 lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and
 great hail.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet, which is 
 ushered in by the usual warning and demand of attention: <I>The second 
 woe is past, and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. Then the 
 seventh angel sounded.</I> This had been suspended for some time, till 
 the apostle had been made acquainted with some intervening occurrences 
 of very great moment, and worthy of his notice and observation. But 
 what he before expected he now heard--the seventh angel sounding. Here
 observe the effects and consequences of this trumpet, thus sounded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here were loud and joyful acclamations of the saints and angels in 
 heaven. Observe, 

 1. The manner of their adorations: they rose from their seats, <I>and 
 fell upon their faces, and worshipped God;</I> they did it with 
 reverence and humility. 
 
 2. The matter of their adorations.

 (1.) They thankfully recognize the right of our God and Saviour to rule 
 and reign over all the world: <I>The kingdoms of this world have become 
 the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They were always so in title, both by creation and purchase.

 (2.) They thankfully observe his actual possession of them, and reign 
 over them; they give him thanks because he had taken to him his great 
 power, asserted his rights, exerted his power, and so turned title into 
 possession. 

 (3.) They rejoice that this his reign shall never end: <I>He shall 
 reign for ever and ever,</I> till all enemies be put under his feet; 
 none shall ever wrest the sceptre out of his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here were angry resentments in the world at these just appearances 
 and actings of the power of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The nations were angry;</I> not only had been so, but were so still: 
 their hearts rose up against God; they met his wrath with their own 
 anger. It was a time when God was taking a just revenge upon the 
 enemies of his people, recompensing tribulation to those who had 
 troubled them. It was a time in which he was beginning to reward his 
 people's faithful services and sufferings; and their enemies could not 
 bear it, they fretted against God, and so increased their guilt and 
 hastened their destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another consequence was the opening of the temple of God in 
 heaven. By this may be meant that here is now a more free communication 
 between heaven and earth, prayer and praises more freely and frequently 
 ascending and graces and blessings plentifully descending. But it 
 rather seems to intend the church of God on earth, a heavenly temple. 
 It is an allusion to the various circumstances of things in the time of 
 the first temple. Under idolatrous and wicked princes, it was shut up 
 and neglected; but, under religious and reforming princes, it was 
 opened and frequented. So, during the power of antichrist, the temple 
 of God seemed to be shut up, and was so in a great degree; but now it 
 was opened again. At this opening of it observe, 

 1. What was seen there: <I>the ark of God's testament.</I> This was in 
 the holy of holies; in this ark the tables of the law were kept. As 
 before Josiah's time the law of God had been lost, but was then found, 
 so in the reign of antichrist God's law was laid aside, and made void 
 by their traditions and decrees; the scriptures were locked up from the 
 people, and they must not look into these divine oracles; now they are 
 opened, now they are brought to the view of all. This was an 
 unspeakable and invaluable privilege; and this, like the ark of the 
 testament, was a token of the presence of God returned to his people, 
 and his favour towards them in Jesus Christ the propitiation. 

 2. What was heard and felt there: <I>Lightnings, voices, thunderings, 
 an earthquake, and great hail.</I> The great blessing of the 
 reformation was attended with very awful providences; and by terrible 
 things in righteousness God would answer those prayers that were 
 presented in his holy temple, now opened. All the great revolutions of 
 the world are concerted in heaven, and are the answers of the prayers 
 of the saints.</P>
