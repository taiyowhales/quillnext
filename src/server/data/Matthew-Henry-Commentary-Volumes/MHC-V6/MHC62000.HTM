 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOUGH</FONT>

 the continued tradition of the church attests that this epistle came 
 from John the apostle, yet we may observe some other evidence that will 
 confirm (or with some perhaps even outweigh) the certainty of that 
 tradition. It should seem that the penman was one of the apostolical 
 college by the sensible palpable assurance he had of the truth of the 
 Mediator's person in his human nature: <I>That which we have heard, 
 which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our 
 hands have handled, of the Word of life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Here he takes notice of the evidence the Lord gave to Thomas of his 
 resurrection, by calling him to feel the prints of the nails and of the 
 spear, which is recorded by John. And he must have been one of the 
 disciples present when the Lord came on the same day in which he arose 
 from the dead, and showed them his hands and his side,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:20">John xx. 20</A>.

 But, that we may be assured which apostle this was, there is scarcely a
 critic or competent judge of diction, or style of argument and spirit, 
 but will adjudge this epistle to the writer of that gospel that bears 
 the name of the apostle John. They wonderfully agree in the titles and 
 characters of the Redeemer: <I>The Word, the Life, the Light; his name
 was the Word of God.</I> Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1,5:7;Joh+1:1;Re+19:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 1 and v. 7
 with John i. 1 and Rev. xix. 13</A>.

 They agree in the commendation of God's love to us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1,4:9;Joh+3:16"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1
 and <I>ch.</I> iv. 9; John iii. 16</A>),

 and in speaking of our regeneration, or being born of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9,4:7,5:1;Joh+3:5,6"><I>ch.</I> iii. 9; iv. 7;
 and v. 1; John iii. 5, 6</A>.

 Lastly (to add no more instances, which may be easily seen in comparing
 this epistle with that gospel), they agree in the allusion to, or 
 application of, that passage in that gospel which relates (and which 
 alone relates) the issuing of water and blood out of the Redeemer's 
 opened side: <I>This is he that came by water and blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6"><I>ch.</I> v. 6</A>.

 Thus the epistle plainly appears to flow from the same pen as that
 gospel did. Now I know not that the text, or the intrinsic history of 
 any of the gospels, gives us such assurance of its writer or penman as 
 that ascribed to John plainly does. There (viz.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:24"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 24</A>)

 the sacred historian thus notifies himself: <I>This is the disciple
 that testifieth of these things and wrote these things; and we know
 that his testimony is true.</I> Now who is this disciple, but he
 concerning whom Peter asked, <I>What shall this man do?</I> And
 concerning whom the Lord answered, <I>If I will that he tarry till I
 come, what is that to thee?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>).

 And who

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+:21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 is described by these three characters:--

 1. <I>That he is the disciple whom Jesus loved,</I> the Lord's
 peculiar friend. 
 
 2. <I>That he also leaned on his breast at supper.</I>
 
 3. That he said unto him, <I>Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</I>
 As sure then as it is that that disciple was John, so sure may the 
 church be that that gospel and this epistle came from the beloved 
 John.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The epistle is styled <I>general,</I> as being not inscribed to any 
 particular church; it is, as a circular letter (or visitation charge), 
 sent to divers churches (some say of Parthia), in order to confirm them 
 in their stedfast adherence to the Lord Christ, and the sacred 
 doctrines concerning his person and office, against seducers; and to 
 instigate them to adorn that doctrine by love to God and man, and 
 particularly to each other, as being descended from God, united by the 
 same head, and travelling towards the same eternal life.</P>
