 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter our apostle gives Timothy many exhortations and 
 directions, which may be of great use to other, both ministers and 
 Christians, for whom they were designed as well as for him. 

 I. He encourages him in his work, showing him whence he must fetch help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He must take care of a succession in the ministry, that the office
 might not die with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">ver. 2</A>.

 III. He exhorts him to constancy and perseverance in this work, as a
 soldier and as a husbandman, considering what would be the end of all
 his sufferings, &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:3-15">ver. 3-15</A>.

 IV. He must shun profane and vain babblings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>),

 for they will be pernicious and mischievous.

 V. He speaks of the foundation of God, which standeth sure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.
 
 VI. What he is to avoid--youthful lusts, and foolish and unlearned
 questions; and what to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:22-26">ver. 22, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
 Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 2  And the things that thou hast heard of me among many
 witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be
 able to teach others also.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 4  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
 <I>this</I> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a
 soldier.
 &nbsp; 5  And if a man also strive for masteries, <I>yet</I> is he not
 crowned, except he strive lawfully.
 &nbsp; 6  The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
 fruits.
 &nbsp; 7  Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in
 all things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Paul encourages Timothy to constancy and perseverance in his work: 
 <I>Be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Observe, Those who have work to do for God must stir up themselves to 
 do it, and strengthen themselves for it. Being strong in the grace that 
 is in Christ Jesus may be understood in opposition to the weakness of 
 grace. Where there is the truth of grace there must be a labouring
 after the strength of grace. As our trials increase, we have need to 
 grow stronger and stronger in that which is good; our faith stronger, 
 our resolution stronger, our love to God and Christ stronger. Or it may 
 be understood in opposition to our being strong in our own strength: 
 "Be strong, not confiding in thy own sufficiency, but in the grace that 
 is in Jesus Christ." Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:10">Eph. vi. 10</A>,

 <I>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</I> When Peter
 promised rather to die for Christ than to deny him he was strong in his 
 own strength; had he been strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 
 he would have kept his standing better. Observe,

 1. There is grace in Christ Jesus; for the law was given by Moses, but
 grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:17">John i. 17</A>.

 There is grace enough in him for all of us. 

 2. We must be strong in this grace; not in ourselves, in our own
 strength, or in the grace we have already received, but in the grace 
 that is in him, and that is the way to be strong in grace. 

 3. As a father exhorts his son, so does Paul exhort Timothy, with great
 tenderness and affection: <I>Thou, therefore, my son, be strong,</I> 
 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Timothy must count upon sufferings, even unto blood, and therefore 
 he must train up others to succeed him in the ministry of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He must instruct others, and train them up for the ministry, and so 
 commit to them the things which he had heard; and he must also ordain 
 them to the ministry, lodge the gospel as a trust in their hands, and 
 so commit to them the things which he had heard. Two things he must 
 have an eye to in ordaining ministers:--Their fidelity or integrity 
 ("Commit them to <I>faithful men,</I> who will sincerely aim at the 
 glory of God, the honour of Christ, the welfare of souls, and the 
 advancement of the kingdom of the Redeemer among men"), and also their
 ministerial ability. They must not only be knowing themselves, but be 
 able to teach others also, and be apt to teach. Here we have,

 1. The things Timothy was to commit to others--what he had heard of
 the apostle among many witnesses; he must not deliver any thing 
 besides, and what Paul delivered to him and others he had received of 
 the Lord Jesus Christ. 

 2. He was to commit them as a trust, as a sacred deposit, which they
 were to keep, and to transmit pure and uncorrupt unto others. 

 3. Those to whom he was to commit these things must be faithful, that
 is, trusty men, and who were skilful to teach others. 

 4. Though men were both faithful and able to teach others, yet these
 things must be committed to them by Timothy, a minister, a man in 
 office; for none must intrude themselves into the ministry, but must 
 have these things committed to them by those already in that 
 office.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must <I>endure hardness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Thou therefore,</I> &c.
 
 1. All Christians, but especially ministers, <I>are soldiers of Jesus 
 Christ;</I> they fight under his banner, in his cause, and against his 
 enemies, for he is the captain of our salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 2. The soldiers of Jesus Christ must approve themselves good soldiers, 
 faithful to their captain, resolute in his cause, and must not give 
 over fighting till <I>they are made more than conquerors, through him 
 that loved them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:37">Rom. viii. 37</A>.

 3. Those who would approve themselves good soldiers of Jesus Christ
 must endure hardness; that is, we must expect it and count upon it in 
 this world, must endure and accustom ourselves to it, and bear it 
 patiently when it comes, and not be moved by it from our integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He must not entangle himself in the affairs of this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 A soldier, when he has enlisted, leaves his calling, and all the 
 business of it, that he may attend his captain's orders. If we have 
 given up ourselves to be Christ's soldiers, we must sit loose to this 
 world; and though there is no remedy, but we must employ ourselves in 
 the affairs of this life while we are here (we have something to do 
 here), we must not entangle ourselves with those affairs, so as by them 
 to be diverted and drawn aside from our duty to God and the great 
 concerns of our Christianity. Those who will war the good warfare must 
 sit loose to this world. <I>That we may please him who hath chosen us 
 to be soldiers.</I> Observe, 

 1. The great care of a soldier should be to please his general; so the
 great care of a Christian should be to please Christ, to approve 
 ourselves to him. The way to please him who hath chosen us to be 
 soldiers is not to entangle ourselves with the affairs of this life, 
 but to be free from such entanglements as would hinder us in our holy 
 warfare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He must see to it that in carrying on the spiritual warfare he went 
 by rule, that he observed the laws of war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>If a man strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he 
 strive lawfully.</I> We are striving for mastery, to get the mastery of 
 our lusts and corruptions, to excel in that which is good, but we 
 cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. In doing that which 
 is good we must take care that we do it in a right manner, that our 
 good may not be evil spoken of. Observe here, 

 1. A Christian is to strive for masteries; he must aim at mastering his
 own lusts and corruptions. 

 2. Yet he must strive according to the laws given to him; he must
 strive lawfully. 

 3. Those who do so shall be crowned at last, after a complete victory
 is obtained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He must be willing to wait for a recompence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the 
 fruits.</I> Or, as it should be read, <I>The husbandman labouring first 
 must partake of the fruits,</I> as appears by comparing it with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:7">Jam. v. 7</A>.

 If we would be partakers of the fruits, we must labour; if we would
 gain the prize, we must run the race. And, further, we must first 
 labour as the husbandman does, with diligence and patience, before we 
 are partakers of the fruit; we must do the will of God, before we 
 receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:36">Heb. x. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle further commends what he had said to the attention of 
 Timothy, and expresses his desire and hope respecting him: <I>Consider 
 what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Here, 

 1. Paul exhorts Timothy to consider those thing about which he 
 admonished him. Timothy must be reminded to use his considering 
 faculties about the things of God. Consideration is as necessary to a 
 good conversation as to a sound conversion. 

 2. He prays for him: <I>The Lord give thee understanding in all
 things.</I> Observe, It is God who gives understanding. The most 
 intelligent man needs more and more of this gift. If he who gave the 
 revelation in the word does not give the understanding in the heart, we 
 are nothing. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would 
 give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up 
 to consider what we say, for consideration is the way to understand, 
 remember, and practise, what we hear or read.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised
 from the dead according to my gospel:
 &nbsp; 9  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <I>even</I> unto bonds;
 but the word of God is not bound.
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that
 they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with
 eternal glory.
 &nbsp; 11  <I>It is</I> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <I>him,</I> we
 shall also live with <I>him:</I>
 &nbsp; 12  If we suffer, we shall also reign with <I>him:</I> if we deny
 <I>him,</I> he also will deny us:
 &nbsp; 13  If we believe not, <I>yet</I> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny
 himself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To encourage Timothy in suffering, the apostle puts him in mind of 
 the resurrection of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from 
 the dead, according to my gospel.</I> This is the great proof of his 
 divine mission, and therefore a great confirmation of the truth of the 
 Christian religion; and the consideration of it should make us faithful 
 to our Christian profession, and should particularly encourage us in 
 suffering for it. Let suffering saints remember this. Observe,

 1. We are to look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who, 
 for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the 
 shame, and has now sat down at the right hand of the throne of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 2. The incarnation and resurrection of Jesus Christ, heartily believed
 and rightly considered, will support a Christian under all sufferings 
 in the present life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another thing to encourage him in suffering was that he had Paul 
 for an example. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the apostle suffered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Wherein I suffer as an evil-doer;</I> and let not Timothy the son 
 expect any better treatment than Paul the father. Paul was a man who 
 did good, and yet suffered as an evil-doer: we must not think it 
 strange if those who do well fare ill in this world, and if the best of 
 men meet with the worst of treatment; but this was his comfort <I>that 
 the word of God was not bound.</I> Persecuting powers may silence 
 ministers and restrain them, but they cannot hinder the operation of 
 the word of God upon men's hearts and consciences; that cannot be bound 
 by any human force. This might encourage Timothy not to be afraid of 
 bonds for the testimony of Jesus; for the word of Christ, which ought 
 to be dearer to him than liberty, or life itself, should in the issue 
 suffer nothing by those bonds. Here we see, 

 (1.) The good apostle's treatment in the world: <I>I suffer 
 trouble;</I> to this he was called and appointed. 

 (2.) The pretence and colour under which he suffered: <I>I suffer as an 
 evil-doer;</I> so the Jews said to Pilate concerning Christ, <I>If he 
 were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:30">John xviii. 30</A>.

 (3.) The real and true cause of his suffering trouble as an evil-doer:
 <I>Wherein;</I> that is, in or for the sake of the gospel. The apostle
 suffered trouble unto bonds, and afterwards he resisted unto blood, 
 striving against sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:4">Heb. xii. 4</A>.

 Though the preachers of the word are often bound, yet the word is never
 bound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Why he suffered cheerfully: <I>I endure all things for the elects' 
 sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Good ministers may and should encourage themselves in the hardest 
 services and the hardest sufferings, with this, that God will certainly 
 bring good to his church, and benefit to his elect, out of 
 them.--<I>That they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ 
 Jesus.</I> Next to the salvation of our own souls we should be willing 
 to do and suffer any thing to promote the salvation of the souls of 
 others.

 (2.) The elect are designed to obtain salvation: <I>God hath not 
 appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:9">1 Thess. v. 9</A>.

 (3.) This salvation is in Christ Jesus, in him as the fountain, the
 purchaser, and the giver of it; and it is accompanied with eternal 
 glory: there is no salvation in Christ Jesus without it.

 (4.) The sufferings of our apostle were for the elects' sake, for their 
 confirmation and encouragement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another thing with which he encourages Timothy is the prospect of 
 a future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those who faithfully adhere to Christ and to his truths and ways, 
 whatever it cost them, will certainly have the advantage of it in 
 another world: <I>If we be dead with him, we shall live with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 <I>If we be dead with him, we shall live with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 If, in conformity to Christ, we be dead to this world, its pleasures, 
 profits, and honours, we shall go to live with him in a better world, 
 to be for ever with him. Nay, though we be called out to suffer for 
 him, we shall not lose by that. <I>Those who suffer for Christ</I> on 
 earth shall reign with Christ in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Those who suffered with David in his humiliation were preferred with 
 him in his exaltation: so it will be with those who suffer with the Son 
 of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is at our peril if we prove unfaithful to him: <I>If we deny him, 
 he also will deny us.</I> If we deny him before man, he will deny us 
 before his Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:33">Matt. x. 33</A>.

 And that man must needs be for ever miserable whom Christ disowns at
 last. This will certainly be the issue, whether we believe it or no 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny 
 himself.</I> He is faithful to his threatenings, faithful to his 
 promises; neither one nor the other shall fall to the ground, no, not 
 the least, jot nor tittle of them. If we be faithful to Christ, he will 
 certainly be faithful to us. If we be false to him, he will be faithful 
 to his threatenings: <I>he cannot deny himself,</I> cannot recede from 
 any word that he hath spoken, for he is yea, and amen, the faithful 
 witness. Observe, 

 (1.) Our being dead with Christ precedes our living with him, and is 
 connected with it: the one is in order to the other; so our suffering 
 for him is the way to reign with him. <I>You that have followed me in 
 the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his 
 glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve 
 tribes of Israel</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Matt. xix. 28</A>.
 
 (2.) This is a faithful saying, and may be depended on and ought to be 
 believed. But,

 (3.) If we deny him, out of fear, or shame, or for the sake of some
 temporal advantage, he will deny and disown us, and will not deny 
 himself, but will continue faithful to his word when he threatens as 
 well as when he promises.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Of these things put <I>them</I> in remembrance, charging <I>them</I>
 before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit,
 <I>but</I> to the subverting of the hearers.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having thus encouraged Timothy to suffer, he comes in the next place to 
 direct him in his work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He must make it his business to edify those who were under his 
 charge, <I>to put them in remembrance</I> of those things which they 
 did already know; for this is the work of ministers; not to tell people 
 that which they never knew before, but to put them in mind of that 
 which they do know, <I>charging them that they strive not about 
 words.</I> Observe, Those that are disposed to strive commonly strive 
 about matters of very small moment. Strifes of words are very 
 destructive to the things of God. That they strive not about words
 <I>to no profit.</I> If people did but consider of what little use most 
 of the controversies in religion are, they would not be so zealous in 
 their strifes of words, <I>to the subverting of the hearers,</I> to the 
 drawing of them away from the great things of God, and occasioning 
 unchristian heats and animosities, by which truth is often in danger of 
 being lost. Observe, People are very prone to strive about words, and 
 such strifes never answer any other ends than to shake some and subvert 
 others; they are not only useless, but they are very hurtful, and 
 therefore ministers are to charge the people that they do not strive 
 about words, and they are most likely to be regarded when they charge 
 them before the Lord, that is, in his name and from his word; when they 
 produce their warrant for what they say.--<I>Study to show thyself
 approved unto God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Observe, The care of ministers must be to approve themselves unto God, 
 to be accepted of him, and to show that they are so approved unto God. 
 In order thereunto, there must be constant care and industry: <I>Study 
 to show thyself</I> such a one, <I>a workman that needs not be 
 ashamed.</I> Ministers must be workmen; they have work to do, and they 
 must take pains in it. Workmen that are unskilful, or unfaithful, or
 lazy, have need to be ashamed; but those who mind their business, and 
 keep to their work, are workmen that need not be ashamed. And what is 
 their work? It is <I>rightly to divide the word of truth.</I> Not to 
 invent a new gospel, but rightly to divide the gospel that is committed 
 to their trust. To speak terror to those to whom terror belongs, 
 comfort to whom comfort; to give every one <I>his portion in due 
 season,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:45">Matt. xxiv. 45</A>.

 Observe here, 

 1. The word which ministers preach is the word of truth, for the author
 of it is the God of truth. 

 2. It requires great wisdom, study, and care, to divide this word of
 truth rightly; Timothy must study in order to do this well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He must take heed of that which would be a hindrance to him in his 
 work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He must take heed of error: <I>Shun profane and vain babblings.</I> The 
 heretics, who boasted of their notions and their arguments, thought 
 their performances such as might recommend them; but the apostle calls 
 them <I>profane and vain babblings:</I> when once men become fond of 
 those <I>they will increase unto more ungodliness.</I> The way of error 
 is down-hill; one absurdity being granted or contended for, a thousand 
 follow: <I>Their word will eat as doth a canker, or gangrene;</I> when 
 errors or heresies come into the church, the infecting of one often 
 proves the infecting of many, or the infecting of the same person with 
 one error often proves the infecting of him with many errors. Upon this 
 occasion the apostle mentions some who had lately advanced erroneous 
 doctrines: <I>Hymeneus and Philetus.</I> He names these corrupt 
 teachers, by which he sets a brand upon them, to their perpetual 
 infamy, and warns all people against hearkening to them. They have 
 <I>erred concerning the truth,</I> or concerning one of the fundamental 
 articles of the Christian religion, which is truth. The resurrection of 
 the dead is one of the great doctrines of Christ. Now see the subtlety 
 of the serpent and the serpent's seed. They did not deny the 
 resurrection (for that had been boldly and avowedly to confront the 
 word of Christ), but they put a corrupt interpretation upon that true 
 doctrine, saying that the resurrection was past already, that what 
 Christ spoke concerning the resurrection was <I>to be understood 
 mystically</I> and by way of allegory, that it must be meant of a 
 spiritual resurrection only. It is true, there is a spiritual 
 resurrection, but to infer thence that there will not be a true and 
 real resurrection of the body at the last day is to dash one truth of 
 Christ in pieces against another. By this they <I>overthrew the faith 
 of some,</I> took them off from the belief of the resurrection of the 
 dead; and if there be no resurrection of the dead, nor future state, no 
 recompence of our services and sufferings in another world, we are of 
 men the most miserable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:19">1 Cor. xv. 19</A>.

 Whatever takes away the doctrine of a future state overthrows the faith
 of Christians. The apostle had largely disproved this error 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1-58">1 Cor. xv.</A>),

 and therefore does not here enter into the arguments against it. 
 Observe, 

 1. The babblings Timothy was to shun were profane and vain; they were
 empty shadows, and led to profaneness: <I>For they will increase unto
 more ungodliness.</I> 

 2. Error is very productive, and on that account the more dangerous:
 it <I>will eat like a gangrene.</I>

 3. When men err concerning the truth, they always endeavour to have
 some plausible pretence for it. Hymeneus and Philetus did not deny a 
 resurrection, but pretended it was already past. 

 4. Error, especially that which affects the foundation, will overthrow
 the faith of some.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having
 this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one
 that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
 &nbsp; 20  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and
 of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and
 some to dishonour.
 &nbsp; 21  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a
 vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use,
 <I>and</I> prepared unto every good work.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see what we may comfort ourselves with, in reference to this, 
 and the little errors and heresies that both infect and infest the 
 church, and do mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It may be a great comfort to us that the unbelief of men cannot make 
 the promise of God of no effect. Though the faith of some particular 
 persons be overthrown, yet <I>the foundation of God standeth sure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 it is not possible that they should deceive the elect. Or it may be 
 meant of the truth itself, which they impugn. All the attacks which the 
 powers of darkness have made upon the doctrine of Christ cannot shake 
 it; it stands firm, and weathers all the storms which have been raised 
 against it. The prophets and apostles, that is, the doctrines of the 
 Old and New Testament, are still firm; and they have a seal with two 
 mottoes upon it, one on the one side, and the other on the other, as is 
 usual in a broad seal. 

 1. One expresses our comfort--that <I>the Lord knows those that are
 his,</I> and those that are not; knows them, that is, he owns them, so 
 knows them that he will never lose them. Though the faith of some be 
 overthrown, yet the Lord is said to know the ways of the righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">Ps. i. 6</A>.

 None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen.

 2. Another declares our duty--that every one who names the name of
 Christ must depart from iniquity. Those who would have the comfort of 
 the privilege must make conscience of the duty. If the name of Christ 
 be called upon us, we must depart from iniquity, else he will not own 
 us; he will say in the great day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:23">Matt. vii. 23</A>),

 <I>Depart from me, I never knew you, you workers of iniquity.</I>
 Observe, 

 (1.) Whatever errors are introduced into the church, the foundation of 
 God standeth sure, his purpose can never be defeated.

 (2.) God hath some in the church who are his and whom he knows to be
 his. 

 (3.) Professing Christians name the name of Christ, are called by his
 name, and therefore are bound to depart from iniquity; for Christ
 <I>gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:14">Tit. ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another thing that may comfort us is that though there are some 
 whose faith is overthrown, yet there are others who keep their 
 integrity, and hold it fast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold,</I> &c. The 
 church of Christ is a great house, a well-furnished house: now some of 
 the furniture of this house is of great value, as the plate in a house; 
 some of small value, and put to mean uses, as the vessels of wood and 
 earth; so it is in the church of God. There are some professors of 
 religion that are like the vessels of wood and earth, they are vessels 
 of dishonour. But at the same time all are not vessels of dishonour; 
 there are <I>vessels of gold and silver,</I> vessels of honour, <I>that 
 are sanctified and meet for the Master's use.</I> When we are 
 discouraged by the badness of some, we must encourage ourselves by the 
 consideration of the goodness of others. Now we should see to it that 
 we be vessels of honour: we must <I>purge ourselves from these corrupt 
 opinions,</I> that we may be sanctified for our Master's use. Observe, 
 
 1. In the church there are some vessels of honour and some of
 dishonour; there are some vessels of mercy and other vessels of wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:22,23">Rom. ix. 22, 23</A>.

 Some dishonour the church by their corrupt opinions and wicked lives;
 and others honour and credit it by their exemplary conversation.

 2. A man must purge himself from these before he can be a vessel of
 honour, or meet for his Master's use. 

 3. Every vessel must be fit for its Master's use; every one in the
 church whom God approves must be devoted to his Master's service and 
 meet for his use. 

 4. Sanctification in the heart is our preparation for every good work.
 The tree must be made good, and then the fruit will be good.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
 charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure
 heart.
 &nbsp; 23  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they
 do gender strifes.
 &nbsp; 24  And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
 unto all <I>men,</I> apt to teach, patient,
 &nbsp; 25  In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
 peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
 the truth;
 &nbsp; 26  And <I>that</I> they may recover themselves out of the snare of
 the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul here exhorts Timothy to beware of <I>youthful lusts,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Though he was a holy good man, very much mortified to the world, yet 
 Paul thought it necessary to caution him against youthful lusts: 
 "<I>Flee</I> them, take all possible care and pains to keep thyself 
 pure from them." The lusts of the flesh are youthful lusts, which young 
 people must carefully watch against, and the best must not be secure. 
 He prescribes an excellent remedy against youthful lusts: <I>Follow 
 righteousness, faith, charity peace,</I> &c. Observe, 

 1. Youthful lusts are very dangerous, for which reason even hopeful
 young people should be warned of them, for they war against the soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:11">1 Pet. ii. 11</A>.

 2. The exciting of our graces will be the extinguishing of our
 corruptions; the more we follow that which is good the faster and the 
 further we shall flee from that which is evil. Righteousness, and 
 faith, and love, will be excellent antidotes against youthful lusts.
 Holy love will cure impure lust.--<I>Follow peace with those that call 
 on the Lord.</I> The keeping up of the communion of saints will take us 
 off from all fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See the 
 character of Christians: they are such as <I>call on the Lord Jesus 
 Christ, out of a pure heart.</I> Observe, Christ is to be prayed to. It 
 is the character of all Christians that they call upon him; but our 
 prayers to God and Christ are not acceptable nor successful except they 
 come out of a pure heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cautions him against contention, and, to prevent this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 cautions him against <I>foolish and unlearned questions,</I> that tend 
 to no benefit, strifes of words. Those who advanced them, and doted 
 upon them, thought themselves wise and learned; but Paul calls them 
 foolish and unlearned. The mischief of these is that they <I>gender 
 strifes,</I> that they breed debates and quarrels among Christians and 
 ministers. It is very remarkable how often, and with what seriousness, 
 the apostle cautions Timothy against disputes in religion, which surely 
 was not without some such design as this, to show that religion 
 consists more in believing and practising what God requires than in 
 subtle disputes.--<I>The servant of the Lord must not strive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Nothing worse becomes the servant of the Lord Jesus, who himself did 
 not strive nor cry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:19">Matt. xii. 19</A>),

 but was a pattern of meekness, and mildness, and gentleness to all,
 than strife and contention. The servant of the Lord must be <I>gentle 
 to all men,</I> and thereby show that he is himself subject to the 
 commanding power of that holy religion which he is employed in 
 preaching and propagating.--<I>Apt to teach.</I> Those are unapt to 
 teach who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Ministers must 
 be patient, bearing with evil, and <I>in meekness instructing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 not only those who subject themselves, but those who oppose themselves. 
 Observe, 

 1. Those who oppose themselves to the truth are to be instructed; for 
 instruction is the scripture-method of dealing with the erroneous, 
 which is more likely to convince them of their errors than fire and 
 faggot: he does not bid us kill their bodies, under pretence of saving 
 their souls. 

 2. Such as oppose themselves are to be instructed in meekness, for our
 Lord is meek and lowly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>),

 and this agrees well with the character of the servant of the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He must not strive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, 
 patient.</I> This is the way to convey truth in its light and power, 
 and to overcome evil with good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:21">Rom. xii. 21</A>.

 3. That which ministers must have in their eyes, in instructing those
 who oppose themselves, must be their recovery: <I>If God, peradventure, 
 will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</I> 
 Observe, 
 
 (1.) Repentance is God's gift. 

 (2.) It is a gift with a <I>peradventure</I> in the case of those who 
 oppose themselves; and therefore, though we are not to despair of the 
 grace of God, yet we must take heed of presuming upon it. <I>To the 
 acknowledging of the truth.</I> 

 (3.) The same God who gives us the discovery of the truth does by his 
 grace bring us to the acknowledging of it, otherwise our hearts would 
 continue in rebellion against it, for we are to confess with our mouths 
 as well as to believe with our hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:9,10">Rom. x. 9, 10</A>.

 And thus sinners recover themselves out of the snare of the devil; see 
 here,

 [1.] The misery of sinners: they are in the <I>snare of the devil, and
 are led captive by him at his will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They are slaves to the worst of task-masters; he is the spirit that now 
 worketh in the children of disobedience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>.

 They are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the
 devil's; they are as fishes that are taken in n evil net, and as the
 birds that are caught in the snare. Further, They are under Ham's curse
 (<I>a servant of servants shall he be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25">Gen. ix. 25</A>),

 they are slaves to him who is but a slave and vassal. 

 [2.] The happiness of those who repent: they recover themselves out of 
 this snare, as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; the snare is 
 broken and they have escaped; and the greater the danger the greater 
 the deliverance. When sinners repent, those who before were led captive 
 by the devil at his will come to be led into the glorious liberty of 
 the children of God, and have their wills melted into the will of the 
 Lord Jesus. The good Lord recover us all out of the snare.</P>
