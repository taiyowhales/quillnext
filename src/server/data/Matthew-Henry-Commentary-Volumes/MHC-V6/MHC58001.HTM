 In this chapter we have a twofold comparison stated: 

 I. Between the evangelical and legal dispensation; and the excellency 
 of the gospel above that of the law is asserted and proved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Between the glory of Christ and that of the highest creatures, the
 angels; where the pre-eminence is justly given to the Lord Jesus 
 Christ, and clearly demonstrated to belong to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:4-14">ver. 4, to the end</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
 past unto the fathers by the prophets,
 &nbsp; 2  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by <I>his</I> Son, whom he
 hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
 worlds;
 &nbsp; 3  Who being the brightness of <I>his</I> glory, and the express
 image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
 power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
 right hand of the Majesty on high;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle begins with a general declaration of the excellency of 
 the gospel dispensation above that of the law, which he demonstrates 
 from the different way and manner of God's communicating himself and 
 his mind and will to men in the one and in the other: both these 
 dispensations were of God, and both of them very good, but there is a 
 great difference in the way of their coming from God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The way wherein God communicated himself and his will to men under 
 the Old Testament. We have here an account, 

 1. Of the persons by whom God delivered his mind under the Old
 Testament; they were <I>the prophets,</I> that is, persons chosen of 
 God, and qualified by him, for that office of revealing the will of God 
 to men. No man takes this honour to himself, unless called; and whoever 
 are called of God are qualified by him. 

 2. The persons to whom God spoke by the prophets: <I>To the
 fathers,</I> to all the Old-Testament saints who were under that 
 dispensation. God favoured and honoured them with much clearer light 
 than that of nature, under which the rest of the world were left.

 3. The order in which God spoke to men in those times that went before
 the gospel, those past times: he spoke to his ancient people <I>at
 sundry times and in divers manners.</I> 

 (1.) <I>At sundry times,</I> or <I>by several parts,</I> as the word 
 signifies, which may refer either to the several ages of the 
 Old-Testament dispensation--the patriarchal, the Mosaic, and the 
 prophetic; or to the several gradual openings of his mind concerning 
 the Redeemer: to Adam, that the Messiah should come of the seed of the 
 woman,--to Abraham, that he should spring from his loins,--to Jacob, 
 that he should be of the tribe of Judah,--to David, that he should be 
 of his house,--to Micah, that he should be born at Bethlehem,--to 
 Isaiah, that he should be born of a virgin. 

 (2.) <I>In divers manners,</I> according to the different ways in which 
 God though fit to communicate his mind to his prophets; sometimes by 
 the <I>illapses</I> of his Spirit, sometimes by <I>dreams,</I> 
 sometimes by visions, sometimes by an audible voice, sometimes by 
 legible characters under his own hand, as when he wrote the ten 
 commandments on tables of stone. Of some of these different ways God
 himself gave an account in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6-8">Num. xii. 6-8</A>,

 <I>If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known
 to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream. Not so with my 
 servant Moses: with him I will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, 
 and not in dark speeches.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's method of communicating his mind and will under the 
 New-Testament dispensation, these last days as they are called, that 
 is, either towards the end of the world, or the end of the Jewish 
 state. The times of the gospel are the last times, the gospel 
 revelation is the last we are to expect from God. There was first the 
 natural revelation; then the patriarchal, by dreams, visions, and 
 voices; then the Mosaic, in the law given forth and written down; then 
 the prophetic, in explaining the law, and giving clearer discoveries of 
 Christ: but now we must expect no new revelation, but only more of the 
 Spirit of Christ to help us better to understand what is already 
 revealed. Now the excellency of the gospel revelation above the former 
 consists in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is the final, the finishing revelation, given forth in the last 
 days of divine revelation, to which nothing is to be added, but the 
 canon of scripture is to be settled and sealed: so that now the minds 
 of men are no longer kept in suspense by the expectation of new 
 discoveries, but they rejoice in a complete revelation of the will of 
 God, both preceptive and providential, so far as is necessary for them 
 to know in order to their direction and comfort. For the gospel 
 includes a discovery of the great events that shall befal the church of 
 God to the end of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a revelation which God has made by his Son, the most excellent 
 messenger that was ever sent into the world, far superior to all the 
 ancient patriarchs and prophets, by whom God communicated his will to 
 his people in former times. And here we have an excellent account of 
 the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The glory of his office, and that in three respects:--

 [1.] God hath appointed him to be heir of all things. As God, he was 
 equal to the Father; but, as God-man and Mediator, he was appointed by 
 the Father to be the heir of all things, the sovereign Lord of all, the 
 absolute disposer, director, and governor of all persons and of all 
 things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,7">Ps. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 <I>All power in heaven and earth is given to him; all judgment is
 committed to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18;Joh+5:22">Matt. xxviii. 18; John v. 22</A>.

 [2.] By him God made the worlds, both visible and invisible, the
 heavens and the earth; not as an instrumental cause, but as his 
 essential word and wisdom. By him he made the old creation, by him he 
 makes the new creature, and by him he rules and governs both. 

 [3.] He upholds all things by the word of his power: he keeps the world 
 from dissolving. <I>By him all things consist.</I> The weight of the 
 whole creation is laid upon Christ: he supports the whole and all the 
 parts. When, upon the apostasy, the world was breaking to pieces under
 the wrath and curse of God, the Son of God, undertaking the work of 
 redemption, bound it up again, and established it by his almighty power 
 and goodness. None of the ancient prophets sustained such an office as 
 this, none was sufficient for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Hence the apostle passes to the glory of the person of Christ, who 
 was able to execute such an office: <I>He was the brightness of his 
 Father's glory, and the express image of his person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This is a high and lofty description of the glorious Redeemer, this is 
 an account of his personal excellency.

 [1.] He is, in person, the Son of God, the only-begotten Son of God, 
 and as such he must have the same nature. This personal distinction 
 always supposes one and the same nature. Every son of man is man; were 
 not the nature the same, the generation would be monstrous. 

 [2.] The person of the Son is the glory of the Father, shining forth 
 with a truly divine splendour. As the beams are effulgent emanations of 
 the sun, the father and fountain of light, Jesus Christ in his person 
 is God manifest in the flesh, he is light of light, the true Shechinah.
 
 [3.] The person of the Son is the true image and character of the 
 person of the Father; being of the same nature, he must bear the same 
 image and likeness. In beholding the power, wisdom, and goodness, of 
 the Lord Jesus Christ, we behold the power, wisdom, and goodness, of 
 the Father; for he hath the nature and perfections of God in him. <I>He 
 that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father;</I> that is, he hath seen 
 the same Being. He that hath known the Son hath known the Father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:7-9">John xiv. 7-9</A>.

 For the Son is in the Father, and the Father in the Son; the personal
 distinction is no other than will consist with essential union. This is 
 the glory of the person of Christ; the fulness of the Godhead dwells, 
 not typically, but really, in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) From the glory of the person of Christ he proceeds to mention the 
 glory of his grace; his condescension itself was truly glorious. The 
 sufferings of Christ had this great honour in them, to be a full 
 satisfaction for the sins of his people: <I>By himself he purged away 
 our sins,</I> that is, by the proper innate merit of his death and 
 bloodshed, by their infinite intrinsic value; as they were the 
 sufferings of himself, he has made atonement for sin. Himself, the 
 glory of his person and nature, gave to his sufferings such merit as 
 was a sufficient reparation of honour to God, who had suffered an 
 infinite injury and affront by the sins of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) From the glory of his sufferings we are at length led to consider 
 the glory of his exaltation: <I>When by himself he had purged away our 
 sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</I> at his 
 Father's right hand. As Mediator and Redeemer, he is invested with the 
 highest honour, authority, and activity, for the good of his people; 
 the Father now does all things by him, and receives all the services of 
 his people from him. Having assumed our nature, and suffered in it on 
 earth, he has taken it up with him to heaven, and there it has the high 
 honour to be next to God, and this was the reward of his 
 humiliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now it was by no less a person than this that God in these last days 
 spoke to men; and, since the dignity of the messenger gives authority 
 and excellency to the message, the dispensations of the gospel must 
 therefore exceed, very far exceed, the dispensation of the law.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
 inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

 Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a
 Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
 &nbsp; 6  And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the
 world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

 kingdom.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
 God, <I>even</I> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
 above thy fellows.
 &nbsp; 10  And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation
 of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
 &nbsp; 11  They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall
 wax old as doth a garment;
 &nbsp; 12  And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
 changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
 &nbsp; 13  But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
 right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
 &nbsp; 14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
 for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having proved the pre-eminence of the gospel above the law 
 from the pre-eminence of the Lord Jesus Christ above the prophets, now 
 proceeds to show that he is much superior not only to the prophets, but 
 to the angels themselves. In this he obviates an objection that the 
 Jewish zealots would be ready to make, that the law was not only 
 delivered by men, <I>but ordained by angels</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19">Gal. iii. 19</A>),

 who attended at the giving forth of the law, the hosts of heaven being 
 drawn forth to attend the Lord Jehovah on that awful occasion. Now the 
 angels are very glorious beings, far more glorious and excellent than 
 men; the scripture always represents them as the most excellent of all 
 creatures, and we know of no being but God himself that is higher than 
 the angels; and therefore that law that was ordained by angels ought to 
 be held in great esteem. To take off the force of this argument, the 
 penman of this epistle proceeds to state the comparison between Jesus 
 Christ and the holy angels, both in nature and office, and to prove 
 that Christ is vastly superior to the angels themselves: <I>Being made 
 so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a 
 more excellent name than they.</I> Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The superior nature of Christ is proved from his superior name. The 
 scripture does not give high and glorious titles without a real 
 foundation and reason in nature; nor would such great things have been 
 said of our Lord Jesus Christ if he had not been as great and excellent 
 as those words import. When it is said that Christ was made so much 
 better than the angels, we are not to imagine that he was a mere 
 creature, as the angels are; the word <B><I>genomenos,</I></B> when 
 joined with an adjective, is nowhere to be rendered <I>created,</I> and 
 here may very well be read, <I>being more excellent,</I> as the 
 <I>Syriac version</I> hath it. We read <B><I>ginesthe ho Theos 
 alethes</I></B>--<I>let God be true,</I> not made so, but acknowledged
 to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The superiority of the name and nature of Christ above the angels 
 is declared in the holy scriptures, and to be deduced thence. We should 
 have known little or nothing either of Christ or of the angels, without 
 the scriptures; and we must therefore be determined by them in our 
 conceptions of the one and the other. Now here are several passages of 
 scripture cited, in which those things are said of Christ that were 
 never said of the angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was said of Christ, <I>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten 
 thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>),

 which may refer to his eternal generation, or to his resurrection, or 
 to his solemn inauguration into his glorious kingdom at his ascension 
 and session at the right hand of the Father. Now this was never said
 concerning the angels, and therefore by inheritance he has a more 
 excellent nature and name than they.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was said concerning Christ, but never concerning the angels, <I>I 
 will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son;</I> taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2 Sam. vii. 14</A>.

 Not only, "I am his Father, and he is my Son, by nature and eternal
 promanation;" but, "I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son, by 
 wonderful conception, and this his son-ship shall be the fountain and 
 foundation of every gracious relation between me and fallen man."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is said of Christ, <I>When God bringeth his First-begotten into 
 the world, let all the angels of God worship him;</I> that is, when he 
 is brought into this lower world, at his nativity, let the angels 
 attend and honour him; or when he is brought into the world above, at 
 his ascension, to enter upon his mediatorial kingdom, or when he shall 
 bring him again into the world, to judge the world, then let the 
 highest creatures worship him. God will not suffer an angel to continue 
 in heaven who will not be in subjection to Christ, and pay adoration to 
 him; and he will at last make the fallen angels and wicked men to 
 confess his divine power and authority and to fall before him. Those 
 who would not have him to reign must then be brought forth and slain 
 before him. The proof of this is taken out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7">Ps. xcvii. 7</A>,

 <I>Worship him, all you gods,</I> that is, "All you that are superior
 to men, own yourselves to be inferior to Christ in nature and 
 power."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God has said concerning Christ, <I>Thy throne, O God, is forever and 
 ever,</I> &c., 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8-12"><I>v.</I> 8-12</A>.

 But of the angels he has only said that <I>he hath made them spirits,
 and his ministers a flame of fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Now, upon comparing what he here says of the angels with what he says 
 to Christ, the vast inferiority of the angels to Christ will plainly 
 appear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What does God say here of the angels? <I>He maketh his angels 
 spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</I> This we have in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4">Ps. civ. 4</A>,

 where it seems to be more immediately spoken of the winds and
 lightning, but is here applied to the angels, whose agency the divine
 Providences makes use of in the winds, and in thunder and lightnings.
 Observe,

 [1.] The office of the angels: they are God's ministers, or
 <I>servants, to do his pleasure.</I> It is the glory of God that he has 
 such servants; it is yet more so that he does not need them. 

 [2.] How the angels are qualified for this service; he makes them 
 spirits and a flame of fire, that is, he endows them with light and 
 zeal, with activity and ability, readiness and resolution to do his 
 pleasure: they are no more than what God has made them to be, and they 
 are servants to the Son as well as to the Father. But observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How much greater things are said of Christ by the Father. Here two 
 passages of scripture are quoted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] One of these is out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:6,7">Ps. xlv. 6, 7</A>,

 where God declares of Christ, <I>First,</I> His true and real divinity,
 and that with much pleasure and affection, not grudging him that glory: 
 <I>Thy throne, O God.</I> Here one person calls another person God, 
 <I>O God.</I> And, if God the Father declares him to be so, he must be 
 really and truly so; for God calls persons and things as they are. And 
 now let who will deny him to be essentially God at their peril, but let 
 us own and honour him as God; for, if he had not been God, he had never 
 been fit to have done the Mediator's work nor to have worn the 
 Mediator's crown. <I>Secondly,</I> God declares his dignity and
 dominion, as having a throne, a kingdom, and a sceptre of that kingdom. 
 He has all right, rule, authority, and power, both as the God of 
 nature, grace, and glory, and as Mediator; and so he is fully adequate 
 to all the intents and purposes of his mediatorial kingdom. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> God declares the eternal duration of the dominion and 
 dignity of Christ, founded upon the divinity of his person: <I>Thy 
 throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</I> from everlasting to 
 everlasting, through all the ages of time, maugre all the attempts of 
 earth and hell to undermine and overthrow it, and through all the 
 endless ages of eternity, when time shall be no more. This 
 distinguishes Christ's throne from all earthly thrones, which are 
 tottering, and will at length tumble down; but the throne of Christ 
 shall be as the days of heaven. <I>Fourthly,</I> God declares of Christ 
 the perfect equity of his administration, and of the execution of his 
 power, through all the parts of his government: <I>A sceptre of 
 righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He came righteously to the sceptre, and he uses it in perfect 
 righteousness; the righteousness of his government proceeds from the 
 righteousness of his person, from an essential eternal love of 
 righteousness and hatred of iniquity, not merely from considerations of 
 prudence or interest, but from an inward and immovable principle: 
 <I>Thou lovest righteousness and hatest iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Christ came to fulfil all righteousness, to bring in an everlasting 
 righteousness; and he was righteous in all his ways and holy in all his 
 works. He has recommended righteousness to men, and restored it among 
 them, as a most excellent and amiable thing. He came to finish 
 transgression, and to make an end of sin as a hateful as well as 
 hurtful thing. <I>Fifthly,</I> God declares of Christ how he was
 qualified for the office of Mediator, and how he was installed and 
 confirmed in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of 
 gladness above thy fellows.</I> 

 1. Christ has the name Messiah from his being anointed. God's anointing
 of Christ signifies both his qualifying him for the office of the 
 Mediator with the Holy Spirit and all his graces, and likewise his 
 inauguration of him into the office, as prophets, priests, and kings, 
 were by anointing. <I>God, even thy God,</I> imports the confirmation 
 of Christ in the office of Mediator by the covenant of redemption and 
 peace, that was between the Father and the Son. God is the God of 
 Christ, as Christ is man and Mediator.

 2. This anointing of Christ was <I>with the oil of gladness,</I> which
 signifies both the gladness and cheerfulness with which Christ
 undertook and went through the office of Mediator (finding himself so
 absolutely sufficient for it), and also that joy which was set before
 him as the reward of his service and sufferings, that crown of glory
 and gladness which he should wear for ever after the suffering of
 death.

 3. This anointing of Christ was above the anointing of his fellows:
 <I>God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above 
 thy fellows.</I> Who are Christ's fellows? Has he any equals? Not as 
 God, except the Father and Spirit, but these are not here meant. As 
 man, however, he has his fellows, and as an anointed person; but his 
 unction is beyond all theirs.

 (1.) Above the angels, who may be said to be his fellows, as they are 
 the sons of God by creation, and God's messengers, whom he employs in 
 his service. 

 (2.) Above all prophets, priests, and kings, that ever were anointed 
 with oil, to be employed in the service of God on earth.

 (3.) Above all the saints, who are his brethren, children of the same 
 father, as he was a partaker with them of flesh and blood. 

 (4.) Above all those who were related to him as man, above all the 
 house of David, all the tribe of Judah, all his brethren and kinsmen in 
 the flesh. All God's other anointed ones had only the Spirit in a 
 certain measure; Christ had the Spirit above measure, without any 
 limitation. None therefore goes through his work as Christ did, none 
 takes so much pleasure in it as Christ does; for he was anointed with 
 the oil of gladness above his fellows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The other passage of scripture in which is the superior excellence 
 of Christ to the angels is taken out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:25-27">Ps. cii. 25-27</A>,

 and is recited in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:10-12">
 <I>v.</I> 10-12</A>,

 where the omnipotence of the Lord Jesus Christ is declared as it
 appears both in creating the world and in changing it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> In creating the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>And thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the 
 earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</I> The Lord Christ 
 had the original right to govern the world, because he made the world 
 in the beginning. His right, as Mediator, was by commission from the 
 Father. His right, as God with the Father, was absolute, resulting from 
 his creating power. This power he had before the beginning of the
 world, and he exerted it in giving a beginning and being to the world. 
 He must therefore be no part of the world himself, for then he must 
 give himself a beginning. He was <B><I>pro panton</I></B>--<I>before
 all things,</I> and <I>by him all things consist,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:17">Col. i. 17</A>.

 He was not only above all things in condition, but before all things in
 existence; and therefore must be God, and self-existent. He laid the 
 foundations of the earth, did not only introduce new forms into 
 pre-existent matter, but made out of nothing the foundations of the 
 earth, the <I>primordia rerum--the first principles of things;</I> he 
 not only founded the earth, but the heavens too are the work of his 
 hands, both the habitation and the inhabitants, the hosts of heaven, 
 the angels themselves; and therefore he must needs be infinitely 
 superior to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> In changing the world that he has made; and here the 
 mutability of this world is brought in to illustrate the immutability 
 of Christ. Observe, 

 1. This world is mutable, all created nature is so; this world has
 passed through many changes, and shall pass through more; all these 
 changes are by the permission and under the direction of Christ, who 
 made the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>They shall perish, they shall all wax old as doth a garment; as a 
 vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed.</I> This 
 our visible world (both the earth and visible heavens) is growing old. 
 Not only men and beasts and trees grow old, but this world itself grows 
 old, and is hastening to its dissolution; it changes like a garment, 
 has lost much of its beauty and strength; it grew old betimes on the 
 first apostasy, and it has been waxing older and growing weaker ever 
 since; it bears the symptoms of a dying world. But then its dissolution 
 will not be its utter destruction, but its change. Christ will fold up 
 this world as a garment not to be abused any longer, not to be any 
 longer so used as it has been. Let us not then set our hearts upon that 
 which is not what we take it to be, and will not be what it now is. Sin 
 has made a great change in the world for the worse, and Christ will 
 make a great change in it for the better. <I>We look for new heavens 
 and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</I> Let the 
 consideration of this wean us from the present world, and make us 
 watchful, diligent, and desirous of that better world, and let us wait 
 on Christ to change us into a meetness for that new world that is 
 approaching; we cannot enter into it till we be new creatures. 

 2. Christ is immutable. Thus the Father testifies of him, <I>Thou
 remainest, thy years shall not fail.</I> Christ is the same in himself, 
 the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever, and the same to his 
 people in all the changes of time. This may well support all who have 
 an interest in Christ under all the changes they meet with in the 
 world, and under all they feel in themselves. Christ is immutable and
 immortal: his years shall not fail. This may comfort us under all 
 decays of nature that we may observe in ourselves or in our friends, 
 though our flesh and heart fail and our days are hastening to an end.
 Christ lives to take care of us while we live, and of ours when we are 
 gone, and this should quicken us all to make our interest in him clear 
 and sure, that our spiritual and eternal life may be hid with Christ in 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The superiority of Christ to the angels appears in this that God 
 never said to the angels what he has said to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What has God said to Christ? He has said, "<I>Sit thou at my right 
 hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 Receive thou glory, dominion, and rest; and remain in the
 administration of thy mediatorial kingdom until all thy enemies shall 
 either be made thy friends by conversion or thy footstool." Note,

 (1.) Christ Jesus has his enemies (would one think it?), enemies even
 among men--enemies to his sovereignty, to his cause, to his people; 
 such as will not have him to reign over them. Let us not think it 
 strange then if we have our enemies. Christ never did any thing to make 
 men his enemies; he has done a great deal to make them all his friends 
 and his Father's friends, and yet he has his enemies. 

 (2.) All the enemies of Christ shall be made his footstool, either by 
 humble submission and entire subjection to his will casting themselves 
 down at his feet, or by utter destruction; he shall trample upon those 
 who continue obstinate, and shall trample over them. 

 (3.) God the Father has undertaken for this, and he will see it done, 
 yea, he will himself do it; and, though it be not done presently, it 
 shall certainly be done, and Christ waits for it,; and so must 
 Christians wait till God has wrought all their works in them, for them, 
 and by them. 

 (4.) Christ shall go on to rule and reign till this be done; he shall 
 not leave any of his great designs unfinished, he shall go on 
 conquering and to conquer. And it becomes his people to go on in their 
 duty, being what he would have them to be, doing what he would have 
 them to do, avoiding what he would have them to avoid, bearing what he 
 would have them to bear, till he make them conquerors and more than 
 conquerors over all their spiritual enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What has God said to the angels? He never said to them, as he said 
 to Christ, <I>Sit you at my right hand;</I> but he has said of them 
 here that <I>they are ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for 
 those who shall be heirs of salvation.</I> Note, 

 (1.) What the angels are as to their nature: they are spirits, without 
 bodies or inclination to bodies, and yet they can assume bodies, and 
 appear in them, when God pleases. They are spirits, incorporeal, 
 intelligent, active, substances; they excel in wisdom and strength. 
 
 (2.) What the angels are as to their office: they are ministering 
 spirits. Christ, as Mediator, is the great minister of God in the great 
 work of redemption. The Holy Spirit is the great minister of God and 
 Christ in the application of this redemption. Angels are ministering 
 spirits under the blessed Trinity, to execute the divine will and 
 pleasure; they are the ministers of divine Providence. 

 (3.) The angels are sent forth for this end--to minister to those who 
 shall be the heirs of salvation. Here observe,

 [1.] The description given of the saints--they are <I>heirs of 
 salvation;</I> at present they are under age, heirs, not inheritors.
 They are heirs because they are children of God; <I>if children, then 
 heirs.</I> Let us make sure that we are children by adoption and 
 regeneration, having made a covenant-resignation of ourselves to God, 
 and walking before him in a gospel-conversation, and then we are heirs 
 of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. 

 [2.] The dignity and privilege of the saints--the angels are sent forth 
 to minister for them. Thus they have done in attending and acting at 
 the giving forth of the law, in fighting the battles of the saints, in 
 destroying their enemies. They still minister for them in opposing the 
 malice and power of evil spirits, in protecting and keeping their 
 bodies, pitching their tents about theirs, instructing, quickening, and 
 comforting their souls under Christ and the Holy Ghost; and thus they 
 shall do in gathering all the saints together at the last day. Bless 
 God for the ministration of angels, keep in God's way, and take the 
 comfort of this promise, that he will <I>give his angels charge over 
 you, to keep you in all your ways. They shall bear you up in their 
 hands, lest you dash your feet against a stone,</I>
