 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the apostle's preface to his whole epistle, in which we 
 may take notice,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the inscription, in which, according to the custom of writing
 letters then, the name of the person by whom it was written and the
 persons to whom it was written are both inserted. 

 1. It is an epistle from Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, to the
 church of Corinth, which he himself had planted, though there were some 
 among them that now questioned his apostleship

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1,2"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1, 2</A>),

 and vilified his person and ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:10">2 Cor. x. 10</A>.

 The most faithful and useful ministers are not secure from this
 contempt. He begins with challenging this character: <I>Paul, called to 
 be an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God.</I> He had not 
 taken this honour to himself, but had a divine commission for it. It 
 was proper at any time, but necessary at this time, to assert his 
 character, and magnify his office, when false teachers made a merit of 
 running him down, and their giddy and deluded followers were so apt to 
 set them up in competition with him. It was not pride in Paul, but 
 faithfulness to his trust, in this juncture, to maintain his 
 apostolical character and authority. And, to make this more fully
 appear, he joins Sosthenes with him in writing, who was a minister of a 
 lower rank. Paul, and Sosthenes his brother, not a fellow-apostle, but 
 a fellow-minister, once a ruler of the Jewish synagogue, afterwards a 
 convert to Christianity, a Corinthian by birth, as is most probable, 
 and dear to this people, for which reason Paul, to ingratiate himself 
 with them, joins them with himself in his first salutations. There is
 no reason to suppose he was made a partaker of the apostle's 
 inspiration, for which reasons he speaks, through the rest of the 
 epistle, in his own name, and in the singular number. Paul did not in 
 any case lessen his apostolical authority, and yet he was ready upon 
 all occasions to do a kind and condescending thing for their good to 
 whom he ministered. The persons to whom this epistle was directed were 
 <I>the church of God that was at Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, 
 and called to be saints.</I> All Christians are thus far sanctified in 
 Christ Jesus, that they are by baptism dedicated and devoted to him, 
 they are under strict obligations to be holy, and they make profession 
 of real sanctity. If they be not truly holy, it is their own fault and 
 reproach. Note, It is the design of Christianity to sanctify us in 
 Christ. <I>He gave himself for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and 
 purify us to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</I> In 
 conjunction with the church at Corinth, he directs the epistle <I>to 
 all that in every place call on the name of Christ Jesus our Lord, both 
 theirs and ours.</I> Hereby Christians are distinguished from the 
 profane and atheistical, that they dare not live without prayer; and 
 hereby they are distinguished from Jews and Pagans, that they call on 
 the name of Christ. He is their common head and Lord. Observe, In
 every place in the Christian world there are some that call on the name 
 of Christ. God hath a remnant in all places; and we should have a 
 common concern for and hold communion with all that call on Christ's 
 name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the apostolical benediction. <I>Grace be to you, and peace, from 
 God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> An apostle of the 
 prince of peace must be a messenger and minister of peace. This 
 blessing the gospel brings with it, and this blessing every preacher of 
 the gospel should heartily wish and pray may be the lot of all among 
 whom he ministers. Grace and peace--the favour of God, and
 reconciliation to him. It is indeed the summary of all blessings. 
 <I>The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace,</I> 
 was the form of benediction under the Old Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:26">Num. vi. 26</A>),

 but this advantage we have by the gospel, 

 1. That we are directed how to obtain that peace from God: it is in and
 by Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any good from him, 
 but through Christ. 

 2. We are told what must qualify us for this peace; namely, grace:
 first grace, then peace. God first reconciles sinners to himself, 
 before he bestows his peace upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the apostle's thanksgiving to God on their behalf. Paul begins 
 most of his epistles with thanksgiving to God for his friends and 
 prayer for them. Note, The best way of manifesting our affection to our 
 friends is by praying and giving thanks for them. It is one branch of 
 the communion of saints to give thanks to God mutually for our gifts, 
 graces, and comforts. He gives thanks, 

 1. For their conversion to the faith of Christ: <I>For the grace which
 was given you through Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He is the great procurer and disposer of the favours of God. Those who 
 are united to him by faith, and made to partake of his Spirit and 
 merits, are the objects of divine favour. God loves them, bears them 
 hearty good-will, and bestows on them his fatherly smiles and 
 blessings. 

 2. For the abundance of their spiritual gifts. This the church of
 Corinth was famous for. They did not come behind any of the churches in 
 any gift,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He specifies <I>utterance and knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Where God has given these two gifts, he has given great capacity for 
 usefulness. Many have the flower of utterance that have not the root of 
 knowledge, and their converse is barren. Many have the treasure of 
 knowledge, and want utterance to employ it for the good of others, and 
 then it is in a manner wrapped up in a napkin. But, where God gives 
 both, a man is qualified for eminent usefulness. When the church of 
 Corinth was enriched with all utterance and all knowledge, it was fit 
 that a large tribute of praise should be rendered to God, especially 
 when these gifts were a testimony to the truth of the Christian 
 doctrine, a confirmation of the testimony of Christ among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 They were <I>signs and wonders and gifts of the Holy Ghost,</I> by 
 which God did bear witness to the apostles, both to their mission and 
 doctrine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4">Heb. ii. 4</A>),

 so that the more plentifully they were poured forth on any church the 
 more full attestation was given to that doctrine which was delivered by 
 the apostles, the more confirming evidence they had of their divine 
 mission. And it is no wonder that when they had such a foundation for 
 their faith they should live in expectation of the coming of their Lord 
 Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is the character of Christians that they wait for Christ's second 
 coming; all our religion has regard to this: we believe it, and hope 
 for it, and it is the business of our lives to prepare for it, if we 
 are Christians indeed. And the more confirmed we are in the Christian 
 faith the more firm is our belief of our Lord's second coming, and the 
 more earnest our expectation of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Of the encouraging hopes the apostle had of them for the time to 
 come, founded on the power and love of Christ, and the faithfulness of 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 He who had begun a good work in them, and carried it on thus far, would 
 not leave it unfinished. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord
 Jesus Christ will be kept by him, and confirmed to the end; and those 
 that are so <I>will be blameless in the day of Christ:</I> not upon the 
 principle of strict justice, but gracious absolution; not in rigour of 
 law, but from rich and free grace. How desirable is it to be confirmed 
 and kept of Christ for such a purpose as this! How glorious are the 
 hopes of such a privilege, whether for ourselves or others! To be kept 
 by the power of Christ from the power of our own corruption and Satan's 
 temptation, that we may appear without blame in the great day! O 
 glorious expectation, especially when the faithfulness of God comes in 
 to support our hopes! He <I>who hath called us into the fellowship of 
 his Son is faithful, and will do it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:24">1 Thess. v. 24</A>.

 He who hath brought us into near and dear relation to Christ, into
 sweet and intimate communion with Christ, is faithful; he may be 
 trusted with our dearest concerns. Those that come at his call shall 
 never be disappointed in their hopes in him. If we approve ourselves 
 faithful to God, we shall never find him unfaithful to us. <I>He will
 not suffer his faithfulness to fail,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <I>that</I> there be no
 divisions among you; but <I>that</I> ye be perfectly joined together
 in the same mind and in the same judgment.
 &nbsp; 11  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by
 them <I>which are of the house</I> of Chloe, that there are
 contentions among you.
 &nbsp; 12  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul;
 and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
 baptized in the name of Paul?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle enters on his subject.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He extorts them to unity and brotherly love, and reproves them for 
 their divisions. He had received an account from some that wished them 
 well of some unhappy differences among them. It was neither ill-will to 
 the church, nor to their ministers, that prompted them to give this 
 account; but a kind and prudent concern to have these heats qualified 
 by Paul's interposition. He writes to them in a very engaging way: 
 "<I>I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> 
 if you have any regard to that dear and worthy name by which you are 
 called, be unanimous. <I>Speak all the same thing;</I> avoid 
 <I>divisions or schisms</I>" (as the original is), "that is, all 
 alienation of affection from each other. <I>Be perfectly joined 
 together in the same mind,</I> as far as you can. In the great things 
 of religion be of a mind: but, when there is not a unity of sentiment, 
 let there be a union of affections. The consideration of being agreed 
 in greater things should extinguish all feuds and divisions about minor 
 ones."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He hints at the origin of these contentions. Pride lay at the 
 bottom, and this made them factious. <I>Only of pride cometh 
 contention,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:10">Prov. xiii. 10</A>.

 They quarrelled about their ministers. Paul and Apollos were both
 faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy: 
 but those who were disposed to be contentious broke into parties, and 
 set their ministers at the head of their several factions: some cried 
 up Paul, perhaps as the most sublime and spiritual teacher; others 
 cried up Apollos, perhaps as the most eloquent speaker; some Cephas, or 
 Peter, perhaps for the authority of his age, or because he was the 
 apostle of the circumcision; and some were for none of them, but Christ 
 only. So liable are the best things in the world to be corrupted, and 
 the gospel and its institutions, which are at perfect harmony with 
 themselves and one another, to be made the engines of variance, 
 discord, and contention. This is no reproach to our religion, but a 
 very melancholy evidence of the corruption and depravity of human 
 nature. Note, How far will pride carry Christians in opposition to one 
 another! Even so far as to set Christ and his own apostles at variance, 
 and make them rivals and competitors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He expostulates with them upon their discord and quarrels: "<I>Is 
 Christ divided?</I> No, there is but one Christ, and therefore 
 Christians should be on one heart. <I>Was Paul crucified for you?</I> 
 Was he your sacrifice and atonement? Did I ever pretend to be your 
 saviour, or any more than his minister? Or, <I>were you baptized in the 
 name of Paul?</I> Were you devoted to my service, or engaged to be my 
 disciples, by that sacred rite? Did I challenge that right in you, or 
 dependence from you, which is the proper claim of your God and 
 Redeemer?" No; ministers, however instrumental they are of good to us, 
 are not to be put in Christ's stead. They are not to usurp Christ's 
 authority, nor encourage any thing in the people that looks like 
 transferring his authority to them. He is our Saviour and sacrifice, he 
 is our Lord and guide. And happy were it for the churches if there were 
 no name of distinction among them, as Christ is not divided.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and
 Gaius;
 &nbsp; 15  Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
 &nbsp; 16  And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I
 know not whether I baptized any other.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle gives an account of his ministry among them. He thanks 
 God he had baptized but a few among them, <I>Crispus,</I> who had been 
 a ruler of a synagogue at Corinth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:8">Acts xviii. 8</A>),

 <I>Gaius, and the household of Stephanas,</I> besides whom, he says, he 
 did not remember that he had baptized any. But how was this a proper 
 matter for thankfulness? Was it not a part of the apostolical 
 commission to baptize all nations? And could Paul give thanks to God 
 for his own neglect of duty? He is not to be understood in such a sense 
 as if he were thankful for not having baptized at all, but for not 
 having done it in present circumstances, lest it should have had this 
 very bad construction put upon it--that he had baptized in his own 
 name, made disciples for himself, or set himself up as the head of a 
 sect. He left it to other ministers to baptize, while he set himself to 
 more useful work, and filled up his time with preaching the gospel. 
 This, he thought, was more his business, because the more important 
 business of the two. He had assistants that could baptize, when none 
 could discharge the other part of his office so well as himself. In 
 this sense he says, <I>Christ sent him not to baptize, but to preach 
 the gospel</I>--not so much to baptize as to preach. Note, Ministers
 should consider themselves sent and set apart more especially to that 
 service in which Christ will be most honoured and the salvation of 
 souls promoted, and for which they are best fitted, though no part of 
 their duty is to be neglected. The principal business Paul did among
 them was to preach <I>the gospel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>the cross</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>Christ crucified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Ministers are the soldiers of Christ, and are to erect and display the 
 banner of the cross. He did not preach his own fancy, but the 
 gospel--the glad tidings of peace, and reconciliation to God, through 
 the mediation of a crucified Redeemer. This is the sum and substance
 of the gospel. Christ crucified is the foundation of all our joys. By
 his death we live. This is what Paul preached, what all ministers 
 should preach, and what all the saints live upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel:
 not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made
 of none effect.
 &nbsp; 18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
 foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
 &nbsp; 19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
 and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
 &nbsp; 20  Where <I>is</I> the wise? where <I>is</I> the scribe? where <I>is</I> the
 disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
 this world?
 &nbsp; 21  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew
 not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save
 them that believe.
 &nbsp; 22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after
 wisdom:
 &nbsp; 23  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
 stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
 &nbsp; 24  But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ
 the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
 &nbsp; 25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
 weakness of God is stronger than men.
 &nbsp; 26  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise
 men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <I>are
 called:</I>
 &nbsp; 27  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
 confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the
 world to confound the things which are mighty;
 &nbsp; 28  And base things of the world, and things which are despised,
 hath God chosen, <I>yea,</I> and things which are not, to bring to
 nought things that are:
 &nbsp; 29  That no flesh should glory in his presence.
 &nbsp; 30  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto
 us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
 &nbsp; 31  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
 glory in the Lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The manner in which Paul preached the gospel, and the cross of 
 Christ: <I>Not with the wisdom of words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>the enticing words of man's wisdom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:4"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4</A>),

 the flourish of oratory, or the accuracies of philosophical language,
 upon which the Greeks so much prided themselves, and which seem to have 
 been the peculiar recommendations of some of the heads of the faction 
 in this church that most opposed this apostle. He did not preach the 
 gospel in this manner, lest <I>the cross of Christ should be of no 
 effect,</I> lest the success should be ascribed to the force of art, 
 and not of truth; not to the plain doctrine of a crucified Jesus, but 
 to the powerful oratory of those who spread it, and hereby the honour 
 of the cross be diminished or eclipsed. Paul had been bred up himself 
 in Jewish learning at the feet of Gamaliel, but in preaching the cross 
 of Christ he laid his learning aside. He preached a crucified Jesus in 
 plain language, and told the people that that Jesus who was crucified 
 at Jerusalem was the Son of God and Saviour of men, and that all who 
 would be saved must repent of their sins, and believe in him, and 
 submit to his government and laws. This truth needed no artificial 
 dress; it shone out with the greatest majesty in its own light, and 
 prevailed in the world by its divine authority, and the demonstration 
 of the Spirit, without any human helps. The plain preaching of a 
 crucified Jesus was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy 
 of the heathen world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the different effects of this preaching: To those who 
 perish it is foolishness, <I>but to those who are saved it is the power 
 of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>It is to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness; 
 but unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power 
 of God and the wisdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 1. Christ crucified is a stumbling-block to the Jews. They could not 
 get over it. They had a conceit that their expected Messiah was to be a 
 great temporal prince, and therefore would never own one who made so 
 mean an appearance in life, and died so accursed a death, for their 
 deliverer and king. They despised him, and looked upon him as 
 execrable, because he was hanged on a tree, and because he did not 
 gratify them with a sign to their mind, though his divine power shone 
 out in innumerable miracles. The Jews require a sign,

 2. He was to the Greeks foolishness. They laughed at the story of a 
 crucified Saviour, and despised the apostles' way of telling it. They
 sought for wisdom. They were men of wit and reading, men that had 
 cultivated arts and sciences, and had, for some ages, been in a manner 
 the very mint of knowledge and learning. There was nothing in the plain 
 doctrine of the cross to suit their taste, nor humour their vanity, nor 
 gratify a curious and wrangling temper: they entertained it therefore 
 with scorn and contempt. What, hope to be saved by one that could not 
 save himself! And trust in one who was condemned and crucified as a
 malefactor, a man of mean birth and poor condition in life, and cut off 
 by so vile and opprobrious a death! This was what the pride of human 
 reason and learning could not relish. The Greeks thought it little 
 better than stupidity to receive such a doctrine, and pay this high 
 regard to such a person: and thus were they justly left to perish in 
 their pride and obstinacy. Note, It is just with God to leave those to 
 themselves who pour such proud contempt on divine wisdom and grace. 

 3. To those who are called and saved <I>he is the wisdom of God, and
 the power of God.</I> Those who are called and sanctified, who receive 
 the gospel, and are enlightened by the Spirit of God, discern more 
 glorious discoveries of God's wisdom and power in the doctrine of 
 Christ crucified than in all his other works. Note, Those who are saved 
 <I>are reconciled to the doctrine of the cross,</I> and led into an 
 experimental acquaintance with the mysteries of Christ crucified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the triumphs of the cross over human wisdom, 
 according to the ancient prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:14">Isa. xxix. 14</A>):

 <I>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the 
 understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?
 Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the 
 wisdom of this world?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>,

 All the valued learning of this world was confounded, baffled, and 
 eclipsed, by the Christian revelation and the glorious triumphs of the 
 cross. The heathen politicians and philosophers, the Jewish rabbis and 
 doctors, the curious searchers into the secrets of nature, were all 
 posed and put to a nonplus. This scheme lay out of the reach of the 
 deepest statesmen and philosophers, and the greatest pretenders to 
 learning both among the Jews and Greeks. When God would save the world, 
 he took a way by himself; and good reason, for <I>the world by wisdom 
 knew not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 All the boasted science of the heathen world did not, could not, 
 effectually bring home the world to God. In spite of all their wisdom, 
 ignorance still prevailed, iniquity still abounded. Men were puffed up 
 by their imaginary knowledge, and rather further alienated from God; 
 and therefore <I>it pleased him, by the foolishness of preaching, to 
 save those that believe.</I> By the <I>foolishness of 
 preaching</I>--not such in truth, but in vulgar reckoning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The thing preached was foolishness in the eyes of worldly-wise men. 
 Our living through one who died, our being blessed by one who was made 
 a curse, our being justified by one who was himself condemned, was all 
 folly and inconsistency to men blinded with self-conceit and wedded to 
 their own prejudices and the boasted discoveries of their reason and 
 philosophy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The manner of preaching the gospel was foolishness to them too. None 
 of the famous men for wisdom or eloquence were employed to plant the 
 church or propagate the gospel. A few fishermen were called out, and 
 sent upon this errand. These were commissioned to disciple the nations: 
 these vessels chosen to convey the treasure of saving knowledge to the 
 world. There was nothing in them that at first view looked grand or 
 august enough to come from God; and the proud pretenders to learning 
 and wisdom despised the doctrine for the sake of those who dispensed 
 it. And yet <I>the foolishness of God is wiser than men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Those methods of divine conduct that vain men are apt to censure as 
 unwise and weak have more true, solid, and successful wisdom in them, 
 than all the learning and wisdom that are among men: "<I>You see your 
 calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many 
 mighty, not many noble, are called,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 &c. You see the state of Christianity; not many men of learning, or
 authority, or honourable extraction, are called." There is a great deal 
 of meanness and weakness in the outward appearance of our religion. 
 For, 

 (1.) Few of distinguished character in any of these respects were 
 chosen for the work of the ministry. God did not choose philosophers,
 nor orators, nor statesmen, nor men of wealth and power and interest in 
 the world, to publish the gospel of grace and peace. Not the wise men 
 after the flesh, though men would apt to think that a reputation for 
 wisdom and learning might have contributed much to the success of the 
 gospel. Not the mighty and noble, however men might be apt to imagine 
 that secular pomp and power would make way for its reception in the 
 world. But God seeth not as man seeth. He hath chosen the foolish 
 things of the world, the weak things of the world, the base and 
 despicable things of the world, men of mean birth, of low rank, of no 
 liberal education, to be the preachers of the gospel and planters of 
 the church. <I>His thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as 
 our ways.</I> He is a better judge than we what instruments and 
 measures will best serve the purposes of his glory. 

 (2.) Few of distinguished rank and character were called to be 
 Christians. As the teachers were poor and mean, so generally were the 
 converts. Few of the wise, and mighty, and noble, embraced the doctrine 
 of the cross. The first Christians, both among Jews and Greeks, were 
 weak, and foolish, and base; men of mean furniture as to their mental 
 improvements, and very mean rank and condition as to their outward 
 estate; and yet what glorious discoveries are there of divine wisdom in 
 the whole scheme of the gospel, and in this particular circumstance of 
 its success!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We have an account how admirably all is fitted, 

 1. To beat down the pride and vanity of men. God hath chosen <I>the
 foolish things of the world to confound the wise</I>--men of no 
 learning to confound the most learned; <I>the weak things of the world 
 to confound the might</I>--men of mean rank and circumstances to 
 confound and prevail against all the power and authority of earthly 
 kings; <I>and base things, and things which are despised</I>--things 
 which men have in the lowest esteem, or in the utmost contempt, to pour 
 contempt and disgrace on all they value and have in veneration; <I>and 
 things which are not, to bring to nought (to abolish) things that 
 are</I>--the conversion of the Gentiles (of whom the Jews had the most 
 contemptuous and vilifying thoughts) was to open a way to the 
 abolishing of that constitution of which they were so fond, and upon 
 which they valued themselves so much as for the sake of it to despise 
 the rest of the world. It is common for the Jews to speak of the 
 Gentiles under this character, as <I>things that are not.</I> Thus, in 
 the apocryphal book of Esther, she is brought in praying that God would 
 not give his sceptre to those <I>who are not,</I>

 <U>Esth. xiv. 11</U>.

 Esdras, in one of the apocryphal books under his name, speaks to God
 <I>of the heathen as those who are reputed as nothing,</I> 
 
 <U>2 Esdras vi. 56, 57</U>.

 And the apostle Paul seems to have this common language of the Jews in
 his view when he calls Abraham the <I>father of us all before him whom 
 he believed, God, who calleth those things that are not as though they 
 were,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17">Rom. iv. 17</A>.

 The gospel is fitted to bring down the pride of both Jews and Greeks,
 to shame the boasted science and learning of the Greeks, and to take 
 down that constitution on which the Jews valued themselves and despised 
 all the world besides, <I>that no flesh should glory in his 
 presence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 that there might be no pretence for boasting. Divine wisdom alone had 
 the contrivance of the method of redemption; divine grace alone 
 revealed it, and made it known. It lay, in both respects, out of human 
 reach. And the doctrine and discovery prevailed, in spite of all the 
 opposition it met with from human art or authority: so effectually did 
 God veil the glory and disgrace the pride of man in all. The gospel 
 dispensation is a contrivance to humble man. But, 

 2. It is as admirably fitted to glorify God. There is a great deal of
 power and glory in the substance and life of Christianity. Though the 
 ministers were poor and unlearned, and the converts generally of the 
 meanest rank, yet the hand of the Lord went along with the preachers, 
 and was mighty in the hearts of the hearers; and Jesus Christ was made 
 both to ministers and Christians what was truly great and honourable. 
 All we have we have from God as the fountain, and in and through Christ 
 as the channel of conveyance. He is made of God to us <I>wisdom, 
 righteousness, sanctification, and redemption</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 all we need, or can desire. We are foolishness, ignorant and blind in
 the things of God, with all our boasted knowledge; and he is made 
 wisdom to us. We are guilty, obnoxious to justice; and he is made 
 righteousness, our great atonement and sacrifice. We are depraved and 
 corrupt; and he is made sanctification, the spring of our spiritual 
 life; from him, the head, it is communicated to all the members of his 
 mystical body by his Holy Spirit. We are in bonds, and he is made 
 redemption to us, our Saviour and deliverer. Observe, Where Christ is 
 made righteousness to any soul, he is also made sanctification. He 
 never discharges from the guilt of sin, without delivering from the 
 power of it; and he is made righteousness and sanctification, that he 
 may in the end be made complete redemption, may free the soul from the 
 very being of sin, and loose the body from the bonds of the grave: and 
 what is designed in all is <I>that all flesh may glory in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Observe, It is the will of God that all our glorifying should be in the 
 Lord: and, our salvation being only through Christ, it is thereby 
 effectually provided that it should be so. Man is humbled, and God 
 glorified and exalted, by the whole scheme.</P>
