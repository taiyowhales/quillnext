 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy <I>our</I> brother,
 unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
 &nbsp; 2  And to <I>our</I> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
 and to the church in thy house:
 &nbsp; 3  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
 Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 4  I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
 &nbsp; 5  Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the
 Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
 &nbsp; 6  That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
 the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ
 Jesus.
 &nbsp; 7  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because
 the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

 I. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:1,2">first two verses</A>

 of the preface we have the persons from and to whom it is written, with
 some annexed note or title, implying somewhat of argument to the 
 purpose of the letter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons writing: Paul, the principal, who calls himself <I>a 
 prisoner of Jesus Christ,</I> that is, for Jesus Christ. To be a 
 prisoner simply is no comfort nor honour; but such as Paul was, <I>for 
 the faith and preaching of the gospel,</I> this was true glory, and 
 proper to move Philemon upon the request made to him by such a one. A 
 petition from one suffering for Christ and his gospel would surely be 
 tenderly regarded by a believer and minister of Christ, especially when 
 strengthened too with the concurrence of Timothy, one eminent in the 
 church, sometimes called by Paul <I>his son in the faith,</I> but now, 
 it is likely, grown more in years, he styles him <I>his brother.</I> 
 What could be denied to two such petitioners? Paul is not slight in 
 serving a poor convert; he gets all the additional help he can in 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The persons written to are <I>Philemon and Apphia,</I> and with them 
 Archippus, and the church in Philemon's house. Philemon, the master of
 Onesimus, was the principal, to whom the letter is inscribed, the head 
 of the family, in whom were the authority and power of taking in or 
 shutting out, and whose property Onesimus was: with him therefore 
 chiefly lay the business. <I>To Philemon our dearly beloved, and 
 fellow-labourer;</I> a good man he was, and probably a minister, and on 
 both accounts dearly beloved by Paul. <I>A lover of good men</I> is one 
 property of a good minister 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:8">Tit. i. 8</A>),

 and especially must such love those who labour with them in the work of 
 the gospel, and who are faithful therein. The general calling as 
 Christians knits those together who are Christian; but, when 
 conjunction in the special calling as ministers is added, this will be 
 further endearing. Paul, in the highest degree of ministry, not only 
 calls Timothy, an evangelist, his brother, but Philemon, an ordinary 
 pastor, his dearly beloved fellow-labourer--an example of humility and 
 condescension, and of all affectionate regards, even in those that are 
 highest in the church, towards others that are labourers in the same 
 special heavenly calling. With Philemon Apphia is joined, probably his
 yoke-fellow; and, having a concern in the domestic affairs, the apostle 
 directs to her likewise. She was a party offended and injured by
 Onesimus, and therefore proper to be taken notice of in a letter for 
 reconciliation and forgiveness. Justice and prudence would direct Paul
 to this express notice of her, who might be helpful in furthering the 
 good ends of his writing. She is set before Archippus, as more 
 concerned and having more interest. A kind conjunction there is in 
 domestic matters between husband and wife, whose interests are one, and 
 whose affections and actings must correspond. These are the principal 
 parties written to. The less principal are, <I>Archippus, and the 
 church in Philemon's house.</I> Archippus was a minister in the church 
 of Colosse, Philemon's friend, and probably co-pastor with him; Paul 
 might think him one whom Philemon would advise with, and who might be 
 capable of furthering the good work of peace-making and forgiveness, 
 and therefore might judge fit to put him in the inscription of the 
 letter, with the adjunct of <I>fellow-soldier.</I> He had called 
 Philemon his <I>fellow-labourer.</I> Ministers must look on themselves 
 as labourers and soldiers, who must therefore take pains, and endure 
 hardship; they must stand on their guard, and make good their post; 
 must look on one another as fellow-labourers, and fellow-soldiers, who 
 must stand together, and strengthen one another's hands and hearts in 
 any work of their holy function and calling: they need see to it that 
 they be provided with spiritual weapons, and skill to use them; as 
 labourers they must minister the word, and sacraments, and discipline, 
 and watch over souls, <I>as those that must give an account of 
 them;</I> and, as soldiers, they must fight the Lord's battles, and not 
 entangle themselves in the things of this life, but attend to the 
 pleasing of him who hath chosen them to be soldiers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4">2 Tim. ii. 4</A>.

 To those it is added, <I>And to the church in thy house,</I> his whole
 family, in which the worship of God was kept up, so that he had, as it 
 were, a church in his house. Observe,

 (1.) Families which generally may be most pious and orderly may yet 
 have one or other in them impious and wicked. This was the aggravation
 of Onesimus's sin, that it was where he might and should have learned 
 better; it is likely that he was secret in his misconduct, till his
 flight discovered him. Hearts are unknown but to God, till overt acts 
 discover them. 

 (2.) This one evil servant did not hinder Philemon's house from being 
 called and counted a church, for the religious worship and order that 
 were kept up in it; and such should all families be--nurseries of 
 religion, societies where God is called on, his word is read, his 
 sabbaths are observed, and the members are instructed in the knowledge 
 of him and of their duty to him, neglect of which is followed with 
 ignorance and all corruption. Wicked families are nurseries for hell,
 as good ones are for heaven.

 (3.) Masters and others of the family may not think it enough to be 
 good, singly and severally in their personal capacities, but they must 
 be socially so; as here Philemon's house was a church; and Paul, for 
 some concern that all might have in this matter of Onesimus, directs to 
 them all, that their affection as well as Philemon's might return to 
 him, and that in their way and place they might further, and not 
 hinder, the reconciliation wished and sought. Desirable it is that all
 in a family be well affected towards one another, for furthering their 
 particular welfare and for the common good and benefit of all. On such 
 accounts might it be that Paul inscribed his letter here so generally, 
 that all might be the more ready to own and receive this poor convert, 
 and to behave affectionately towards him. Next to this inscription 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle's salutation of those named by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</I> This is the token in every epistle; so the apostle writes. 
 He is a hearty well-wisher to all his friends, and wishes for them the 
 best things; not gold, nor silver, nor any earthly good, in the first 
 or chief place, but <I>grace and peace from God in Christ;</I> he 
 cannot give them himself, but he prays for them from him who can bestow 
 them. <I>Grace,</I> the free favour and good-will of God, the spring
 and fountain of all blessings; <I>and peace,</I> all good, as the fruit 
 and effect of that grace. <I>To you,</I> that is, be bestowed on you, 
 and continued to you, with the comfortable feeling and sense of it in 
 yourselves. <I>From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> The 
 Holy Spirit also is understood, though not named; for all acts towards 
 the creatures of the whole Trinity: from the Father, who is our Father 
 in Christ, the first in order of acting as of subsisting; and from 
 Christ, his favour and good-will as God, and the fruits of it through 
 him as Mediator, God-man. It is in the beloved that we are accepted, 
 and through him we have peace and all good things, who is, with the 
 Father and Spirit, to be looked to and blessed and praised for all, and 
 to be owned, not only as Jesus and Christ, but as Lord also. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:14">2 Cor. xiii. 14</A>

 the apostle's benediction is full: <I>The grace of the Lord Jesus
 Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be 
 with you all, Amen.</I> Observe, Spiritual blessings are first and 
 especially to be sought for ourselves and others. The favour of God and 
 peace with him, as in itself it is the best and most desirable good, so 
 is it the cause of all other, and what puts sweetness into every mercy 
 and can make happy even in the want of all earthly things. <I>Though 
 there be no herd in the stall, and the labour of the olive fail,</I> 
 yet may such <I>rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of their 
 salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.

 <I>There are many that say, Who will show us any good?</I> But, if God
 <I>lift up the light of his countenance,</I> this will put more joy and 
 gladness into the heart than all worldly increase,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>.
 
 And 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:26">Num. vi. 26</A>,

 <I>The Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon thee, and give
 thee peace.</I> In this is summarily all good, and from this one 
 fountain, God the <I>Father, Son,</I> and <I>Spirit,</I> all comes. 
 After this salutation of the apostle to Philemon, and his friends and 
 family, for better making way still for his suit to him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He expresses the singular and affection he had for him, by 
 thanksgiving and prayer to God in his behalf, and the great joy for the 
 many good things he knew and heard to be in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:4-7"><I>v.</I> 4-7</A>.

 The apostle's thanksgiving and prayer for Philemon are here set forth 
 by the object, circumstance, and matter of them, with the way whereby 
 much of the knowledge of Philemon's goodness came to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the object of Paul's praises and prayers for Philemon: <I>I 
 thank my God, making mention of thee in my prayers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 (1.) God is the author of all the good that is in any, or that is done 
 by them. <I>From me is thy fruit found,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>.

 To him therefore is all the praise due. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:13,14">1 Chron. xxix. 13, 14</A>,

 <I>But</I> [or for] <I>who am I, and what is my people, that we should
 be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of 
 thee,</I> both wherewith to offer, and the will and heart to do it. On 
 this account (says he) <I>we thank thee our God, and praise thy 
 glorious name.</I> 

 (2.) It is the privilege of good men that their praises and prayers 
 they come to God as their God: <I>Our God, we thank thee,</I> said 
 David; and <I>I thank my God,</I> said Paul. 

 (3.) Our prayers and praises should be offered up to God, not for 
 ourselves only, but for others also. Private addresses should not be 
 altogether with a private spirit, minding our own things only, but 
 others must be remembered by us. We must be affected with joy and 
 thankfulness for any good in them, or done by them, or bestowed on 
 them, as far as is known to us, and seek for them what they need. In 
 this lies no little part of the communion of saints. Paul, in his
 private thanksgivings and prayers, was often particular in remembering 
 his friends: <I>I thank my God, making mention of thee in my 
 prayers;</I> sometimes it may be by name, or at least having them 
 particularly in his thoughts; and God knows who is meant, though not 
 named. This is a means of exercising love, and obtaining good for 
 others. <I>Strive with me, by your prayers to God for me,</I> said the 
 apostle: and what he desired for himself he surely practised on behalf 
 of others; so should all. <I>Pray one for another,</I> says James,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:16">v. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the circumstance: <I>Always making mention of thee. 
 Always</I>--usually, not once or twice only, but frequently. So must we
 remember Christian friends much and often, as their case may need, 
 bearing them in our thoughts and upon our hearts before our God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is the matter both of his praises and prayers, in reference to 
 Philemon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of his praises. 

 [1.] He thanks God for the love which he heard Philemon had towards the 
 Lord Jesus. He is to be loved as God superlatively, as his divine 
 perfections require; and as related to us, the Lord, and our Lord, our 
 Maker, Redeemer, and Saviour, who loved us, and gave himself for us. 
 Paul thanks God for what he heard of this, the signal marks and 
 expressions of it in Philemon. 

 [2.] For his faith in Christ also. Love to Christ, and faith in him, 
 are prime Christian graces, for which there is great ground of praise 
 to God, where he has blessed any with them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Rom. i. 8</A>,

 <I>I thank my God</I> because <I>your faith is published throughout the
 world;</I> and, in reference to the Colossians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:3,4"><I>ch.</I> i. 3, 4</A>),

 <I>We give thanks to God since we heard of your faith in Christ
 Jesus.</I> This is a saving grace, and the very principle of Christian 
 life and of all good works. 

 [3.] He praises God likewise for Philemon's love to all the saints. 
 These two must go together; for he who <I>loveth him that begat must 
 and</I> will <I>love those also that are begotten of him.</I> The 
 apostle joins them in that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:3,4">Col. i. 3, 4</A>),

 <I>We give thanks to God since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, 
 and of the love which you have to all the saints.</I> These bear the 
 image of Christ, which will be loved by every Christian. Different
 sentiments and ways in what is not essential will not make a difference 
 of affection as to the truth, though difference in the degrees of love 
 will be according as more or less of that image is discerned. Mere 
 external differences are nothing here. Paul calls a poor converted 
 slave <I>his bowels.</I> We must love, as God does, all saints. Paul 
 thanked God for the good that was not only in the churches, but in the 
 particular persons he wrote to, and though this too was known to him 
 merely by report: <I>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast 
 towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all saints.</I> This was what he 
 enquired after concerning his friends, the truth, and growth, and 
 fruitfulness of their graces, their faith in Christ, and love to him 
 and to all the saints. Love to saints, if it be sincere, will be 
 catholic and universal love towards all saints; but faith and love, 
 though in the heart they are hidden things, are known by the effects of 
 them. Therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The apostle joins prayer with his praises, that the fruits of 
 Philemon's faith and love might be more and more conspicuous, so as 
 that the communication of them might constrain others to the 
 acknowledgment of all the good things that were in him and in his house 
 towards Christ Jesus; that their <I>light might so shine before men 
 that they, seeing their good works, might</I> be stirred up to imitate 
 them, and to <I>glorify their Father who is in heaven.</I> Good works 
 must be done, not of vain-glory to be seen, yet such as may be seen to 
 God's glory and the good of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He adds a reason, both of his prayer and his praises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>For "we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the 
 bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</I> The good thou 
 hast done and still doest is abundant matter of joy and comfort to me 
 and others, who therefore desire you may continue and abound in such 
 good fruits more and more, to God's honour and the credit of religion. 
 <I>The administration of this service not only supplieth the want of 
 the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God,</I>"

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
 thee that which is convenient,
 &nbsp; 9  Yet for love's sake I rather beseech <I>thee,</I> being such an
 one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 10  I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in
 my bonds:
 &nbsp; 11  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
 profitable to thee and to me:
 &nbsp; 12  Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
 mine own bowels:
 &nbsp; 13  Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he
 might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
 &nbsp; 14  But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
 should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
 &nbsp; 15  For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
 shouldest receive him for ever;
 &nbsp; 16  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother
 beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in
 the flesh, and in the Lord?
 &nbsp; 17  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
 &nbsp; 18  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <I>thee</I> ought, put that on
 mine account;
 &nbsp; 19  I Paul have written <I>it</I> with mine own hand, I will repay
 <I>it:</I> albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even
 thine own self besides.
 &nbsp; 20  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh
 my bowels in the Lord.
 &nbsp; 21  Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee,
 knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
 &nbsp; 22  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that
 through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
 &nbsp; 23  There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ
 Jesus;
 &nbsp; 24  Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
 &nbsp; 25  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with your spirit.
 Amen. 
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The main business of the epistle, which was to plead with Philemon 
 on behalf of Onesimus, that he would receive him and be reconciled to
 him. Many arguments Paul urges for this purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:8-21"><I>v.</I> 8-21</A>.
 
 The</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1<I>st Argument</I> is taken from what was before noted, and is carried 
 in the illative <I>wherefore:</I> "Seeing so much good is reported of 
 thee and found in thee, especially thy love to all saints, now let me 
 see it on a fresh and further occasion; <I>refresh the bowels of
 Onesimus and mine also,</I> in forgiving and receiving him, who is now 
 a convert, and so a saint indeed, and meet for thy favour and love." 
 Observe, A disposition to do good, together with past instances and 
 expressions of it, is a good handle to take hold of for pressing to 
 more. "<I>Be not weary of well-doing,</I> go on as thou art able, and 
 as new objects and occasions occur, to do the same still." The</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2<I>nd Argument</I> is from the authority of him that was now making 
 this request to him: <I>I might be very bold in Christ to enjoin thee 
 that which is convenient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The apostles had under Christ great power in the church over the 
 ordinary ministers, as well as the members of it, for edification; they 
 might require of them what was fit, and were therein to be obeyed, 
 which Philemon should consider. This was a matter within the compass of 
 the apostle's power to require, though he would not in this instance 
 act up to it. Observe, Ministers, whatever their power be in the 
 church, are to use prudence in the exercise of it; they may not 
 unseasonably, nor further than is requisite, put it forth; in all they 
 must use godly wisdom and discretion. Wherefore this may be a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3<I>rd Argument,</I> Waiving the authority which yet he had to require, 
 he chooses to entreat it of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee.</I> Observe, It is no 
 disparagement for those who have power to be condescending, and 
 sometimes even to beseech, where, in strictness of right, they might 
 command; so does Paul here, though an apostle: he entreats where he 
 might enjoin, he argues from love rather than authority, which 
 doubtless must carry engaging influence with it. And especially, which
 may be a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4<I>th Argument,</I> When any circumstance of the person pleading gives 
 additional force to his petition, as here: <I>Being such a one as Paul 
 the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</I> Years bespeak 
 respect; and the motions of such, in things lawful and fit, should be 
 received with regard. The request of an aged apostle, and now suffering 
 for Christ and his gospel, should be tenderly considered. "If thou wilt 
 do any thing for a poor aged prisoner, to comfort me in my bonds, and 
 make my chain lighter, grant me this which I desire: hereby in a manner 
 you will do honour to Christ in the person of an aged suffering servant 
 of his, which doubtless he will take as done to himself." He makes also 
 a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5<I>th Argument,</I> From the spiritual relation now between Onesimus 
 and himself: <I>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have 
 begotten in my bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 "Though of right and in a civil respect he by thy servant, yet in a 
 spiritual sense he is now a son to me, God having made me the 
 instrument of his conversion, even here, where I am a prisoner for 
 Christ's sake." Thus does God sometimes honour and comfort his 
 suffering servants, not only working good in themselves by their 
 sufferings, exercising and improving thereby their own graces, but 
 making them a means of much spiritual good to others, either of their 
 conversion, as of Onesimus here, or of their confirmation and 
 strengthening, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:14">Phil. i. 14</A>,

 <I>Many brethren, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to 
 speak the word of the Lord without fear.</I> When God's servants are 
 bound, yet his word and Spirit are not bound; spiritual children may 
 then be born to them. The apostle lays an emphasis here: <I>My son, 
 whom I have begotten in my bonds;</I> he was dear to him, and he hoped 
 would be so to Philemon, under this consideration. Prison-mercies are 
 sweet and much set by. Paul makes an argument to Philemon from this
 dear relation that now was between Onesimus and him, his son begotten 
 in his bonds. And a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6<I>th Argument</I> is from Philemon's own interest: <I>Who in time 
 past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Unsanctified persons are unprofitable persons; they answer not the 
 great end of their being and relations. Grace makes good for somewhat:
 "<I>In time past unprofitable, but now profitable,</I> inclined and 
 fitted to be so, and will be so to thee, his master, if thou receive 
 him, as he has since his conversion been here to me, ministering to me 
 in my confinement." There seems an allusion to the name Onesimus, which 
 signifies <I>profitable.</I> Now he will answer to his name. It may be 
 noted also how the apostle speaks in this matter, not as Onesimus's 
 former case and conduct might warrant; he had wronged his master, and 
 ran away from him, and lived as if he were his own and not his; yet as 
 God covers the sins of penitents, forgives and does not upbraid, so 
 should men. How tenderly does Paul here speak! Not that Onesimus's sin 
 was small, nor that he would have any, much less himself, to take it 
 so; but having been humbled for it, and doubtless taken shame to 
 himself on account thereof, the apostle now would not sink his spirit 
 by continuing to load and burden him therewith, but speaks thus 
 tenderly when he is pleading with Philemon not to make severe 
 reflections on his servant's misconduct, but to forgive. 

 (2.) What happy changes conversion makes--of evil good! of unprofitable 
 useful! Religious servants are a treasure in a family. Such will make
 conscience of their time and trusts, promoting the interests of those 
 whom they serve, and managing all they can for the best. This then is 
 the argument here urged: "It will now be for thy advantage to receive 
 him: thus changed, as he is, thou mayest expect him to be a dutiful and 
 faithful servant, though in time past he was not so." Whereupon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7<I>th Argument,</I> He urges Philemon from the strong affection that 
 he had to Onesimus. He had mentioned the spiritual relation before, 
 <I>My son begotten in my bonds;</I> and now he signifies how dear he 
 was to him: <I>Thou therefore receive him, that is my own bowels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 "I love him as I do myself, and have sent him back to thee for this 
 end, that thou shouldst receive him; do it therefore for my sake, 
 receive him as one thus dear to me." Observe, Even good men may 
 sometimes need great earnestness and entreaty to lay their passions, 
 let go their resentments, and forgive those who have injured and 
 offended them. Some have thought it to look this way, when Paul is so 
 pathetic and earnest, mustering up so many pleas and arguments to gain 
 what he requests. Philemon, a Phrygian, might perhaps be naturally of a 
 rough and difficult temper, and thence need no little pains in touching 
 all the springs that might move him to forgiveness and reconciliation; 
 but rather should we strive to be like God, who is <I>slow to anger, 
 ready to forgive, and abundant in pardons.</I> And again, an</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8<I>th Argument</I> is from the apostle's denying himself in sending 
 back Onesimus: though he might have presumed upon Philemon's leave to 
 detain him longer, yet he would not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Paul was now in prison, and wanted a friend or servant to act for him, 
 and assist him, for which he found Onesimus fit and ready, and 
 therefore would have detained him to minister to him, instead of 
 Philemon himself, whom if he had requested to have come to him in 
 person for such purpose, he might have presumed he would not have 
 refused; much less might he have reckoned that he would be unwilling 
 his servant should do this in his stead; yet he would not take this 
 liberty, though his circumstances needed it: <I>I have sent him 
 back</I> to thee, that any good office of thine to me might not be 
 <I>of necessity, but willingly.</I> Observe, Good deeds are most 
 acceptable to God and man when done with most freedom. And Paul herein, 
 notwithstanding his apostolical power, would show what regard he had to 
 civil rights, which Christianity does by no means supersede or weaken, 
 but rather confirm and strengthen. Onesimus, he knew, was Philemon's 
 servant, and therefore without his consent not to be detained from him. 
 In his unconverted state he had violated that right, and withdrawn 
 himself, to his master's injury; but, now that he had seen his sin and 
 repented, he was willing and desirous to return to his duty, and Paul 
 would not hinder this, but rather further it. He might indeed have 
 presumed on Philemon's willingness; but, but notwithstanding his need, 
 he would deny himself rather than take that way. And he further 
 urges,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9<I>th Argument,</I> That such a change was now wrought in Onesimus 
 that Philemon needed not fear his ever running from him, or injuring 
 him any more: <I>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that 
 thou shouldest receive him for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 There are those of whom Solomon says, <I>If thou deliver them, thou 
 must do it again</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:19">Prov. xix. 19</A>);

 but the change wrought in Onesimus was such that he would never again 
 need one thus to intercede for him. Charity would so hope and judge, 
 yea, so it would be; yet the apostle speaks cautiously, that none might 
 be bold to make another such experiment in expectation of a like 
 gracious issue. Observe, 

 (1.) In matters that may be wrested to ill, ministers must speak 
 warily, that kind providences of God towards sinners be not abused to 
 encouragements to sin, or abatements of just abhorrence of it: 
 <I>Perhaps he therefore departed from thee for a season,</I> &c. 

 (2.) How tenderly still the sins of penitents are spoken of; he calls 
 it a <I>departure for a season,</I> instead of giving it the term that 
 it deserved. As overruled and ordered by God, it was <I>a 
 departure;</I> but in itself, and in respect of the disposition and 
 manner of the act, it was a <I>criminal going away.</I> When we speak 
 of the nature of any sin or offence against God, the evil of it is not 
 to be lessened; but in the person of a penitent sinner, as God covers 
 it, so must we: "<I>He departed for a season, that thou shouldst 
 receive him for ever,</I> that upon conversion he may return, and be a 
 faithful and useful servant to thee as long as he lives." <I>Bray a 
 fool in a mortar, yet will not his folly depart from him.</I> But it is 
 not so with true penitents: they will not return to folly.

 (3.) Observe the wisdom, and goodness, and power of God, in causing 
 that to end so happily which was begun and carried on for some time so 
 wickedly, thus regarding a poor vassal, one of such low rank and 
 condition and so little regarded by men, working so good and great a 
 change in him who was so far gone in evil ways, who had wronged a 
 master so good, had run from a family so pious, from the means of 
 grace, the church in his house, that he should be led into the way of 
 salvation who had fled from it, and find means made effectual at Rome 
 who had been hardened under them at Colosse. What riches are here of 
 divine grace! None so low, nor mean, nor vile, as utterly to be 
 despaired of. God can meet with them when running from him; can make 
 means effectual at one time and place, which have not been so at 
 another. So was it in this instance of Onesimus; having returned to 
 God, he now returns to his master, who will have more service and 
 better hold of him than ever--by conscience of his duty and 
 faithfulness in it to his life's end; his interest therefore it will be 
 now to receive him. So God often brings gain to his people out of their 
 losses. And, besides interest, a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10<I>th Argument</I> is taken from the capacity under which Onesimus 
 now would return, and must be received by Philemon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Not now as a servant</I> (that is, not merely or so much), <I>but
 above a servant</I> (in a spiritual respect), <I>a brother beloved,</I> 
 one to be owned as a brother in Christ, and to be beloved as such, upon 
 account of this holy change that is wrought in him, and one therefore 
 who will be useful unto thee upon better principles and in a better 
 manner than before, who will love and promote the best things in thy 
 family, be a blessing in it, and help to keep up the church that is in 
 thy house." Observe, 

 (1.) There is a spiritual brotherhood between all true believers, 
 however distinguished in civil and outward respects; they are all 
 children of the same heavenly Father, have a right to the same 
 spiritual privileges and benefits, must love and do all good offices to 
 and for one another as brethren, though still in the same rank, and 
 degree, and station, wherein they were called. Christianity does not 
 annul nor confound the respective civil duties, but strengthens the 
 obligation to them, and directs to a right discharge of them. 

 (2.) Religious servants are more than mere ordinary servants; they have 
 grace in their hearts, and have found grace in God's sight, and so will 
 in the sight of religious masters.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:6">Ps. ci. 6</A>,

 <I>Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell 
 with me. He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</I> 
 "Onesimus having now become such, receive and regard him as one that is 
 partaker of the same common faith, and so <I>a brother beloved, 
 specially to me</I> who have been the instrument of his conversion." 
 Good ministers love not so much according to the outward good which 
 they receive as the spiritual good which they do. Paul called Onesimus 
 his <I>own bowels,</I> and other converts his <I>joy and crown. "A 
 brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to thee, both in 
 the flesh and in the Lord;</I> by a double tie therefore (both civil 
 and religious) thy servant: thy property, one of thy house and family, 
 and now, in a spiritual respect, thy brother in Christ, which heightens 
 the engagement. He is God's servant and thine too; here are more ties 
 than he is under to me. How readily therefore should he be received and 
 loved by thee, as one of thy family and one of the true faith, one of 
 thy house and one of the church in thy house!" This argument is 
 strengthened by another, the</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 11<I>th Argument,</I> From the communion of saints: <I>If thou count me 
 therefore a partner, receive him as myself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There is a fellowship among saints; they have interest one in another, 
 and must love and act accordingly. "Now show thy love to me, and the 
 interest I have in thee, by loving and receiving one so near and dear 
 to me, even as myself; own and treat him as thou wouldst me, with a 
 like ready and true, though perhaps not equal, affection." But why such 
 concern and earnestness for a servant, a slave, and such a one as had 
 misbehaved? <I>Answer,</I> Onesimus being now penitent, it was
 doubtless to encourage him, and to support him against the fears he 
 might have in returning to a master whom he had so much abused and 
 wronged, to keep him from sinking into despondency and dejection, and 
 encourage him to his duty. Wise and good ministers will have great and 
 tender care of young converts, to encourage and hearten them what they 
 can to and in their duty. <I>Objection,</I> But Onesimus had wronged as 
 well as offended his master. The answer to this makes a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 12<I>th Argument,</I> A promise of satisfaction to Philemon: <I>If he 
 hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Here are three things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A confession of Onesimus's debt to Philemon: <I>If he hath wronged 
 thee, or oweth thee aught.</I> It is not an <I>if</I> of doubting, but 
 of illation and concession; <I>seeing he hath wronged thee,</I> and 
 thereby has become indebted to thee; such an <I>if</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1,2Pe+2:4">Col. iii. 1 
 and 2 Pet. ii. 4</A>,

 &c. Observe, True penitents will be ingenuous in owning their faults,
 as doubtless Onesimus had been to Paul, upon his being awakened and 
 being brought to repentance; and especially is this to be done in cases 
 of injury to others. Onesimus by Paul owns the wrong. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Paul here engages for satisfaction: <I>Put that on my account; I 
 Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it.</I> Observe, 
 
 [1.] The communion of saints does not destroy distinction of property: 
 Onesimus, now converted, and become a brother beloved, is yet 
 Philemon's servant still, and indebted to him for wrongs that he had 
 done, and not to be discharged but by free and voluntary remission, or 
 on reparation made by himself, or some other in his behalf, which part, 
 rather than fail, the apostle undertakes for him. 

 [2.] Suretiship is not in all cases unlawful, but in some is a good and 
 merciful undertaking. Only know the person and case, be not <I>surety 
 for a stranger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:15">Prov. xi. 15</A>),

 and go not beyond ability; help thy friend thou mayest, as far as will 
 comport with justice and prudence. And how happy for us that Christ
 would be made the surety of a better covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:22">Heb. vii. 22</A>),

 that he would be made <I>sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be 
 made the righteousness of God in him!</I> And,

 [3.] Formal securities by writing, as well as by word and promise, may 
 be required and given. Persons die, and words may be forgotten or 
 mistaken; writing better preserves right and peace, and has been in use 
 with good persons, as well as others, in all ages,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:9,Lu+16:5-7">Jer. xxxii. 9, &c.; Luke xvi. 5-7</A>.

 It was much that Paul, who lived on contributions himself, would 
 undertake to make good all loss by an evil servant to his master; but 
 hereby he expresses his real and great affection for Onesimus, and his 
 full belief of the sincerity of his conversion: and he might have hope 
 that, notwithstanding this generous offer, Philemon would not insist on 
 it, but freely remit all, considering,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The reason of things between him and Philemon: "<I>Albeit, I do 
 not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thy own self besides;</I> 
 thou wilt remember, without my reminding thee, that thou are on other 
 accounts more in debt to me than this comes to." Modesty in 
 self-praises is true praise. The apostle glances at the benefits he had 
 conferred on Philemon: "That thou art any thing in grace and 
 acceptation with God, or enjoyest any thing in a right and comfortable 
 manner, it is, under God, owing to my ministry. I have been the 
 instrument in his hand of all that spiritual good to thee; and what thy 
 obligation to me on this account is I leave to thee to consider. Thy
 forgiving a pecuniary debt to a poor penitent for my sake and at my
 request, and which, however, I now take upon myself to answer, thy
 remitting it to him, or to me, now his surety, thou wilt confess, is
 not so great a thing; here is more <I>per contra: Thou owest to me even
 thy ownself besides.</I>" Observe, How great the endearments are
 between ministers and those towards whom their endeavours have been
 blessed to their conversion or spiritual edification! <I>If it had been
 possible</I> (said Paul to the Galatians), <I>you would have plucked
 out your own eyes, and have given them to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:15">Gal. iv. 15</A>.

 On the other hand he calls them his <I>children, of whom he travailed
 again, till Christ was formed in them,</I> that is, the likeness of 
 Christ more fully. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:8">1 Thess. ii. 8</A>,

 <I>We were willing to have imparted to you not the gospel of God only,
 but also our own souls, because you were dear unto us.</I> By way of 
 allusion, this may illustrate Christ's undertaking for us. We had 
 revolted from God, and by sin had wronged him, but Christ undertakes to 
 make satisfaction, <I>the just for the unjust, that he might bring us 
 unto God.</I> "If the sinner owes thee aught, put it upon my account, I 
 will pay the debt; let his iniquity be laid on me, I will bear the 
 penalty." Further, a</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 13<I>th Argument</I> is from the joy and comfort the apostle hereby 
 would have on Philemon's own account, as well as on Onesimus's in such 
 a seasonable and acceptable fruit of Philemon's faith and obedience: 
 <I>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels 
 in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Philemon was Paul's son in the faith, yet he entreats him as a brother; 
 Onesimus a poor slave, yet he solicits for him as if he were seeking 
 some great thing for himself. How pathetic is he! "<I>Yea, brother,</I> 
 or <I>O my brother</I> (it is an adverb of wishing or desiring), <I>let 
 me have joy of thee in the Lord.</I> Thou knowest that I am now a 
 prisoner or the Lord, for his sake and cause, and need all the comfort 
 and support that my friends in Christ can give me: now this will be a 
 joy to me, I shall <I>have joy of thee in the Lord,</I> as seeing such 
 an evidence and fruit of thy own Christian faith and love, and on 
 Onesimus's account, who hereby will be relieved and encouraged." 
 Observe,

 (1.) Christians should do the things that may rejoice the hearts of one 
 another, both people and minister reciprocally, and ministers of their 
 brethren. From the world they expect trouble; and where may they look 
 for comfort and joy but in one another? 

 (2.) Fruits of faith and obedience in people are the minister's 
 greatest joy, especially the more of love appears in them to Christ and 
 his members, forgiving injuries, showing compassion, being merciful as 
 their heavenly Father is merciful. "<I>Refresh my bowels in the 
 Lord.</I> It is not any carnal selfish respect I am actuated by, but 
 what is pleasing to Christ, and that he may have honour therein." 
 Observe,

 [1.] The Lord's honour and service are a Christian's chief aim in all 
 things. And, 

 [2.] It is meat and drink to a good minister to see people ready and 
 zealous in what is good, especially in acts of charity and beneficence, 
 as occasions occur, forgiving injuries, remitting somewhat of their 
 right, and the like. And, once more, his last, which is the</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 14<I>th Argument,</I> Lies in the good hope and opinion which he 
 expresses of Philemon: <I>Having confidence in thy obedience, I wrote 
 unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Good thoughts and expectations of us more strongly move and engage us 
 to do the things expected from us. The apostle knew Philemon to be a
 good man, and was thence persuaded of his readiness to do good, and
 that not in a scanty and niggardly manner, but with a free and liberal
 hand. Observe, Good persons will be ready for good works, and not
 narrow and pinching, but abundant in them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:8">Isa. xxxii. 8</A>,

 <I>The liberal deviseth liberal things.</I> The Macedonians first gave 
 themselves to the Lord, and then to his apostles by the will of God, to 
 do what good they could with what they had, according as occasions 
 offered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus far is the substance and body of the epistle. We have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conclusion, where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He signifies his good hope of deliverance, through their prayers, 
 and that shortly he might see them, desiring Philemon to make provision 
 for him: <I>But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that 
 through your prayers I shall be given unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>But withal,</I> or <I>moreover.</I> He comes to another thing, yet, 
 as may seem, not without some eye to the matter which he had been upon, 
 that might be furthered by this intimation that he hoped he should 
 himself soon follow, and know the effect of his epistle, which Philemon 
 would therefore be the more stirred up to see might be to his 
 satisfaction. Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The thing requested: <I>Prepare me also a lodging;</I> under this 
 all necessaries for a stranger are included. He wills Philemon to do 
 it, intending to be his guest, as most to his purpose. Observe, 
 Hospitality is a great Christian duty, especially in ministers, and 
 towards ministers, such as the apostle was, coming out of such dangers
 and sufferings for Christ and his gospel. Who would not show the utmost 
 of affectionate regards to such a one? It is an honourable title that 
 he gives Gaius 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Rom. xvi. 23</A>),

 <I>My host, and of the whole church.</I> Onesiphorus is also 
 affectionately remembered by the apostle on this account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:16,18">2 Tim. i. 16, 18</A>),

 <I>The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft 
 refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; and in how many things 
 he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is the ground of the apostle's request: <I>For I trust that 
 through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</I> He did not know how 
 God might deal with him, but the benefit of prayer he had often found, 
 and hoped he should again, for deliverance, and liberty to come to 
 them. Observe, 

 [1.] Our dependence is on God for life and liberty and opportunity of 
 service; all is by divine pleasure. 

 [2.] When abridged of these or any other mercies, our trust and hope 
 must be in God, without fainting or succumbing, while our case is 
 depending. But yet, 

 [3.] Trust must be with the use of means, prayer especially, though no 
 other should be at hand; this hath unlocked heaven and opened 
 prison-doors. <I>The fervent effectual prayer of the righteous availeth 
 much.</I> 

 [4.] Prayer of people for ministers, especially when they are in 
 distress and danger, is their great duty; ministers need and request 
 it. Paul, though an apostle, did so with much earnestness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15;30;2Co+1:11;Eph+6:18,19;1Th+5:25">Rom. xv. 30;
 2 Cor. i. 11; Eph. vi. 18, 19; 1 Thess. v. 25</A>.

 The least may in this way be helpful to the greatest. Yet, 

 [5.] Though prayer obtains, yet it does not merit the things obtained: 
 they are God's gift, and Christ's purchase. <I>I trust that through 
 your prayers,</I> <B><I>charisthesomai hymin</I></B>--<I>I shall be 
 freely bestowed on you.</I> What God gives, he will yet be sought to 
 for, that mercies may be valued the more, and known whence they come, 
 and God may have the praise. Minister's lives and labours are for the 
 people's good; the office was set up for them; <I>he gave gifts for 
 men, apostles,</I> &c.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8,11,12">Eph. iv. 8, 11, 12</A>.

 Their gifts, and labours, and lives, all are for their benefit. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:21,22">1 Cor. iii. 21, 22</A>,

 <I>All things are yours, Apollos, Cephas,</I> &c. 

 [6.] In praying for faithful ministers, people in effect pray for 
 themselves: "<I>I trust I shall be given unto you,</I> for your 
 service, and comfort, and edification in Christ." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:15">2 Cor. iv. 15</A>.

 [7.] Observe the humility of the apostle; his liberty, should he have 
 it, he would own to be through their prayers, as well as, or more than, 
 his own; he mentions them only through the high thoughts he had of the 
 prayers of many, and the regard God would show to his praying people.
 Thus of the first thing in the apostle's conclusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. he sends salutations from one who was his fellow-prisoner, and four 
 more who were his fellow-labourers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 Saluting is wishing health and peace. Christianity is no enemy to 
 courtesy, but enjoins it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:8">1 Pet. iii. 8</A>.

 It is a mere expression of love and respect, and a means of preserving 
 and nourishing them. <I>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner 
 in Christ Jesus.</I> he was of Colosse, and so countryman and 
 fellow-citizen with Philemon; by office he seems to have been an 
 evangelist, who laboured among the Colossians (if he was not the first 
 converter of them), for whom he had special affection. <I>Our dear 
 fellow-servant</I> (said St. Paul), <I>and for you a faithful minister 
 of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:7">Col. i. 7</A>),
 
 and

 (
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:12,13"><I>ch.</I> iv. 12, 13</A>),

 <I>A servant of Christ, always labouring for you in prayers. I bear him
 record that he hath a great zeal for you,</I> &c. A very eminent person 
 therefore this was, who, being at Rome, perhaps accompanying Paul, and 
 labouring in the same work of preaching and propagating the gospel, was 
 confined in the same prison, and for the same cause; both termed 
 <I>prisoners in Christ Jesus,</I> intimating the ground of their 
 imprisonment, not any crime or wickedness, but for the faith of Christ 
 and their service to him. An honour it is to suffer shame for Christ's 
 name. <I>My fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus</I> is mentioned as his 
 glory and the apostle's comfort; not that he was a prisoner and so 
 hindered from his work (this was matter of affliction), but that, 
 seeing God thus permitted and called him to suffer, his providence so 
 ordered it that they suffered together, and so had the benefit and 
 comfort of one another's prayers, and help, it may be, in some things; 
 this was a mercy. So God sometimes lightens the sufferings of his 
 servants by the communion of saints, the sweet fellowship they have one 
 with another in their bonds. Never more enjoyment of God have they 
 found than when suffering together for God. So Paul and Silas, when 
 their feet were fast in the stocks, had their tongues set at liberty, 
 and their hearts tuned for the praises of God.--<I>Marcus, Aristarchus, 
 Demas, Lucas, my fellow-labourers.</I> The mention of these seems in a 
 manner to interest them in the business of the latter. How ill would it 
 look by denial of the request of it to slight so many worthy names as 
 most of these, at least, were! <I>Marcus,</I> cousin of Barnabas, and 
 son of Mary, who was so hospitable to the saints at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10;Ac+12:12">Col. iv. 10, Acts xii. 12</A>),

 and whose house was the place of meeting for prayer and the worship of 
 God. Though some failing seems to have been in him when Paul and he 
 parted, yet in conjunction with Barnabas he went on with his work, and 
 here Paul and he, we perceive, were reconciled, and differences 
 forgotten,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2 Tim. iv. 11</A>.

 He bids Mark to be brought to him, <I>for he is profitable to me for 
 the ministry,</I> that is, of an evangelist. <I>Aristarchus</I> is 
 mentioned with Marcus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col. iv. 10</A>),

 and called there by Paul his fellow-prisoner; and speaking there of 
 Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, he adds, <I>Touching whom you 
 received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him:</I> an 
 evidence that he himself had received him, and was reconciled to him.
 Next is <I>Demas,</I> who hitherto, it seems, appeared not faulty, 
 though he is censured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2 Tim. iv. 10</A>)

 as having forsaken Paul, from <I>love of this present world.</I> But 
 how far his forsaking was, whether total from his work and profession, 
 or partial only, and whether he repented and returned to his duty, 
 scripture is silent, and so much we be: no mark of disgrace lay on him 
 here, but he is joined with others who were faithful, as he is also in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14">Col. iv. 14</A>.

 <I>Lucas</I> is the last, that <I>beloved physician</I> and evangelist,
 who came to Rome, companion with Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14;2Ti+4:11">Col. iv. 14; 2 Tim. iv. 11</A>.

 He was Paul's associate in his greatest dangers, and his
 fellow-labourer. The ministry is not a matter of carnal ease nor
 pleasure, but of pains; if any are idle in it, they answer not their
 calling. Christ bids his disciples <I>pray the Lord of the harvest to
 send forth labourers,</I> not loiterers, <I>into his harvest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:38">Matt. ix. 38</A>.

 And the people are extorted to <I>know those that labour among them,
 and are over them in the Lord, and to esteem them very highly in love 
 for their work's sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:12,13">1 Thess. v. 12, 13</A>.

 <I>My fellow-labourers,</I> says the apostle: ministers must be helpers
 together of the truth; they serve the same Lord, in the same holy work 
 and function, and are expectants of the same glorious reward; therefore 
 they must be assistants to each other in furthering the interest of 
 their great and common Master. Thus of the salutations, and then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is the apostle's closing prayer and benediction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phm+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) What is wished and prayed for: <I>Grace,</I> the free favour and 
 love of God, together with the fruits and effects of it in all good 
 things, for soul and body, for time and eternity. Observe, Grace is the 
 best wish for ourselves and others; with this the apostle begins and 
 ends. 

 (2.) From whom: <I>Our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> the Son of God, second 
 Person in the Trinity, Lord by natural right, <I>by whom, and for whom, 
 all things were created</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:16;Joh+1:1-3">Col. i. 16, John i. 1-3</A>),

 <I>and who is heir of all things,</I> and, as God-man and Mediator, who 
 purchased us, and to whom we are given by the Father. <I>Jesus,</I> the 
 Saviour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>.

 We were lost and undone; he recovers us, and repairs the ruin. He saves
 by merit, procuring pardon and life for us; and by power, rescuing us
 from sin, and Satan, and hell, and renewing us to the likeness, and
 bringing us to the enjoyment, of God: thus is he Jesus; and Christ, the
 Messiah or anointed, consecrated and fitted to be king, priest, and
 prophet, to his church. To all those offices were there anointings
 under the law with oil, and to them was the Saviour spiritually
 anointed with the Holy Ghost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:38">Acts x. 38</A>.

 In none but him were all these together and in such eminence. <I>He was
 anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:7">Ps. xlv. 7</A>.

 This Lord Jesus Christ is ours by original title to us, by gospel 
 offers and gift, his purchase of us, and our own acceptance of him, 
 resignation to him, and mystical union with him: <I>Our Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</I> Observe, All grace to us is from Christ; he purchased, and 
 he bestows it. <I>Of his fulness we all receive, and grace for 
 grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.
 
 <I>He filleth all in all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:23">Eph. i. 23</A>.

 (3.) To whom: <I>Your spirit,</I> <B><I>meta tou pneumatos
 hymon,</I></B> not of Philemon only, but of all who were named in the 
 inscription. <I>With your spirit,</I> that is, with you, the soul or 
 spirit being the immediate seat of grace, whence it influences the 
 whole man, and flows out in gracious and holy actings. All the house
 saluted are here joined in the closing benediction, the more to remind 
 and quicken all to further the end of the epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Amen</I> is added, not only for strong and affectionate summing up 
 the prayer and wish, <I>so let it be;</I> but as an expression of faith 
 that it will be heard, <I>so shall it be.</I> And what need we more to 
 make us happy than to have <I>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with 
 our spirit?</I> This is the usual benediction, but it may be taken here 
 to have some special respect also to the occasion; the grace of Christ 
 with their spirits, Philemon's especially, would sweeten and mollify 
 them, take off too deep and keen resentments of injuries, and dispose
 to forgive others as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven us.</P>
