 This chapter is an introduction to the latter part of the prophecies of 
 this book. Whether what is contained between this and the sounding of 
 the seventh trumpet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">ch. xi. 15</A>)

 be a distinct prophecy from the other, or only a more general account
 of some of the principal things included in the other, is disputed by 
 our curious enquirers into these abstruse writings. However, here we 
 have,

 I. A remarkable description of a very glorious angel with an open book
 in his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. An account of seven thunders which the apostle heard, as echoing to
 the voice of this angel, and communicating some discoveries, which the 
 apostle was not yet allowed to write, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. The solemn oath taken by him who had the book in his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 IV. The charge given to the apostle, and observed by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
 with a cloud: and a rainbow <I>was</I> upon his head, and his face
 <I>was</I> as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
 &nbsp; 2  And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his
 right foot upon the sea, and <I>his</I> left <I>foot</I> on the earth,
 &nbsp; 3  And cried with a loud voice, as <I>when</I> a lion roareth: and
 when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
 &nbsp; 4  And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
 about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,
 Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write
 them not.
 &nbsp; 5  And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
 earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
 &nbsp; 6  And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
 heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the
 things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are
 therein, that there should be time no longer:
 &nbsp; 7  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
 shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as
 he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have an account of another vision the apostle was favoured 
 with, between the sounding of the sixth trumpet and that of the 
 seventh. And we observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The person who was principally concerned in communicating this 
 discovery to John--an angel from heaven, <I>another mighty angel,</I>
 who is so set forth as would induce one to think it could be no other 
 than our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ! 

 1. He was <I>clothed with a cloud:</I> he veils his glory, which is too 
 great for mortality to behold; and he throws a veil upon his 
 dispensations. <I>Clouds and darkness are round about him.</I> 

 2. <I>A rainbow was upon his head;</I> he is always mindful of his 
 covenant, and, when his conduct is most mysterious, yet it is perfectly 
 just and faithful. 

 3. <I>His face was as the sun,</I> all bright, and full of lustre and
 majesty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>.

 4. <I>His feet were as pillars of fire;</I> all his ways, both of grace
 and providence, are pure and steady.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His station and posture: <I>He set his right foot upon the sea and 
 his left foot upon the earth,</I> to show the absolute power and 
 dominion he had over the world. <I>And he held in his hand a little 
 book opened,</I> probably the same that was before sealed, but was now 
 opened, and gradually fulfilled by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His awful voice: <I>He cried aloud, as when a lion roareth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and his awful voice was echoed by <I>seven thunders,</I> seven solemn 
 and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The prohibition given to the apostle, that he should not publish, 
 but conceal what he had learned from the seven thunders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The apostle was for preserving and publishing every thing he saw and 
 heard in these visions, but the time had not yet come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The solemn oath taken by this mighty angel. 

 1. The manner of his swearing: <I>He lifted up his hand to heaven, and 
 swore by him that liveth for ever,</I> by himself, as God often has 
 done, or by God as God, to whom he, as Lord, Redeemer, and ruler of the 
 world, now appeals.

 2. The matter of the oath: that <I>there shall be time no longer;</I> 
 either,

 (1.) That there shall be now no longer delay in fulfilling the
 predictions of this book than till the last angel should sound; then 
 every thing should be put into speedy execution: <I>the mystery of God 
 shall be finished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) That when this mystery of God is finished time itself shall be no 
 more, as being the measure of things that are in a mutable changing 
 state; but all things shall be at length for ever fixed, and so time 
 itself swallowed up in eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,
 and said, Go <I>and</I> take the little book which is open in the hand
 of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 9  And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the
 little book. And he said unto me, Take <I>it,</I> and eat it up; and
 it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth
 sweet as honey.
 &nbsp; 10  And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate
 it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I
 had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
 &nbsp; 11  And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
 peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,

 I. A strict charge given to the apostle, which was, 

 1. That he should <I>go and take the little book</I> out of the hands 
 of that mighty angel mentioned before. This charge was given, not by 
 the angel himself who stood upon the earth, but by the same voice from 
 heaven that in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:4">fourth verse</A>

 had lain an injunction upon him not to write what he had discerned by
 the seven thunders. 

 2. To eat the book; this part of the charge was given by the angel
 himself, hinting to the apostle that before he should publish what he 
 had discovered he must more thoroughly digest the predictions, and be 
 in himself suitably affected with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the taste and relish which this little book would 
 have, when the apostle had taken it in; at first, while <I>in his 
 mouth, sweet.</I> All persons feel a pleasure in looking into future 
 events, and in having them foretold; and all good men love to receive a 
 word from God, of what import soever it be. But, when this book of 
 prophecy was more thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents 
 would be bitter; these were things so awful and terrible, such grievous 
 persecutions of the people of God, and such desolation made in the 
 earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would not be 
 pleasant, but painful to the mind of the apostle: thus was Ezekiel's 
 prophecy to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:3"><I>ch.</I> iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle's discharge of the duty he was called to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>He took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up,</I> 
 and he found the relish to be as was told him. 

 1. It becomes the servants of God to digest in their own souls the
 messages they bring to others in his name, and to be suitably affected 
 therewith themselves.

 2. It becomes them to deliver every message with which they are
 charged, whether pleasing or unpleasing to men. That which is least 
 pleasing may be most profitable; however, God's messengers must not 
 keep back any part of the counsel of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle is made to know that this book of prophecy, which he 
 had now taken in, was not given him merely to gratify his own 
 curiosity, or to affect him with pleasure or pain, but to be 
 communicated by him to the world. Here his prophetical commission seems 
 to be renewed, and he is ordered to prepare for another embassy, to 
 convey those declarations of the mind and will of God which are of
 great importance to all the world, and to the highest and greatest men 
 in the world, and such should be read and recorded in many languages. 
 This indeed is the case; we have them in our language, and are all 
 obliged to attend to them, humbly to enquire into the meaning of them, 
 and firmly to believe that every thing shall have its accomplishment in 
 the proper time; and, when the prophecies shall be fulfilled, the sense 
 and truth of them will appear, and the omniscience, power, and 
 faithfulness of the great God will be adored.</P>
