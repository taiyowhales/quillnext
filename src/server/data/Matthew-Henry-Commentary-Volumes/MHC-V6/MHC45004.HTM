 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great gospel doctrine of justification by faith without the works 
 of the law was so very contrary to the notions the Jews had learnt from
 those that sat in Moses' chair, that it would hardly go down with them; 
 and therefore the apostle insists very largely upon it, and labours 
 much in the confirmation and illustration of it. He had before proved 
 it by reason and argument, now in this chapter he proves it by example, 
 which in some places serves for confirmation as well as illustration.
 The example he pitches upon is that of Abraham, whom he chooses to 
 mention because the Jews gloried much in their relation to Abraham, put 
 it in the first rank of their external privileges that they were 
 Abraham's seed, and truly they had Abraham for their father. Therefore
 this instance was likely to be more taking and convincing to the Jews 
 than any other. His argument stands thus: "All that are saved are 
 justified in the same way as Abraham was; but Abraham was justified by 
 faith, and not by works; therefore all that are saved are so 
 justified;" for it would easily be acknowledged that Abraham was the 
 father of the faithful. Now this is an argument, not only <I>&agrave; 
 pari</I>--from an equal case, as they say, but <I>&agrave; 
 fortiori</I>--from a stronger case. If Abraham, a man so famous for 
 works, so eminent in holiness and obedience, was nevertheless justified 
 by faith only, and not by those works, how much less can any other, 
 especially any of those that spring from him, and come so far short of 
 him in works, set up for a justification by their own works? And it 
 proves likewise, <I>ex abundanti</I>--the more abundantly, as some 
 observe, that we are not justified, no not by those good works which 
 flow from faith, as the matter of our righteousness; for such were 
 Abraham's works, and are we better than he? The whole chapter is taken 
 up with his discourse upon this instance, and there is this in it, 
 which hath a particular reference to the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, where he has asserted that, in the business of justification, 
 Jews and Gentiles stand upon the same level. Now in this chapter, with 
 a great deal of cogency of argument,

 I. He proves that Abraham was justified not by works, but by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. He observes when and why he was so justified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:9-17">ver. 9-17</A>.

 III. He describes and commends that faith of his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 IV. He applies all this to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:22-25">ver. 22-25</A>.

 And, if he had now been in the school of Tyrannus, he could not have
 disputed more argumentatively.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining
 to the flesh, hath found?
 &nbsp; 2  For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <I>whereof</I> to
 glory; but not before God.
 &nbsp; 3  For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it
 was counted unto him for righteousness.
 &nbsp; 4  Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,
 but of debt.
 &nbsp; 5  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
 justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
 &nbsp; 6  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man,
 unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
 &nbsp; 7  <I>Saying,</I> Blessed <I>are</I> they whose iniquities are forgiven,
 and whose sins are covered.
 &nbsp; 8  Blessed <I>is</I> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle proves that Abraham was justified not by works, but by 
 faith. Those that of all men contended most vigorously for a share in 
 righteousness by the privileges they enjoyed, and the works they 
 performed, were the Jews, and therefore he appeals to the case of 
 Abraham their father, and puts his own name to the relation, being a 
 Hebrew of the Hebrews: <I>Abraham our father.</I> Now surely his 
 prerogative must needs be as great as theirs who claim it as his seed 
 according to the flesh. Now <I>what has he found?</I> All the world is 
 seeking; but, while the most are wearying themselves for very vanity, 
 none can be truly reckoned to have found, but those who are justified 
 before God; and thus Abraham, like a wise merchant, seeking goodly 
 pearls, found this one pearl of great price. What has he found, 
 <B><I>kata sarka</I></B>--<I>as pertaining to the flesh,</I> that is,
 by circumcision and his external privileges and performances? These the 
 apostle calls <I>flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>.

 Now what did he get by these? Was he justified by them? Was it the
 merit of his works that recommended him to God's acceptance? No, by no 
 means, which he proves by several arguments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. If he had been justified by works, room would have been left for 
 boasting, which must for ever be excluded. If so, <I>he hath whereof to 
 glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which is not to be allowed. "But," might the Jews say, "was not his 
 name made great 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2">Gen. xii. 2</A>),

 and then might not he glory?" Yes, but not before God; he might deserve 
 well of men, but he could never merit of God. Paul himself had 
 <I>whereof to glory before men,</I> and we have him sometimes glorying 
 in it, yet with humility; but nothing to glory in before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:4,Php+3:8,9">1 Cor. iv. 4; Phil. iii. 8, 9</A>.

 So Abraham. Observe, He takes it for granted that man must not pretend
 to glory in any thing before God; no, not Abraham, as great and as good 
 a man as he was; and therefore he fetches an argument from it: it would 
 be absurd for him <I>that glorieth to glory in any but the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is expressly said that Abraham's faith was counted to him for 
 righteousness. <I>What saith the scripture?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 In all controversies in religion this must be our question, <I>What 
 saith the scripture?</I> It is not what this great man, and the other 
 good man, say, but What saith the scripture? Ask counsel at this Abel, 
 and so end the matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:18">2 Sam. ii. 18</A>.
 
 <I>To the law, and to the testimony</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:20">Isa. viii. 20</A>),

 thither is the last appeal. Now the scripture saith that <I>Abraham 
 believed, and this was counted to him for righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6">Gen. xv. 6</A>);

 therefore he had not whereof to glory before God, it being purely of 
 free grace that it was so imputed, and having not in itself any of the 
 formal nature of a righteousness, further than as God himself was 
 graciously pleased so to count it to him. It is mentioned in Genesis, 
 upon occasion of a very signal and remarkable act of faith concerning 
 the promised seed, and is the more observable in that it followed upon 
 a grievous conflict he had had with unbelief; his faith was now a 
 victorious faith, newly returned from the battle. It is not the perfect 
 faith that is required to justification (there may be acceptable faith 
 where there are remainders of unbelief), but the prevailing faith, the 
 faith that has the upper hand of unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. If he had been justified by faith, the reward would have been 
 <I>of debt, and not of grace,</I> which is not to be imagined. This is 
 his argument 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 Abraham's reward was God himself; so he had told him but just before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>),

 <I>I am thy exceeding great reward.</I> Now, if Abraham had merited 
 this by the perfection of his obedience, it had not been an act of 
 grace in God, but Abraham might have demanded it with as much 
 confidence as ever any labourer in the vineyard demanded the penny he 
 had earned. But this cannot be; it is impossible for man, much more 
 guilty man, to make God a debtor to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:35">Rom. xi. 35</A>.

 No, God will have free grace to have all the glory, grace for grace's
 sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.

 And therefore <I>to him that worketh not</I>--that can pretend to no
 such merit, nor show any worth or value in his work, which may answer 
 such a reward, but disclaiming any such pretension casts himself wholly 
 upon the free grace of God in Christ, by a lively, active, obedient 
 faith--to such a one <I>faith is counted for righteousness,</I> is 
 accepted of God as the qualification required in all those that shall 
 be pardoned and saved. <I>Him that justifieth the ungodly,</I> that is, 
 him that was before ungodly. His former ungodliness was no bar to his 
 justification upon his believing: <B><I>ton asebe</I></B>--<I>that 
 ungodly one,</I> that is, Abraham, who, before his conversion, it 
 should seem, was carried down the stream of the Chaldean idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2">Josh. xxiv. 2</A>.

 No room therefore is left for despair; though God clears not the
 impenitent guilty, yet through Christ he justifies the ungodly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He further illustrates this by a passage out of the Psalms, where 
 David speaks of the remission of sins, the prime branch of 
 justification, as constituting the happiness and blessedness of a man, 
 pronouncing blessed, not the man who has no sin, or none which deserved 
 death (for then, while man is so sinful, and God so righteous, where 
 would be the blessed man?) but <I>the man to whom the Lord imputeth not 
 sin,</I> who though he cannot plead, Not guilty, pleads the act of 
 indemnity, and his plea is allowed. It is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:1,2">Ps. xxxii. 1, 2</A>,

 where observe, 

 1. The nature of forgiveness. It is the remission of a debt or a crime;
 it is the covering of sin, as a filthy thing, as the nakedness and 
 shame of the soul. God is said <I>to cast sin behind his back, to hide 
 his face from it,</I> which, and the like expressions, imply that the 
 ground of our blessedness is not our innocency, or our not having 
 sinned (a thing is, and is filthy, though covered; justification does 
 not make the sin not to have been, or not to have been sin), but God's 
 not laying it to our charge, as it follows here: it is God's <I>not 
 imputing sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which makes it wholly a gracious act of God, not dealing with us in 
 strict justice as we have deserved, not entering into judgment, not 
 marking iniquities, all which being purely acts of grace, the 
 acceptance and the reward cannot be expected as debts; and therefore 
 Paul infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that it is the imputing of righteousness without works.

 2. The blessedness of it: <I>Blessed are they.</I> When it is said, 
 <I>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, blessed is the man that 
 walketh not in the counsel of the wicked,</I> &c., the design is to 
 show the characters of those that are blessed; but when it is said, 
 <I>Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven,</I> the design is 
 to show what that blessedness is, and what the ground and foundation of 
 it. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. The sentiments of the 
 world are, Those are happy that have a clear estate, and are out of 
 debt to man; but the sentence of the word is, Those are happy that have 
 their debts to God discharged. O how much therefore is it our interest 
 to make it sure to ourselves that our sins are pardoned! For this is 
 the foundation of all other benefits. So and so I will do for them; for 
 I will be merciful,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  <I>Cometh</I> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <I>only,</I>
 or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was
 reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
 &nbsp; 10  How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
 uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
 &nbsp; 11  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
 righteousness of the faith which <I>he had yet</I> being
 uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
 believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might
 be imputed unto them also:
 &nbsp; 12  And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
 circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith
 of our father Abraham, which <I>he had</I> being <I>yet</I> uncircumcised.
 &nbsp; 13  For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
 <I>was</I> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but
 through the righteousness of faith.
 &nbsp; 14  For if they which are of the law <I>be</I> heirs, faith is made
 void, and the promise made of none effect:
 &nbsp; 15  Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <I>there
 is</I> no transgression.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore <I>it is</I> of faith, that <I>it might be</I> by grace; to
 the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that
 only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith
 of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
 &nbsp; 17a (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many
 nations,)
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 St. Paul observes in this paragraph when and why Abraham was thus 
 justified; for he has several things to remark upon that. It was before 
 he was circumcised, and before the giving of the law; and there was a 
 reason for both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was before he was circumcised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 His faith was counted to him for righteousness while he was in
 uncircumcision. It was imputed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6">Gen. xv. 6</A>,

 and he was not circumcised till

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1-27"><I>ch.</I> xvii.</A>.

 Abraham is expressly said to be justified by faith <I>fourteen
 years,</I> some say <I>twenty-five years, before he was 
 circumcised.</I> Now this the apostle takes notice of in answer to the 
 question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Cometh this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the 
 uncircumcision also?</I> Abraham was pardoned and accepted in 
 uncircumcision, a circumstance which, as it might silence the fears of 
 the poor uncircumcised Gentiles, so it might lower the pride and 
 conceitedness of the Jews, who gloried in their circumcision, as if 
 they had the monopoly of all happiness. Here are two reasons why 
 Abraham was justified by faith in uncircumcision:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That circumcision might be <I>a seal of the righteousness of 
 faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The tenour of the covenants must first be settled before the seal can 
 be annexed. Sealing supposes a previous bargain, which is confirmed and 
 ratified by that ceremony. After Abraham's justification by faith had 
 continued several years only a grant by parole, for the confirmation of 
 Abraham's faith God was pleased to appoint a sealing ordinance, and 
 Abraham received it; though it was a bloody ordinance, yet he submitted 
 to it, and even received it as a special favour, <I>the sign of 
 circumcision,</I> &c. Now we may hence observe,

 (1.) The nature of sacraments in general: they are signs and 
 seals--signs to represent and instruct, seals to ratify and confirm.
 They are signs of absolute grace and favour; they are seals of the 
 conditional promises; nay, they are mutual seals: God does in the 
 sacraments seal to us to be to us a God, and we do therein seal to him 
 to be to him a people. 

 (2.) The nature of circumcision in particular: it was the initiating 
 sacrament of the Old Testament; and it is here said to be, 

 [1.] <I>A sign</I>--a sign of that original corruption which we are all 
 born with, and which is cut off by spiritual circumcision,--a 
 commemorating sign of God's covenant with Abraham,--a distinguishing 
 sign between Jews and Gentiles,--a sign of admission into the visible 
 church,--a sign prefiguring baptism, which comes in the room of 
 circumcision, now under the gospel, when (the blood of Christ being 
 shed) all bloody ordinances are abolished; it was <I>an outward and 
 sensible sign of an inward and spiritual grace signified thereby.</I>

 [2.] <I>A seal of the righteousness of the faith.</I> In general, it 
 was a seal of the covenant of grace, particularly of justification by 
 faith--the covenant of grace, called <I>the righteousness which is of 
 faith</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6"><I>ch.</I> x. 6</A>),
 
 and it refers to an Old-Testament promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:12">Deut. xxx. 12</A>.

 Now if infants were then capable of receiving a seal of the covenant of
 grace, which proves that they then were within the verge of that 
 covenant, how they come to be now cast out of the covenant and 
 incapable of the seal, and by what severe sentence they were thus 
 rejected and incapacitated, those are concerned to make out that not 
 only reject, but nullify and reproach, the baptism of the seed of 
 believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>That he might be the father of all those that believe.</I> Not 
 but that there were those that were justified by faith before Abraham; 
 but of Abraham first it is particularly observed, and in him commenced 
 a much clearer and fuller dispensation of the covenant of grace than 
 any that had been before extant; and there he is called <I>the father 
 of all that believe,</I> because he was so eminent a believer, and so 
 eminently justified by faith, as Jabal was the father of shepherds and 
 Jubal of musicians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:20,21">Gen. iv. 20, 21</A>.

 <I>The father of all those that believe;</I> that is, a standing
 <I>pattern of faith,</I> as parents are examples to their children; and 
 a standing precedent of justification by faith, as the liberties, 
 privileges, honours, and estates, of the fathers descend to their 
 children. Abraham was the father of believers, because to him 
 particularly the <I>magna charta</I> was renewed.

 (1.) The father of believing Gentiles, <I>though they be not 
 circumcised.</I> Zaccheus, a publican, if he believe, is reckoned a son 
 of Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>.

 Abraham being himself uncircumcised when he was justified by faith, 
 uncircumcision can never be a bar. Thus were the doubts and fears of 
 the poor Gentiles anticipated and no room left to question but that 
 righteousness might be imputed to them also,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11,Ga+5:6">Col. iii. 11; Gal. v. 6</A>.

 (2.) The father of believing Jews, not merely as circumcised, and of
 the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, but because believers, 
 because they <I>are not of the circumcision only</I> (that is, are not 
 only circumcised), <I>but walk in the steps of that faith</I>--have not 
 only the sign, but the thing signified--not only are of Abraham's 
 family, but follow the example of Abraham's faith. See here who are the 
 genuine children and lawful successors of those that were the church's 
 fathers: not those that sit in their chairs, and bear their names, but 
 those that tread in their steps; this is the line of succession, which 
 holds, notwithstanding interruptions. It seems, then, those were most 
 loud and forward to call Abraham father that had least title to the 
 honours and privileges of his children. Thus those have most reason to 
 call Christ Father, not that bear his name in being Christians in 
 profession, but that tread in his steps.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was before the giving of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>.

 The former observation is levelled against those that confined
 justification to the circumcision, this against those that expected it 
 by the law; now the promise was made to Abraham long before the law. 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:17,18">Gal. iii. 17, 18</A>.
 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What that promise was--<I>that he should be the heir of the
 world,</I> that is, of the land of Canaan, the choicest spot of ground 
 in the world,--or the father of many nations of the world, who sprang
 from him, besides the Israelites,--or the heir of the comforts of the
 life which now is. The meek are said to <I>inherit the earth,</I> and 
 the world is theirs. Though Abraham had so little of the world in 
 possession, yet he was heir of it all. Or, rather, it points at Christ, 
 the seed here mentioned; compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16">Gal. iii. 16</A>,

 <I>To thy seed, which is Christ.</I> Now Christ is the heir of the
 world, the ends of the earth are his possession, and it is in him that 
 Abraham was so. And it refers to that promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>),

 <I>In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it was made to him: <I>Not through the law, but through the 
 righteousness of faith. Not through the law,</I> for that was not yet 
 given: but it was upon that believing which was counted to him for 
 righteousness; it was upon his trusting God, in his leaving his own
 country when God commanded him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>.

 Now, being by faith, it could not be by the law, which he proves by the 
 opposition there is between them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):

 <I>If those who are of the law be heirs;</I> that is, those, and those
 only, and they by virtue of the law (the Jews did, and still do, boast 
 that they are the rightful heirs of the world, because to them the law 
 was given), then <I>faith is made void;</I> for, if it were requisite 
 to an interest in the promise that there should be a perfect 
 performance of the whole law, then the promise can never take its 
 effect, nor is it to any purpose for us to depend upon it, since the 
 way to life by perfect obedience to the law, and spotless sinless 
 innocency, is wholly blocked up, and the law in itself opens no other 
 way. This he proves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>The law worketh wrath</I>--wrath in us to God; it irritates and 
 provokes that carnal mind which is enmity to God, as the damming up of 
 a stream makes it swell--wrath in God against us. It works this, that 
 is, it discovers it, or our breach of the law works it. Now it is 
 certain that we can never expect the inheritance by a law that worketh 
 wrath. How the law works wrath he shows very concisely in the latter 
 part of the verse: <I>Where no law is there is no transgression,</I> an
 acknowledged maxim, which implies, Where there is a law there is 
 transgression and that transgression is provoking, and so the law 
 worketh wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Why the promise was made to him by faith; for three reasons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 (1.) <I>That it might be by grace,</I> that grace might have the honour 
 of it; <I>by grace, and not by the law; by grace, and not of debt, nor 
 of merit;</I> that <I>Grace, grace,</I> might be cried to every stone, 
 especially to the top-stone, in this building. Faith hath particular 
 reference to grace granting, as grace hath reference to faith 
 receiving. <I>By grace,</I> and therefore <I>through faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:8">Eph. ii. 8</A>.

 For God will have every crown thrown at the feet of grace, free grace,
 and every song in heaven sung to that tune, <I>Not unto us, O Lord, not 
 unto us, but unto thy name be the praise.</I>

 (2.) <I>That the promise might be sure.</I> The first covenant, being a 
 covenant of works, was not sure: but, through man's failure, the 
 benefits designed by it were cut off; and therefore, the more 
 effectually to ascertain and ensure the conveyance of the new covenant, 
 there is another way found out, <I>not by works</I> (were it so, the 
 promise would not be sure, because of the continual frailty and 
 infirmity of the flesh), <I>but by faith,</I> which receives all from 
 Christ, and acts in a continual dependence upon him, as the great 
 trustee of our salvation, and in whose keeping it is safe. The covenant 
 is therefore sure, because it is so well ordered in all things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:5">2 Sam. xxiii. 5</A>.

 (3.) <I>That it might be sure to all the seed.</I> If it had been <I>by
 the law,</I> it had been limited to the Jews, <I>to whom pertained the 
 glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4"><I>ch.</I> ix. 4</A>);

 but therefore it was by faith that Gentiles as well as Jews might
 become interested in it, the spiritual as well as the natural seed of
 faithful Abraham. God would contrive the promise in such a way as
 might make it most extensive, to comprehend all true believers, that
 circumcision and uncircumcision might break no squares; and for this
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 he refers us to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:5">Gen. xvii. 5</A>,

 where the reason of the change of his name from <I>Abram--a high
 father, to Abraham--the high father of a multitude,</I> is thus 
 rendered: <I>For a father of many nations have I made thee;</I> that 
 is, all believers, both before and since the coming of Christ in the 
 flesh, should take Abraham for their pattern, and call him 
 <I>father.</I> The Jews say Abraham was the father of all proselytes to 
 the Jewish religion. <I>Behold, he is the father of all the world, 
 which are gathered under the wings of the Divine 
 Majesty.</I>--Maimonides.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having observed when Abraham was justified by faith, and why, for the 
 honour of Abraham and for example to us who call him father, the 
 apostle here describes and commends the faith of Abraham, where 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whom he believed: <I>God who quickeneth.</I> It is God himself that 
 faith fastens upon: <I>other foundation can no man lay.</I> Now observe 
 what in God Abraham's faith had an eye to--to that, certainly, which would
 be most likely to confirm his faith concerning the things promised:--

 1. <I>God who quickeneth the dead.</I> It was promised that he should
 be <I>the father of many nations,</I> when he and his wife were now as 
 good as dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11,12">Heb. xi. 11, 12</A>),

 and therefore he looks upon God as a God that could breathe life into 
 dry bones. He that quickeneth the dead can do any thing, can give a 
 child to Abraham when he is old, can bring the Gentiles, who are 
 <I>dead in trespasses and sins,</I> to a divine and spiritual life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:1">Eph. ii. 1</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19,20">Eph. i. 19, 20</A>.

 2. <I>Who calleth things which are not as though they were;</I> that
 is, creates all things by the word of his power, as in the beginning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:3,2Co+4:6">Gen. i. 3; 2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 The justification and salvation of sinners, the espousing of the
 Gentiles that had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things 
 which are not as though they were, giving being to things that were 
 not. This expresses the sovereignty of God and his absolute power and 
 dominion, a mighty stay to faith when all other props sink and totter.
 It is the holy wisdom and policy of faith to fasten particularly on 
 that in God which is accommodated to the difficulties wherewith it is 
 to wrestle, and will most effectually answer the objections. It is 
 faith indeed to build upon the all-sufficiency of God for the 
 accomplishment of that which is impossible to anything but that 
 all-sufficiency. Thus Abraham became <I>the father of many nations 
 before him whom he believed,</I> that is, in the eye and account of 
 God; or <I>like him whom he believed;</I> as God was a common Father, 
 so was Abraham. It is by faith in God that we become accepted of him, 
 and conformable to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he believed. He here greatly magnifies the strength of 
 Abraham's faith, in several expressions. 

 1. <I>Against hope, he believed in hope,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 There was a hope against him, a natural hope. All the arguments of 
 sense, and reason, and experience, which in such cases usually beget 
 and support hope, were against him; no second causes smiled upon him, 
 nor in the least favoured his hope. But, against all those inducements 
 to the contrary, he believed; for he had a hope for him: <I>He believed 
 in hope,</I> which arose, as his faith did, from the consideration of 
 God's all-sufficiency. <I>That he might become the father of many 
 nations.</I> Therefore God, by his almighty grace, enabled him thus to 
 believe against hope, that he might pass for a pattern of great and 
 strong faith to all generations. It was fit that he who was to be the 
 father of the faithful should have something more than ordinary in his 
 faith--that in him faith should be set in its highest elevation, and so 
 the endeavours of all succeeding believers be directed, raised, and 
 quickened. Or this is mentioned as the matter of the promise that he
 believed; and he refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:5">Gen. xv. 5</A>,

 <I>So shall thy seed be,</I> as the stars of heaven, so innumerable, so 
 illustrious. This was that which he believed, when it was counted to 
 him for righteousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And it is observable that this particular instance of his faith was
 <I>against hope,</I> against the surmises and suggestions of his 
 unbelief. He had just before been concluding hardly that he should go 
 childless, that one born in his house was his heir

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>);

 and this unbelief was a foil to his faith, and bespeaks it a believing 
 against hope. 

 2. <I>Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Observe, His own body was now dead--become utterly unlikely to beget a 
 child, though the new life and vigour that God gave him continued after 
 Sarah was dead, witness his children by Keturah. When God intends some
 special blessing, some child of promise, for his people, he commonly 
 puts a sentence of death upon the blessing itself, and upon all the 
 ways that lead to it. Joseph must be enslaved and imprisoned before he 
 be advanced. But Abraham did not consider this, <B><I>ou 
 katenoese</I></B>--<I>he did not dwell in his thoughts upon it.</I> He 
 said indeed, <I>Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years 
 old?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:17">Gen. xvii. 17</A>.

 But that was the language of his admiration and his desire to be
 further satisfied, not of his doubting and distrust; his faith passed 
 by that consideration, and thought of nothing but the faithfulness of 
 the promise, with the contemplation whereof he was swallowed up, and 
 this kept up his faith. <I>Being not weak in faith, he considered 
 not.</I> It is mere weakness of faith that makes a man lie poring upon 
 the difficulties and seeming impossibilities that lie in the way of a 
 promise. Though it may seem to be the wisdom and policy of carnal 
 reason, yet it is the weakness of faith, to look into the bottom of all 
 the difficulties that arise against the promise.

 3. <I>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and he therefore staggered not because he considered not the frowns and
 discouragements of second causes; <B><I>ou diekrithe</I></B>--<I>he 
 disputed not;</I> he did not hold any self-consultation about it, did 
 not take time to consider whether he should close with it or no, did 
 not hesitate nor stumble at it, but by a resolute and peremptory act of 
 his soul, with a holy boldness, ventured all upon the promise. He took 
 it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate, but 
 presently determined it as a ruled case, did not at all hang in 
 suspense about it: he <I>staggered not through unbelief.</I> Unbelief 
 is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. It is not 
 the promise that fails, but our faith that fails when we stagger. 

 4. He <I>was strong in faith, giving glory to God,</I>
 <B><I>enedynamothe</I></B>--<I>he was strengthened</I> in faith, his 
 faith <I>got ground by exercise--crescit eundo.</I> Though weak faith 
 shall not be rejected, the bruised reed not broken, the smoking flax 
 not quenched, yet strong faith shall be commended and honoured. The
 strength of his faith appeared in the victory it won over his fears.
 And hereby he gave glory to God; for, as unbelief dishonours God by 
 making him a liar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:10">
 1 John v. 10</A>),

 so faith honours God by setting to its seal that he is true, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:33">John iii. 33</A>.
 
 Abraham's faith gave God the glory of his wisdom, power, holiness, 
 goodness, and especially of his faithfulness, resting upon the word 
 that he had spoken. Among men we say, "He that trusts another, gives 
 him credit, and honours him by taking his word;" thus Abraham gave 
 glory to God by trusting him. We never hear our Lord Jesus commending 
 any thing so much as great faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10,15:28">Matt. viii. 10 and xv. 28</A>):

 therefore God gives honour to faith, great faith, because faith, great 
 faith, gives honour to God. 

 5. He was <I>fully persuaded that what God had promised he was able to 
 perform,</I> <B><I>plerophoretheis</I></B>--<I>was carried on with the 
 greatest confidence</I> and assurance; it is a metaphor taken from 
 ships that come into the harbour with full sail. Abraham saw the
 storms of doubts, and fears, and temptations likely to rise against the 
 promise, upon which many a one would have shrunk back, and lain by for 
 fairer days, and waited a smiling gale of sense and reason. But 
 Abraham, having taken God for his pilot, and the promise for his card 
 and compass, resolves to weather his point, and like a bold adventurer 
 sets up all his sails, breaks through all the difficulties, regards
 neither winds nor clouds, but trusts to the strength of his bottom and 
 the wisdom and faithfulness of his pilot, and bravely makes to the 
 harbour, and comes home an unspeakable gainer. Such was his full
 persuasion, and it was built on the omnipotence of God: <I>He was 
 able.</I> Our waverings rise mainly from our distrust of the divine 
 power; and therefore to fix us it is requisite we believe not only that 
 he is faithful, but that he is able, that hath promised. <I>And
 therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Because with such a confidence he ventured his all in the divine 
 promise, God graciously accepted him, and not only answered, but 
 out-did, his expectation. This way of glorifying God by a firm reliance 
 on his bare promise was so very agreeable to God's design, and so very 
 conducive to his honour, that he graciously accepted it as a 
 righteousness, and justified him, though there was not that in the 
 thing itself which could merit such an acceptance. This shows why faith 
 is chosen to be the prime condition of our justification, because it is 
 a grace that of all others gives glory to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was
 imputed to him;
 &nbsp; 24  But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe

 &nbsp; 25  Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for
 our justification.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the chapter, he applies all to us; and, having 
 abundantly proved that Abraham was justified by faith, he here
 concludes that his justification was to be the pattern or sampler of 
 ours: <I>It was not written for his sake alone.</I> It was not intended 
 only for an historical commendation of Abraham, or a relation of 
 something peculiar to him (as some antip&aelig;dobaptists will needs
 understand that circumcision was a <I>seal of the righteousness of the 
 faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 only to Abraham himself, and no other); no, the scripture did not 
 intend hereby to describe some singular way of justification that 
 belonged to Abraham as his prerogative. The accounts we have of the 
 Old-Testament saints were not intended for histories only, barely to 
 inform and divert us, but for precedents to direct us, for ensamples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>)
 
 for <I>our learning,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:4"><I>ch.</I> xv. 4</A>.

 And this particularly concerning Abraham was written <I>for us
 also,</I> to assure us what that righteousness is which God requireth 
 and accepteth to our salvation,--for us also, that are man and vile, 
 that come so far short of Abraham in privileges and performances, us 
 Gentiles as well as the Jews, for the blessing of Abraham comes upon 
 the Gentiles through Christ,--for us on whom the ends of the world are 
 come, as well as for the patriarchs; for the grace of God is the same 
 yesterday, to-day, and for ever. His application of it is but short. 
 Only we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Our common privilege; it shall be imputed to us, that is, 
 righteousness shall. The gospel way of justification is by an imputed 
 righteousness, <B><I>mellei logizesthai</I></B>--<I>it shall be
 imputed;</I> he uses a future verb, to signify the continuation of this 
 mercy in the church, that as it is the same now so it will be while God 
 has a church in the world, and there are any of the children of men to 
 be justified; for there is a fountain opened that is inexhaustible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Our common duty, the condition of this privilege, and that is 
 believing. The proper object of this believing is a divine revelation. 
 The revelation to Abraham was concerning a Christ to come; the 
 revelation to us is concerning a Christ already come, which difference 
 in the revelation does not alter the case. Abraham believed the power 
 of God in raising up an Isaac from the dead womb of Sarah; we are to 
 believe the same power exerted in a higher instance, the resurrection 
 of Christ from the dead. The resurrection of Isaac was in a figure
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:19">Heb. xi. 19</A>);

 the resurrection of Christ was real. Now we are to believe on him that 
 raised up Christ; not only believe his power, that he could do it, but 
 depend upon his grace in raising up Christ as our surety; so he 
 explains it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 where we have a brief account of the meaning of Christ's death and 
 resurrection, which are the two main hinges on which the door of 
 salvation turns. 

 1. He was <I>delivered for our offences.</I> God the Father delivered
 him, he delivered up himself as a sacrifice for sin. He died indeed as
 a malefactor, because he died for sin; but it was not his own sin, but 
 the sins of the people. He died to make atonement for our sins, to 
 expiate our guilt, to satisfy divine justice. 

 2. He was <I>raised again for our justification,</I> for the perfecting
 and completing of our justification. By the merit of his death he paid 
 our debt, in his resurrection he took out our acquittance. When he was 
 buried he lay a prisoner in execution for our debt, which as a surety 
 he had undertaken to pay; on the third day an angel was sent to roll 
 away the stone, and so to discharge the prisoner, which was the 
 greatest assurance possible that divine justice was satisfied, the debt 
 paid, or else he would never have released the prisoner: and therefore 
 the apostle puts a special emphasis on Christ's resurrection; it is 
 Christ that died, <I>yea, rather that has risen again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:34"><I>ch.</I> viii. 34</A>.

 So that upon the whole matter it is very evident that we are not
 justified by the merit of our own works, but by a fiducial obediential 
 dependence upon Jesus Christ and his righteousness, as the condition on
 our part of our right to impunity and salvation, which was the truth
 that Paul in this and the foregoing chapter had been fixing as the
 great spring and foundation of all our comfort.</P>
