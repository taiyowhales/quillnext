 Second Epistle was written soon after the former, and seems to have 
 been designed to prevent a mistake, which might arise from some 
 passages in the former epistle, concerning the second coming of Christ, 
 as if it were near at hand. The apostle in this epistle is careful to 
 prevent any wrong use which some among them might make of those 
 expressions of his that were agreeable to the dialect of the prophets 
 of the Old Testament, and informs them that there were many 
 intermediate counsels yet to be fulfilled before that day of the Lord 
 should come, though, because it is sure, he had spoken of it as near.  
 There are other things that he writes about for their consolation under 
 sufferings, and exhortation and direction in duty.</P>
