 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These
 things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
 stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest,
 and art dead.
 &nbsp; 2  Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
 ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
 &nbsp; 3  Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
 fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come
 on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come
 upon thee.
 &nbsp; 4  Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
 their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they
 are worthy.
 &nbsp; 5  He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
 raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
 life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
 his angels.
 &nbsp; 6  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
 the churches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The preface, showing,

 1. To whom this letter is directed: <I>To the angel of the church of
 Sardis,</I> an ancient city of Lydia, on the banks of the mountain 
 Tmolus, said to have been the chief city of Asia the Less, and the 
 first city in that part of the world that was converted by the 
 preaching of John; and, some say, the first that revolted from 
 Christianity, and one of the first that was laid in its ruins, in which 
 it still lies, without any church or ministry. 

 2. By whom this message was sent--the Lord Jesus, who here assumes the
 character of him <I>that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven 
 stars,</I> taken out of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4"><I>ch.</I> i. 4</A>,

 where <I>the seven spirits are said to be before the throne.</I> 

 (1.) He hath the seven spirits, that is, the Holy Spirit with his 
 various powers, graces, and operations; for he is personally one, 
 though efficaciously various, and may be said here to be seven, which 
 is the number of the churches, and of the angels of the churches, to 
 show that to every minister, and to every church, there is a 
 dispensation and measure of the Spirit given for them to profit 
 withal--a stock of spiritual influence for that minister and church to 
 improve, both for enlargement and continuance, which measure of the 
 Spirit is not ordinarily withdrawn from them, till they forfeit it by 
 misimprovement. Churches have their spiritual stock and fund, as well
 as particular believers; and, this epistle being sent to a languishing 
 ministry and church, they are very fitly put in mind that Christ has 
 the seven spirits, the Spirit without measure and in perfection, to 
 whom they may apply themselves for the reviving of his work among them.
 
 (2.) He hath the seven stars, the angels of the churches; they are 
 disposed of by him, and accountable to him, which should make them 
 faithful and zealous. He has ministers to employ, and spiritual 
 influences to communicate to his ministers for the good of his church.
 The Holy Spirit usually works by the ministry, and the ministry will be 
 of no efficacy without the Spirit; the same divine hand holds them 
 both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The body of this epistle. There is this observable in it, that 
 whereas in the other epistles Christ begins with commending what is 
 good in the churches, and then proceeds to tell them what is amiss, in 
 this (and in the epistle to Laodicea) he begins,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With a reproof, and a very severe one: <I>I know thy works, that 
 thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</I> Hypocrisy, and a 
 lamentable decay in religion, are the sins charged upon this church, by 
 one who knew her well, and all her works.

 (1.) This church had gained a great reputation; it had a name, and a 
 very honourable one, for a flourishing church, a name for vital lively 
 religion, for purity of doctrine, unity among themselves, uniformity in 
 worship, decency, and order. We read not of any unhappy divisions among 
 themselves. Every thing appeared well, as to what falls under the 
 observation of men.

 (2.) This church was not really what it was reputed to be. They had a 
 name to live, but they were dead; there was a form of godliness, but 
 not the power, <I>a name to live,</I> but not a principle of life. If 
 there was not a total privation of life, yet there was a great deadness 
 in their souls and in their services, a great deadness in the spirits 
 of their ministers, and a great deadness in their ministrations, in 
 their praying, in their preaching, in their converse, and a great 
 deadness in the people in hearing, in prayer, and in conversation; what 
 little life was yet left among them was, in a manner, expiring, ready 
 to die.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Our Lord proceeds to give this degenerate church the best advice: 
 <I>Be watchful, and strengthen the things,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 (1.) He advises them to be upon their watch. The cause of their sinful 
 deadness and declension was that they had let down their watch. 
 Whenever we are off our watch, we lose ground, and therefore must 
 return to our watchfulness against sin, and Satan, and whatever is 
 destructive to the life and power of godliness. 

 (2.) To strengthen the things that remain, and that are ready to die. 
 Some understand this of persons; there were some few who had retained 
 their integrity, but they were in danger of declining with the rest. It 
 is a difficult thing to keep up to the life and <I>power of 
 godliness</I> ourselves, when we see a universal deadness and 
 declension prevailing round about us. Or it may be understood of 
 practices, as it follows: <I>I have not found thy works perfect before 
 God,</I> not filled up; there is something wanting in them; there is 
 the shell, but not the kernel; there is the carcase, but not the 
 soul--the shadow, but not the substance. The inward thing is wanting, 
 thy works are hollow and empty; prayers are not filled up with holy 
 desires, alms-deeds not filled up with true charity, sabbaths not 
 filled up with suitable devotion of soul to God; there are not inward 
 affections suitable to outward acts and expressions. Now when the 
 spirit is wanting the form cannot long subsist. 

 (3.) To recollect themselves, and <I>remember how they have received 
 and heard</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 not only to remember what they had received and heard, what messages 
 they had received from God, what tokens of his mercy and favour towards 
 them, what sermons they had heard, but how they had received and heard, 
 what impressions the mercies of God had made upon their souls at first, 
 what affections they felt working under their word and ordinances, the 
 love of their espousals, the kindness of their youth, how welcome the 
 gospel and the grace of God were to them when they first received them. 
 <I>Where is the blessedness they then spoke of?</I> 

 (4.) To hold fast what they had received, that they might not lose all, 
 <I>and repent</I> sincerely that they had lost so much of the life of 
 religion, and had run the risk of losing all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ enforces his counsel with a dreadful threatening in case it 
 should be despised: <I>I will come unto thee as a thief, and thou shalt 
 not know the hour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) When Christ leaves a people as to his gracious presence, he comes 
 to them in judgment; and his judicial presence will be very dreadful to 
 those who have sinned away his gracious presence. 

 (2.) His judicial approach to a dead declining people will be 
 surprising; their deadness will keep them in security, and, as it 
 procures an angry visit from Christ to them, it will prevent their 
 discerning it and preparing for it. 

 (3.) Such a visit from Christ will be to their loss; he will come as a 
 thief, to strip them of their remaining enjoyments and mercies, not by 
 fraud, but in justice and righteousness, taking the forfeiture they 
 have made of all to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Our blessed Lord does not leave this sinful people without some 
 comfort and encouragement: <I>In the midst of judgment he remembers 
 mercy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 and here 

 (1.) He makes honourable mention of the faithful remnant in Sardis, 
 though but small: <I>Thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not 
 defiled their garments;</I> they had not given into the prevailing 
 corruptions and pollution of the day and place in which they lived. God 
 takes notice of the smallest number of those who abide with him; and 
 the fewer they are the more precious in his sight.

 (2.) He makes a very gracious promise to them: <I>They shall walk with 
 me in white, for they are worthy</I>--in the <I>stola,</I> the white 
 robes of justification, and adoption, and comfort, or in the white 
 robes of honour and glory in the other world. They shall walk with 
 Christ in the pleasant walks of the heavenly paradise; and what 
 delightful converse will there be between Christ and them when they 
 thus walk together! This is an honour proper and suitable to their
 integrity, which their fidelity has prepared them for, and which it is 
 no way unbecoming Christ to confer upon them, though it is not a legal 
 but a gospel worthiness that is ascribed to them, not merit but 
 meetness. Those who walk with Christ in the clean garments of real 
 practical holiness here, and keep themselves unspotted from the world, 
 shall walk with Christ in the white robes of honour and glory in the 
 other world: this is a suitable reward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We now come to the conclusion of this epistle, in which, as 
 before, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A great reward promised to the conquering Christian 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and it is very much the same with what has been already mentioned: 
 <I>He that overcometh shall be clothed in white raiment.</I> The purity 
 of grace shall be rewarded with the perfect purity of glory. Holiness, 
 when perfected, shall be its own reward; glory is the perfection of 
 grace, differing not in kind, but in degree. Now to this is added 
 another promise very suitable to the case: <I>I will not blot his name 
 out of the book of life, but will confess his name before my Father, 
 and before his angels.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Christ has his book of life, a register and roll of all who shall 
 inherit eternal life. 
 
 [1.] The book of eternal election. 

 [2.] The book of remembrance of all those who have lived to God, and 
 have kept up the life and power of godliness in evil times.

 (2.) Christ will not blot the names of his chosen and faithful ones out 
 of this book of life; men may be enrolled in the registers of the 
 church, as baptized, as making a profession, as having a name to live, 
 and that name may come to be blotted out of the roll, when it appears 
 that it was but a name, a name to live, without spiritual life; such 
 often lose the very name before they die, they are left of God to blot 
 out their own names by their gross and open wickedness. But the names 
 of those that overcome shall never be blotted out. 

 (3.) Christ will produce this book of life, and confess the names of 
 the faithful who stand there, before God, and all the angels; he will 
 do this as their Judge, when the books shall be opened; he will do this 
 as their captain and head, leading them with him triumphantly to 
 heaven, presenting them to the Father: <I>Behold me, and the children 
 that thou hast given me.</I> How great will this honour and reward 
 be!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The demand of universal attention finishes the message. Every word 
 from God deserves attention from men; that which may seem more 
 particularly directed to one body of men has something in it 
 instructive to all.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
 things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the
 key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth,
 and no man openeth;
 &nbsp; 8  I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open
 door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength,
 and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
 they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them
 to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have
 loved thee.
 &nbsp; 10  Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
 keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all
 the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

 God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the
 name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, <I>which is</I>
 new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and
 <I>I will write upon him</I> my new name.

 the churches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have now come to the sixth letter, sent to one of the Asian 
 churches, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription, showing,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For whom it was more immediately designed: <I>The angel of the 
 church of Philadelphia;</I> this also was a city in Asia Minor, seated 
 upon the borders of Mysia and Lydia, and had its name from that 
 brotherly love for which it was eminent. We can hardly suppose that 
 this name was given to it after it received the Christian religion, and 
 that it was so called from that Christian affection that all believers 
 have, and should have, one for another, as the children of one Father 
 and the brethren of Christ; but rather that it was its ancient name, on 
 account of the love and kindness which the citizens had and showed to 
 each other as a civil fraternity. This was an excellent spirit, and, 
 when sanctified by the grace of the gospel, would render them an 
 excellent church, as indeed they were, for here is no one fault found 
 with this church, and yet, doubtless, there were faults in it of common 
 infirmity; but love covers such faults.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By whom this letter was signed; even by the same Jesus who is alone 
 the universal head of all the churches; and here observe by what title 
 he chooses to represent himself to this church: <I>He that is holy, he 
 that is true, he that hath the key of David,</I> &c. You have his 
 personal character: <I>He that is holy</I> and <I>he that is true,</I> 
 holy in his nature, and therefore he cannot but be true to his word, 
 for he hath spoken in his holiness; and you have also his political 
 character: <I>He hath the key of David, he openeth, and no man 
 shutteth; he hath the key of the house of David,</I> the key of 
 government and authority in and over the church. Observe, 

 (1.) The acts of his government. 

 [1.] He opens. He opens a door of opportunity to his churches; he opens
 a door of utterance to his ministers; he opens a door of entrance, 
 opens the heart; he opens a door of admission into the visible church, 
 laying down the terms of communion; and he opens the door of admission 
 into the church triumphant, according to the terms of salvation fixed 
 by him.

 [2.] He shuts the door. When he pleases, he shuts the door of
 opportunity and the door of utterance, and leaves obstinate sinners 
 shut up in the hardness of their hearts; he shuts the door of 
 church-fellowship against unbelievers and profane persons; and he shuts 
 the door of heaven against the foolish virgins who have slept away 
 their day of grace, and against the workers of iniquity, how vain and 
 confident soever they may be.

 (2.) The way and manner in which he performs these acts, and that is 
 absolute sovereignty, independent upon the will of men, and 
 irresistible by the power of men: <I>He openeth, and no man shutteth; 
 he shutteth, and no man openeth;</I> he works to will and to do, and, 
 when he works, none can hinder. These were proper characters for him, 
 when speaking to a church that had endeavoured to be conformed to 
 Christ in holiness and truth, and that had enjoyed a wide door of 
 liberty and opportunity under his care and government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The subject-matter of this epistle, where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ puts them in mind of what he had done for them: <I>I have set 
 before thee an open door, and no man can shut it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 I have set it open, and kept it open, though there be many adversaries. 
 Learn here,

 (1.) Christ is to be acknowledged as the author of all the liberty and 
 opportunity his churches enjoy. 

 (2.) He takes notice and keeps account, how long he has preserved their 
 spiritual liberties and privileges for them. 

 (3.) Wicked men envy the people of God their door of liberty, and would 
 be glad to shut it against them. 

 (4.) If we do not provoke Christ to shut this door against us, men 
 cannot do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This church is commended: <I>Thou hast a little strength, and hast 
 kept my word, and hast not denied my name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 In this there seems to be couched a gentle reproof: "<I>Thou hast a 
 little strength,</I> a little grace, which, though it be not 
 proportionate to the wide door of opportunity which I have opened to 
 thee, yet is true grace, and has kept thee faithful." True grace, 
 though weak, has the divine approbation; but, though Christ accepts a 
 little strength, yet believers should not rest satisfied in a little, 
 but should strive to grow in grace, to be <I>strong in faith, giving 
 glory to God.</I> True grace, though weak, will do more than the 
 greatest gifts or highest degrees of common grace, for it will enable 
 the Christian to keep the word of Christ, and not to deny his name. 
 Obedience, fidelity, and a free confession of the name of Christ, are 
 the fruits of true grace, and are pleasing to Christ as such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is a promise of the great favour God would bestow on this 
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 This favour consists in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ would make this church's enemies subject to her. 

 [1.] Those enemies are described to be such as <I>said they were
 Jews,</I> but lied in saying so--pretended to be the only and peculiar 
 people of God, but were really <I>the synagogue of Satan.</I> 
 Assemblies that <I>worship God in spirit and in truth</I> are the 
 Israel of God; assemblies that either worship false gods, or the true 
 God in a false manner, are the synagogues of Satan: though they may 
 profess to be the only people of God, their profession is a lie.

 [2.] Their subjection to the church is described: <I>They shall worship
 at thy feet;</I> not pay a religious and divine honour to the church 
 itself, nor to the ministry of it, but shall be convinced that they 
 have been in the wrong, that this church is in the right and is beloved 
 of Christ, and they shall desire to be taken into communion with her 
 and that they may worship the same God after the same manner. How shall 
 this great change be wrought? By the power of God upon the hearts of 
 his enemies, and by signal discoveries of his peculiar favour to his 
 church: <I>They shall know that I have loved thee.</I> Observe, 
 <I>First,</I> The greatest honour and happiness any church can enjoy 
 consist in the peculiar love and favour of Christ. <I>Secondly,</I>
 Christ can discover this his favour to his people in such a manner that 
 their very enemies shall see it, and be forced to acknowledge it. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> This will, by the grace of Christ, soften the hearts of 
 their enemies, and make them desirous to be admitted into communion 
 with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Another instance of favour that Christ promises to this church is 
 persevering grace in the most trying times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and this as the reward of their past fidelity. <I>To him that hath 
 shall be given.</I> Here observe, 

 [1.] The gospel of Christ is the word of his patience. It is the fruit 
 of the patience of God to a sinful world; it sets before men the 
 exemplary patience of Christ in all his sufferings for men; it calls 
 those that receive it to the exercise of patience in conformity to 
 Christ.

 [2.] This gospel should be carefully kept by all that enjoy it; they 
 must keep up to the faith, and practice, and worship prescribed in the 
 gospel.

 [3.] After a day of patience we must expect an hour of temptation; a 
 day of gospel peace and liberty is a day of God's patience, and it is 
 seldom so well improved as it should be and therefore it is often 
 followed by an hour of trial and temptation.

 [4.] Sometimes the trial is more general and universal; it comes upon 
 all the world, and, when it is so general, it is usually the shorter.

 [5.] Those who keep the gospel in a time of peace shall be kept by 
 Christ in an hour of temptation. By keeping the gospel they are 
 prepared for the trial; and the same divine grace that has made them 
 fruitful in times of peace will make them faithful in times of 
 persecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ calls the church to that duty which he before promised he 
 would enable her to do, and that is, to persevere, <I>to hold fast that 
 which she had.</I> 

 (1.) The duty itself: "<I>Hold fast that which thou hast,</I> that 
 faith, that truth, that strength of grace, that zeal, that love to the 
 brethren; thou hast been possessed of this excellent treasure, hold it 
 fast." 

 (2.) The motives, taken from the speedy appearance of Christ: 
 "<I>Behold, I come quickly.</I> See, I am just a coming to relieve them 
 under the trial, to reward their fidelity, and to punish those who fall 
 away; they shall lose that crown which they once seemed to have a right 
 to, which they hoped for, and pleased themselves with the thoughts of.
 The persevering Christian shall win the prize from backsliding 
 professors, who once stood fair for it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conclusion of this epistle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. After his usual manner, our Saviour promises a glorious reward to 
 the victorious believer, in two things:--

 (1.) He shall be a monumental <I>pillar in the temple of God;</I> not a
 pillar to support the temple (heaven needs no such props), but a 
 monument of the free and powerful grace of God, a monument that shall 
 never be defaced nor removed, as many stately pillars erected in honour 
 to the Roman emperors and generals have been. 

 (2.) On this monumental pillar there shall be an honourable 
 inscription, as in those cases is usual. 

 [1.] <I>The name of God,</I> in whose cause he engaged, whom he served, 
 and for whom he suffered in this warfare; <I>and the name of the city 
 of God,</I> the church of God, <I>the new Jerusalem, which came down 
 from heaven.</I> On this pillar shall be recorded all the services the 
 believer did to the church of God, how he asserted her rights, enlarged 
 her borders, maintained her purity and honour; this will be a greater 
 name than <I>Asiaticus,</I> or <I>Africanus;</I> a soldier under God in 
 the wars of the church. And then another part of the inscription is,

 [2.] The <I>new name</I> of Christ, the Mediator, the Redeemer, the 
 captain of our salvation; by this it will appear under whose banner 
 this conquering believer had enlisted, under whose conduct he acted, by 
 whose example he was encouraged, and under whose influence he fought 
 the good fight, and came off victorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The epistle is closed up with the demand of attention: <I>He that 
 hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,</I> 
 how Christ loves and values his faithful people, how he commends, and 
 how he will crown their fidelity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
 These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
 beginning of the creation of God;
 &nbsp; 15  I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I
 would thou wert cold or hot.
 &nbsp; 16  So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
 I will spue thee out of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 17  Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
 and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,
 and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
 &nbsp; 18  I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that
 thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
 clothed, and <I>that</I> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and
 anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou mayest see.
 &nbsp; 19  As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
 therefore, and repent.
 &nbsp; 20  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
 voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
 with him, and he with me.
 &nbsp; 21  To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
 throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father
 in his throne.
 &nbsp; 22  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
 the churches.

 We now come to the last and worst of all the seven Asian churches, the 
 reverse of the church of Philadelphia; for, as there was nothing 
 reproved in that, here is nothing commended in this, and yet this was 
 one of <I>the seven golden candlesticks,</I> for a corrupt church may 
 still be a church. Here we have, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription, to whom, and from whom. 

 1. To whom: <I>To the angel of the church of Laodicea.</I> This was a
 once famous city near the river Lycus, had a wall of vast compass, and 
 three marble theatres, and, like Rome, was built on seven hills. It
 seems, the apostle Paul was very instrumental in planting the gospel in 
 this city, from which he wrote a letter, as he mentions in <I>the 
 epistle to the Colossians,</I> the last chapter, in which he sends 
 salutations to them, Laodicea not being above twenty miles distant from 
 Colosse. In this city was held a council in the fourth century, but it 
 has been long since demolished, and lies in its ruins to this day, an 
 awful monument of <I>the wrath of the Lamb.</I> 

 2. From whom this message was sent. Here our Lord Jesus styles himself
 <I>the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the 
 creation of God.</I>

 (1.) <I>The Amen,</I> one that is steady and unchangeable in all his 
 purposes and promises, which are all yea, and all amen. 

 (2.) <I>The faithful and true witness,</I> whose testimony of God to 
 men ought to be received and fully believed, and whose testimony of men 
 to God will be fully believed and regarded, and will be a swift but 
 true witness against all indifferent lukewarm professors.

 (3.) <I>The beginning of the creation of God,</I> either of the first 
 creation, and so he is the beginning, that is, the first cause, the 
 Creator, and the Governor of it; or of the second creation, the church; 
 and so he is the head of that body, the first-born from the dead, as it 
 is in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>,

 whence these titles are taken. Christ, having raised up himself by his
 own divine power, as the head of a new world, raises up dead souls to 
 be a living temple and church to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The subject-matter, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The heavy charge drawn up against this church, ministers and people, 
 by one who knew them better than they knew themselves: <I>Thou art 
 neither cold nor hot,</I> but worse than either; <I>I would thou wert 
 cold or hot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Lukewarmness or indifference in religion is the worst temper in the 
 world. If religion is a real thing, it is the most excellent thing, and 
 therefore we should be in good earnest in it; if it is not a real 
 thing, it is the vilest imposture, and we should be earnest against it. 
 If religion is worth any thing, it is worth every thing; an 
 indifference here is inexcusable: <I>Why halt you between two opinions? 
 If God be God, follow him; if Baal</I> (be God), <I>follow him.</I> 
 Here is no room for neutrality. An open enemy shall have a fairer 
 quarter than a perfidious neuter; and there is more hope of a heathen 
 than of such. Christ expects that men should declare themselves in 
 earnest either for him or against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A severe punishment threatened: <I>I will spue thee out of my 
 mouth.</I> As lukewarm water turns the stomach, and provokes to a 
 vomit, lukewarm professors turn the heart of Christ against them. He is 
 sick of them, and cannot long bear them. They may call their 
 lukewarmness <I>charity, meekness, moderation,</I> and <I>a largeness 
 of soul;</I> it is nauseous to Christ, and makes those so that allow 
 themselves in it. They shall be rejected, and finally rejected; for far 
 be it from the holy Jesus to return to that which has been thus 
 rejected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We have one cause of this indifference and inconsistency in religion 
 assigned, and that is self-conceitedness or self-delusion. They thought
 they were very well already, and therefore they were very indifferent 
 whether they grew better or no: <I>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and 
 increased with goods,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Here observe, What a difference there was between the thoughts they had 
 of themselves and the thoughts that Christ had of them.

 (1.) The high thoughts they had of themselves: <I>Thou sayest, I am 
 rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,</I> rich, and 
 growing richer, and increased to such a degree as to be above all want 
 or possibility of wanting. Perhaps they were well provided for as to 
 their bodies, and this made them overlook the necessities of their 
 souls. Or they thought themselves well furnished in their souls: they 
 had learning, and they took it for religion; they had gifts, and they 
 took them for grace; they had wit, and they took it for true wisdom; 
 they had ordinances, and they took up with them instead of the God of 
 ordinances. How careful should we be not to put the cheat upon our own 
 souls! Doubtless there are many in hell that once thought themselves to 
 be in the way to heaven. Let us daily beg of God that we may not be 
 left to flatter and deceive ourselves in the concerns of our souls. 
 
 (2.) The mean thoughts that Christ had of them; and he was not 
 mistaken. He knew, though they knew not, that they were <I>wretched, 
 and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</I> Their state was 
 wretched in itself, and such as called for pity and compassion from 
 others: though they were proud of themselves, they were pitied by all 
 who knew their case. For, 

 [1.] They were poor, really poor, when they said and thought they were 
 rich; they had no provision for their souls to live upon; their souls 
 were starving in the midst of their abundance; they were vastly in debt 
 to the justice of God, and had nothing to pay off the least part of the 
 debt.

 [2.] They were <I>blind;</I> they could not see their state, nor their 
 way, nor their danger; they could not see into themselves; they could 
 not look before them; they were blind, and yet they thought they saw; 
 the very light that was in them was darkness, and then how great must 
 that darkness be! They could not see Christ, though evidently set 
 forth, and crucified, before their eyes. They could not see God by 
 faith, though always present in them. They could not see death, though 
 it was just before them. They could not look into eternity, though they 
 stood upon the very brink of it continually.

 [3.] They were naked, without clothing and without house and harbour 
 for their souls. They were without clothing, had neither the garment of 
 justification nor that of sanctification. Their nakedness both of guilt 
 and pollution had no covering. They lay always exposed to sin and 
 shame. Their righteousnesses were but filthy rags; they were rags, and 
 would not cover them, filthy rags, and would defile them. And they were 
 naked, without house or harbour, for they were without God, and he has 
 been the dwelling-place of his people in all ages; in him alone the 
 soul of man can find rest, and safety, and all suitable accommodations. 
 The riches of the body will not enrich the soul; the sight of the body 
 will not enlighten the soul; the most convenient house for the body 
 will not afford rest nor safety to the soul. The soul is a different 
 thing from the body, and must have accommodation suitable to its 
 nature, or else in the midst of bodily prosperity it will be wretched 
 and miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We have good counsel given by Christ to this sinful people, and that 
 is that they drop their vain and false opinion they had of themselves, 
 and endeavour to be that really which they would seem to be: <I>I 
 counsel thee to buy of me,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus Christ continues to give good counsel to those who 
 have cast his counsels behind their backs. 

 (2.) The condition of sinners is never desperate, while they enjoy the
 gracious calls and counsels of Christ.

 (3.) Our blessed Lord, the counsellor, always gives the best advice, 
 and that which is most suitable to the sinner's case; as here, 

 [1.] These people were poor; Christ counsels them to buy of him gold 
 tried in the fire, that they might be rich. He lets them know where 
 they might have true riches and how they might have them.
 <I>First,</I> Where they might have them--from himself; he sends them 
 not to the streams of Pactolus, nor to the mines of Potosi, but invites 
 them to himself, the pearl of price. <I>Secondly,</I> And how must they 
 have this true gold from him? They must buy it. This seems to be
 unsaying all again. How can those that are poor buy gold? Just as they 
 may buy of Christ wine and milk, that is, <I>without money and without 
 price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>.

 Something indeed must be parted with, but it is nothing of a valuable
 consideration, it is only to make room for receiving true riches. "Part 
 with sin and self-sufficiency, and come to Christ with a sense of your 
 poverty and emptiness, that you may be filled with his hidden 
 treasure."

 [2.] These people were naked; Christ tells them where they might have 
 clothing, and such as would cover the shame of their nakedness. This 
 they must receive from Christ; and they must only put off their filthy 
 rags that they might put on the white raiment which he had purchased 
 and provided for them--his own imputed righteousness for justification 
 and the garments of holiness and sanctification.

 [3.] They were blind; and he <I>counsels them to buy of him eye-salve, 
 that they might see,</I> to give up their own wisdom and reason, which 
 are but blindness in the things of God, and resign themselves to his 
 word and Spirit, and their eyes shall be opened to see their way and 
 their end, their duty and their true interest; a new and glorious scene 
 would then open itself to their souls; a new world furnished with the 
 most beautiful and excellent objects, and this light would be 
 marvellous to those who were but just now delivered from the powers of 
 darkness. This is the wise and good counsel Christ gives to careless 
 souls; and, if they follow it, he will judge himself bound in honour to 
 make it effectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Here is added great and gracious encouragement to this sinful people 
 to take the admonition and advice well that Christ had given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 
 He tells them,

 (1.) It was given them in true and tender affection: "<I>Whom I love, I 
 rebuke and chasten.</I> You may think I have given you hard words and 
 severe reproofs; it is all out of love to your souls. I would not have 
 thus openly rebuked and corrected your sinful lukewarmness and vain 
 confidence, if I had not been a lover of your souls; had I hated you, I 
 would have let you alone, to go on in sin till it had been your ruin." 
 Sinners ought to take the rebukes of God's word and rod as tokens of 
 his good-will to their souls, and should accordingly repent in good 
 earnest, and turn to him that smites them; better are the frowns and 
 wounds of a friend than the flattering smiles of an enemy. 

 (2.) If they would comply with his admonitions, he was ready to make 
 them good to their souls: <I>Behold, I stand at the door and knock,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 [1.] Christ is graciously pleased by his word and Spirit to come to the 
 door of the heart of sinners; he draws near to them in a way of mercy, 
 ready to make them a kind visit.

 [2.] He finds this door shut against him; the heart of man is by nature 
 shut up against Christ by ignorance, unbelief, sinful prejudices.

 [3.] When he finds the heart shut, he does not immediately withdraw, 
 but he waits to be gracious, even till his head be filled with the dew.

 [4.] He uses all proper means to awaken sinners, and to cause them to 
 open to him: he calls by his word, he knocks by the impulses of his 
 Spirit upon their conscience.

 [5.] Those who open to him shall enjoy his presence, to their great 
 comfort and advantage. He will sup with them; he will accept of what is 
 good in them; he will eat his pleasant fruit; and he will bring the 
 best part of the entertainment with him. If what he finds would make 
 but a poor feast, what he brings will make up the deficiency: he will 
 give fresh supplies of graces and comforts, and thereby stir up fresh 
 actings of faith, and love, and delight; and in all this Christ and his 
 repenting people will enjoy pleasant communion with each other. Alas! 
 what do careless obstinate sinners lose by refusing to open the door of 
 the heart to Christ!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We now come to the conclusion of this epistle; and here we have as 
 before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The promise made to the overcoming believer. It is here implied, 
 
 (1.) That though this church seemed to be wholly overrun and overcome 
 with lukewarmness and self-confidence, yet it was possible that by the 
 reproofs and counsels of Christ they might be inspired with fresh zeal 
 and vigour, and might come off conquerors in their spiritual warfare. 
 
 (2.) That, if they did so, all former faults should be forgiven, and 
 they should have a great reward. And what is that reward? <I>They shall 
 sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and have sat down 
 with my Father on his throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Here it is intimated,

 [1.] That Christ himself had met with his temptations and conflicts.

 [2.] That he overcame them all, and was more than a conqueror.

 [3.] That, as the reward of his conflict and victory, he has sat down 
 with God the Father on his throne, possessed of that glory which he had 
 with the Father from eternity, but which he was pleased very much to 
 conceal on earth, leaving it as it were in the hands of the Father, as 
 a pledge that he would fulfil the work of a Saviour before he reassumed 
 that manifestative glory; and, having done so, then <I>pignus 
 reposcere--he demands the pledge,</I> to appear in his divine glory 
 equal to the Father.

 [4.] That those who are conformed to Christ in his trials and victories 
 shall be conformed to him in his glory; they shall sit down with him on 
 his throne, on his throne of judgment at the end of the world, on his 
 throne of glory to all eternity, shining in his beams by virtue of 
 their union with him and relation to him, as the mystical body of which 
 he is the head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. All is closed up with the general demand of attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 putting all to whom these epistles shall come in mind that what is
 contained in them is not of private interpretation, not intended for 
 the instruction, reproof, and correction of those particular churches 
 only, but of all the churches of Christ in all ages and parts of the 
 world: and as there will be a resemblance in all succeeding churches to 
 these, both in their graces and sins, so they may expect that God will 
 deal with them as he dealt with these, which are patterns to all ages 
 what faithful, and fruitful churches may expect to receive from God, 
 and what those who are unfaithful may expect to suffer from his hand; 
 yea, that God's dealings with his churches may afford useful 
 instruction to the rest of the world, to put them upon considering, 
 <I>If judgment begin at the house of God, what shall the end of those 
 be that do not obey the gospel of Christ?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1 Pet. iv. 17</A>.

 Thus end the messages of Christ to the Asian churches, the epistolary
 part of this book. We now come to the prophetical part.</P>
