 The general exhortation to holiness is continued, and enforced by
 several reasons taken from the foundation on which Christians are
 built, Jesus Christ, and from their spiritual blessings and privileges
 in him. The means of obtaining it, the word of God, is recommended, and
 all contrary qualities are condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>.

 Particular directions are given how subjects ought to obey the
 magistrates, and servants their masters, patiently suffering in well 
 doing, in imitation of Christ,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
 hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
 &nbsp; 2  As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that
 ye may grow thereby:
 &nbsp; 3  If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <I>is</I> gracious.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The holy apostle has been recommending mutual charity, and setting 
 forth the excellences of the word of God, calling it an 
 <I>incorruptible seed,</I> and saying that it <I>liveth and abideth for 
 ever.</I> He pursues his discourse, and very properly comes in with 
 this necessary advice, <I>Wherefore laying aside all malice,</I> &c. 
 These are such sins as both destroy charity and hinder the efficacy of 
 the word, and consequently they prevent our regeneration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His advice is to lay aside or put off what is evil, as one would do 
 an old rotten garment: "Cast it away with indignation, never put it on 
 more."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sins to be put off, or thrown aside, are, 

 (1.) <I>Malice,</I> which may be taken more generally for all sorts of 
 wickedness, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:21,1Co+5:8">Jam. i. 21; 1 Cor. v. 8</A>.

 But, in a more confined sense, malice is anger resting in the bosom of 
 fools, settled overgrown anger, retained till it inflames a man to 
 design mischief, to do mischief, or delight in any mischief that befals 
 another.

 (2.) <I>Guile,</I> or deceit in words. So it comprehends flattery,
 falsehood, and delusion, which is a crafty imposing upon another's 
 ignorance or weakness, to his damage. 

 (3.) <I>Hypocrisies.</I> The word being plural comprehends all sorts of 
 hypocrisies. In matters of religion hypocrisy is counterfeit piety. In 
 civil conversation hypocrisy is counterfeit friendship, which is much 
 practised by those who give high compliments, which they do not 
 believe, make promises which they never intend to perform, or pretend 
 friendship when mischief lies in their hearts. 

 (4.) <I>All envies;</I> every thing that may be called <I>envy,</I> 
 which is a grieving at the good and welfare of another, at their 
 abilities, prosperity, fame, or successful labours.

 (5.) <I>Evil speaking,</I> which is detraction, speaking against 
 another, or defaming him; it is rendered <I>backbiting,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:20,Ro+1:30">2 Cor. xii. 20; Rom. i. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hence learn, 

 (1.) The best Christians have need to be cautioned and warned against 
 the worst sins, such as malice, hypocrisy, envy. They are but 
 sanctified in part, and are still liable to temptations. 

 (2.) Our best services towards God will neither please him nor profit 
 us if we be not conscientious in our duties to men. The sins here 
 mentioned are offences against the second table. These must be laid 
 aside, or else we cannot receive the word of God as we ought to do. 
 
 (3.) Whereas it is said <I>all malice, all guile,</I> learn, That one 
 sin, not laid aside, will hinder our spiritual profit and everlasting 
 welfare. 

 (4.) Malice, envy, hatred, hypocrisy, and evil-speaking, generally go 
 together. Evil-speaking is a sign that malice and guile lie in the
 heart; and all of them combine to hinder our profiting by the word of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle, like a wise physician, having prescribed the purging 
 out of vicious humours, goes on to direct to wholesome and regular 
 food, that they may grow thereby. The duty exhorted to is a strong and 
 constant desire for the <I>word of God,</I> which word is here called 
 <I>reasonable milk,</I> only, this phrase not being proper English, our 
 translators rendered it <I>the milk of the word,</I> by which we are to 
 understand food proper for the soul, or a reasonable creature, whereby 
 the mind, not the body, is nourished and strengthened. This milk of the 
 word must be <I>sincere,</I> not adulterated by the mixtures of men, 
 who often corrupt the word of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:17">2 Cor. ii. 17</A>.

 The manner in which they are to desire this sincere milk of the word is
 stated thus: <I>As new-born babes.</I> He puts them in mind of their 
 regeneration. A new life requires suitable food. They, being newly 
 born, must desire the milk of the word. Infants desire common milk, and 
 their desires towards it are fervent and frequent, arising from an 
 impatient sense of hunger, and accompanied with the best endeavours of 
 which the infant is capable. Such must Christians' desires be for the 
 word of God: and that for this end, that they may grow thereby, that we 
 may improve in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18">2 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 Learn,

 1. Strong desires and affections to the word of God are a sure evidence
 of a person's being born again. If they be such desires as the babe has 
 for the milk, they prove that the person is new-born. They are the 
 lowest evidence, but yet they are certain. 

 2. Growth and improvement in wisdom and grace are the design and desire 
 of every Christian; all spiritual means are for edification and 
 improvement. The word of God, rightly used, does not leave a man as it 
 finds him, but improves and makes him better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He adds an argument from their own experience: <I>If so be,</I> or 
 <I>since that,</I> or <I>forasmuch as, you have tasted that the Lord is 
 gracious,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The apostle does not express a doubt, but affirms that these good 
 Christians had tasted the goodness of God, and hence argues with them. 
 "You ought to lay aside these vile sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 you ought to desire the word of God; you ought to grow thereby, since 
 you cannot deny but that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." 
 The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:4">next verse</A>

 assures us that the Lord here spoken of is the Lord Jesus Christ. Hence
 learn,

 1. Our Lord Jesus Christ is very gracious to his people. He is in
 himself infinitely good; he is very kind, free, and merciful to 
 miserable sinners; he is pitiful and good to the undeserving; he has in 
 him a fulness of grace. 

 2. The graciousness of our Redeemer is best discovered by an 
 experimental taste of it. There must be an immediate application of the 
 object to the organ of taste; we cannot taste at a distance, as we may 
 see, and hear, and smell. To taste the graciousness of Christ 
 experimentally supposes our being united to him by faith, and then we 
 may taste his goodness in all his providences, in all our spiritual 
 concerns, in all our fears and temptations, in his word and worship 
 every day. 

 3. The best of God's servants have in this life but a taste of the
 grace of Christ. A taste is but a little; it is not a draught, nor does
 it satisfy. It is so with the consolations of God in this life. 

 4. The word of God is the great instrument whereby he discovers and
 communicates his grace to men. Those who feed upon the sincere milk of 
 the word taste and experience most of his grace. In our converses with 
 his word we should endeavour always to understand and experience more 
 and more of his grace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  To whom coming, <I>as unto</I> a living stone, disallowed indeed
 of men, but chosen of God, <I>and</I> precious,
 &nbsp; 5  Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
 holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
 God by Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 6  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I
 lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that

 &nbsp; 7  Unto you therefore which believe <I>he is</I> precious: but unto

 good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle here gives us a description of Jesus Christ as a living 
 stone; and though to a capricious wit, or an infidel, this description 
 may seem rough and harsh, yet to the Jews, who placed much of their 
 religion in their magnificent temple, and who understood the 
 prophetical style, which calls the Messiah <I>a stone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14,28:16">Isa. viii. 14; xxviii. 16</A>),
 
 it would appear very elegant and proper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In this metaphorical description of Jesus Christ, he is called a 
 stone, to denote his invincible strength and everlasting duration, and 
 to teach his servants that he is their protection and security, the 
 foundation on which they are built, and a rock of offence to all their 
 enemies. He is the living stone, having eternal life in himself, and 
 being the prince of life to all his people. The reputation and respect 
 he has with God and man are very different. He is disallowed of men, 
 reprobated or rejected by his own countrymen the Jews, and by the 
 generality of mankind; but chosen of God, separated and fore-ordained 
 to be the foundation of the church (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>),

 and precious, a most honourable, choice, worthy person in himself, in
 the esteem of God, and in the judgment of all who believe on him. To 
 this person so described we are obliged to come: <I>To whom coming,</I> 
 not by a local motion, for that is impossible since his exaltation, but 
 by faith, whereby we are united to him at first, and draw nigh to him 
 afterwards. Learn, 

 (1.) Jesus Christ is the very foundation-stone of all our hopes and 
 happiness. He communicates the true knowledge of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>);

 by him we have access to the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6">John xiv. 6</A>),

 and through him are made partakers of all spiritual blessings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph. i. 3</A>.

 (2.) Men in general disallow and reject Jesus Christ; they slight him, 
 dislike him, oppose and refuse him, as scripture and experience 
 declare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3">Isa. liii. 3</A>.

 (3.) However Christ may be disallowed by an ungrateful world, yet he is
 chosen of God, and precious in his account. He is chosen and fixed
 upon to be the Lord of the universe, the head of the church, the 
 Saviour of his people, and the Judge of the world. He is precious in 
 the excellency of his nature, the dignity of his office, and the 
 gloriousness of his services. 

 (4.) Those who expect mercy from this gracious Redeemer must come to 
 him, which is our act, though done by God's grace--an act of the soul, 
 not of the body--a real endeavour, not a fruitless wish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having described Christ as the foundation, the apostle goes on to 
 speak of the superstructure, the materials built upon him: <I>You also, 
 as living stones, are built up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The apostle is recommending the Christian church and constitution to 
 these dispersed Jews. It was natural for them to object that the 
 Christian church had no such glorious temple, nor such a numerous 
 priesthood; but its dispensation was mean, the services and sacrifices 
 of it having nothing of the pomp and grandeur which the Jewish 
 dispensation had. To this the apostle answers that the Christian church 
 is a much nobler fabric than the Jewish temple; it is a living temple, 
 consisting not of dead materials, but of living parts. Christ, the 
 foundation, is a living stone. Christians are lively stones, and these
 make a spiritual house, and they are a holy priesthood; and, though 
 they have no bloody sacrifices of beasts to offer, yet they have much 
 better and more acceptable, and they have an altar too on which to 
 present their offerings; for they offer spiritual sacrifices, 
 acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Learn,

 (1.) All sincere Christians have in them a principle of spiritual life 
 communicated to them from Christ their head: therefore, as he is called 
 a living stone, so they are called lively, or living stones; not dead 
 in trespasses and sins, but alive to God by regeneration and the 
 working of the divine Spirit. 

 (2.) The church of God is a spiritual house. The foundation is Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:22">Eph. ii. 22</A>.

 It is a house for its strength, beauty, variety of parts, and 
 usefulness of the whole. It is spiritual foundation, Christ Jesus,--in 
 the materials of it, spiritual persons,--in its furniture, the graces 
 of the Spirit,--in its connection, being held together by the Spirit of 
 God and by one common faith,--and in its use, which is spiritual work, 
 to offer up spiritual sacrifices. This house is daily built up, every
 part of it improving, and the whole supplied in every age by the 
 addition of new particular members. 

 (3.) All good Christians are a holy priesthood. The apostle speaks here 
 of the generality of Christians, and tells them they are a holy 
 priesthood; they are all select persons, sacred to God, serviceable to 
 others, well endowed with heavenly gifts and graces, and well employed.
 
 (4.) This holy priesthood must and will offer up spiritual sacrifices 
 to God. The spiritual sacrifices which Christians are to offer are 
 their bodies, souls, affections, prayers, praises, alms, and other 
 duties. 

 (5.) The most spiritual sacrifices of the best men are not acceptable 
 to God, but through Jesus Christ; he is the only great high priest, 
 through whom we and our services can be accepted; therefore bring all 
 your oblations to him, and by him present them to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He confirms what he had asserted of Christ being a <I>living 
 stone,</I> &c., from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>.

 Observe the manner of the apostle's quoting scripture, not by book,
 chapter, and verse; for these distinctions were not then made, so no 
 more was said than a reference to Moses, David, or the prophets, except 
 once a particular psalm was named,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:33">Acts xiii. 33</A>.

 In their quotations they kept rather to the sense than the words of
 scripture, as appears from what is recited from the prophet in this 
 place. He does not quote the scripture, neither the Hebrew nor LXX., 
 word for word, yet makes a just and true quotation. The true sense of
 scripture may be justly and fully expressed in other than in 
 scripture--words. <I>It is contained.</I> The verb is active, but our 
 translators render it passively, to avoid the difficulty of finding a 
 nominative case for it, which had puzzled so many interpreters before 
 them. The matter of the quotation is this, <I>Behold, I lay in 
 Zion.</I> Learn,

 1. In the weighty matters of religion we must depend entirely upon
 scripture--proof; Christ and his apostles appealed to Moses, David, and 
 the ancient prophets. The word of God is the only rule God hath given 
 us. It is a perfect and sufficient rule. 

 2. The accounts that God hath given us in scripture concerning his Son
 Jesus Christ are what require our strictest attention. <I>Behold, I 
 lay,</I> &c. John calls for the like attention, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">John i. 29</A>.

 These demands of attention to Christ show us the excellency of the
 matter, the importance of it, and our stupidity and dulness.

 3. The constituting of Christ Jesus head of the church is an eminent
 work of God: <I>I lay in Zion.</I> The setting up of the pope for the
 head of the church is a human contrivance and an arrogant presumption;
 Christ only is the foundation and head of the church of God. 

 4. Jesus Christ is the chief corner-stone that God hath laid in his
 spiritual building. The corner-stone stays inseparably with the 
 building, supports it, unites it, and adorns it. So does Christ by his 
 holy church, his spiritual house. 

 5. Jesus Christ is the corner-stone for the support and salvation of
 none but such as are his sincere people: none but Zion, and such as are 
 of Zion; not for Babylon, not for his enemies. 

 6. True faith in Jesus Christ is the only way to prevent a man's utter
 confusion. Three things put a man into great confusion, and faith 
 prevents them all--disappointment, sin, and judgment. Faith has a 
 remedy for each.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He deduces an important inference, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Jesus Christ is said to be the chief corner-stone. Hence the apostle 
 infers with respect to good men, "To you therefore who believe he is 
 precious, or he is an honour. Christ is the crown and honour of a 
 Christian; you who believe will be so far from being ashamed of him 
 that you will boast of him and glory in him for ever." As to wicked 
 men, the disobedient will go on to disallow and reject Jesus Christ; 
 but God is resolved that he shall be, in despite of all opposition, the 
 head of the corner. Learn, 

 1. Whatever is by just and necessary consequence deduced from
 scripture may be depended upon with as much certainty as if it were 
 contained in express words of scripture. The apostle draws an inference 
 from the prophet's testimony. The prophet did not expressly say so, but 
 yet he said that from which the consequence was unavoidable. Our 
 Saviour bids them search the scriptures, because they testified of him; 
 and yet no place in those scriptures to which he there refers them said 
 that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Yet those scriptures do say 
 that he who should be born of a virgin, before the sceptre departed 
 from Judah, during the second temple, and after Daniel's seventy weeks, 
 was the Messiah; but such was Jesus Christ: to collect this conclusion 
 one must make use of reason, history, eye-sight, experience, and yet it 
 is an infallible scripture--conclusion notwithstanding. 

 2. The business of a faithful minister is to apply general truths to
 the particular condition and state of his hearers. The apostle quotes a 
 passage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 out of the prophet, and applies it severally to good and bad. This 
 requires wisdom, courage, and fidelity; but it is very profitable to 
 the hearers. 

 3. Jesus Christ is exceedingly precious to all the faithful. The
 majesty and grandeur of his person, the dignity of his office, his near
 relation, his wonderful works, his immense love--every thing engages
 the faithful to the highest esteem and respect for Jesus Christ. 

 4. Disobedient people have no true faith. By disobedient people
 understand those that are unpersuadable, incredulous, and impenitent.
 These may have some right notions, but no solid faith. 

 5. Those that ought to be builders of the church of Christ are often
 the worst enemies that Christ has in the world. In the Old Testament 
 the false prophets did the most mischief; and in the New Testament the 
 greatest opposition and cruelty that Christ met with were from the 
 scribes, pharisees, chief priests, and those who pretended to build and 
 take care of the church. Still the hierarchy of Rome is the worst
 enemy in the world to Jesus Christ and his interest. 

 6. God will carry on his own work, and support the interest of Jesus
 Christ in the world, notwithstanding the falseness of pretended friends 
 and the opposition of his worst enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle adds a further description, still preserving the 
 metaphor of a stone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 The words are taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:13,14">Isa. viii. 13, 14</A>,

 <I>Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself--and he shall be for a stone of
 stumbling, and for a rock of offence,</I> whence it is plain that Jesus 
 Christ is the Lord of hosts, and consequently the most high God.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The builders, the chief-priests, refused him, and the people 
 followed their leaders; and so Christ became to them <I>a stone of 
 stumbling, and a rock of offence,</I> at which they stumbled and hurt 
 themselves; and in return he fell upon them as a mighty stone or rock, 
 and punished them with destruction. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:44">Matt. xii. 44</A>,

 <I>Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on 
 whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder.</I> Learn,

 (1.) All those that are disobedient take offense at the word of God:
 <I>They stumble at the word, being disobedient.</I> They are offended 
 with Christ himself, with his doctrine and the purity of his precepts; 
 but the Jewish doctors more especially stumbled at the meanness of his 
 appearance and the proposal of trusting only to him for their 
 justification before God. They could not be brought to seek 
 justification by faith, but as it were by the works of the law; <I>for 
 they stumbled at that stumbling-stone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:32">Rom. ix. 32</A>.

 (2.) The same blessed Jesus who is the author of salvation to some is
 to others the occasion of their sin and destruction. <I>He is set for 
 the rising and fall of many in Israel.</I> He is not the author of 
 their sin, but only the occasion of it; their own disobedience makes 
 them stumble at him and reject him, which he punishes, as a judge, with 
 destruction. Those who reject him as a Saviour will split upon him as a 
 Rock. 

 (3.) God himself hath appointed everlasting destruction to all those 
 who <I>stumble at the word, being disobedient.</I> All those who go on 
 resolutely in their infidelity and contempt of the gospel are appointed 
 to eternal destruction; and God from eternity knows who they are. 

 (4.) To see the Jews generally rejecting Christ, and multitudes in all 
 ages slighting him, ought not to discourage us in our love and duty to 
 him; for this had been foretold by the prophets long ago, and is a 
 confirmation of our faith both in the scriptures and in the 
 Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those who received him were highly privileged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The Jews were exceedingly tender of their ancient privileges, of being 
 the only people of God, taken into a special covenant with him, and 
 separated from the rest of the world. "Now," say they, "if we submit to 
 the gospel--constitution, we shall lose all this, and stand upon the 
 same level with the Gentiles."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To this objection the apostle answers, that if they did not submit 
 they were ruined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 but that if they did submit they should lose no real advantage, but 
 continue still what they desired to be, <I>a chosen generation, a royal 
 priesthood,</I> &c. Learn, 

 [1.] All true Christians <I>are a chosen generation;</I> they all make 
 one family, a sort and species of people distinct from the common 
 world, of another spirit, principle, and practice, which they could 
 never be if they were not chosen in Christ to be such, and sanctified 
 by his Spirit.

 [2.] All the true servants of Christ are a royal priesthood. They are
 royal in their relation to God and Christ, in their power with God, and 
 over themselves and all their spiritual enemies; they are princely in 
 the improvements and the excellency of their own spirits, and in their 
 hopes and expectations; they are a royal priesthood, separated from sin 
 and sinners, consecrated to God, and offering to God spiritual services 
 and oblations, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

 [3.] All Christians, wheresoever they be, compose one holy nation. They 
 are one nation, collected under one head, agreeing in the same manners 
 and customs, and governed by the same laws; and they are a holy nation, 
 because consecrated and devoted to God, renewed and sanctified by his 
 Holy Spirit.

 [4.] It is the honour of the servants of Christ that they are God's 
 peculiar people. They are the people of his acquisition, choice, care, 
 and delight. These four dignities of all genuine Christians are not 
 natural to them; for their first state is a state of horrid darkness, 
 but they are effectually called out of darkness into a state of 
 marvellous light, joy, pleasure, and prosperity, with this intent and 
 view, that they should show forth, by words and actions, the virtues 
 and praises of him who hath called them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To make this people content, and thankful for the great mercies 
 and dignities brought unto them by the gospel, the apostle advises them 
 to compare their former and their present state. Time was when they 
 were not a people, nor had they obtained mercy, but they were solemnly 
 disclaimed and divorced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:8,Ho+1:6,9">Jer. iii. 8; Hos. i. 6, 9</A>);

 but now they are taken in again to be the people of God, and have 
 obtained mercy. Learn, 

 [1.] The best people ought frequently to look back upon what they were 
 in time past.

 [2.] The people of God are the most valuable people in the world; all 
 the rest are not a people, good for little.

 [3.] To be brought into the number of the people of God is a very great 
 mercy, and it may be obtained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He warns them to beware of fleshly lusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Even the best of men, <I>the chosen generation, the people of God,</I> 
 need an exhortation to abstain from the worst sins, which the apostle 
 here proceeds most earnestly and affectionately to warn them against.
 Knowing the difficulty, and yet the importance of the duty, he uses his 
 utmost interest in them: <I>Dearly beloved, I beseech you.</I> The duty
 is to abstain from, and to suppress, the first inclination or rise of 
 fleshly lusts. Many of them proceed from the corruption of nature, and 
 in their exercise depend upon the body, gratifying some sensual 
 appetite or inordinate inclination of the flesh. These Christians ought 
 to avoid, considering, 

 1. The respect they have with God and good men: They are <I>dearly
 beloved.</I> 

 2. Their condition in the world: <I>They are strangers and
 pilgrims,</I> and should not impede their passage by giving into the
 wickedness and lusts of the country through which they pass. 

 3. The mischief and danger these sins do: "<I>They war against the
 soul;</I> and therefore your souls ought to war against them." Learn,

 (1.) The grand mischief that sin does to man is this, it <I>wars 
 against the soul;</I> it destroys the moral liberty of the soul; it 
 weakens and debilitates the soul by impairing its faculties; it robs 
 the soul of its comfort and peace; it debases and destroys the dignity 
 of the soul, hinders its present prosperity, and plunges it into 
 everlasting misery. 

 (2.) Of all sorts of sin, none are more injurious to the soul than 
 <I>fleshly lusts.</I> Carnal appetites, lewdness, and sensuality, are 
 most odious to God, and destructive to man's soul. It is a sore 
 judgment to be given up to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He exhorts them further to adorn their profession by an honest 
 conversation. Their conversation in every turn, every instance, and 
 every action of their lives, ought to be honest; that is, good, lovely, 
 decent, amiable, and without blame: and that because they lived among 
 the Gentiles, people of another religion, and who were inveterate 
 enemies to them, who did already slander them and constantly spoke evil 
 of them <I>as of evil-doers.</I> "A clean, just, good conversation may 
 not only stop their mouths, but may possibly be a means to bring them 
 to glorify God, and turn to you, when they shall see you excel all 
 others in good works. They now call you evil-doers; vindicate 
 yourselves by good works, this is the way to convince them. There is a 
 day of visitation coming, wherein God may call them by his word and his 
 grace to repentance; and then they will glorify God, and applaud you, 
 for your excellent conversation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:68">Luke i. 68</A>.

 When the gospel shall come among them, and take effect, a good
 conversation will encourage them in their conversion, but an evil one 
 will obstruct it." Note,

 1. A Christian profession should be attended with an honest 
 conversation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>.

 2. It is the common lot of the best Christians to be evil spoken of by
 wicked men. 

 3. Those that are under God's gracious visitation immediately change
 their opinion of good people, glorifying God and commending those whom 
 before they railed at as evil-doers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
 sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;
 &nbsp; 14  Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
 punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.
 &nbsp; 15  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put
 to silence the ignorance of foolish men:
 &nbsp; 16  As free, and not using <I>your</I> liberty for a cloak of
 maliciousness, but as the servants of God.
 &nbsp; 17  Honour all <I>men.</I> Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
 king.
 &nbsp; 18  Servants, <I>be</I> subject to <I>your</I> masters with all fear; not
 only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
 &nbsp; 19  For this <I>is</I> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward
 God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.
 &nbsp; 20  For what glory <I>is it,</I> if, when ye be buffeted for your
 faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
 suffer <I>for it,</I> ye take it patiently, this <I>is</I> acceptable with
 God.
 &nbsp; 21  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
 suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
 steps:
 &nbsp; 22  Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:
 &nbsp; 23  Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he
 suffered, he threatened not; but committed <I>himself</I> to him that
 judgeth righteously:
 &nbsp; 24  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
 that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by
 whose stripes ye were healed.
 &nbsp; 25  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
 the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The general rule of a Christian conversation is this, it must be 
 honest, which it cannot be if there be not a conscientious discharge of 
 all relative duties. The apostle here particularly treats of these 
 distinctly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case of subjects. Christians were not only reputed innovators in 
 religion, but disturbers of the state; it was highly necessary, 
 therefore, that the apostle should settle the rules and measures of 
 obedience to the civil magistrate, which he does here, where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty required is submission, which comprises loyalty and 
 reverence to their persons, obedience to their just laws and commands, 
 and subjection to legal penalties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The persons or objects to whom this submission is due are described, 
 
 (1.) More generally: <I>Every ordinance of man.</I> Magistracy is
 certainly of divine right; but the particular form of government, the 
 power of the magistrate, and the persons who are to execute this power, 
 are of human institution, and are governed by the laws and 
 constitutions of each particular country; and this is a general rule, 
 binding in all nations, let the established form of be what it will. 
 
 (2.) Particularly: <I>To the king, as supreme,</I> first in dignity and 
 most eminent in degree; the king is a legal person, not a tyrant: <I>or 
 unto governors,</I> deputies, proconsuls, rulers of provinces, who 
 <I>are sent by him,</I> that is, commissioned by him to govern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reasons to enforce this duty are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>For the Lord's sake,</I> who had ordained magistracy for the 
 good of mankind, who has required obedience and submission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1-14">Rom. xiii.</A>),
 
 and whose honour is concerned in the dutiful behavior of subjects to 
 their sovereigns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From the end and use of the magistrate's office, which are, to 
 punish evil-doers, and to praise and encourage all those that do well. 
 They were appointed for the good of societies; and, where this end is 
 not pursued, the fault is not in their institution but their practice. 
 
 [1.] True religion is the best support of civil government; it requires 
 submission for the Lord's sake, and for conscience' sake. 

 [2.] All the punishments, and all the magistrates in the world, cannot 
 hinder but there will be evil-doers in it.

 [3.] The best way the magistrate can take to discharge his own duty, 
 and to amend the world, is to punish well and reward well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Another reason why Christians should submit to the evil magistrate 
 is because it <I>is the will of God,</I> and consequently their duty; 
 and because it is the way to put to silence the malicious slanders of 
 ignorant and foolish men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Learn,

 [1.] <I>The will of God is,</I> to a good man, the strongest reason for 
 any duty.

 [2.] Obedience to magistrates is a considerable branch of a Christian's 
 duty: <I>So is the will of God.</I>

 [3.] A Christian must endeavour, in all relations, to behave himself so 
 as to put to silence the unreasonable reproaches of the most ignorant 
 and foolish men.

 [4.] Those who speak against religion and religious people are ignorant 
 and foolish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He reminds them of the spiritual nature of Christian liberty. The 
 Jews, from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>,

 concluded that they were bound to obey no sovereign but one <I>taken
 from their own brethren;</I> and the converted Jews thought they were 
 free from subjection by their relation to Christ. To prevent their 
 mistakes, the apostle tells the Christians that they were free, but 
 from what? Not from duty or obedience to God's law, which requires 
 subjection to the civil magistrate. They were free spiritually from the 
 bondage of sin and Satan, and the ceremonial law; but they must not 
 make their Christian liberty a cloak or covering for any wickedness, or 
 for the neglect of any duty towards God or towards their superiors, but 
 must still remember they were <I>the servants of God.</I> Learn,

 [1.] All the servants of Christ are free men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:36">John viii. 36</A>);

 they are <I>free</I> from Satans' dominion, the law's condemnation, the 
 wrath of God, the uneasiness of duty, and the terrors of death. 

 [2.] The servants of Jesus Christ ought to be very careful not to abuse 
 their Christian liberty; they must not make it a cover or cloak for any 
 wickedness against God or disobedience to superiors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostle concludes his discourse concerning the duty of subjects 
 with four admirable precepts:--

 (1.) <I>Honour all men.</I> A due respect is to be given to all men;
 the poor are not to be despised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:5">Prov. xvii. 5</A>);

 the wicked must be honoured, not for their wickedness, but for any 
 other qualities, such as wit, prudence, courage, eminency of 
 employment, or the hoary head. Abraham, Jacob, Samuel, the prophets,
 and the apostles, never scrupled to give due honour to bad men. 

 (2.) <I>Love the brotherhood.</I> All Christians are a fraternity, 
 united to Christ the head, alike disposed and qualified, nearly related 
 in the same interest, having communion one with another, and going to 
 the same home; they should therefore love one another with an especial 
 affection. 

 (3.) <I>Fear God</I> with the highest reverence, duty, and submission; 
 if this be wanting, none of the other three duties can be performed as 
 they ought. 

 (4.) <I>Honour the king</I> with that highest honour that is peculiarly 
 due to him above other men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The case of servants wanted an apostolical determination as well as 
 that of subjects, for they imagined that their Christian liberty set 
 them free from their unbelieving and cruel masters; to this the apostle 
 answers, <I>Servants, be subject,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 By <I>servants</I> he means those who were strictly such, whether 
 hired, or bought with money, or taken in the wars, or born in the 
 house, or those who served by contract for a limited time, as 
 apprentices. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He orders them to <I>be subject,</I> to do their business faithfully 
 and honestly, to conduct themselves, as inferiors ought, with reverence 
 and affection, and to submit patiently to hardships and inconveniences. 
 This subjection they owe to their masters, who have a right to their 
 service; and that <I>not only to the good and gentle,</I> such as use 
 them well and abate somewhat of their right, but even to the crooked 
 and perverse, who are scarcely to be pleased at all. Learn, 

 (1.) Servants ought to behave themselves to their masters with 
 submission, and fear of displeasing them. 

 (2.) The sinful misconduct of one relation does not justify the sinful 
 behaviour of the other; the servant is bound to do his duty, though the 
 master be sinfully froward and perverse. 

 (3.) Good people are meek and gentle to their servants and inferiors. 
 Our holy apostle shows his love and concern for the souls of poor 
 servants, as well as for higher people. Herein he ought to be imitated 
 by all inferior ministers, who should distinctly apply their counsels 
 to the lower, the meaner, the younger, and the poorer sort of their 
 hearers, as well as others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having charged them to be subject, he condescends to reason with 
 them about it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If they were patient under their hardships, while they suffered 
 unjustly, and continued doing their duty to their unbelieving and 
 untoward masters, this would e acceptable to God, and he would reward 
 all that they suffered for conscience towards him; but to be patient 
 when they were justly chastised would deserve no commendation at all; 
 it is only <I>doing well, and suffering patiently for that, which is 
 acceptable with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 
 Learn,

 [1.] There is no condition so mean but a man may live conscientiously
 in it, and glorify God in it; the meanest servant may do so.

 [2.] The most conscientious persons are very often the greatest 
 sufferers. <I>For conscience towards God, they suffer wrongfully; they 
 do well, and suffer for it;</I> but sufferers of this sort are 
 praiseworthy, they do honour to God and to religion, and they are 
 accepted of him; and this is their highest support and satisfaction.

 [3.] Deserved sufferings must be endured with patience: <I>If you are 
 buffeted for your faults, you</I> must <I>take it patiently.</I> 
 Sufferings in this world are not always pledges of our future 
 happiness; if children or servants be rude and undutiful, and suffer 
 for it, this will neither be acceptable with God nor procure the praise 
 of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) More reasons are given to encourage Christian servants to patience 
 under unjust sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 [1.] From their Christian calling and profession: <I>Hereunto were you 
 called.</I>

 [2.] From the example of Christ, who <I>suffered for us,</I> and so 
 became our <I>example, that we should follow his steps,</I> whence 
 learn, <I>First,</I> Good Christians are a sort of people called to be 
 sufferers, and therefore they must expect it; by the terms of 
 Christianity they are bound to deny themselves, and take up the cross; 
 they are called by the commands of Christ, by the dispensations of 
 Providence, and by the preparations of divine grace; and, by the 
 practice of Jesus Christ, they are bound to suffer when thus called to 
 it. <I>Secondly,</I> Jesus Christ <I>suffered for</I> you, or <I>for 
 us;</I> it was not the Father that suffered, but he whom the Father 
 sanctified, and sent into the world, for that end; it was both the body 
 and soul of Christ that suffered, and he suffered for us, in our stead 
 and for our good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The sufferings of Christ should quiet us under the most 
 unjust and cruel sufferings we meet with in the world. He suffered 
 voluntarily, not for himself, but for us, with the utmost readiness, 
 with perfect patience, from all quarters, and all this though he was 
 God-man; shall not we sinners, who deserve the worst, submit to the 
 light afflictions of this life, which work for us unspeakable 
 advantages afterwards?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The example of Christ's subjection and patience is here explained 
 and amplified: <I>Christ suffered,</I> 

 (1.) Wrongfully, and without cause; for he <I>did no sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 <I>He had done no violence,</I> no injustice or wrong to any one--he 
 wrought no iniquity of any sort whatever; <I>neither was guile found in 
 his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>),

 his words, as well as his actions, were all sincere, just, and right. 
 
 (2.) Patiently: <I>When he was reviled, he reviled not again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 when they blasphemed him, mocked him, called him foul names, he was 
 <I>dumb, and opened not his mouth;</I> when they went further, to real 
 injuries, beating, buffeting, and crowning him with thorns, <I>he 
 threatened not; but committed</I> both <I>himself</I> and his cause 
 <I>to God that judgeth righteously,</I> who would in time clear his 
 innocency, and avenge him on his enemies. Learn,

 [1.] Our Blessed Redeemer was perfectly holy, and so free from sin that 
 no temptation, no provocation whatsoever, could extort from him so much 
 as the least sinful or indecent word.

 [2.] Provocations to sin can never justify the commission of it. The 
 rudeness, cruelty, and injustice of enemies, will not justify 
 Christians in reviling and revenge; the reasons for sin can never be so 
 great, but we have always stronger reasons to avoid it.

 [3.] The judgment of God will determine justly upon every man and every 
 cause; and thither we ought, with patience and resignation, to refer 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Lest any should think, from what is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>,

 that Christ's death was designed merely for an example of patience
 under sufferings, the apostle here adds a more glorious design and 
 effect of it: <I>Who his own self,</I> &c., where note, 

 (1.) The person suffering--Jesus Christ: <I>His own self--in his own 
 body.</I> The expression <I>his own self</I> is emphatic, and necessary 
 to show that he verified all the ancient prophecies, to distinguish him 
 from the Levitical priests (who offered the blood of others, but he by 
 <I>himself purged our sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>),

 and to exclude all others from participation with him in the work of 
 man's redemption: it is added, <I>in his body;</I> not but that he 
 suffered in his soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:38">Matt. xxvi. 38</A>),

 but the sufferings of the soul were inward and concealed, when those of 
 the body were visible and more obvious to the consideration of these 
 suffering servants, for whose sake this example is produced. 

 (2.) The sufferings he underwent were <I>stripes,</I> wounds, and 
 death, <I>the death of the cross</I>--servile and ignominious 
 punishments!

 (3.) The reason of his sufferings: He <I>bore our sins,</I> which 
 teaches, 

 [1.] That Christ, in his sufferings, stood charged with our sins, as 
 one who had undertaken to put them away by <I>the sacrifice of 
 himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:6">Isa. liii. 6</A>.

 [2.] That he bore the punishment of them, and thereby satisfied divine
 justice. 

 [3.] That hereby he takes away our sins, and removes them away from us;
 as the scape-goat did typically bear the sins of the people on his 
 head, and then carried them quite away,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:21,22">Lev. xvi. 21, 22</A>),

 so the Lamb of God does first bear our sins in his own body, and 
 thereby take away the sins of the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">John i. 29</A>.

 (4.) The fruits of Christ's sufferings are, 

 [1.] Our sanctification, consisting of the death, the mortification of 
 sin, and a new holy life of righteousness, for both which we have an 
 example, and powerful motives and abilities also, from the death and 
 resurrection of Christ.

 [2.] Our justification. Christ was bruised and crucified as an 
 expiatory sacrifice, and <I>by his stripes we are healed.</I> Learn, 
 <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ bore the sins of all his people, and 
 expiated them by his <I>death upon the cross. Secondly,</I> No man can 
 depend safely upon Christ, as having borne his sin and expiated his 
 guilt, till he dies unto sin and lives unto righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The apostle concludes his advice to Christian servants, by putting 
 them in mind of the difference between their former and present 
 condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 They <I>were as sheep going astray,</I> which represents,

 (1.) Man's sin: he goes astray; it is his own act, he is not driven, 
 but does voluntary go astray. 

 (2.) His misery: he goes astray from the pasture, from the shepherd, 
 and from the flock, and so exposes himself to innumerable dangers. 

 (3.) Here is the recovery of these by conversion: <I>But are now 
 returned.</I> The word is passive, and shows that the return of a 
 sinner is the effect of divine grace. This return is from all their
 errors and wanderings, to Christ, who is the true careful shepherd, 
 that loves his sheep, and laid down his life for them, who is the most 
 vigilant pastor, and bishop, or overseer of souls. Learn, 

 [1.] Sinners, before their conversion, are always going astray; their 
 life is a continued error.

 [2.] Jesus Christ is the supreme shepherd and bishop of souls, who is 
 always resident with his flock, and watchful over them.

 [3.] Those that expect the love and care of this universal pastor must 
 return to him, must die unto sin, and live unto righteousness.</P>
