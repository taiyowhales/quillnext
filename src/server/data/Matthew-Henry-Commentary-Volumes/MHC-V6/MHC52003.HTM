 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle gives further evidence of his love to the 
 Thessalonians, reminding them of his sending Timothy to them, with the 
 mention of his design therein and his inducements so to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 He acquaints them also with his great satisfaction at the return of
 Timothy, with good tidings concerning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 And concludes with fervent prayer for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:11-13">ver. 11, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good
 to be left at Athens alone;
 &nbsp; 2  And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
 fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to
 comfort you concerning your faith:
 &nbsp; 3  That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for
 yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
 &nbsp; 4  For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
 should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
 &nbsp; 5  For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to
 know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you,
 and our labour be in vain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle gives an account of his sending Timothy to 
 the Thessalonians. Though he was hindered from going to them himself, 
 yet his love was such that he could not forbear sending Timothy to 
 them. Though Timothy was very useful to him, and he could not well 
 spare him, yet Paul was content, for their good, <I>to be left alone at 
 Athens.</I> Note, Those ministers do not duly value the establishment 
 and welfare of their people who cannot deny themselves in many things 
 for that end. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The character he gives of Timothy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>We sent Timotheus, our brother.</I> Elsewhere he calls him his son; 
 here he calls him brother. Timothy was Paul's junior in age, his
 inferior in gifts and graces, and of a lower rank in the ministry: for 
 Paul was an apostle, and Timothy but an evangelist; yet Paul calls him 
 brother. This was an instance of the apostle's humility, and showed his 
 desire to put honour upon Timothy and to recommend him to the esteem of 
 the churches. He calls him also a minister of God. Note, Ministers of 
 the gospel of Christ are ministers of God, to promote the kingdom of 
 God among men. He calls him also his fellow-labourer in the gospel of 
 Christ. Note, Ministers of the gospel must look upon themselves as 
 labourers in the Lord's vineyard; they have an honourable office and 
 hard work, yet a good work. <I>This is a true saying, If any man desire 
 the office of a bishop, he desires a good work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:1">1 Tim. iii. 1</A>.

 And ministers should look upon one another, and strengthen one 
 another's hands, not strive and contend one with another (which will 
 hinder their work), but strive together to carry on the great work they 
 are engaged in, namely, to preach and publish the gospel of Christ, and 
 to persuade people to embrace and entertain it and live suitably 
 thereto.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The end and design why Paul sent Timothy: <I>To establish you and 
 to comfort you concerning your faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Paul had converted them to the Christian faith, and now he was desirous 
 that they might be confirmed and comforted, that they might confirmed 
 in the choice they had made of the Christian religion, and comforted in 
 the profession and practice of it. Note, The more we are comforted, the 
 more we shall be confirmed, because, when we find pleasure in the ways 
 of God, we shall thereby be engaged to continue and persevere therein. 
 The apostle's design was to establish and comfort the Thessalonians 
 concerning their faith,--concerning the object of their faith, namely, 
 the truths of the gospel, and particularly that Jesus Christ was the 
 Saviour of the world, and so wise and good, so powerful and faithful, 
 that they might rely upon him,--concerning the recompence of faith, 
 which was more than sufficient to balance all their losses and reward 
 all their labours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The motive inducing Paul to send Timothy for this end, namely, a 
 godly fear or jealousy, lest they should be moved from the faith of 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He was desirous that no man, no one among them, should be moved or 
 shaken in mind, that they should not apostatize or waver in the faith. 
 And yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He apprehended there was danger, and feared the consequence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There was danger, 

 [1.] By reason of <I>affliction</I> and persecution for the sake of the 
 gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 These Thessalonians could not but perceive what afflictions the 
 apostles and preachers of the gospel met with, and this might possibly 
 stumble them; and also those who made profession of the gospel were 
 persecuted, and without doubt these Thessalonians themselves were 
 afflicted.

 [2.] By reason of the tempter's subtlety and malice. The apostle was 
 afraid lest by any means the tempter had tempted them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The devil is a subtle and unwearied tempter, who seeks an opportunity 
 to beguile and destroy us, and takes all advantages against us, both in 
 a time of prosperity and adversity; and he has often been successful in 
 his attacks upon persons under afflictions. He has often prejudiced the 
 minds of men against religion on account of the sufferings its 
 professors are exposed to. We have reason therefore to be jealous over 
 ourselves and others, lest we be ensnared by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The consequence the apostle feared was lest his labour should be 
 in vain. And thus it would have been, if the tempter had tempted them, 
 and prevailed against them, to move them from the faith. They would 
 have lost what they had wrought, and the apostle would have lost what 
 he laboured for. Note, It is the devil's design to hinder the good 
 fruit and effect of the preaching of the gospel. If he cannot hinder 
 ministers from labouring in the word and doctrine, he will, if he be 
 able, hinder them of the success of their labours. Note also, Faithful 
 ministers are much concerned about the success of their labours. No one 
 would willingly labour in vain; and ministers are loth to spend their 
 strength, and pains, and time, for nought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To prevent this danger, with its bad consequence, the apostle tells 
 them what care he took in sending Timothy, 

 (1.) To put them in mind of what he had told them before concerning 
 suffering tribulation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>We are appointed thereunto,</I> that is, unto afflictions. So is the 
 will and purpose of God that <I>through many afflictions we must enter 
 into his kingdom.</I> Their troubles and persecutions did not come by 
 chance, not merely from the wrath and malice of the enemies of 
 religion, but by the <I>appointment of God.</I> The event only came to 
 pass according as God had determined, and they knew he had told them 
 before it would be; so that they should not think it strange, and, 
 being fore-warned, they should be fore-armed. Note, The apostles were
 so far from flattering people with an expectation of worldly prosperity 
 in religion that, on the contrary, they told them plainly they must 
 count upon trouble in the flesh. And herein they followed the example 
 of their great Master, the author or our faith. Besides, it might prove 
 a confirmation of their faith, when they perceived that it only 
 happened to them as was predicted before.

 (2.) To know their faith, that so he might inform the apostles whether 
 they remained stedfast under all their sufferings, whether their faith 
 failed or not, because, if their faith did not fail, they would be able 
 to stand their ground against the tempter and all his temptations: 
 their faith would be a <I>shield, to defend them against all the fiery 
 darts of the wicked,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us
 good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good
 remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also
 <I>to see</I> you:
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
 affliction and distress by your faith:
 &nbsp; 8  For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
 &nbsp; 9  For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all
 the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
 &nbsp; 10  Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your
 face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have Paul's great satisfaction upon the return of Timothy with 
 good tidings from the Thessalonians, in which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The good report Timothy made concerning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Without question, he was a willing messenger of these good tidings.
 <I>Concerning their faith,</I> that is, concerning their stedfastness 
 in the faith, that they were not shaken in mind, nor turned aside form 
 the profession of the gospel. <I>Their love</I> also continued; their 
 love to the gospel, and the ministers of the gospel. For they had a 
 good and a kind remembrance of the apostles, and that constantly, or 
 always. The names of the apostles were very dear to them, and the 
 thoughts of them, and what they themselves had received from them, were 
 very precious, insomuch that they <I>desired greatly to see them 
 again,</I> and receive some spiritual gift from them; and there was no 
 love lost, for the apostle was as desirous to see them. It is happy 
 where there is such mutual love between minister and people. This tends 
 to promote religion, and the success of the gospel. The world hates 
 them, and therefore they should love one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great comfort and satisfaction the apostle had in this good 
 report concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted in all our affliction and 
 distress.</I> The apostle thought this good news of them was sufficient 
 to balance all the troubles he met with. It was easy to him to bear 
 affliction, or persecution, or fightings from without, when he found 
 the good success of his ministry and the constancy of the converts he 
 had made to Christianity; and his distress of mind on account of his 
 fears within, lest he had laboured in vain, was now in a good measure 
 over, when he understood their faith and the perseverance of it. This 
 put new life and spirit into the apostle and made him vigorous and 
 active in the work of the Lord. Thus he was not only comforted, but 
 greatly rejoiced also: <I>Now we live, if you stand fast in the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It would have been a killing thing to the apostles if the professors of 
 religion had been unsteady, or proved apostates; whereas nothing was 
 more encouraging than their constancy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The effects of this were thankfulness and prayer to God on their 
 behalf. Observe, 
 
 1. How thankful the apostle was,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He was full of joy, and full of praise and thanksgiving. When we are 
 most cheerful we should be most thankful. What we rejoice in we should 
 give thanks for. This is to rejoice before our God, to spiritualize
 our joy. Paul speaks as if he could not tell how to express his 
 thankfulness to God, or his joy and rejoicing for their sakes. But he 
 was careful God should not lose the glory of the comfort he received in 
 the welfare of his friends. His heart was enlarged with love to them 
 and with thanksgiving to God. He was willing to express the one and the 
 other as well as he could. As to thankfulness to God, this especially 
 is very imperfect in the present state; but, when we come to heaven, we 
 shall do this work better than now we can. 

 2. He prayed for them night and day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 evening and morning, or very frequently, in the midst of the business 
 of the day or slumber of the night lifting up his heart to God in 
 prayer. Thus we should pray always. And Paul's prayer was fervent 
 prayer. He prayed exceedingly, and was earnest in his supplication. 
 Note, When we are most thankful we should always give ourselves to 
 prayer; and those we give thanks for have yet need to be prayed for. 
 Those whom we most rejoice in, and who are our greatest comforts, must 
 be our constant care, while in this world of temptation and 
 imperfection. There was something still lacking in their faith; Paul 
 desired that this might be perfected, and to see their face in order 
 thereunto. Note, 

 (1.) The best of men have something wanting in their faith, if not as 
 to the matter of it, there being some mysteries or doctrines not 
 sufficiently known or believed by them, yet as to the clearness and 
 certainty of their faith, there being some remaining darkness and 
 doubtings, or at least as to the effects and operations of it, these 
 being not so conspicuous and perfect as they should be. And, 

 (2.) The ministry of the word and ordinances is helpful, and to be 
 desired and used for the perfecting of that which is lacking in our 
 faith.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
 direct our way unto you.
 &nbsp; 12  And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one
 toward another, and toward all <I>men,</I> even as we <I>do</I> toward you:
 &nbsp; 13  To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in
 holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord
 Jesus Christ with all his saints.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words we have the earnest prayer of the apostle. He desired to 
 be instrumental in the further benefit of the Thessalonians; and the 
 only way to be so while at a distance was by prayer for them, together 
 with his writing or sending to them. He desired that their faith might 
 be perfected, which he could not be the proper cause or author of; for 
 he pretended not to dominion over their faith, nor to have the donation 
 of it, and he therefore concludes with prayer for them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whom he prays to, namely, God and Christ. Prayer is a part of 
 religious worship, and all religious worship is due unto God only. 
 Prayer is here made to God, even the Father and our Father; and also to 
 Christ, even our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore Jesus Christ our Lord is 
 God, even as God our Father is God. Prayer is to be offered to God as 
 our Father. So Christ taught his disciples to pray; and so the Spirit 
 of adoption prompts them to pray, to cry, <I>Abba Father.</I> Prayer is 
 not only to be offered in the name of Christ, but offered up to Christ 
 himself, as our Lord and our Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he prays for, with respect to himself and his 
 fellow-labourers, and on behalf of the Thessalonians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays that himself and fellow-labourers might have a prosperous
 journey to them by the will of God, that their way might be directed to 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The taking of a journey to this or that place, one would think, is a 
 thing depending so much on a man's own will, and lies so much in his 
 own power, that Paul needed not by prayer to go to God about it. But 
 the apostle knew that <I>in God we live, and move, and have our 
 being,</I> that we depend upon God in all our motions and actions, as 
 well as for the continuance of life and being, that divine Providence 
 orders all our affairs and that it is owing thereto if we prosper 
 therein, that God our Father directs and orders his children whither 
 they shall go and what they shall do, that our Lord Jesus Christ in a 
 particular manner directs the motions of his faithful ministers, those 
 stars which he holds in his right hand. Let us acknowledge God in all 
 our ways, and he will direct our paths.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prays for the prosperity of the Thessalonians. Whether he should 
 have an opportunity of coming to them or not, yet he earnestly prayed 
 for the prosperity of their souls. And there are two things he desired 
 for them, which we should desire for ourselves and friends:--

 (1.) That they might increase and abound in love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 in love to one another and in love to all men. Note, Mutual love is 
 required of all Christians, and not only that they love one another, 
 but that they also have a charitable disposition of mind and due 
 concern for the welfare of all men. Love is of God, and is the 
 fulfilling of the gospel as well as of the law. Timothy brought good 
 tidings of their faith, yet something was lacking therein; and of their 
 charity, yet the apostle prays that this might increase and abound. 
 Note, We have reason to desire to grow in every grace, and have need of 
 the Spirit's influence in order to growth in grace; and the way to 
 obtain this is by prayer. We are beholden to God not only for the
 stock put into our hands at first, but for the improvement of it also. 
 And to our prayer we must add endeavour. To excite this in the 
 Thessalonians the apostle again mentions his love, his abounding love, 
 towards them. The more we are beloved, the more affectionate we should 
 be. 

 (2.) That they might be established unblamable in holiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 This spiritual benefit is mentioned as an effect of increasing and 
 abounding love: <I>To the end that he</I> (the Lord) <I>may establish 
 your hearts.</I> Note, The more we grow and abound in grace, and 
 particularly in the grace of love, the more we are established and 
 confirmed in it. Note also, Holiness is required of all those who would 
 go to heaven, and therein we must be unblamable; that is, we must act 
 in every thing so that we may not in the least contradict the 
 profession we make of holiness. Our desire should be to have our hearts 
 established in holiness before God, and be preserved safe, to the 
 coming of the Lord Jesus Christ; and that we may be unblamable before 
 God, even the Father, now, and be presented blameless before the throne 
 of his glory, when the Lord Jesus shall come with all his saints. Note, 
 
 [1.] The Lord Jesus will certainly come, and come in his glory. 

 [2.] When he comes, his saints will come with him: <I>They shall appear
 with him in glory.</I>

 [3.] Then the excellency as well as the necessity of holiness will
 appear, because without this no hearts shall be established at that 
 day, nor shall any one be unblamable, or avoid everlasting 
 condemnation.</P>
