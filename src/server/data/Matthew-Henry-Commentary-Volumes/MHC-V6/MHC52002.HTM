 In this chapter the apostle puts the Thessalonians in mind of the 
 manner of his preaching among them,

 Then of the manner of his conversation among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 Afterwards of the success of his ministry, with the effects both on
 himself and on them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>),

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that
 it was not in vain:
 &nbsp; 2  But even after that we had suffered before, and were
 shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in
 our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
 &nbsp; 3  For our exhortation <I>was</I> not of deceit, nor of uncleanness,
 nor in guile:
 &nbsp; 4  But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the
 gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which
 trieth our hearts.
 &nbsp; 5  For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know,
 nor a cloak of covetousness; God <I>is</I> witness:
 &nbsp; 6  Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor <I>yet</I> of
 others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of
 Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have an account of Paul's manner of preaching, and his 
 comfortable reflection upon his entrance in among the Thessalonians. As 
 he had the testimony of his own conscience witnessing to his integrity, 
 so he could appeal to the Thessalonians how faithful he, and Silas, and 
 Timotheus, his helpers in the work of the Lord, had discharged their 
 office: <I>You yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you.</I> 
 Note, It is a great comfort to a minister to have his own conscience 
 and the consciences of others witnessing for him that he set out well, 
 with good designs and from good principles; and that <I>his preaching 
 was not in vain,</I> or, as some read it, <I>was not fain.</I> The 
 apostle here comforts himself either in the success of his ministry, 
 that it was not fruitless or in vain (according to our translation), or 
 as others think, reflecting upon the sincerity of his preaching, that 
 it was not vain and empty, or deceitful and treacherous. The 
 subject-matter of the apostle's preaching was not vain and idle 
 speculations about useless niceties and foolish questions, but sound 
 and solid truth, such as was most likely to profit his hearers. A good 
 example this is, to be imitated by all the ministers of the gospel. 
 Much less was the apostle's preaching vain or deceitful. He could say 
 to these Thessalonians what he told the Corinthians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:2">2 Cor. iv. 2</A>):

 <I>We have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
 craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.</I> He had no 
 sinister or worldly design in his preaching, which he puts them in mind 
 to have been,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With courage and resolution: <I>We were bold in our God to speak 
 unto you the gospel of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The apostle was inspired with a holy boldness, nor was he discouraged 
 at the afflictions he met with, or the opposition that was made against 
 him. He had met with ill usage at Philippi, as these Thessalonians
 well knew. There it was that he and Silas were shamefully treated, 
 being put in the stocks; yet no sooner were they set at liberty than 
 they went to Thessalonica, and preached the gospel with as much 
 boldness as ever. Note, Suffering in a good cause should rather sharpen 
 than blunt the edge of holy resolution. The gospel of Christ, at its 
 first setting out in the world, met with much opposition; and those who 
 preached it preached it <I>with contention,</I> with great agony, which 
 denoted either the apostles' striving in their preaching or their 
 striving against the opposition they met with. This was Paul's comfort; 
 he was neither daunted in his work, nor driven from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With great simplicity and godly sincerity: <I>Our exhortation was 
 not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This, no doubt, was matter of the greatest comfort to the apostle--the 
 consciousness of his own sincerity; and was one reason of his success.
 It was the sincere and uncorrupted gospel that he preached and exhorted 
 them to believe and obey. His design was not to set up a faction, to 
 draw men over to a party, but to promote <I>pure religion and undefiled 
 before God and the Father.</I> The gospel he preached was without 
 deceit, it was true and faithful; it was not fallacious, nor a 
 cunningly-devised fable. Nor was it of uncleanness. His gospel was pure 
 and holy, worthy of its holy author, tending to discountenance all 
 manner of impurity. <I>The word of God is pure.</I> There should be no 
 corrupt mixtures therewith; and, as the matter of the apostle's 
 exhortation was thus true and pure, the manner of his speaking was 
 without guile. He did not pretend one thing and intend another. <I>He
 believed, and therefore he spoke.</I> He had no sinister and secular 
 aims and views, but was in reality what he seemed to be. The apostle 
 not only asserts his sincerity, but subjoins the reasons and evidences 
 thereof. The reasons are contained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were stewards, <I>put in trust</I> with the gospel: and it is 
 required of a steward that he be faithful. The gospel which Paul 
 preached was not his own, but the gospel of God. Note, Ministers have a 
 great favour shown them, and honour put upon them, and trust committed 
 to them. They must not dare to corrupt the word of God: they must 
 diligently make use of what is entrusted with them, so as God hath 
 allowed and commanded, knowing they shall be called to an account, when 
 they must be no longer stewards.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their design was to please God and not men. God is a God of truth, 
 and requires truth in the inward parts; and, if sincerity be wanting, 
 all that we do cannot please God. The gospel of Christ is not 
 accommodated to the fain fancies and lusts of men, to gratify their 
 appetites and passions; but, on the contrary, it was designed for the 
 mortifying of their corrupt affections, and delivering them from the 
 power of fancy, that they might be brought under the power of faith. 
 <I>If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Gal. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They acted under the consideration of God's omniscience, as in the 
 sight of him who <I>tries our hearts.</I> This is indeed the great 
 motive to sincerity, to consider that God not only seeth all that we 
 do, but knoweth our thoughts afar off, and searcheth the heart. He is 
 well acquainted with all our aims and designs, as well as our actions. 
 And it is from this God who trieth our hearts that we must receive our 
 reward. The evidences of the apostle's sincerity follow; and they are 
 these:--

 (1.) He avoided flattery: <I>Neither at any time used we flattering
 words, as you know,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He and his fellow-labourers preached Christ and him crucified, and did 
 not aim to gain an interest in men's affections for themselves, by 
 glorying, and fawning and wheedling them. No, he was far from this;
 nor did he flatter men in their sins; nor tell them, if they would be 
 of his party, they might live as they listed. He did not flatter them 
 with fain hopes, nor indulge them in any evil work or way, promising 
 them life, and so <I>daubing with untempered mortar.</I>

 (2.) He avoided covetousness. He did not make the ministry <I>a 
 cloak,</I> or a covering, for <I>covetousness, as God was witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 His design was not to enrich himself by preaching the gospel; so far 
 from this, he did not stipulate with them for bread. He was not like 
 the false apostles, who, <I>through covetousness, with feigned words 
 made merchandise</I> of the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:3">2 Pet. ii. 3</A>.

 (3.) He avoided ambition and vain-glory: <I>Nor of men sought we glory,
 neither of you nor yet of others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They expected neither people's purses nor their caps, neither to be 
 enriched by them nor caressed, and adored, and called Rabbi by them. 
 This apostle exhorts the Galatians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:26"><I>ch.</I> v. 26</A>)

 <I>not to be desirous of vain glory;</I> his ambition was to obtain
 <I>that honour which comes from God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:44">John v. 44</A>.

 He tells them that they might have used greater authority as apostles,
 and expected greater esteem, and demanded maintenance, which is meant 
 by the phrase of <I>being burdensome,</I> because perhaps some would 
 have thought this too great a burden for them to bear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
 children:
 &nbsp; 8  So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to
 have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our
 own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
 &nbsp; 9  For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for
 labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto
 any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
 &nbsp; 10  Ye <I>are</I> witnesses, and God <I>also,</I> how holily and justly
 and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
 &nbsp; 11  As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every
 one of you, as a father <I>doth</I> his children,
 &nbsp; 12  That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto
 his kingdom and glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle reminds the Thessalonians of the manner of 
 his conversation among them. And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He mentions the gentleness of their behaviour: <I>We were gentle 
 among you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He showed great mildness and tenderness who might have acted with the 
 authority of an apostle of Christ. Such behaviour greatly recommends 
 religion, and is most agreeable to God's gracious dealing with sinners, 
 in and by the gospel. This great apostle, though he abhorred and 
 avoided flattery, was most condescending to all men. He accommodated 
 himself to all men's capacities, <I>and became all things to all 
 men.</I> He showed the kindness and care of a nurse that cherishes her 
 children. This is the way to win people, rather than to rule with 
 rigour. The word of God is indeed powerful; and as it comes often with 
 awful authority upon the minds of men, as it always has enough in it to 
 convince every impartial judgment, so it comes with the more pleasing 
 power, when the ministers of the gospel recommend themselves to the 
 affections of the people. And as a nursing mother bears with 
 frowardness in a child, and condescends to mean offices for its good, 
 and draws out her breast, cherishing it in her bosom, so in like manner 
 should the ministers of Christ behave towards their people. The
 <I>servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, and
 patient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:24">2 Tim. ii. 24</A>.

 This gentleness and goodness the apostle expressed several ways. 

 1. By the most affectionate desire of their welfare: <I>Being 
 affectionately desirous of you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The apostle had a most affectionate love to their persons, and sought
 them, not theirs; themselves, not their goods; and to gain them, not to 
 be a gainer by them, or to make a merchandise of them: it was their 
 spiritual and eternal welfare and salvation that he was earnestly 
 desirous of. 

 2. By great readiness to do them good, willingly imparting to them,
 <I>not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See here the manner of Paul's preaching. He spared no pains therein.
 He was willing to run hazards, and venture his soul, or life, in 
 preaching the gospel. He was willing to spend and be spent in the 
 service of men's souls; and, as those who give bread to the hungry from 
 a charitable principle are said to impart their souls in what they give

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:10">Isa. xviii. 10</A>),

 so did the apostles in giving forth the bread of life; so dear were 
 these Thessalonians in particular to this apostle, and so great was his 
 love to them. 

 3. By bodily labour to prevent their charge, or that his ministry might
 not be expensive and burdensome to them: <I>You remember our labour and 
 travail; for, labouring night and day,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He denied himself the liberty he had of taking wages from the churches. 
 To the labour of the ministry he added that of his calling, as a 
 tent-maker, that he might get his own bread. We are not to suppose that 
 the apostle spent the whole night and day in bodily labour, or work, to 
 supply the necessities of his body; for then he would have had no time 
 for the work of the ministry. But he spent part of the night, as well 
 as the day, in this work; and was willing to forego his rest in the 
 night, that he might have an opportunity to do good to the souls of men 
 in the day time. A good example is here set before the ministers of the 
 gospel, to be industrious for the salvation of men's souls, though it 
 will not follow that they are always obliged to preach freely. There is 
 no general rule to be drawn from this instance, either that ministers 
 may at no time work with their hands, for the supply of their outward 
 necessities, or that they ought always to do so. 

 4. By the holiness of their conversation, concerning which he appeals
 not only to them, but to God also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>You are witnesses, and God also.</I> They were observers of their 
 outward conversation in public before men, and God was witness not only 
 of their behaviour in secret, but of the inward principles from which 
 they acted. Their behaviour was holy towards God, just towards all men, 
 and unblamable, without giving cause of scandal or offence; and they 
 were careful to give no offence either to those who were without, or to 
 those who believed, that they might give no ill example; that their 
 preaching and living might be all of a piece. Herein, said this
 apostle, <I>do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of 
 offence towards God, and towards men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Acts xxiv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He mentions their faithful discharge of the work and office of the 
 ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Concerning this also he could appeal to them as witnesses. Paul and his 
 fellow-labourers were not only good Christians, but faithful ministers. 
 And we should not only be good as to our general calling as Christians, 
 but in our particular callings and relations. Paul exhorted the 
 Thessalonians, not only informing them in their duty, but exciting and 
 quickening them to the performance of it, by proper motives and 
 arguments. And he comforted them also, endeavouring to cheer and 
 support their spirits under the difficulties and discouragements they 
 might meet with. And this he did not only publicly, but privately also, 
 and from house to house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:20">Acts xx. 20</A>),
 
 <I>and charged every one</I> of them by personal addresses: this, some 
 think, is intended by the similitude of a father's charging his 
 children. This expression also denotes the affectionate and 
 compassionate counsels and consolations which this apostle used. He was 
 their spiritual father; and, as he cherished them like a nursing 
 mother, so he charged them as a father, with a father's affection 
 rather than a father's authority. As <I>my beloved sons, I warn 
 you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:14">1 Cor. iv. 14</A>.

 The manner of this apostle's exhortation ought to be regarded by
 ministers in particular for their imitation, and the matter of it is 
 greatly to be regarded by them and all others; namely, that <I>they 
 would walk worthy of God, who hath called them to his kingdom and 
 glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. What is our great gospel privilege--that God has called us to his 
 kingdom and glory. The gospel calls us into the kingdom and state of 
 grace here and unto the kingdom and state of glory hereafter, to heaven 
 and happiness as our end and to holiness as the way to that end. 

 2. What is our great gospel duty--that we walk worthy of God, that the
 temper of our minds and tenour of our lives be answerable to this call 
 and suitable to this privilege. We should accommodate ourselves to the 
 intention and design of the gospel, and live suitably to our profession 
 and privileges, our hopes and expectations, as becomes those who are 
 called with such a high and holy calling.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
 when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye
 received <I>it</I> not <I>as</I> the word of men, but as it is in truth,
 the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
 believe.
 &nbsp; 14  For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God
 which in Jud&aelig;a are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered
 like things of your own countrymen, even as they <I>have</I> of the
 Jews:
 &nbsp; 15  Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and
 have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to
 all men:
 &nbsp; 16  Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be
 saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon
 them to the uttermost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here observe, 

 I. The apostle makes mention of the success of his ministry among these 
 Thessalonians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 which is expressed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the manner of their receiving the word of God: <I>When you 
 received the word of God, which you heard of us, you received it, not 
 as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</I> Where 
 note, 

 (1.) The word of the gospel is preached by men like ourselves, men of 
 like passions and infirmities with others: <I>We have this treasure in 
 earthen vessels.</I> The word of God, which these Thessalonians 
 received, they heard from the apostles. 

 (2.) However, it is in truth the word of God. Such was the word the
 apostles preached by divine inspiration, and such is that which is left 
 upon record, written in the scriptures by divine inspiration; and such 
 is that word which in our days is preached, being either contained, or 
 evidently founded on, or deduced from, these sacred oracles. 

 (3.) Those are greatly to blame who give out their own fancies or 
 injunctions for the word of God. This is the vilest way of imposing 
 upon a people, and to deal unfaithfully.

 (4.) Those are also to blame who, in hearing the word, look no further 
 than to the ministry of men, who are only, or chiefly, pleased with the 
 elegance of the style, or the beauty of the composition, or the voice 
 and manner in which the word is preached, and expect to receive their 
 advantage herein. 

 (5.) We should receive the word of God as the word of God, with
 affections suitable to the holiness, wisdom, verity, and goodness, 
 thereof. The words of men are frail and perishing, like themselves, and 
 sometimes false, foolish, and fickle: but God's word is holy, wise, 
 just, and faithful; and, like its author, lives and abides for ever. 
 Let us accordingly receive and regard it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By the wonderful operation of this word they received: <I>It 
 effectually worketh in those that believe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Those who by faith receive the word find it profitable. <I>It does good 
 to those that walk uprightly,</I> and by its wonderful effects 
 evidences itself to be the word of God. This converts their souls, and 
 enlightens their minds, and rejoices their hearts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-14">Ps. xix.</A>);

 and such as have this inward testimony of the truth of the scriptures,
 the word of God, by the effectual operations thereof on their hearts, 
 have the best evidence of their divine original to themselves, though 
 this is not sufficient to convince others who are strangers 
 thereto.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He mentions the good effects which his successful preaching 
 had,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Upon himself and fellow-labourers. It was a constant cause of 
 thankfulness: <I>For this cause thank we God without ceasing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The apostle expressed his thankfulness to God so often upon this 
 account that he seemed to think he never could be sufficiently thankful 
 that God had counted him faithful, and put him into the ministry, and 
 made his ministrations successful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Upon them. The word wrought effectually in them, not only to be 
 examples unto others in faith and good works (which he had mentioned 
 before), but also in constancy and patience under sufferings and trials 
 for the sake of the gospel: <I>You became followers of the churches of 
 God, and have suffered like things as they have done</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and with like courage and constancy, with like patience and hope. Note, 
 The cross is the Christian's mark: if we are called to suffer we are 
 called only to be followers of the churches of God; <I>so persecuted 
 they the prophets that were before you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12">Matt. v. 12</A>.

 It is a good effect of the gospel when we are enabled to suffer for its
 sake. The apostle mentions the sufferings of the churches of God, which
 <I>in Judea were in Christ Jesus.</I> Those in Judea first heard the
 gospel, and they first suffered for it: for the Jews were the most
 bitter enemies Christianity had, and were especially enraged against
 their countrymen who embraced Christianity. Note, Bitter zeal and fiery
 persecution will set countrymen at variance, and break through all the
 bonds of nature, as well as contradict all the rules of religion. In
 every city where the apostles went to preach the gospel the Jews
 stirred up the inhabitants against them. They were the ringleaders of
 persecution in all places; so in particular it was at Thessalonica:
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:5">Acts xvii. 5</A>,

 <I>The Jews that believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain
 lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the 
 city in an uproar.</I> Upon this occasion, the apostle gives a 
 character of the unbelieving Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 enough to justify their final rejection and the ruin of their place, 
 and church, and nation, which was now approaching. 

 (1.) They <I>killed the Lord Jesus,</I> and impudently and 
 presumptuously wished that his blood might be on them and their 
 children. 

 (2.) They killed <I>their own prophets:</I> so they had done all along; 
 their fathers had done so: they had been a persecuting generation. 

 (3.) They hated the apostles, and did them all the mischief they could. 
 They persecuted them, and drove and chased them from place to place: 
 and no marvel, if they killed the Lord Jesus, that they persecuted his 
 followers. 

 (4.) They <I>pleased not God.</I> They had quite lost all sense of 
 religion, and due care to do their duty to God. It was a most fatal
 mistake to think that they did God service by killing God's servants. 
 Murder and persecution are most hateful to God and cannot be justified 
 on any pretence; they are so contrary to natural religion that no zeal 
 for any true or only pretended institution of religion can ever excuse 
 them.

 (5.) They were <I>contrary to all men.</I> Their persecuting spirit was 
 a perverse spirit; contrary to the light of nature, and contrary to 
 humanity, contrary to the welfare of all men, and contrary to the 
 sentiments of all men not under the power of bigotry. 

 (6.) They had <I>an implacable enmity to the Gentiles,</I> and envied 
 them the offers of the gospel: <I>Forbidding the apostles to speak to 
 the Gentiles, that they might be saved.</I> The means of salvation had 
 long been confined to the Jews. <I>Salvation is of the Jews,</I> says
 our Saviour. And they were envious against the Gentiles, and angry that 
 they should be admitted to share in the means of salvation. Nothing 
 provoked them more than our Saviour's speaking to them at any time 
 concerning this matter; this enraged the Jews at Jerusalem, when, in 
 his defence, Paul told them, <I>he was sent unto the Gentiles,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21">Acts xxii. 21</A>.

 They heard him patiently till he uttered these words, but then could
 endure no longer, but <I>lifted up their voices, and said, Away with 
 such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should 
 live.</I> Thus did the Jews fill up their sins; and nothing tends more 
 to any person or people's filling up the measure of their sins than 
 opposing the gospel, obstructing the progress of it, and hindering the 
 salvation of precious souls. For the sake of these things <I>wrath has 
 come upon them to the uttermost;</I> that is, wrath was determined 
 against them, and would soon overtake them. It was not many years after 
 this that Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Jewish nation cut off by the 
 Romans. Note, When the measure of any man's iniquity is full, and he 
 has sinned to the uttermost, then comes wrath, and that to the 
 uttermost.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
 presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see
 your face with great desire.

 again; but Satan hindered us.
 &nbsp; 19  For what <I>is</I> our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? <I>Are</I>
 not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle apologizes for his absence. Here observe, 

 1. He tells them they were involuntarily forced from them: <I>We,
 brethren, were taken from you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Such was the rage of his persecutors. He was unwillingly sent away by 
 night to Berea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:10">Acts xvii. 10</A>.

 2. Though he was absent in body, yet he was present in heart. He had 
 still a remembrance of them, and great care for them. 

 3. Even his bodily absence was but for a short time, the time of an
 hour. Time is short, all our time on earth is short and uncertain, 
 whether we are present with our friends or absent from them. This
 world is not a place where we are always, or long, to be together. It
 is in heaven that holy souls shall meet, and never part more. 

 4. He earnestly desired and endeavoured to see them again: <I>We
 endeavoured more abundantly to see your face with great desire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 So that the apostle at least intended his absence should be but for a 
 short time. His desire and endeavour were to return again very soon to
 Thessalonica. But men of business are not masters of their own time.
 Paul did his endeavour, and he could do no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 5. He tells them that Satan hindered his return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, either some enemy or enemies, or the great enemy of mankind, 
 who stirred up opposition to Paul, either in his return to 
 Thessalonica, when he intended to return thither, or stirred up such 
 contentions or dissensions in those places whether he went as made his 
 presence necessary. Note, Satan is a constant enemy to the work of God, 
 and does all he can to obstruct it. 

 6. He assures them of his affection and high esteem for them, though he
 was not able, as yet, to be present with them according to his desire. 
 They were his <I>hope, and joy, and crown of rejoicing; his glory and 
 joy.</I> These are expressions of great and endeared affection, and 
 high estimation. And it is happy when ministers and people have such 
 mutual affection and esteem of each other, and especially if they shall 
 thus rejoice, if those that sow and those that reap shall rejoice 
 together, <I>in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his 
 coming.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here puts the Thessalonians in mind that though he could 
 not come to them as yet, and though he should never be able to come to 
 them, yet our Lord Jesus Christ will come, nothing shall hinder this.
 And further, when he shall come, all must appear in his presence, or 
 before him. Ministers and people must all appear before him, and 
 faithful people will be the glory and joy of faithful ministers in that 
 great and glorious day.</P>
