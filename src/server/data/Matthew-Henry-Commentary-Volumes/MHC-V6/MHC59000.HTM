 writer of this epistle was not James the son of Zebedee; for he was put 
 to death by Herod

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:1,2">Acts xii.</A>)

 before Christianity had gained so much ground among the Jews of the
 dispersion as is here implied. But it was the other James, the son of 
 Alpheus, who was cousin-german to Christ, and one of the twelve 
 apostles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:3">Matt. x. 3</A>.

 He is called <I>a pillar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Gal. ii. 9</A>),

 and this epistle of his cannot be disputed, without loosening a
 foundation-stone. It is called a general epistle, because (as some 
 think) not directed to any particular person or church, but such a one 
 as we call a circular letter. Others think it is called general, or 
 catholic, to distinguish it from the epistles of Ignatius, Barnabas, 
 Polycarp, and others who were noted in the primitive times, but not 
 generally received in the church, and on that account not canonical, as 
 this is. Eusebius tells us that this epistle was "generally read in the 
 churches with the other catholic epistles." His. Eccles. page 53. Ed.
 Val. Anno 1678. James, our author, was called the just, for his great 
 piety. He was an eminent example of those graces which he presses upon 
 others. He was so exceedingly revered for his justice, temperance, and 
 devotion, that Josephus the Jewish historian records it as one of the 
 causes of the destruction of Jerusalem, "That St. James was martyred in 
 it." This is mentioned in hopes of procuring the greater regard to what 
 is penned by so holy and excellent a man. The time when this epistle
 was written is uncertain. The design of it is to reprove Christians for 
 their great degeneracy both in faith and manners, and to prevent the 
 spreading of those libertine doctrines which threatened the destruction 
 of all practical godliness. It was also a special intention of the 
 author of this epistle to awaken the Jewish nation to a sense of the 
 greatness and nearness of those judgments which were coming upon them; 
 and to support all true Christians in the way of their duty, under the 
 calamities and persecutions they might meet with. The truths laid down 
 are very momentous, and necessary to be maintained; and the rules for 
 practice, as here stated, are such as ought to be observed in our times 
 as well as in preceding ages.</P>
