 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The introduction to the whole epistle, which is much the same as in 
 others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The apostle's thanksgivings and praises to God for his inestimable
 blessings bestowed on the believing Ephesians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3-14">ver. 3-14</A>.

 III. His earnest prayers to God in their behalf,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:15-23">ver. 15-23</A>.

 This great apostle was wont to abound in prayers and in thanksgivings 
 to almighty God, which he generally so disposes and orders that at the 
 same time they carry with them and convey the great and important 
 doctrines of the Christian religion, and the most weighty instructions 
 to all those who seriously peruse them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
 saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
 &nbsp; 2  Grace <I>be</I> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <I>from</I>
 the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The title St. Paul takes to himself, as belonging to him--<I>Paul,
 an apostle of Jesus Christ,</I> &c. He reckoned it a great honour to be 
 employed by Christ, as one of his messengers to the sons of men. The 
 apostles were prime officers in the Christian church, being 
 extraordinary ministers appointed for a time only. They were furnished 
 by their great Lord with extraordinary gifts and the immediate 
 assistance of the Spirit, that they might be fitted for publishing and 
 spreading the gospel and for governing the church in its infant state.
 Such a one Paul was, and that not <I>by the will</I> of man conferring 
 that office upon him, nor by his own intrusion into it; but <I>by the 
 will of God,</I> very expressly and plainly intimated to him, he being 
 immediately called (as the other apostles were) by Christ himself to 
 the work. Every faithful minister of Christ (though his call and office 
 are not of so extraordinary a nature) may, with our apostle, reflect on 
 it as an honour and comfort to himself that he is what he is <I>by the 
 will of God.</I> 

 2. The persons to whom this epistle is sent: <I>To the saints who are 
 at Ephesus,</I> that is, to the Christians who were members of the 
 church at Ephesus, the metropolis of Asia. He calls them saints, for 
 such they were in profession, such they were bound to be in truth and 
 reality, and many of them were such. All Christians must be saints; 
 and, if they come not under that character on earth, they will never be 
 saints in glory. He calls them <I>the faithful in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 believers in him, and firm and constant in their adherence to him and 
 to his truths and ways. Those are not saints who are not faithful, 
 believing in Christ, firmly adhering to him, and true to the profession 
 they make of relation to their Lord. Note, It is the honour not only of 
 ministers, but of private Christians too, to have obtained mercy of the 
 Lord to be faithful.--<I>In Christ Jesus,</I> from whom they derive all 
 their grace and spiritual strength, and in whom their persons, and all 
 that they perform, are made accepted. 

 3. The apostolical benediction: <I>Grace be to you,</I> &c. This is the
 token in every epistle; and it expresses the apostle's good-will to his 
 friends, and a real desire of their welfare. By <I>grace</I> we are to 
 understand the free and undeserved love and favour of God, and those 
 graces of the Spirit which proceed from it; by <I>peace</I> all other 
 blessings, spiritual and temporal, the fruits and product of the 
 former. No peace without grace. No peace, nor grace, but <I>from God
 the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> These peculiar 
 blessings proceed from God, not as a Creator, but as a Father by 
 special relation: and they come from our Lord Jesus Christ, who, having 
 purchased them for his people, has a right to bestow them upon them.
 Indeed the saints, and the faithful in Christ Jesus, had already 
 received grace and peace; but the increase of these is very desirable, 
 and the best saints stand in need of fresh supplies of the graces of 
 the Spirit, and cannot but desire to improve and grow: and therefore 
 they should pray, each one for himself and all for one another, that 
 such blessings may still abound unto them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After this short introduction he comes to the matter and body of the 
 epistle; and, though it may seem somewhat peculiar in a letter, yet the 
 Spirit of God saw fit that his discourse of divine things in this 
 chapter should be cast into prayers and praises, which, as they are 
 solemn addresses to God, so they convey weighty instructions to others. 
 Prayer may preach; and praise may do so too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Blessed <I>be</I> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
 hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <I>places</I>
 in Christ:
 &nbsp; 4  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation
 of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him
 in love:
 &nbsp; 5  Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by
 Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his
 will,
 &nbsp; 6  To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
 us accepted in the beloved.
 &nbsp; 7  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
 of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
 &nbsp; 8  Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and
 prudence;
 &nbsp; 9  Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
 to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
 &nbsp; 10  That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might
 gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
 heaven, and which are on earth; <I>even</I> in him:
 &nbsp; 11  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being
 predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
 things after the counsel of his own will:
 &nbsp; 12  That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first
 trusted in Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  In whom ye also <I>trusted,</I> after that ye heard the word of
 truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye
 believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
 &nbsp; 14  Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption
 of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He begins with thanksgivings and praise, and enlarges with a great deal 
 of fluency and copiousness of affection upon the exceedingly great and 
 precious benefits which we enjoy by Jesus Christ. For the great 
 privileges of our religion are very aptly recounted and enlarged upon 
 in our praises to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general he blesses God for <I>spiritual blessings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>,

 where he styles him <I>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> 
 for, as Mediator, the Father was his God; as God, and the second person 
 in the blessed Trinity, God was his Father. It bespeaks the mystical 
 union between Christ and believers, that the God and Father of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ is their God and Father, and that in and through him. All 
 blessings come from God as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. No good 
 can be expected from a righteous and holy God to sinful creatures, but 
 by his mediation. <I>He hath blessed us with all spiritual 
 blessings.</I> Note, Spiritual blessings are the best blessings with 
 which God blesses us, and for which we are to bless him. He blesses us 
 by bestowing such things upon us as make us really blessed. We cannot 
 thus bless God again; but must do it by praising, and magnifying, and 
 speaking well of him on that account. Those whom God blesses with some 
 he blesses with all spiritual blessings; to whom he gives Christ, he 
 freely gives all these things. It is not so with temporal blessings; 
 some are favoured with health, and not with riches; some with riches, 
 and not with health, &c. But, where God blesses with spiritual 
 blessings, he blesses with all. They are <I>spiritual blessings in 
 heavenly places;</I> that is, say some, in the church, distinguished 
 from the world, and called out of it. Or it may be read, <I>in heavenly 
 things,</I> such as come from heaven, and are designed to prepare men 
 for it, and to secure their reception into it. We should hence learn to 
 mind spiritual and heavenly things as the principal things, spiritual 
 and heavenly blessings as the best blessings, with which we cannot be 
 miserable and without which we cannot but be so. <I>Set not your 
 affections on things on the earth, but on those things which are 
 above.</I> These we are blessed with in Christ; for, as all our 
 services ascend to God through Christ, so all our blessings are 
 conveyed to us in the same way, he being the Mediator between God and 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular spiritual blessings with which we are blessed in 
 Christ, and for which we ought to bless God, are (many of them) here 
 enumerated and enlarged upon. 

 1. Election and predestination, which are the secret springs whence the
 others flow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4,5,11"><I>v.</I> 4, 5, 11</A>.
 
 <I>Election,</I> or choice, respects that lump or mass of mankind out 
 of which some are chosen, from which they are separated and 
 distinguished. Predestination has respect to the blessings they are 
 designed for; particularly <I>the adoption of children,</I> it being 
 the purpose of God that in due time we should become his adopted 
 children, and so have a right to all the privileges and to the 
 inheritance of children. We have here the date of this act of love: it 
 was <I>before the foundation of the world;</I> not only before God's 
 people had a being, but before the world had a beginning; for they were 
 chosen in the counsel of God from all eternity. It magnifies these 
 blessings to a high degree that they are the products of eternal 
 counsel. The alms which you give to beggars at your doors proceed from 
 a sudden resolve; but the provision which a parent makes for his 
 children is the result of many thoughts, and is put into his last will 
 and testament with a great deal of solemnity. And, as this magnifies 
 divine love, so it secures the blessings to God's elect; for <I>the 
 purpose of God according to election shall stand.</I> He acts in 
 pursuance of his eternal purpose in bestowing spiritual blessings upon 
 his people. <I>He hath blessed us</I>--<I>according as he hath chosen us
 in him,</I> in Christ the great head of the election, who is 
 emphatically called <I>God's elect, his chosen;</I> and in the chosen 
 Redeemer an eye of favour was cast upon them. Observe here one great 
 end and design of this choice: <I>chosen--that we should be holy;</I>
 not because he foresaw they would be holy, but because he determined to 
 make them so. All who are chosen to happiness as the end are chosen to 
 holiness as the means. Their sanctification, as well as their 
 salvation, is the result of the counsels of divine love.--<I>And without
 blame before him</I>--that their holiness might not be merely external
 and in outward appearance, so as to prevent blame from men, but 
 internal and real, and what God himself, who <I>looketh at the 
 heart,</I> will account such, such holiness as proceeds from love to 
 God and to our fellow-creatures, this charity being the principle of 
 all true holiness. The original word signifies such an innocence as no 
 man can carp at; and therefore some understand it of that perfect 
 holiness which the saints shall attain in the life to come, which will 
 be eminently before God, they being in his immediate presence for ever. 
 Here is also the rule and the fontal cause of God's election: it is 
 <I>according to the good pleasure of his will</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not for the sake of any thing in them foreseen, but because it was his
 sovereign will, and a thing highly pleasing to him. It is <I>according 
 to the purpose,</I> the fixed and unalterable will, <I>of him who 
 worketh all things after the counsel of his own will</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 who powerfully accomplishes whatever concerns his elect, as he has
 wisely and freely fore-ordained and decreed, the last and great end and 
 design of all which is his own glory: <I>To the praise of the glory of 
 his grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that we should be to the praise of his glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that is, that we should live and behave ourselves in such a manner that 
 his rich grace might be magnified, and appear glorious, and worthy of 
 the highest praise. <I>All is of God, and from him, and through 
 him,</I> and therefore all must be to him, and centre in his praise.
 Note, The glory of God is his own end, and it should be ours in all 
 that we do. This passage has been understood by some in a very
 different sense, and with a special reference to the conversion of 
 these Ephesians to Christianity. Those who have a mind to see what is 
 said to this purpose may consult Mr. Locke, and other well-known 
 writers, on the place. 

 2. The next spiritual blessing the apostle takes notice of is
 acceptance with God through Jesus Christ: <I>Wherein,</I> or by which 
 grace, <I>he hath made us accepted in the beloved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Jesus Christ is the beloved of his Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),

 as well as of angels and saints. It is our great privilege to be 
 accepted of God, which implies his love to us and his taking us under 
 his care and into his family. We cannot be thus accepted of God, but in 
 and through Jesus Christ. He loves his people for the sake of the 
 beloved. 

 3. Remission of sins, and redemption through the blood of Jesus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 No remission without redemption. It was by reason of sin that we were 
 captivated, and we cannot be released from our captivity but by the 
 remission of our sins. This redemption we have in Christ, and this
 remission through his blood. The guilt and the stain of sin could be no 
 otherwise removed than by the blood of Jesus. All our spiritual 
 blessings flow down to us in that stream. This great benefit, which 
 comes freely to us, was dearly bought and paid for by our blessed Lord; 
 and yet it is according to the riches of God's grace. Christ's 
 satisfaction and God's rich grace are very consistent in the great 
 affair of man's redemption. God was satisfied by Christ as our 
 substitute and surety; but it was rich grace that would accept of a 
 surety, when he might have executed the severity of the law upon the 
 transgressor, and it was rich grace to provide such a surety as his own 
 Son, and freely to deliver him up, when nothing of that nature could 
 have entered into our thoughts, nor have been any otherwise found out 
 for us. In this instance he has not only manifested riches of grace, 
 but <I>has abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 wisdom in contriving the dispensation, and prudence in executing the
 counsel of his will, as he has done. How illustrious have the divine
 wisdom and prudence rendered themselves, in so happily adjusting the
 matter between justice and mercy in this grand affair, in securing the
 honour of God and his law, at the same time that the recovery of
 sinners and their salvation are ascertained and made sure! 

 4. Another privilege which the apostle here blesses God for is divine 
 revelation--that God hath <I>made known to us the mystery of his 
 will</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that is, so much of his good-will to men, which had been concealed for 
 a long time, and is still concealed from so great a part of the world: 
 this we owe to Christ, who, having lain in the bosom of the Father from 
 eternity, came to declare his will to the children of men. <I>According 
 to his good pleasure,</I> his secret counsels concerning man's 
 redemption, <I>which he had purposed,</I> or resolved upon, merely in 
 and from himself, and not for any thing in them. In this revelation, 
 and in his <I>making known unto us the mystery of his will,</I> the 
 wisdom and the prudence of God do abundantly shine forth. It is
 described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 <I>as the word of truth, and the gospel of our salvation.</I> Every 
 word of it is true. It contains and instructs us in the most weighty
 and important truths, and it is confirmed and sealed by the very oath 
 of God, whence we should learn to <I>betake ourselves to it in all our 
 searches after divine truth.</I> It is the gospel of our salvation: it 
 publishes the glad tidings of salvation, and contains the offer of it: 
 it points out the way that leads to it; and the blessed Spirit renders 
 the reading and the ministration of it effectual to the salvation of 
 souls. O, how ought we to prize this glorious gospel and to bless God 
 for it! This is the light shining in a dark place, for which we have 
 reason to be thankful, and to which we should take heed. 

 5. Union in and with Christ is a great privilege, a spiritual blessing,
 and the foundation of many others. <I>He gathers together in one all 
 things in Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 All the lines of divine revelation meet in Christ; all religion centres 
 in him. Jews and Gentiles were united to each other by being both 
 united to Christ. <I>Things in heaven and things on earth</I> are
 gathered together in him; peace made, correspondence settled, between 
 heaven and earth, through him. The innumerable company of angels become 
 one with the church through Christ: this God <I>purposed in 
 himself,</I> and it was his design in that dispensation which was to be 
 accomplished by his sending Christ in the fulness of time, at the exact 
 time that God had prefixed and settled. 

 6. The eternal inheritance is the great blessing with which we are
 blessed in Christ: <I>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Heaven is the inheritance, the happiness of which is a sufficient 
 portion for a soul: it is conveyed in the way of an inheritance, being 
 the gift of a Father to his children. <I>If children, then heirs.</I> 
 All the blessings that we have in hand are but small if compared with 
 the inheritance. What is laid out upon an heir in his minority is 
 nothing to what is reserved for him when he comes to age. Christians 
 are said to have obtained this inheritance, as they have a present 
 right to it, and even actual possession of it, in Christ their head and 
 representative. 

 7. The seal and earnest of the Spirit are of the number of these
 blessings. We are said to be <I>sealed with that Holy Spirit of 
 promise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The blessed Spirit is holy himself, and he makes us holy. He is called 
 <I>the Spirit of promise,</I> as he is the promised Spirit. By him 
 believers are sealed; that is, separated and set apart for God, and 
 distinguished and marked as belonging to him. The Spirit <I>is the
 earnest of our inheritance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The earnest is part of payment, and it secures the full sum: so is the 
 gift of the Holy Ghost; all his influences and operations, both as a 
 sanctifier and a comforter, are heaven begun, glory in the seed and 
 bud. The Spirit's illumination is an earnest of everlasting light; 
 sanctification is an earnest of perfect holiness; and his comforts are 
 earnests of everlasting joys. He is said to be the earnest, <I>until 
 the redemption of the purchased possession.</I> It may be called here 
 the possession, because this earnest makes it as sure to the heirs as 
 though they were already possessed of it; and it is purchased for them 
 by the blood of Christ. The redemption of it is mentioned because it
 was mortgaged and forfeited by sin; and Christ restores it to us, and 
 so is said to redeem it, in allusion to the law of redemption. Observe, 
 from all this, what a gracious promise that is which secures the gift 
 of the Holy Ghost to those who ask him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle mentions the great end and design of God in bestowing all 
 these spiritual privileges, <I>that we should be to the praise of his 
 glory who first trusted in Christ</I>--we to whom the gospel was first
 preached, and who were first converted to the faith of Christ, and to 
 the placing of our hope and trust in him. Note, Seniority in grace is a 
 preferment: <I>Who were in Christ before me,</I> says the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:7">Rom. xvi. 7</A>);

 those who have for a longer time experienced the grace of Christ are 
 under more special obligations to glorify God. They should be strong in 
 faith, and more eminently glorify him; but this should be the common 
 end of all. For this we were made, and for this we were redeemed; this 
 is the great design of our Christianity, and of God in all that he has 
 done for us: <I>unto the praise of his glory,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He intends that his grace and power and other perfection should by this 
 means become conspicuous and illustrious, and that the sons of men 
 should magnify him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord

 &nbsp; 16  Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in
 my prayers;
 &nbsp; 17  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
 may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
 knowledge of him:
 &nbsp; 18  The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye
 may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of
 the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
 &nbsp; 19  And what <I>is</I> the exceeding greatness of his power to
 us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty
 power,
 &nbsp; 20  Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the
 dead, and set <I>him</I> at his own right hand in the heavenly
 <I>places,</I>
 &nbsp; 21  Far above all principality, and power, and might, and
 dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world,
 but also in that which is to come:
 &nbsp; 22  And hath put all <I>things</I> under his feet, and gave him <I>to
 be</I> the head over all <I>things</I> to the church,

 all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have come to the last part of this chapter, which consists of Paul's 
 earnest prayer to God in behalf of these Ephesians. We should pray for 
 the persons for whom we give thanks. Our apostle blesses God for what 
 he had done for them, and then he prays that he would do more for them. 
 He gives thanks for spiritual blessings, and prays for further supplies 
 of them; for God <I>will for this be enquired of by the house of 
 Israel, to do it for them.</I> He has laid up these spiritual blessings 
 for us in the hands of his Son, the Lord Jesus; but then he has 
 appointed us to draw them out, and fetch them in, by prayer. We have no 
 part nor lot in the matter, any further than we claim it by faith and 
 prayer. One inducement to pray for them was the good account he had of 
 them, <I>of their faith in the Lord Jesus and love to all the 
 saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Faith in Christ, and love to the saints, will be attended with all
 other graces. Love to the saints, as such, and because they are such, 
 must include love to God. Those who love saints, as such, love all
 saints, how weak in grace, how mean in the world, how fretful and 
 peevish soever, some of them may be. Another inducement to pray for 
 them was because they had received the earnest of the inheritance: this 
 we may observe from the words being connected with the preceding ones 
 by the particle <I>wherefore.</I> "Perhaps you will think that, having 
 received the earnest, it should follow, therefore you are happy enough, 
 and need take no further care: you need not pray for yourselves, nor I 
 for you." No, quite the contrary. <I>Wherefore--I cease not to give
 thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 While he blesses God for giving them the Spirit, he ceases not to pray 
 that he would give unto them the Spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 that he would give greater measures of the Spirit. Observe, Even the 
 best of Christians need to be prayed for: and, while we hear well of 
 our Christian friends, we should think ourselves obliged to intercede 
 with God for them, that they may abound and increase yet more and more. 
 Now what is it that Paul prays for in behalf of the Ephesians? Not that 
 they might be freed from persecution; nor that they might possess the 
 riches, honours, or pleasures of the world; but the great thing he 
 prays for is the illumination of their understandings, and that their 
 knowledge might increase and abound: he means it of a practical and 
 experimental knowledge. The graces and comforts of the Spirit are 
 communicated to the soul by the enlightening of the understanding. In 
 this way he gains and keeps possession. Satan takes a contrary way: he 
 gets possession by the senses and passions, Christ by the 
 understanding. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whence this knowledge must come from <I>the God of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The Lord <I>is a God of knowledge,</I> and there is no sound saving 
 knowledge but what comes from him; and therefore to him we must look 
 for it, who is <I>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 <I>and the Father of glory.</I> It is a Hebraism. God is infinitely 
 glorious in himself all glory is due to him from his creatures, and he 
 is the author of all that glory with which his saints are or shall be 
 invested. Now he gives knowledge by giving the Spirit of knowledge; for 
 the Spirit of God is the teacher of the saints, <I>the Spirit of wisdom 
 and revelation.</I> We have the revelation of the Spirit in the word: 
 but will that avail us, if we have not the wisdom of the Spirit in the 
 heart? If the same Spirit who indited the sacred scriptures do not take 
 the veil from off our hearts, and enable us to understand and improve 
 them, we shall be never the better.--<I>In the knowledge of him,</I> or 
 for the acknowledgment of him; not only a speculative knowledge of 
 Christ, and of what relates to him, but an acknowledgment of Christ's 
 authority by an obedient conformity to him, which must be by the help 
 of <I>the Spirit of wisdom and revelation.</I> This knowledge is first 
 in the understanding. He prays that <I>the eyes of their understanding 
 may be enlightened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Observe, Those who have their eyes opened, and have some understanding 
 in the things of God, have need to be more and more enlightened, and to 
 have their knowledge more clear, and distinct, and experimental.
 Christians should not think it enough to have warm affections, but they 
 should labour to have clear understandings; they should be ambitious of 
 being knowing Christians, and judicious Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it is that he more particularly desire they should grow in the 
 knowledge of. 
 
 1. <I>The hope of his calling,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Christianity is our calling. God has called us to it, and on that 
 account it is said to be his calling. There is a hope in this calling; 
 for those who deal with God deal upon trust. And it is a desirable 
 thing to know what this hope of our calling is, to have such an 
 acquaintance with the immense privileges of God's people, and the 
 expectations they have from God, and with respect to the heavenly 
 world, as to be quickened thereby to the utmost diligence and patience 
 in the Christian course. We ought to labour after, and pray earnestly 
 for, a clearer insight into, and a fuller acquaintance with, the great 
 objects of a Christian's hopes. 

 2. <I>The riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.</I>
 Besides the heavenly inheritance prepared for the saints, there is a 
 present inheritance in the saints; for grace is glory begun, and 
 holiness is happiness in the bud. There is a glory in this inheritance, 
 riches of glory, rendering the Christian more excellent and more truly 
 honourable than all about him: and it is desirable to know this 
 experimentally, to be acquainted with the principles, pleasures, and 
 powers, of the spiritual and divine life. It may be understood of the 
 glorious inheritance in or among the saints in heaven, where God does, 
 as it were, lay forth all his riches, to make them happy and glorious, 
 and where all that the saints are in possession of is transcendently 
 glorious, as the knowledge that can be attained of this upon earth is 
 very desirable, and must be exceedingly entertaining and delightful.
 Let us endeavour then, by reading, contemplation, and prayer, to know 
 as much of heaven as we can, that we may be desiring and longing to be 
 there. 

 3. <I>The exceeding greatness of God's power towards those who
 believe,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The practical belief of the all-sufficiency of God, and of the 
 omnipotence of divine grace, is absolutely necessary to a close and 
 steady walking with him. It is a desirable thing to know
 experimentally the mighty power of that grace beginning and carrying on 
 the work of faith in our souls. It is a difficult thing to bring a soul 
 to believe in Christ, and to venture its all upon his righteousness, 
 and upon the hope of eternal life. It is nothing less than an almighty 
 power that will work this in us. The apostle speaks here with a mighty 
 fluency and copiousness of expression, and yet, at the same time, as if 
 he wanted words to express the <I>exceeding greatness of God's almighty 
 power,</I> that power which God exerts towards his people, and by which 
 <I>he raised Christ from the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 That indeed was the great proof of the truth of the gospel to the 
 world: but the transcript of that in ourselves (our sanctification, and 
 rising from the death of sin, in conformity to Christ's resurrection) 
 is the great proof to us. Though this cannot prove the truth of the
 gospel to another who knows nothing of the matter (there the 
 resurrection of Christ is the proof), yet to be able to speak 
 experimentally, as the Samaritans, "<I>We have heard him ourselves,</I> 
 we have felt a mighty change in our hearts," will make us able to say, 
 with the fullest satisfaction, <I>Now we believe, and are sure, that 
 this is the Christ, the Son of God.</I> Many understand the apostle 
 here as speaking of that <I>exceeding greatness of power</I> which God 
 will exert for raising the bodies of believers to eternal life, even 
 the same <I>mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised 
 him,</I> &c. And how desirable a thing must it be to become at length 
 acquainted with that power, by being raised out of the grave thereby 
 unto eternal life!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having said something of Christ and his resurrection, the apostle 
 digresses a little from the subject he is upon to make some further 
 honourable mention of the Lord Jesus and his exaltation. He sits at the 
 Father's <I>right hand in the heavenly places,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 Jesus Christ is advanced above all, and he is set in authority over 
 all, they being made subject to him. All the glory of the upper world, 
 and all the powers of both worlds, are entirely devoted to him. The 
 Father <I>hath put all things under his feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 according to the promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 All creatures whatsoever are in subjection to him; they must either 
 yield him sincere obedience or fall under the weight of his sceptre, 
 and receive their doom from him. God <FONT SIZE=-1>GAVE</FONT> <I>him 
 to be head over all things.</I> It was a gift to Christ, considered as 
 a Mediator, to be advanced to such dominion and headship, and to have 
 such a mystical body prepared for him: and it was a gift to the church, 
 to be provided with a head endued with so much power and authority. God 
 <I>gave him to be the head over all things.</I> He gave him all power 
 both in heaven and in earth. <I>The Father loves the Son, and hath 
 given</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>ALL</FONT> <I>things into his hands.</I> But 
 that which completes the comfort of this is that he is the head over 
 all things to the church; he is entrusted with all power, that is, that 
 he may dispose of all the affairs of the providential kingdom in 
 subserviency to the designs of his grace concerning his church. With 
 this therefore we may answer the messengers of the nations, that the 
 Lord hath founded Zion. The same power that supports the world support 
 the church; and we are sure he loves his church, for it <I>is his 
 body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 his mystical body, and he will care for it. It is <I>the fulness of him 
 that filleth all in all.</I> Jesus Christ filleth all in all; he 
 supplies all defects in all his members, filling them with his Spirit, 
 and even with <I>the fulness of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 19</A>.

 And yet the church is said to be his fulness, because Christ as
 Mediator would not be complete if he had not a church. How could he be 
 a king if he had not a kingdom? This therefore comes in to the honour 
 of Christ, <I>as Mediator, that the church is his fulness.</I></P>
