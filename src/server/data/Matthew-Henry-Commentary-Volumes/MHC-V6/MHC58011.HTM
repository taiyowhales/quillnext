 The apostle having, in the close of the foregoing chapter, recommended
 the grace of faith and a life of faith as the best preservative against 
 apostasy, he now enlarges upon the nature and fruits of this excellent
 grace. 

 I. The nature of it, and the honour it reflects upon all who live in
 the exercise of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The great examples we have in the Old Testament of those who lived
 by faith, and died and suffered extraordinary things by the strength of 
 his grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:4-38">ver. 4-38</A>.

 And, 

 III. The advantages that we have in the gospel for the exercise of
 this grace above what those had who lived in the times of the Old 
 Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:39,40">ver. 39, 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
 of things not seen.
 &nbsp; 2  For by it the elders obtained a good report.
 &nbsp; 3  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by
 the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of
 things which do appear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. A definition or description of the grace of faith in two parts. 

 1. It <I>is the substance of things hoped for.</I> Faith and hope go
 together; and the same things that are the object of our hope are the 
 object of our faith. It is a firm persuasion and expectation that God 
 will perform all that he has promised to us in Christ; and this 
 persuasion is so strong that it gives the soul a kind of possession and 
 present fruition of those things, gives them a subsistence in the soul, 
 by the first-fruits and foretastes of them: so that believers in the 
 exercise of faith <I>are filled with joy unspeakable and full of 
 glory.</I> Christ dwells in the soul by faith, and the soul is filled 
 with the fullness of God, as far as his present measure will admit; he 
 experiences a substantial reality in the objects of faith. 

 2. It is <I>the evidence of things not seen.</I> Faith demonstrates to
 the eye of the mind the reality of those things that cannot be 
 discerned by the eye of the body. Faith is the firm assent of the soul 
 to the divine revelation and every part of it, and sets to its seal 
 that God is true. It is a full approbation of all that God has
 revealed as holy, just, and good; it helps the soul to make application 
 of all to itself with suitable affections and endeavours; and so it is 
 designed to serve the believer instead of sight, and to be to the soul 
 all that the senses are to the body. That faith is but opinion or fancy 
 which does not realize invisible things to the soul, and excite the 
 soul to act agreeably to the nature and importance of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of the honour it reflects upon all those who have lived 
 in the exercise of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>By it the elders obtained a good report</I>--the ancient believers, 
 who lived in the first ages of the world. Observe, 

 1. True faith is an old grace, and has the best plea to antiquity: it
 is not a new invention, a modern fancy; it is a grace that has been 
 planted in the soul of man ever since the covenant of grace was 
 published in the world; and it has been practiced from the beginning of 
 the revelation; the eldest and best men that ever were in the world 
 were believers. 

 2. Their faith was their honour; it reflected honour upon them. They
 were an honour to their faith, and their faith was an honour to them. 
 It put them upon doing <I>the things that were of good report,</I> and 
 God has taken care that a record shall be kept and report made of the 
 excellent things they did in the strength of this grace. The genuine 
 actings of faith will bear to be reported, deserve to be reported, and 
 will, when reported, redound to the honour of true believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here one of the first acts and articles of faith, which 
 has a great influence on all the rest, and which is common to all 
 believers in every age and part of the world, namely, the creation of 
 the <I>worlds by the word of God,</I> not out of pre-existent matter, 
 but out of nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The grace of faith has a retrospect as well as prospect; it looks not 
 only forward to the end of the world, but back to the beginning of the 
 world. By faith we understand much more of the formation of the world 
 than ever could be understood by the naked eye of natural reason. Faith 
 is not a force upon the understanding, but a friend and a help to it. 
 Now what does faith give us to understand concerning <I>the worlds,</I> 
 that is, the upper, middle, and lower regions of the universe? 

 1. <I>That these worlds were</I> not eternal, nor did they produce
 themselves, but they were made by another. 

 2. That the maker of the worlds is god; he is the maker of all things;
 and whoever is so must be God. 

 3. That he made the world with great exactness; it was a <I>framed</I>
 work, in every thing duly adapted and disposed to answer its end, and
 to express the perfections of the Creator. 

 4. That God made the world by his word, that is, by his essential 
 wisdom and eternal Son, and by his active will, saying, <I>Let it be 
 done, and it was done,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:9">Ps. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 5. That the world was thus framed out of nothing, out of no
 pre-existent matter, contrary to the received maxim, that "out of 
 nothing nothing can be made," which, though true of created power, can 
 have no place with God, who can call <I>things that are not as if they 
 were,</I> and command them into being. These things we understand by 
 faith. The Bible gives us the truest and most exact account of the 
 origin of all things, and we are to believe it, and not to wrest or run 
 down the scripture-account of the creation, because it does not suit 
 with some fantastic hypotheses of our own, which has been in some 
 learned but conceited men the first remarkable step towards infidelity, 
 and has led them into many more.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
 than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous,
 God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
 speaketh.
 &nbsp; 5  By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
 and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his
 translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
 &nbsp; 6  But without faith <I>it is</I> impossible to please <I>him:</I> for he
 that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <I>that</I> he is a
 rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
 &nbsp; 7  By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
 moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by
 the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
 righteousness which is by faith.
 &nbsp; 8  By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
 which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he
 went out, not knowing whither he went.
 &nbsp; 9  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <I>in</I> a
 strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob,
 the heirs with him of the same promise:
 &nbsp; 10  For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
 builder and maker <I>is</I> God.
 &nbsp; 11  Through faith also Sara herself received strength to
 conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past
 age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
 <I>so many</I> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand
 which is by the sea shore innumerable.
 &nbsp; 13  These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
 but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <I>them,</I> and
 embraced <I>them,</I> and confessed that they were strangers and
 pilgrims on the earth.
 &nbsp; 14  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek
 a country.
 &nbsp; 15  And truly, if they had been mindful of that <I>country</I> from
 whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
 returned.
 &nbsp; 16  But now they desire a better <I>country,</I> that is, an
 heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God:
 for he hath prepared for them a city.
 &nbsp; 17  By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and
 he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
 <I>son,</I>
 &nbsp; 18  Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
 &nbsp; 19  Accounting that God <I>was</I> able to raise <I>him</I> up, even from
 the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
 &nbsp; 20  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
 come.
 &nbsp; 21  By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons
 of Joseph; and worshipped, <I>leaning</I> upon the top of his staff.
 &nbsp; 22  By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing
 of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his
 bones.
 &nbsp; 23  By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of
 his parents, because they saw <I>he was</I> a proper child; and they
 were not afraid of the king's commandment.
 &nbsp; 24  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be
 called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
 &nbsp; 25  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
 than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
 &nbsp; 26  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
 treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the
 reward.
 &nbsp; 27  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the
 king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
 &nbsp; 28  Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
 blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
 &nbsp; 29  By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <I>land:</I>
 which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
 &nbsp; 30  By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
 compassed about seven days.
 &nbsp; 31  By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that
 believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having given us a more general account of the grace of 
 faith, now proceeds to set before us some illustrious examples of it in 
 the Old-Testament times, and these may be divided into two classes:--

 1. Those whose names are mentioned, and the particular exercise and
 actings of whose faith are specified. 

 2. Those whose names are barely mentioned, and an account given in 
 general of the exploits of their faith, which it is left to the reader 
 to accommodate, and apply to the particular persons from what he 
 gathers up in the sacred story. We have here those whose names are not 
 only mentioned, but the particular trials and actings of their faith 
 are subjoined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The leading instance and example of faith here recorded is that of 
 Abel. It is observable that the Spirit of God has not thought fit to 
 say any thing here of the faith of our first parents; and yet the 
 church of God has generally, by a pious charity, taken it for granted 
 that God gave them repentance and faith in the promised seed, that he 
 instructed them in the mystery of sacrificing, that they instructed 
 their children in it, and that they found mercy with God, after they 
 had ruined themselves and all their posterity. But God has left the 
 matter still under some doubt, as a warning to all who have great 
 talents given to them, and a great trust reposed in them, that they do 
 not prove unfaithful, since God would not enroll our first parents 
 among the number of believers in this blessed calendar. It begins with 
 Abel, one of the first saints, and the first martyr for religion, of 
 all the sons of Adam, one who lived by faith, and died for it, and 
 therefore a fit pattern for the Hebrews to imitate. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What Abel did by faith: <I>He offered up a more acceptable sacrifice 
 than Cain,</I> a more full and perfect sacrifice, <B><I>pleiona 
 thysian.</I></B> Hence learn, 

 (1.) That, after the fall, God opened a new way for the children of men 
 to return to him in religious worship. This is one of the first
 instances that is upon record of fallen men going in to worship God; 
 and it was a wonder of mercy that all intercourse between God and man 
 was not cut off by the fall. 

 (2.) After the fall, God must be worshipped by sacrifices, a way of 
 worship which carries in it a confession of sin, and of the desert of 
 sin, and a profession of faith in a Redeemer, who was to be a ransom 
 for the souls of men. 

 (3.) That, from the beginning, there has been a remarkable difference 
 between the worshippers. Here were two persons, brethren, both of whom 
 went in to worship God, and yet there was a vast difference. Cain was 
 the elder brother, but Abel has the preference. It is not seniority of 
 birth, but grace, that makes men truly honourable. The difference is
 observable in their persons: Abel was an upright person, a righteous 
 man, a true believer; Cain was a formalist, had not a principle of 
 special grace. It is observable in their principles: Abel acted under
 the power of faith; Cain only from the force of education, or natural 
 conscience. There was also a very observable difference in their
 offerings: Abel brought a sacrifice of atonement, <I>brought of the 
 firstlings of the flock,</I> acknowledging himself to be a sinner who 
 deserved to die, and only hoping for mercy through <I>the great 
 sacrifice;</I> Cain brought only a sacrifice of acknowledgment, a mere 
 thank-offering, <I>the fruit of the ground,</I> which might, and 
 perhaps must, have been offered in innocency; here was no confession of 
 sin, no regard to the ransom; this was an essential defect in Cain's 
 offering. There will always be a difference between those who worship 
 the true God; some will compass him about with lies, others will be 
 faithful with the saints; some, like the Pharisee, will lean to their 
 own righteousness; others, like the publican, will confess their sin, 
 and cast themselves upon the mercy of God in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What Abel gained by his faith: the original record is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:4">Gen. iv. 4</A>,

 <I>God had respect to Abel, and to his offering;</I> first to his 
 person as gracious, then to his offering as proceeding from grace, 
 especially from the grace of faith. In this place we are told that he 
 obtained by his faith some special advantages; as, 

 (1.) <I>Witness that he was righteous,</I> a justified, sanctified, and 
 accepted person; this, very probably, was attested by fire from heaven, 
 kindling and consuming his sacrifice. 

 (2.) God gave witness to the righteousness of his person, by testifying 
 his acceptance of his gifts. When the fire, an emblem of God's
 justice, consumed the offering, it was a sign that the mercy of God 
 accepted the offerer for the sake of the great sacrifice. 

 (3.) <I>By it he, being dead, yet speaketh.</I> He had the honour to 
 leave behind him an instructive speaking case; and what does it speak 
 to us? What should we learn from it? 

 [1.] That fallen man has leave to go in to worship God, with hope of 
 acceptance.

 [2.] That, if our persons and offerings be accepted, it must be through 
 faith in the Messiah.

 [3.] That acceptance with God is a peculiar and distinguishing favour.

 [4.] That those who obtain this favour from God must expect the envy 
 and malice of the world.

 [5.] That God will not suffer the injuries done to his people to remain 
 unpunished, nor their sufferings unrewarded. These are very good and 
 useful instructions, and yet <I>the blood of sprinkling speaketh better 
 things than that of Abel.</I>

 [6.] That God would not suffer Abel's faith to die with him, but would 
 raise up others, who should obtain like precious faith; and so he did 
 in a little time; for in the next verse we read,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the faith of Enoch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He is the second of those elders that through faith have a good report. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What is here reported of him. In this place (and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:22">Gen. v. 22</A>,

 &c.) we read,

 (1.) <I>That he walked with God,</I> that is, that he was really,
 eminently, actively, progressively, and perseveringly religious in his 
 conformity to God, communion with God, and complacency in God.

 (2.) <I>That he was translated, that he should not see death,</I> nor
 any part of him be found upon earth; for God took him, soul and body, 
 into heaven, as he will do those of the saints who shall be found alive 
 at his second coming. 

 (3.) <I>That before his translation he had this testimony, that he 
 pleased God.</I> He had the evidence of it in his own conscience, and 
 the Spirit of God witnessed with his spirit. Those who by faith walk 
 with God in a sinful world are pleasing to him, and he will give them 
 marks of his favour, and put honour upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is here said of his faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is said that <I>without</I> this <I>faith it is impossible to please 
 God,</I> without such a faith as helps us to walk with God, an active 
 faith, and that we cannot come to God unless we <I>believe that he is, 
 and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</I>

 (1.) He must believe that God is, and that he is what he is, what he 
 has revealed himself to be in the scripture, a Being of infinite 
 perfections, subsisting in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
 Observe, The practical belief of the existence of God, as revealed in 
 the word, would be a powerful awe-band upon our souls, a bridle of 
 restraint to keep us from sin, and a spur of constraint to put us upon 
 all manner of gospel obedience.

 (2.) <I>That he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.</I> 
 Here observe, 

 [1.] By the fall we have lost God; we have lost the divine light, life, 
 love, likeness, and communion.

 [2.] God is again to be found of us through Christ, the second Adam.

 [3.] God has prescribed means and ways wherein he may be found; to 
 with, a strict attention to his oracles, attendance on his ordinances, 
 and ministers duly discharging their office and associating with his 
 people, observing his providential guidance, and in all things humbly 
 waiting his gracious presence.

 [4.] Those who would find God in these ways of his must <I>seek him 
 diligently;</I> they must seek early, earnestly, and perseveringly. 
 <I>Then shall they seek him, and find him, if they seek him with all 
 their heart;</I> and when once they have found him, as their reconciled 
 God, they will never repent the pains they have spent in seeking after 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The faith of Noah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The ground of Noah's faith--a warning he had received from God of
 things as yet not seen. He had a divine revelation, whether by voice or 
 vision does not appear; but it was such as carried in it its own 
 evidence; he was <I>forewarned of things not seen as yet,</I> that is, 
 of a great and severe judgment, such as the world had never yet seen, 
 and of which, in the course of second causes, there was not yet the 
 least sign. This secret warning he was to communicate to the world, who 
 would be sure to despise both him and his message. God usually warns 
 sinners before he strikes; and, where his warnings are slighted, the 
 blow will fall the heavier.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The actings of Noah's faith, and the influence it had both upon his 
 mind and practice. 

 (1.) Upon his mind; it impressed his soul with a fear of God's 
 judgment: he was <I>moved with fear.</I> Faith first influences our 
 affections, then our actions; and faith works upon those affections 
 that are suitable to the matter revealed. If it be some good thing, 
 faith stirs up love and desire; if some evil thing, faith stirs up 
 fear. 

 (2.) His faith influenced his practice. His fear, thus excited by 
 believing God's threatening, moved him to prepare an ark, in which, no 
 doubt, he met with the scorns and reproaches of a wicked generation.
 He did not dispute with God why he should make an ark, nor how it could 
 be capable of containing what was to be lodged in it, nor how such a 
 vessel could possibly weather out so great a storm. His faith silenced 
 all objections, and set him to work in earnest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The blessed fruits and rewards of Noah's faith. 

 (1.) Hereby himself and his house were saved, when a whole world of 
 sinners were perishing about them. God saved his family for his sake; 
 it was well for them that they were Noah's sons and daughters; it was 
 well for those women that they married into Noah's family; perhaps they 
 might have married to great estates in other families, but then they 
 would have been drowned. We often say, "It is good to be akin to an 
 estate;" but surely it is good to be akin to the covenant. 

 (2.) Hereby he judged and condemned the world; his holy fear condemned 
 their security and vain confidence; his faith condemned their unbelief; 
 his obedience condemned their contempt and rebellion. Good examples 
 will either convert sinners or condemn them. There is something very 
 convincing in a life of strict holiness and regard to God; it commends 
 itself to every man's conscience in the sight of God, and they are 
 judged by it. This is the best way the people of God can take to 
 condemn the wicked; not by harsh and censorious language, but by a holy 
 exemplary conversation. 

 (3.) Hereby <I>he became an heir of the righteousness which is by 
 faith.</I> 

 [1.] He was possessed of a true justifying righteousness; he was 
 <I>heir to it:</I> and,

 [2.] This his right of inheritance was through faith in Christ, as <I>a 
 member of Christ, a child of God,</I> and, if a child, then an heir. 
 His righteousness was relative, resulting from his adoption, through 
 faith in the promised seed. As ever we expect to be justified and saved 
 <I>in the great and terrible day of the Lord,</I> let us now prepare an 
 ark, secure an interest in Christ, and in the ark of the covenant, and 
 do it speedily, before the door be shut, for there is not salvation in 
 any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The faith of Abraham, the friend of God, and father of the 
 faithful, in whom the Hebrews boasted, and from whom they derived their 
 pedigree and privileges; and therefore the apostle, that he might both 
 please and profit them, enlarges more upon the heroic achievements of 
 Abraham's faith than of that of any other of the patriarchs; and in the 
 midst of his account of the faith of Abraham he inserts the story of 
 Sarah's faith, whose daughters those women are that continue to do 
 well. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The ground of Abraham's faith, the call and promise of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 (1.) This call, though it was a very trying call, was the call of God, 
 and therefore a sufficient ground for faith and rule of obedience. The 
 manner in which he was called Stephen relates in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2,3">Acts vii. 2, 3</A>,

 <I>The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in
 Mesopotamia--And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from 
 thy kindred, and come into the land which I will show thee.</I> This 
 was an effectual call, by which he was converted from the idolatry of 
 his father's house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:1">Gen. xii. 1</A>.

 This call was renewed after his father's death in Charran. Observe,

 [1.] The grace of God is absolutely free, in taking some of the worst
 of men, and making them the best.

 [2.] God must come to us before we come to him.

 [3.] In calling and converting sinners, God appears as a God of glory, 
 and works a glorious work in the soul.

 [4.] This calls us not only to leave sin, but sinful company, and 
 whatever is inconsistent with our devotedness to him.

 [5.] We need to be called, not only to set out well, but to go on well.

 [6.] He will not have his people take up that rest any where short of 
 the heavenly Canaan.

 (2.) The promise of God. God promised Abraham that the place he was 
 called to he should afterwards receive for an inheritance, after awhile 
 he should have the heavenly Canaan for his inheritance, and in process 
 of time his posterity should inherit the earthly Canaan. Observe here,
 
 [1.] God calls his people to an inheritance: by his effectual call he 
 makes them children, and so heirs. 

 [2.] This inheritance is not immediately possessed by them; they must 
 wait some time for it: but the promise is sure, and shall have its 
 seasonable accomplishment.

 [3.] The faith of parents often procures blessings for their 
 posterity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The exercise of Abraham's faith: he yielded an implicit regard to 
 the call of God. 

 (1.) <I>He went out, not knowing whither he went.</I> He put himself 
 into the hand of God, to send him whithersoever he pleased. He 
 subscribed to God's wisdom, as fittest to direct; and submitted to his 
 will, as fittest to determine every thing that concerned him. Implicit 
 faith and obedience are due to God, and to him only. All that are 
 effectually called resign up their own will and wisdom to the will and 
 wisdom of God, and it is their wisdom to do so; though they know not 
 always their way, yet they know their guide, and this satisfies them. 
 
 (2.) <I>He sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange 
 country.</I> This was an exercise of his faith. Observe, 

 [1.] How Canaan is called the land of promise, because yet only 
 promised, not possessed.

 [2.] How Abraham lived in Canaan, not as heir and proprietor, but as a 
 sojourner only. He did not serve an ejectment, or raise a war against 
 the old inhabitants, to dispossess them, but contented himself to live 
 as a stranger, to bear their unkindnesses patiently, to receive any 
 favours from them thankfully, and to keep his heart fixed upon his 
 home, the heavenly Canaan.

 [3.] He dwelt in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of 
 the same promise. He lived there in an ambulatory moving condition,
 living in a daily readiness for his removal: and thus should we all 
 live in this world. He had good company with him, and they were a
 great comfort to him in his sojourning state. Abraham lived till Isaac 
 was seventy-five years old, and Jacob fifteen. Isaac and Jacob were 
 heirs of the same promise; for the promise was renewed to Isaac

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:3">Gen. xxvi. 3</A>),
 
 and to Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:13">Gen. xxviii. 13</A>.

 All the saints are heirs of the same promise. The promise is made to 
 believers and their children, and to as many as the Lord our God shall 
 call. And it is pleasant to see parents and children sojourning 
 together in this world as heirs of the heavenly inheritance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The supports of Abraham's faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>He looked for a city that hath foundations, whose builder and maker 
 is God.</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) The description given of heaven: it is a city, a regular society, 
 well established, well defended, and well supplied: it is a city that 
 hath foundations, even the immutable purposes and almighty power of 
 God, the infinite merits and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
 promises of an everlasting covenant, its own purity, and the perfection 
 of its inhabitants: and it is a city whose builder and maker is God. He 
 contrived the model; he accordingly made it, and he has laid open a new 
 and living way into it, and prepared it for his people; he puts them 
 into possession of it, prefers them in it, and is himself the substance 
 and felicity of it. 

 (2.) Observe the due regard that Abraham had to this heavenly city: he 
 looked for it; he believed there was such a state; he waited for it, 
 and in the mean time he conversed in it by faith; he had exalted and 
 rejoicing hopes, that in God's time and way he should be brought safely 
 to it. 

 (3.) The influence this had upon his present conversation: it was a 
 support to him under all the trials of his sojourning state, helped him 
 patiently to bear all the inconveniences of it, and actively to 
 discharge all the duties of it, persevering therein unto the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. In the midst of the story of Abraham, the apostle inserts an account 
 of the faith of Sarah. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The difficulties of Sarah's faith, which were very great. As, 

 (1.) The prevalency of unbelief for a time: she laughed at the promise, 
 as impossible to be made good. 

 (2.) She had gone out of the way of her duty through unbelief, in 
 putting Abraham upon taking Hagar to his bed, that he might have a 
 posterity. Now this sin of hers would make it more difficult for her to 
 act by faith afterwards. 

 (3.) The great improbability of the thing promised, that she should be 
 the mother of a child, when she was of sterile constitution naturally, 
 and now past the prolific age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The actings of her faith. Her unbelief is pardoned and forgotten, 
 but her faith prevailed and is recorded: <I>She judged him faithful, 
 who had promised,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 She received the promise as the promise of God; and, being convinced of 
 that, she truly judged he both could and would perform it, how 
 impossible soever it might seem to reason; for the faithfulness of God 
 will not suffer him to deceive his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The fruits and rewards of her faith. 

 (1.) <I>She received strength to conceive seed.</I> The strength of 
 nature, as well as grace, is from God: he can make the barren soul 
 fruitful, as well as the barren womb.

 (2.) <I>She was delivered of a child,</I> a man-child, a child of the 
 promise, and comfort of his parents' advanced years, and the hope of 
 future ages. 

 (3.) From them, by this son, sprang a numerous progeny of illustrious 
 persons, <I>as the stars of the sky</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)--

 a great, powerful, and renowned nation, above all the rest in the
 world; and a nation of saints, the peculiar church and people of God; 
 and, which was the highest honour and reward of all, <I>of these, 
 according to the flesh, the Messiah came, who is over all, God blessed 
 for evermore.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostle proceeds to make mention of the faith of the other 
 patriarchs, Isaac and Jacob, and the rest of this happy family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The trial of their faith in the imperfection of their present state. 
 They had not received the promises, that is, they had not received the 
 things promised, they had not yet been put into possession of Canaan, 
 they had not yet seen their numerous issue, they had not seen Christ in 
 the flesh. Observe, 

 (1.) Many that are interested in the promises do not presently receive 
 the things promised. 

 (2.) One imperfection of the present state of the saints on earth is 
 that their happiness lies more in promise and reversion than in actual 
 enjoyment and possession. The gospel state is more perfect than the 
 patriarchal, because more of the promises are now fulfilled. The 
 heavenly state will be most perfect of all; for there all the promises 
 will have their full accomplishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The actings of their faith during this imperfect state of things. 
 Though they had not received the promises, yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They saw them afar off. Faith has a clear and a strong eye, and 
 can see promised mercies at a great distance. Abraham saw Christ's day, 
 when it was afar off, and rejoiced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">John viii. 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were persuaded of them, that they were true and should be 
 fulfilled. Faith sets to its seal that God is true, and thereby settles 
 and satisfies the soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They embraced them. Their faith was a faith of consent. Faith has 
 a long arm, and can lay hold of blessings at a great distance, can make 
 them present, can love them, and rejoice in them; and thus antedate the 
 enjoyment of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They <I>confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on 
 earth.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] Their condition: <I>Strangers and pilgrims.</I> They are strangers 
 as saints, whose home is heaven; they are pilgrims as they are 
 travelling towards their home, though often meanly and slowly.

 [2.] Their acknowledgment of this their condition: they were not 
 ashamed to own it; both their lips and their lives confessed their 
 present condition. They expected little from the world. They cared not
 to engage much in it. They endeavoured to lay aside every weight, to 
 gird up the loins of their minds to mind their way, to keep company and 
 pace with their fellow-travellers, looking for difficulties, and 
 bearing them, and longing to get home.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Hereby they declared plainly that they sought another country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 heaven, their own country. For their spiritual birth is thence, there 
 are their best relations, and there is their inheritance. This country 
 they seek: their designs are for it; their desires are after it; their 
 discourse is about it; they diligently endeavour to clear up their 
 title to it, to have their temper suited to it, to have their 
 conversation in it, and to come to the enjoyment of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) They gave full proof of their sincerity in making such a 
 confession. For, 

 [1.] They were not mindful of that country whence they came, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 They did not hanker after the plenty and pleasures of it, nor regret
 and repent that they had left it; they had no desire to return to it. 
 Note, Those that are once effectually and savingly called out of a 
 sinful state have no mind to return into it again; they now know better 
 things.

 [2.] They did not take the opportunity that offered itself for their 
 return. They might have had such an opportunity. They had time enough 
 to return. They had natural strength to return. They knew the way. 
 Those with whom they sojourned would have been willing enough to part 
 with them. Their old friends would have been glad to receive them. They 
 had sufficient to bear the charges of their journey; and flesh and 
 blood, a corrupt counsellor, would be sometimes suggesting to them a 
 return. But they stedfastly adhered to God and duty under all 
 discouragements and against all temptations to revolt from him. So 
 should we all do. We shall not want opportunities to revolt from God; 
 but we must show the truth of our faith and profession by a steady 
 adherence to him to the end of our days. Their sincerity appeared not 
 only in not returning to their former country, but in desiring a better 
 country, that is, a heavenly. Observe, <I>First,</I> The heavenly 
 country is better than any upon earth; it is better situated, better 
 stored with every thing that is good, better secured from every thing 
 that is evil; the employments, the enjoyments, the society, and every 
 thing in it, are better than the best in this world. <I>Secondly,</I>
 All true believers desire this better country. True faith draws forth 
 sincere and fervent desires; and the stronger faith is the more fervent 
 those desires will be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) They died in the faith of those promises; not only lived by the 
 faith of them, but died in the full persuasion that all the promises 
 would be fulfilled to them and theirs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 That faith held out to the last. By faith, when they were dying, they 
 received the atonement; they acquiesced in the will of God; they 
 quenched all the fiery darts of the devil; they overcame the terrors of 
 death, disarmed it of its sting, and bade a cheerful farewell to this 
 world and to all the comforts and crosses of it. These were the actings 
 of their faith. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The gracious and great reward of their faith: <I>God is not ashamed 
 to be their God, for he hath prepared for them a city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Note,
 
 (1.) God is the God of all true believers; faith gives them an interest 
 in God, and in all his fullness. 

 (2.) He is called their God. He calls himself so: <I>I am the God of 
 Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</I> he gives them 
 leave to call him so; and he gives them the spirit of adoption, to 
 enable them to cry, <I>Abba, Father.</I> 

 (3.) Notwithstanding their meanness by nature, their vileness by sin, 
 and the poverty of their outward condition, God is not ashamed to be 
 called <I>their God:</I> such is his condescension, such is his love to 
 them; therefore let them never be ashamed of being called his people, 
 nor of any of those that are truly so, how much soever despised in the 
 world. Above all, let them take care that they be not a shame and 
 reproach to their God, and so provoke him to be ashamed of them; but 
 let them act so as to be to him for a name, and for a praise, and for a 
 glory. 

 (4.) As the proof of this, God has prepared for them a city, a 
 happiness suitable to the relation into which he has taken them. For 
 there is nothing in this world commensurate to the love of God in being 
 the God of his people; and, if God neither could nor would give his 
 people anything better than this world affords, he would be ashamed to 
 be called their God. If he takes them into such a relation to himself, 
 he will provide for them accordingly.  If he takes to himself the title 
 of their God, he will fully answer it, and act up to it; and he has 
 prepared that for them in heaven which will fully answer this character 
 and relation, so that it shall never be said, to the reproach and 
 dishonour of God, that he has adopted a people to be his own children 
 and then taken no care to make a suitable provision for them. The 
 consideration of this should inflame the affections, enlarge the 
 desires, and excite the diligent endeavours, of the people of God after 
 this city that he has prepared for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Now after the apostle has given this account of the faith of 
 others, with Abraham, he returns to him again, and gives us an instance 
 of the greatest trial and act of faith that stands upon record, either 
 in the story of the father of the faithful or of any of his spiritual 
 seed; and this was his offering up Isaac: <I>By faith Abraham, when he 
 was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that had received the promises 
 offered up his only-begotten son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 In this great example observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The trial and exercise of Abraham's faith; he was tried indeed. It 
 is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1">Gen. xxii. 1</A>),

 <I>God in this tempted Abraham;</I> not to sin, for so God tempteth no 
 man, but only tried his faith and obedience to purpose. God had before 
 this tempted or tried the faith of Abraham, when he called him away 
 from his country and father's house,--when by a famine he was forced 
 out of Canaan into Egypt,--when he was obliged to fight with five kings 
 to rescue Lot,--when Sarah was taken from him by Abimelech, and in many 
 other instances. But this trial was greater than all; he was commanded 
 to offer up his son Isaac. Read the account of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:2">Gen. xxii. 2</A>.

 There you will find every word was a trial: "<I>Take now thy son, thine
 only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, 
 and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains 
 which I will tell thee of.</I> Take thy son, not one of thy beasts or 
 slaves, thy only son by Sarah, Isaac thy laughter, the child of thy joy 
 and delight, whom thou lovest as thine own soul; take him away to a 
 distant place, three days' journey, the land of Moriah; do not only 
 leave him there, but offer him for a burnt offering." A greater trial 
 was never put upon any creature. The apostle here mentions some things 
 that very much added to the greatness of this trial.

 (1.) He was put upon it after he had received the promises, that this 
 Isaac should build up his family, that in him his seed should be called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and that he should be one of the progenitors of the Messiah, and all 
 nations blessed in him; so that, in being called to offer up his Isaac, 
 he seemed to be called to destroy and cut off his own family, to cancel 
 the promises of God, to prevent the coming of Christ, to destroy the 
 whole world, to sacrifice his own soul and his hopes of salvation, and 
 to cut off the church of God at one blow: a most terrible trial! 

 (2.) That this Isaac was his only-begotten son by his wife Sarah, the 
 only one he was to have by her, and the only one that was to be the 
 child and heir of the promise. Ishmael was to be put off with earthly 
 greatness. The promise of a posterity, and of the Messiah, must either 
 be fulfilled by means of this son or not at all; so that, besides his 
 most tender affection to this his son, all his expectations were bound 
 up in him, and, if he perished, must perish with him. If Abraham had 
 ever so many sons, this was the only son who could convey to all 
 nations the promised blessing. A son for whom he waited so long, whom 
 he received in so extraordinary a manner, upon whom his heart was 
 set--to have this son offered up as a sacrifice, and that by his own 
 hand; it was a trial that would have overset the firmest and the 
 strongest mind that ever informed a human body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The actings of Abraham's faith in so great a trial: he obeyed; he 
 offered up Isaac; he intentionally gave him up by his submissive soul 
 to God, and was ready to have done it actually, according to the 
 command of God; he went as far in it as to the very critical moment, 
 and would have gone through with it if God had not prevented him. 
 Nothing could be more tender and moving than those words of Isaac: 
 <I>My father, here is the wood, here is the fire; but where is the lamb 
 for the burnt-offering?</I> little thinking that he was to be the lamb; 
 but Abraham knew it, and yet he went on with the great design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The supports of his faith. They must be very great, suitable to the
 greatness of the trial: <I>He accounted that God was able to raise him 
 from the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 His faith was supported by the sense he had of the mighty power of God, 
 who was able to raise the dead; he reasoned thus with himself, and so 
 he resolved all his doubts. It does not appear that he had any 
 expectation of being countermanded, and prevented from offering up his 
 son; such an expectation would have spoiled the trial, and consequently 
 the triumph, of his faith; but he knew that God was able to raise him 
 from the dead, and he believed that God would do so, since such great 
 things depended upon his son, which must have failed if Isaac had not a 
 further life. Observe,

 (1.) God is able to raise the dead, to raise dead bodies, and to raise 
 dead souls.

 (2.) The belief of this will carry us through the greatest difficulties 
 and trials that we can meet with. 

 (3.) It is our duty to be reasoning down our doubts and fears, by the 
 consideration of the almighty power of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The reward of his faith in this great trial
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 he received his son from the dead in a figure, in a parable. 

 (1.) He received his son. He had parted with him to God, and God gave
 him back again. The best way to enjoy our comforts with comfort is to 
 resign them up to God; he will then return them, if not in kind, yet in 
 kindness. 

 (2.) He received him from the dead, for he gave him up for dead; he was 
 as a dead child to him, and the return was to him no less than a 
 resurrection. 

 (3.) This was a figure or parable of something further. It was a
 figure of the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ, of whom Isaac was a 
 type. It was a figure and earnest of the glorious resurrection of all 
 true believers, whose life is not lost, but hid with Christ in God. We 
 come now to the faith of other Old-Testament saints, mentioned by name, 
 and by the particular trials and actings of their faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Of the faith of Isaac, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Something of him we had before interwoven with the story of Abraham; 
 here we have something of a distinct nature--that by faith he blessed 
 his two sons, Jacob and Esau, <I>concerning things to come.</I> Here 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The actings of his faith: He <I>blessed Jacob and Esau concerning 
 things to come.</I> He blessed them; that is, he resigned them up to 
 God in covenant; he recommended God and religion to them; he prayed for 
 them, and prophesied concerning them, what would be the condition, and 
 the condition of their descendants: we have the account of this in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:1-46">Gen. xxvii</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) Both Jacob and Esau were blessed as Isaac's children, at least as
 to temporal good things. It is a great privilege to be the offspring of 
 good parents, and often the wicked children of good parents fare the 
 better in this world for their parents' sake, for things present are in 
 the covenant; but they are not the best things, and no man knoweth love 
 or hatred by having or wanting such things.

 (2.) Jacob had the precedency and the principal blessing, which shows 
 that it is grace and the new birth that exalt persons above their 
 fellows and qualify them for the best blessings, and that it is owing 
 to the sovereign free grace of God that in the same family one is taken 
 and another left, one loved and the other hated, since all the race of 
 Adam are by nature hateful to God--that if one has his portion in this 
 world, and the other in the better world, it is God who makes the 
 difference; for even the comforts of this life are more and better than 
 any of the children of men deserve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The difficulties Isaac's faith struggled with. 

 (1.) He seemed to have forgotten how God had determined the matter at 
 the birth of these his sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:23">Gen. xxv. 23</A>.

 This should have been a rule to him all along, but he was rather swayed 
 by natural affection, and by general custom, which gives the double 
 portion of honour, affection, and advantage, to the first-born.

 (2.) He acted in this matter with some reluctance. When he came to
 pronounce the blessing, <I>he trembled very exceedingly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:33">Gen. xxvii. 33</A>);

 and he charged Jacob that he had subtly taken away Esau's blessing, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:33,35"><I>v.</I> 33, 35</A>.

 But, notwithstanding all this, Isaac's faith recovered itself, and he 
 ratified the blessing: <I>I have blessed him yea, and he shall be 
 blessed.</I> Rebecca and Jacob are not to be justified in the indirect 
 means they used to obtain this blessing, but God will be justified in 
 overruling even the sins of men to serve the purposes of his glory. 
 Now, the faith of Isaac thus prevailing over his unbelief, it has 
 pleased the God of Isaac to pass by the weakness of his faith, to 
 commend the sincerity of it, and record him among the elders, <I>who 
 through faith have obtained a good report.</I> We now go on to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. The faith of Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 who, <I>when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph, and 
 worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</I> There were a great 
 many instances of the faith of Jacob; his life was a life of faith, and 
 his faith met with great exercise. But it has pleased God to single two 
 instances out of many of the faith of this patriarch, besides what has 
 been already mentioned in the account of Abraham. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The actings of his faith here mentioned, and they are two:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He blessed both the sons of Joseph,</I> Ephraim and Manasseh; 
 he adopted them into the number of his own sons, and so into the 
 congregation of Israel, though they were born in Egypt. It is doubtless 
 a great blessing to be joined to the visible church of God in 
 profession and privilege, but more to be so in spirit and truth. 

 [1.] He made them both heads of different tribes, as if they had been 
 his own immediate sons.

 [2.] He prayed for them, that they might both be blessed of God.

 [3.] He prophesied that they should be blessed; but, as Isaac did 
 before, so now Jacob prefers the younger, Ephraim; and though Joseph 
 had placed them so, that the right hand of his father should be laid on 
 Manasseh, the elder, Jacob wittingly laid it on Ephraim, and this by 
 divine direction, for he could not see, to show that the Gentile 
 church, the younger, should have a more abundant blessing than the 
 Jewish church, the elder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>He worshipped, leaning on his staff;</I> that is, he praised 
 God for what he had done for him, and for the prospect he had of 
 approaching blessedness; and he prayed for those he was leaving behind 
 him, that religion might live in his family when he was gone. He did 
 this <I>leaning on the top of his staff;</I> not as the papists dream, 
 that he worshipped some image of God engraven on the head of his staff, 
 but intimating to us his great natural weakness, that he was not able 
 to support himself so far as to sit up in his bed without a staff, and 
 yet that he would not make this an excuse for neglecting the 
 worshipping of God; he would do it as well as he could with his body, 
 as well as with his spirit, though he could not do it as well as he 
 would. He showed thereby his dependence upon God, and testified his 
 condition here as a pilgrim with his staff, and his weariness of the 
 world, and willingness to be at rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The time and season when Jacob thus acted his faith: when he was 
 dying. He lived by faith, and he died by faith and in faith. Observe, 
 Though the grace of faith is of universal use throughout our whole 
 lives, yet it is especially so when we come to die. Faith has its 
 greatest work to do at last, to help believers to finish well, to die 
 to the Lord, so as to honour him, by patience, hope, and joy--so as to
 leave a witness behind them of the truth of God's word and the 
 excellency of his ways, for the conviction and establishment of all who 
 attend them in their dying moments. The best way in which parents can 
 finish their course is blessing their families and worshipping their 
 God. We have now come to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. The faith of Joseph, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 And here also we consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he did by his faith: <I>He made mention of the departing of the 
 children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</I> The 
 passage is out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:24,25">Gen. l. 24, 25</A>.

 Joseph was eminent for his faith, though he had not enjoyed the helps
 for it which the rest of his brethren had. He was sold into Egypt. He 
 was tried by temptations, by sin, by persecution, for retaining his 
 integrity. He was tried by preferment and power in the court of 
 Pharaoh, and yet his faith held out and carried him through to the 
 last.

 (1.) He made mention by faith of the departing of the children of 
 Israel, that the time should come when they should be delivered out of 
 Egypt; and he did this both that he might caution them against the 
 thoughts of settling in Egypt, which was now a place of plenty and ease 
 to them; and also that he might keep them from sinking under the 
 calamities and distresses which he foresaw were coming upon them there; 
 and he does it to comfort himself, that though he should not live to 
 see their deliverance, yet he could die in the faith of it. 

 (2.) He gave commandment concerning his bones, that they should 
 preserve them unburied in Egypt, till God should deliver them out of 
 that house of bondage, and that then they should carry his bones along 
 with them into Canaan and deposit them there. Though believers are 
 chiefly concerned for their souls, yet they cannot wholly neglect their 
 bodies, as being members of Christ and parts of themselves, which shall 
 at length be raised up, and be the happy companions of their glorified 
 souls to all eternity. Now Joseph gave this order, not that he thought 
 his being buried in Egypt would either prejudice his soul or prevent 
 the resurrection of his body (as some of the rabbis fancied that all 
 the Jews who were buried out of Canaan must be conveyed underground to 
 Canaan before they could rise again), but to testify, 

 [1.] That though he had lived and died in Egypt, yet he did not live 
 and die an Egyptian, but an Israelite.

 [2.] That he preferred a significant burial in Canaan before a 
 magnificent one in Egypt.

 [3.] That he would go as far with his people as he could, though he 
 could not go as far as he would.

 [4.] That he believed the resurrection of the body, and the communion 
 that his soul should presently have with departed saints, as his body 
 had with their dead bodies.

 [5.] To assure them that God would be with them in Egypt, and deliver 
 them out of it in his own time and way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When it was that the faith of Joseph acted after this manner; 
 namely, as in the case of Jacob, when he was dying. God often gives his 
 people living comforts in dying moments; and when he does it is their 
 duty, as they can, to communicate them to those about them, for the 
 glory of God, for the honour of religion, and for the good of their 
 brethren and friends. We go on now to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XI. The faith of the parents of Moses, which is cited from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:3">Exod. ii. 3</A>,

 &c. Here observe,

 1. The acting of their faith: they hid this their son three months.
 Though only the mother of Moses is mentioned in the history, yet, by 
 what is here said, it seems his father not only consented to it, but 
 consulted about it. It is a happy thing where yoke-fellows draw 
 together in the yoke of faith, as heirs of the grace of God; and when 
 they do this in a religious concern for the good of their children, to 
 preserve them not only from those who would destroy their lives, but 
 from those who would corrupt their minds. Observe, Moses was persecuted 
 betimes, and forced to be concealed; in this he was a type of Christ, 
 who was persecuted almost as soon as he was born, and his parents were 
 obliged to flee with him into Egypt for his preservation. It is a great 
 mercy to be free from wicked laws and edicts; but, when we are not, we 
 must use all lawful means for our security. In this faith of Moses's 
 parents there was a mixture of unbelief, but God was pleased to 
 overlook it. 

 2. The reasons of their thus acting. No doubt, natural affection could
 not but move them; but there was something further. They <I>saw he was
 a proper child, a goodly child</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:2">Exod. ii. 2</A>),
 
 <I>exceedingly fair,</I> as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:20">Acts vii. 20</A>,

 <B><I>asteios to Theo</I></B>--<I>venustus Deo</I>--<I>fair to God.</I>
 There appeared in him something uncommon; the beauty of the Lord sat 
 upon him, as a presage that he was born to great things, and that by 
 conversing with God his face should shine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:29">Exod. xxxiv. 29</A>),

 what bright and illustrious actions he should do for the deliverance of
 Israel, and how his name should shine in the sacred records. Sometimes, 
 not always, the countenance is the index of the mind. 

 3. The prevalency of their faith over their fear. They were not afraid
 of the king's commandment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:22">Exod. i. 22</A>.

 That was a wicked and a cruel edict, that all the males of the
 Israelites should be destroyed in their infancy, and so the name of 
 Israel must be destroyed out of the earth. But they did not so fear as 
 presently to give up their child; they considered that, if none of the 
 males were preserved, there would be an end and utter ruin of the 
 church of God and the true religion, and that though in their present 
 state of servitude and oppression one would praise the dead rather than 
 the living, yet they believed that God would preserve his people, and 
 that the time was coming when it would be worth while for an Israelite 
 to live. Some must hazard their own lives to preserve their children, 
 and they were resolved to do it; they knew the king's commandment was 
 evil in itself, contrary to the laws of God and nature, and therefore 
 of no authority nor obligation. Faith is a great preservative against 
 the sinful slavish fear of men, as it sets God before the soul, and 
 shows the vanity of the creature and its subordination to the will and 
 power of God. The apostle next proceeds to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XII. The faith of Moses himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>,

 &c.), here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. An instance of his faith in conquering the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</I> 
 whose foundling he was, and her fondling too; she had adopted him for 
 his son, and he refused it. Observe, 

 [1.] How great a temptation Moses was under. Pharaoh's daughter is said 
 to have been his only child, and was herself childless; and having 
 found Moses, and saved him as she did, she resolved to take him and 
 bring him up as her son; and so he stood fair to be in time king of 
 Egypt, and he might thereby have been serviceable to Israel. He owed 
 his life to this princess; and to refuse such kindness from her would 
 look not only like ingratitude to her, but a neglect of Providence, 
 that seemed to intend his advancement and his brethren's advantage.

 [2.] How glorious was the triumph of his faith in so great a trial. He 
 <I>refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter</I> lest he 
 should undervalue the truer honour of being a son of Abraham, the 
 father of the faithful; <I>he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's 
 daughter</I> lest it should look like renouncing his religion as well 
 as his relation to Israel; and no doubt both these he must have done if 
 he had accepted this honour; he therefore nobly refused it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He chose <I>rather to suffer affliction with the people of God 
 than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He was willing to take his lot with the people of God here, though it 
 was a suffering lot, that he might have his portion with them 
 hereafter, rather than to enjoy all the sensual sinful pleasures of 
 Pharaoh's court, which would be but for a season, and would then be 
 punished with everlasting misery. Herein he acted rationally as well as 
 religiously, and conquered the temptation to worldly pleasure as he had 
 done before to worldly preferment. Here observe,

 [1.] The pleasures of sin are and will be but short; they must end in 
 speedy repentance or in speedy ruin.

 [2.] The pleasures of this world, and especially those of a court, are 
 too often the pleasures of sin; and they are always so when we cannot 
 enjoy them without deserting God and his people. A true believer will 
 despise them when they are offered upon such terms.

 [3.] Suffering is to be chosen rather than sin, there being more evil 
 in the least sin than there can be in the greatest suffering.

 [4.] It greatly alleviates the evil of suffering when we suffer with 
 the people of God, embarked in the same interest and animated by the 
 same Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He accounted <I>the reproaches of Christ greater riches than the 
 treasures of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 See how Moses weighed matters: in one scale he put the worst of 
 religion--<I>the reproaches of Christ,</I> in the other scale the best 
 of the world--<I>the treasures of Egypt;</I> and in his judgment, 
 directed by faith, the worst of religion weighed down the best of the 
 world. The reproaches of the church of God are <I>the reproaches of 
 Christ,</I> who is, and has ever been, the head of the church. Now here 
 Moses conquered the riches of the world, as before he had conquered its 
 honours and pleasures. God's people are, and always have been, a 
 reproached people. Christ accounts himself reproached in their 
 reproaches; and, while he thus interests himself in their reproaches, 
 they become riches, and greater riches than the treasures of the 
 richest empire in the world; for Christ will reward them with a crown 
 of glory that fades not away. Faith discerns this, and determines and 
 acts accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The circumstance of time is taken notice of, when Moses by his faith 
 gained this victory over the world, in all its honours, pleasures, and 
 treasures: <I>When he had come to years</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 not only to years of discretion, but of experience, to the age of forty 
 years--when he was great, or had come to maturity. Some would take this 
 as detracting from his victory, that he gained it so late, that he did 
 not make this choice sooner; but it is rather an enhancement of the 
 honour of his self-denial and victory over the world that he made this 
 choice when he had grown ripe for judgment and enjoyment, able to know 
 what he did and why he did it. It was not the act of a child, that 
 prefers counters to gold, but it proceeded from mature deliberation. It 
 is an excellent thing for persons to be seriously religious when in the 
 midst of worldly business and enjoyments, to despise the world when 
 they are most capable of relishing and enjoying it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What it was that supported and strengthened the faith of Moses to 
 such a degree as to enable him to gain such a victory over the world: 
 <I>He had respect unto the recompense of reward,</I> that is, say some, 
 the deliverance out of Egypt; but doubtless it means much more--the
 glorious reward of faith and fidelity in the other world. Observe here, 
 
 (1.) Heaven is a great reward, surpassing not only all our deservings, 
 but all our conceptions. It is a reward suitable to the price paid for 
 it--the blood of Christ; suitable to the perfections of God, and fully
 answering to all his promises. It is a recompense of reward, because 
 given by a righteous Judge for the righteousness of Christ to righteous 
 persons, according to the righteous rule of the covenant of grace. 

 (2.) Believers may and ought to have respect to this recompense of 
 reward; they should acquaint themselves with it, approve of it, and 
 live in the daily and delightful expectation of it. Thus it will prove 
 a land-mark to direct their course, a load-stone to draw their hearts, 
 a sword to conquer their enemies, a spur to quicken them to duty, and a 
 cordial to refresh them under all the difficulties of doing and 
 suffering work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We have another instance of the faith of Moses, namely, in forsaking 
 Egypt: <I>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the 
 king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) The product of his faith: <I>He forsook Egypt,</I> and all its 
 power and pleasures, and undertook the conduct of Israel out of it. 
 Twice Moses forsook Egypt: 

 [1.] As a supposed criminal, when the king's wrath was incensed against 
 him for killing the Egyptian

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:14,15">Exod. ii. 14, 15</A>),

 where it is said he feared, not with a fear of despondency, but of
 discretion, to save his life. 

 [2.] As a commander and ruler in Jeshurun, after God had employed him 
 to humble Pharaoh and make him willing to let Israel go.

 (2.) The prevalency of his faith. It raised him above the fear of the 
 king's wrath. Though he knew that it was great, and levelled at him in 
 particular, and that it marched at the head of a numerous host to 
 pursue him, yet he was not dismayed, and he said to Israel, <I>Fear 
 not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:13">Exod. xiv. 13</A>.

 Those who forsook Egypt must expect the wrath of men; but they need not
 fear it, for they are under the conduct of that God who is able to make
 the wrath of man to praise him, and restrain the remainder of it. 

 (3.) The principle upon which his faith acted in these his motions:
 <I>He endured, as seeing him that was invisible.</I> He bore up with 
 invincible courage under all danger, and endured all the fatigue of his 
 employment, which was very great; and this by seeing the invisible God.
 Observe, 

 [1.] The God with whom we have to do is an invisible God: he is so to 
 our senses, to the eye of the body; and this shows the folly of those 
 who pretend to make images of God, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.

 [2.] By faith we may see this invisible God. We may be fully assured of 
 his existence, of his providence, and of his gracious and powerful 
 presence with us.

 [3.] Such a sight of God will enable believers to endure to the end 
 whatever they may meet with in the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. We have yet another instance of the faith of Moses, in keeping 
 <I>the passover and sprinkling of blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The account of this we have in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:13-23">Exod. xii. 13-23</A>.

 Though all Israel kept this passover, yet it was by Moses that God
 delivered the institution of it; and, though it was a great mystery, 
 Moses by faith both delivered it to the people and kept it that night 
 in the house where he lodged. The passover was one of the most solemn 
 institutions of the Old Testament, and a very significant type of 
 Christ. The occasion of its first observance was extraordinary: it was
 in the same night that God slew the first-born of the Egyptians; but, 
 though the Israelites lived among them, the destroying angel passed 
 over their houses, and spared them and theirs. Now, to entitle them to
 this distinguishing favour, and to mark them out for it, a lamb must be 
 slain; the blood of it must be sprinkled with a bunch of hyssop upon 
 the lintel of the door, and on the two side-posts; the flesh of the 
 lamb must be roasted with fire; and it must be all of it eaten that 
 very night with bitter herbs, in a travelling posture, their loins 
 girt, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hand. This 
 was accordingly done, and the destroying angel passed over them, and 
 slew the first-born of the Egyptians. This opened a way for the return 
 of Abraham's posterity into the land of promise. The accommodation of 
 this type is not difficult.

 (1.) Christ is that Lamb, he is our Passover, he was sacrificed for us.
 
 (2.) His blood must be sprinkled; it must be applied to those who have 
 the saving benefit of it. 

 (3.) It is applied effectually only to the Israelites, the chosen 
 people of God. 

 (4.) It is not owing to our inherent righteousness or best performances 
 that we are saved from the wrath of God, but to the blood of Christ and 
 his imputed righteousness. If any of the families of Israel had
 neglected the sprinkling of this blood upon their doors, though they 
 should have spent all the night in prayer, the destroying angel would 
 have broken in upon them, and slain their first-born. 

 (5.) Wherever this blood is applied, the soul receives a whole Christ 
 by faith, and lives upon him. 

 (6.) This true faith makes sin bitter to the soul, even while it 
 receives the pardon and atonement. 

 (7.) All our spiritual privileges on earth should quicken us to set out 
 early, and get forward, in our way to heaven.

 (8.) Those who have been marked out must ever remember and acknowledge 
 free and distinguishing grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XIII. The next instance of faith is that of the Israelites passing 
 through the Red Sea under the conduct of Moses their leader, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The story we have in Exodus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:1-31 "><I>ch.</I> xiv</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The preservation and safe passage of the Israelites through the Red 
 Sea, when there was no other way to escape from Pharaoh and his host, 
 who were closely pursuing them. Here we may observe, 

 (1.) Israel's danger was very great; an enraged enemy with chariots and 
 horsemen behind them; steep rocks and mountains on either hand, and the 
 Red Sea before them. 

 (2.) Their deliverance was very glorious. By faith they passed through 
 the Red Sea as on dry land; the grace of faith will help us through all 
 the dangers we meet with in our way to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The destruction of the Egyptians. They, presumptuously attempting to 
 follow Israel through the Red Sea, being thus blinded and hardened to 
 their ruin, were all drowned. Their rashness was great, and their ruin 
 was grievous. When God judges, he will overcome; and it is plain that 
 the destruction of sinners is of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XIV. The next instance of faith is that of the Israelites, under Joshua 
 their leader, before the walls of Jericho. The story we have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:5">Josh. vi. 5</A>,
 
 &c. Here observe,

 1. The means prescribed to God to bring down the walls of Jericho. It
 was ordered that they should compass the walls about once a day for 
 seven days together and seven times the last day, that the priests 
 should carry the ark when they compassed the walls about, and should 
 blow with trumpets made of rams' horns, and sound a longer blast than 
 before, and then all the people should shout, and the walls of Jericho 
 should fall before them. Here was a great trial of their faith. The 
 method prescribed seemed very improbable to answer such an end, and 
 would doubtless expose them to the daily contempt of their enemies; the 
 ark of God would seem to be in danger. But this was the way God 
 commanded them to take, and he loves to do great things by small and 
 contemptible means, that his own arm may be made bare. 

 2. The powerful success of the prescribed means. The walls of Jericho
 fell before them. This was a frontier town in the land of Canaan, the
 first that stood out against the Israelites. God was pleased in this 
 extraordinary manner to slight and dismantle it, in order to magnify 
 himself, to terrify the Canaanites, to strengthen the faith of the 
 Israelites, and to exclude all boasting. God can and will in his own 
 time and way cause all the powerful opposition that is made to his 
 interest and glory to fall down, and the grace of faith is mighty 
 through God for the pulling down of strong-holds; he will make Babylon 
 fall before the faith of his people, and, when he has some great thing 
 to do for them, he raises up great and strong faith in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XV. The next instance is the faith of Rahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Among the noble army of believing worthies, bravely marshalled by the 
 apostle, Rahab comes in the rear, to show <I>that God is no respecter 
 of persons.</I> Here consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who this Rahab was. 

 (1.) She was a Canaanite, a <I>stranger to the commonwealth of 
 Israel,</I> and had but little help for faith, and yet she was a 
 believer; the power of divine grace greatly appears when it works 
 without the usual means of grace. 

 (2.) She was a harlot, and lived in a way of sin; she was not only a 
 keeper of a public house, but a common woman of the town, and yet she 
 believed that the greatness of sin, if truly repented of, shall be no 
 bar to the pardoning mercy of God. Christ has saved the chief of
 sinners. <I>Where sin has abounded, grace has superabounded.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What she did by her faith: <I>She received the spies in peace,</I> 
 the men that Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:6,7">Josh. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 She not only bade them welcome, but she concealed them from their
 enemies who sought to cut them off, and she made a noble confession of 
 her faith,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 She engaged them to covenant with her to show favour to her and hers,
 when God should show kindness to them, and that they would give her a
 sign, which they did, a line of scarlet, which she was to hang forth 
 out of the window; she sent them away with prudent and friendly advice. 
 Learn here, 

 (1.) True faith will show itself in good works, especially towards the 
 people of God. 

 (2.) Faith will venture all hazards in the cause of God and his people; 
 a true believer will sooner expose his own person than God's interest 
 and people. 

 (3.) A true believer is desirous, not only to be in covenant with God, 
 but in communion with the people of God, and is willing to cast in his 
 lot with them, and to fare as they fare.</P>

 turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

 deserts, and <I>in</I> mountains, and <I>in</I> dens and caves of the

 received not the promise:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having given us a classis of many eminent believers, whose 
 names are mentioned and the particular trials and actings of their 
 faith recorded, now concludes his narrative with a more summary account 
 of another set of believers, where the particular acts are not ascribed 
 to particular persons by name, but left to be applied by those who are 
 well acquainted with the sacred story; and, like a divine orator, he 
 prefaces his part of the narrative with an elegant expostulation: 
 <I>What shall I say more? Time would fail me;</I> as if he had said, 
 "It is in vain to attempt to exhaust this subject; should I not 
 restrain my pen, it would soon run beyond the bounds of an epistle; and 
 therefore I shall but just mention a few more, and leave you to enlarge 
 upon them." Observe, 

 1. After all our researches into the scripture, there is still more to 
 be learned from them. 

 2. We must well consider in divine matters what we should say, and suit
 it as well as we can to the time. 

 3. We should be pleased to think how great the number of believers was 
 under the Old Testament, and how strong their faith, though the objects 
 thereof were not then so fully revealed. And, 

 4. We should lament it, that now, in gospel times, when the rule of 
 faith is more clear and perfect, the number of believers should be so 
 small and their faith so weak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In this summary account the apostle mentions,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Gideon, whose story we have in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:11">Judges vi. 11</A>,

 &c. He was an eminent instrument raised up of God to deliver his people
 from the oppression of the Midianites; he was a person of mean tribe 
 and family, called from a mean employment (threshing wheat), and 
 saluted by an angel of God in this surprising manner, <I>The Lord is 
 with thee, thou mighty man of war.</I> Gideon could not at first 
 receive such honours, but humbly expostulates with the angel about 
 their low and distressed state. The angel of the Lord delivers him his 
 commission, and assures him of success, confirming the assurance by 
 fire out of the rock. Gideon is directed to offer sacrifice, and,
 instructed in his duty, goes forth against the Midianites, when his 
 army is reduced from thirty-two thousand to three hundred; yet by 
 these, with their lamps and pitchers, God put the whole army of the 
 Midianites to confusion and ruin: and the same faith that gave Gideon 
 so much courage and honour enabled him to act with great meekness and 
 modesty towards his brethren afterwards. It is the excellency of the 
 grace of faith that, while it helps men to do great things, it keeps 
 them from having high and great thoughts of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Barak, another instrument raised up to deliver Israel out of the 
 hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, Judges 4, where we read, 

 (1.) Though he was a soldier, yet he received his commission and 
 instructions from Deborah, a <I>prophetess of the Lord;</I> and he 
 insisted upon having this divine oracle with him in his expedition. 
 
 (2.) He obtained a great victory by his faith over all the host of 
 Sisera. 

 (3.) His faith taught him to return all the praise and glory to God: 
 this is the nature of faith; it has recourse unto God in all dangers 
 and difficulties, and then makes grateful returns to God for all 
 mercies and deliverances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Samson, another instrument that God raised up to deliver Israel from
 the Philistines: his story we have in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1-16:31">Judges xiii., xiv., xv., and xvi.</A>,

 and from it we learn that the grace of faith is the strength of the
 soul for great service. If Samson had not had a strong faith as well as 
 a strong arm, he had never performed such exploits. Observe,

 (1.) By faith the servants of God shall overcome even the roaring lion.
 
 (2.) True faith is acknowledged and accepted, even when mingled with 
 many failings. 

 (3.) The believer's faith endures to the end, and, in dying, gives him 
 victory over death and all his deadly enemies; his greatest conquest he 
 gains by dying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Jephthah, whose story we have, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:1-40">Judg. xi.</A>,

 before that of Samson. He was raised up to deliver Israel from the 
 Ammonites. As various and new enemies rise up against the people of 
 God, various and new deliverers are raised up for them. In the story of 
 Jephthah observe,

 (1.) The grace of God often finds out, and fastens upon, the most
 undeserving and ill-deserving persons, to do great things for them and 
 by them. Jephthah was the son of a harlot.

 (2.) The grace of faith, wherever it is, will put men upon 
 acknowledging God in all their ways

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:11"><I>ch.</I> xi. 11</A>):

 <I>Jephthah rehearsed all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh.</I> 

 (3.) The grace of faith will make men bold and venturous in a good 
 cause.

 (4.) Faith will not only put men upon making their vows to God, but 
 paying their vows after the mercy received; yea, though they have vowed 
 to their own great grief, hurt, and loss, as in the case of Jephthah 
 and his daughter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. David, that great man after God's own heart. Few ever met with 
 greater trials, and few ever discovered a more lively faith. His first 
 appearance on the stage of the world was a great evidence of his faith. 
 Having, when young, slain <I>the lion and the bear,</I> his faith in 
 God encouraged him to encounter the great Goliath, and helped him to 
 triumph over him. The same faith enabled him to bear patiently the 
 ungrateful malice of Saul and his favourites, and to wait till God 
 should put him into possession of the promised power and dignity. The 
 same faith made him a very successful and victorious prince, and, after 
 a long life of virtue and honour (though not without some foul stains 
 of sin), he died in faith, relying upon the everlasting covenant that 
 God had made with him and his, ordered in all things and sure; and he 
 has left behind him such excellent memoirs of the trials and acts of 
 faith in the book of Psalms as will ever be of great esteem and use, 
 among the people of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Samuel, raised up to be a most eminent prophet of the Lord to 
 Israel, as well as a ruler over them. God revealed himself to Samuel 
 when he was but a child, and continued to do so till his death. In his 
 story observe, 

 (1.) Those are likely to grow up to some eminency in faith who begin 
 betimes in the exercise of it. 

 (2.) Those whose business it is to reveal the mind and will of God to 
 others had need to be well established in the belief of it 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. To Samuel he adds, <I>and of the prophets,</I> who were 
 extraordinary ministers of the Old-Testament church, employed of God 
 sometimes to denounce judgment, sometimes to promise mercy, always to 
 reprove sin; sometimes to foretell remarkable events, known only to 
 God; and chiefly to give notice of the Messiah, his coming, person, and 
 offices; for in him the prophets as well as the law center. Now a true 
 and strong faith was very requisite for the right discharge of such an 
 office as this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having done naming particular persons, he proceeds to tell us what 
 things were done by their faith. He mentions some things that easily 
 apply themselves to one or other of the persons named; but he mentions 
 other things that are not so easy to be accommodated to any here named, 
 but must be left to general conjecture or accommodation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>By faith they subdued kingdoms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Thus did David, Joshua, and many of the judges. Learn hence,

 (1.) The interests and powers of kings and kingdoms are often set up in 
 opposition to God and his people. 

 (2.) God can easily subdue all those kings and kingdoms that set 
 themselves to oppose him. 

 (3.) Faith is a suitable and excellent qualification of those who fight 
 in the ways of the Lord; it makes them just, bold, and wise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They <I>wrought righteousness,</I> both in their public and personal 
 capacities; they turned many from idolatry to the ways of 
 righteousness; they believed God, and it was imputed to them for 
 righteousness; they walked and acted righteously towards God and man. 
 It is a greater honour and happiness to work righteousness than to work 
 miracles; faith is an active principle of universal righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They <I>obtained promises,</I> both general and special. It is faith 
 that gives us an interest in the promises; it is by faith that we have 
 the comfort of the promises; and it is by faith that we are prepared to 
 wait for the promises, and in due time to receive them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They <I>stopped the mouths of lions;</I> so did Samson, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:5,6">Judg. xiv. 5, 6</A>,
 
 and David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:34,35">1 Sam. xvii. 34, 35</A>,

 and Daniel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:22">6:22</A>.

 Here learn,

 (1.) The power of God is above the power of the creature.

 (2.) Faith engages the power of God for his people, whenever it shall
 be for his glory, to overcome brute beasts and brutish men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They <I>quenched the violence of the fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 So Moses, by the prayer of faith, quenched the fire of God's wrath that 
 was kindled against the people of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1,2">Num. xi. 1, 2</A>.

 So did the three children, or rather mighty champions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:17-27">Dan. iii. 17-27</A>.

 Their faith in God, refusing to worship the golden image, exposed them
 to the fiery furnace which Nebuchadnezzar had prepared for them, and 
 their faith engaged for them that power and presence of God in the 
 furnace which quenched the violence of the fire, so that not so much as 
 the smell thereof passed on them. Never was the grace of faith more 
 severely tried, never more nobly exerted, nor ever more gloriously 
 rewarded, than theirs was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They <I>escaped the edge of the sword.</I> Thus David escaped the 
 sword of Goliath and of Saul; and Mordecai and the Jews escaped the 
 sword of Haman. The swords of men are held in the hand of God, and he 
 can blunt the edge of the sword, and turn it away from his people 
 against their enemies when he pleases. Faith takes hold of that hand of 
 God which has hold of the swords of men; and God has often suffered 
 himself to be prevailed upon by the faith of his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. <I>Out of weakness they were made strong.</I> From national 
 weakness, into which the Jews often fell by their unbelief; upon the 
 revival of their faith, all their interest and affairs revived and 
 flourished. From bodily weakness; thus Hezekiah, believing the word of 
 God, recovered out of a mortal distemper, and he ascribed his recovery 
 to the promise and power of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:15,16">Isa. xxxviii. 15, 16</A>),

 <I>What shall I say? He hath spoken it, and he hath also done it. Lord
 by these things men live, and in these is the life of my spirit.</I> 
 And it is the same grace of faith that from spiritual weakness helps 
 men to recover and renew their strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. They <I>grew valiant in fight.</I> So did Joshua, the judges, and 
 David. True faith gives truest courage and patience, as it discerns the 
 strength of God, and thereby the weakness of all his enemies. And they 
 were not only valiant, but successful. God, as a reward and
 encouragement of their faith, <I>put to flight the armies of the 
 aliens,</I> of those who were aliens to their commonwealth, and enemies 
 to their religion; God made them flee and fall before his faithful 
 servants. Believing and praying commanders, at the head of believing 
 and praying armies, have been so owned and honoured of God that nothing 
 could stand before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. <I>Women received their dead raised to life again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 So did the widow of Zarepath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:23">1 Kings xvii. 23</A>),
 
 and the Shunamite,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:36">2 Kings iv. 36</A>.
 
 (1.) <I>In Christ there is neither male nor female;</I> many of the
 weaker sex have been strong in faith. 

 (2.) Though the covenant of grace takes in the children of believers, 
 yet it leaves them subject to natural death. 

 (3.) Poor mothers are loth to resign up their interest in their 
 children, though death has taken them away. 

 (4.) God has sometimes yielded so far to the tender affections of 
 sorrowful women as to restore their dead children to life again. Thus 
 Christ had compassion on the widow of Nain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:12">Luke vii. 12</A>,

 &c.

 (5.) This should confirm our faith in the general resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle tells us what these believers endured by faith. 

 1. They <I>were tortured, not accepting deliverance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 They were put upon the rack, to make them renounce their God, their 
 Saviour, and their religion. They bore the torture, and would not 
 accept of deliverance upon such vile terms; and that which animated 
 them thus to suffer was the hope they had of <I>obtaining a better 
 resurrection,</I> and deliverance upon more honourable terms. This is 
 thought to refer to that memorable story,

 <U>2 Macc. <I>ch.</I> vii.</U>, &c.

 2. They endured <I>trials of cruel mockings and scourgings, and bonds
 and imprisonment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 They were persecuted in their reputation by <I>mockings,</I> which are 
 cruel to an ingenuous mind; in their persons by <I>scourging,</I> the 
 punishment of slaves; in their liberty by <I>bonds and 
 imprisonment.</I> Observe how inveterate is the malice that wicked men 
 have towards the righteous, how far it will go, and what a variety of 
 cruelties it will invent and exercise upon those against whom they have 
 no cause of quarrel, except in the matters of their God. 

 3. They were put to death in the most cruel manner; some <I>were 
 stoned,</I> as Zechariah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:21">2 Chron. xxiv. 21</A>),

 <I>sawn asunder,</I> as Isaiah by Manasseh. <I>They were tempted;</I>
 some read it, <I>burnt,</I> 
 
 <U>2 Macc. vii. 5</U>.

 <I>They were slain with the sword.</I> All sorts of deaths were
 prepared for them; their enemies clothed death in all the array of 
 cruelty and terror, and yet they boldly met it and endured it. 

 4. Those who escaped death were used so ill that death might seem more
 eligible than such a life. Their enemies spared them, only to prolong 
 their misery, and wear out all their patience; for they were forced to 
 <I>wander about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, 
 afflicted,</I> and <I>tormented; they wandered about in deserts, and on 
 mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 They were stripped of the conveniences of life, and turned out of house 
 and harbour. They had not raiment to put on, but were forced to cover 
 themselves with the skins of slain beasts. They were driven out of all
 human society, and forced to converse with the beasts of the field, to 
 hide themselves in dens and caves, and make their complaint to rocks 
 and rivers, not more obdurate than their enemies. Such sufferings as 
 these they endured then for their faith; and such they endured through 
 the power of the grace of faith: and which shall we most admire, the 
 wickedness of human nature, that is capable of perpetrating such 
 cruelties on fellow creatures, or the excellency of divine grace, that 
 is able to bear up the faithful under such cruelties, and to carry them 
 safely through all?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What they obtained by their faith. 

 1. A most honourable character and commendation from God, the true
 Judge and fountain of honour--that <I>the world was not worthy</I> of
 such men; the world did not deserve such blessings; they did not know
 how to value them, nor how to use them. Wicked men! The righteous are
 not worthy to live in the world, and God declares the world is not
 worthy of them; and, though they widely differ in their judgment, they
 agree in this, that it is not fit that good men should have their rest
 in this world; and therefore God receives them out of it, to that world
 that is suitable to them, and yet far beyond the merit of all their
 services and sufferings. 
 
 2. They <I>obtained a good report</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>)

 of all good men, and of the truth itself, and have the honour to be 
 enrolled in this sacred calendar of the Old-Testament worthies, God's 
 witnesses; yea, they had a witness for them in the consciences of their 
 enemies, who, while they thus abused them, were condemned by their own 
 consciences, as persecuting those who were more righteous than 
 themselves. 

 3. They obtained an interest in the promises, though not the full 
 possession of them. They had a title to the promises, though they 
 received not the great things promised. This is not meant of the 
 felicity of the heavenly state, for this they did receive, when they 
 died, in the measure of a part, in one constituent part of their 
 persons, and the much better part; but it is meant of the felicity of 
 the gospel-state: they had types, but not the antitype; they had 
 shadows, but had not seen the substance; and yet, under this imperfect 
 dispensation, they discovered this precious faith. This the apostle
 insists upon to render the faith more illustrious, and to provoke 
 Christians to a holy jealousy and emulation; that they should not 
 suffer themselves to be outdone in the exercise of faith by those who 
 came so short of them in all the helps and advantages for believing. He 
 tells the Hebrews that God had <I>provided some better things for</I> 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 and therefore they might be assured that he expected at least as good 
 things from them; and that since the gospel is the end and perfection 
 of the Old Testament, which had no excellency but in its reference to 
 Christ and the gospel, it was expected that their faith should be as 
 much more perfect than the faith of the Old-Testament saints; for their 
 state and dispensation were more perfect than the former, and were 
 indeed the perfection and completion of the former, for without the 
 gospel-church the Jewish church must have remained in an incomplete and 
 imperfect state. This reasoning is strong, and should be effectually 
 prevalent with us all.</P>
