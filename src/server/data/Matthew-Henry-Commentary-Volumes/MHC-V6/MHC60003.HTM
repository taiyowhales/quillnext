 Wherein the apostle describes the duties of husbands and wives one to
 another, beginning with the duty of the wife, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 He exhorts Christians to unity, love, compassion, peace, and patience
 under sufferings; to oppose the slanders of their enemies, not by
 returning evil for evil, or railing for railing, but by blessing; by a
 ready account of their faith and hope, and by keeping a good conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>.

 To encourage them to this, he proposes the example of Christ, who
 suffered, the just for the unjust, but yet punished the old world for 
 their disobedience, and saved the few who were faithful in the days of 
 Noah,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Likewise, ye wives, <I>be</I> in subjection to your own husbands;
 that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be
 won by the conversation of the wives;
 &nbsp; 2  While they behold your chaste conversation <I>coupled</I> with
 fear.
 &nbsp; 3  Whose adorning let it not be that outward <I>adorning</I> of
 plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of
 apparel;
 &nbsp; 4  But <I>let it be</I> the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
 not corruptible, <I>even the ornament</I> of a meek and quiet spirit,
 which is in the sight of God of great price.
 &nbsp; 5  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also,
 who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
 their own husbands:
 &nbsp; 6  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose
 daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with
 any amazement.
 &nbsp; 7  Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with <I>them</I> according to
 knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker
 vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that
 your prayers be not hindered.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having treated of the duties of subjects to their 
 sovereigns, and of servants to their masters, proceeds to explain the 
 duty of husbands and wives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Lest the Christian matrons should imagine that their conversion to 
 Christ, and their interest in all Christian privileges, exempted them 
 from subjection to their pagan or Jewish husbands, the apostle here 
 tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In what the duty of wives consists.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In <I>subjection,</I> or an affectionate submission to the will, 
 and obedience to the just authority, of <I>their own husbands,</I> 
 which obliging conduct would be the most likely way to win those 
 disobedient and unbelieving husbands who had rejected the word, or who 
 attended to no other evidence of the truth of it than what they saw in 
 the prudent, peaceable, and exemplary <I>conversation of their 
 wives.</I> Learn, 

 [1.] Every distinct relation has its particular duties, which ministers 
 ought to preach, and the people ought to understand.

 [2.] A cheerful <I>subjection,</I> and a loving, reverential respect, 
 are duties which Christian women owe their husbands, whether they be 
 good or bad; these were due from Eve to Adam before the fall, and are 
 still required, though much more difficult now than they were before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16,1Ti+2:11">Gen. iii. 16; 1 Tim. ii. 11</A>.

 [3.] Though the design of the word of the gospel is to win and gain
 souls to Christ Jesus, yet there are many so obstinate that they will 
 not be <I>won by the word.</I>

 [4.] There is nothing more powerful, next to the word of God, to win 
 people, than a good conversation, and the careful discharge of relative 
 duties.

 [5.] Irreligion and infidelity do not dissolve the bonds, nor dispense 
 with the duties, of civil relations; <I>the wife</I> must discharge her 
 duty <I>to her own husband,</I> though he <I>obey not the word.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In <I>fear,</I> or reverence to their husbands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:33">Eph. v. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) In a <I>chaste conversation,</I> which their unbelieving husbands 
 would accurately observe and attend to. 

 [1.] Evil men are strict observers of the conversation of the 
 professors of religion; their curiosity, envy, and jealousy, make them 
 watch narrowly the ways and lives of good people.

 [2.] <I>A chaste conversation,</I> attended with due and proper respect 
 to every one, is an excellent means to win them to the faith of the 
 gospel and obedience to the word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) In preferring the ornaments of the mind to those of the body. 

 [1.] He lays down a rule in regard to the dress of religious women,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Here are three sorts of ornaments forbidden: <I>plaiting of hair,</I>
 which was commonly used in those times by lewd women; <I>wearing of 
 gold,</I> or ornaments made of <I>gold,</I> was practised by Rebecca, 
 and Esther, and other religious women, but afterwards became the attire 
 chiefly of harlots and wicked people; <I>putting on of apparel,</I> 
 which is not absolutely forbidden, but only too much nicety and 
 costliness in it. Learn, <I>First,</I> Religious people should take 
 care that all their external behaviour be answerable to their 
 profession of Christianity: <I>They must be holy in all manner of 
 conversation. Secondly,</I> The outward adorning of the body is very
 often sensual and excessive; for instance, when it is immoderate, and 
 above your degree and station in the world, when you are proud of it 
 and puffed up with it, when you dress with design to allure and tempt 
 others, when your apparel is too rich, curious, or superfluous, when 
 your fashions are fantastical, imitating the levity and vanity of the 
 worst people, and when they are immodest and wanton. The attire of a 
 harlot can never become a chaste Christian matron.

 [2.] Instead of the outward adorning of the body, he directs Christian 
 wives to put on much more excellent and beautiful ornaments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Here note, <I>First,</I> The part to be adorned: <I>The hidden man of 
 the heart;</I> that is, the soul; the hidden, the inner man. Take care 
 to adorn and beautify your souls rather than your bodies. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The ornament prescribed. It must, in general, be 
 something <I>not corruptible,</I> that beautifies the soul, that is, 
 the graces and virtues of God's Holy Spirit. The ornaments of the body 
 are destroyed by the moth, and perish in the using; but the grace of 
 God, the longer we wear it, the brighter and better it is. More 
 especially, the finest ornament of Christian women is <I>a meek and 
 quiet spirit,</I> a tractable easy temper of mind, void of passion, 
 pride, and immoderate anger, discovering itself in a quiet obliging 
 behaviour towards their husbands and families. If the husband be harsh, 
 and averse to religion (which was the case of these good wives to whom 
 the apostle gives this direction), there is no way so likely to win him 
 as a prudent meek behaviour. At least, a quiet spirit will make a good 
 woman easy to herself, which, being visible to others, becomes an 
 amiable ornament to a person in the eyes of the world. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 The excellency of it. Meekness and calmness of spirit are, in the sight 
 of God, of great price--amiable in the sight of men, and precious in 
 the sight of God. Learn,

 1. A true Christian's chief care lies in the right ordering and
 commanding of his own spirit. Where the hypocrite's work ends, there
 the true Christian's work begins. 

 2. The endowments of the inner man are the chief ornaments of a
 Christian; but especially a composed, calm, and quiet spirit, renders 
 either man or woman beautiful and lovely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duties of Christian wives being in their nature difficult, the 
 apostle enforces them by the example, 

 (1.) Of the holy women of old, who trusted in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 "You can pretend nothing of excuse from the weakness of your sex, but 
 what they might. They lived <I>in old time,</I> and had less knowledge
 to inform them and fewer examples to encourage them; yet in all ages 
 they practised this duty; they were <I>holy women,</I> and therefore 
 their example is obligatory; they <I>trusted in God,</I> and yet did 
 not neglect their duty to man: the duties imposed upon you, of a quiet 
 spirit and of subjection to your own husbands, are not new, but what 
 have ever been practised by the greatest and best women in the world."

 (2.) Of Sara, who obeyed her husband, and followed him when he went 
 from Ur of the Chaldeans, <I>not knowing whither he went,</I> and 
 <I>called him lord,</I> thereby showing him reverence and acknowledging 
 his superiority over her; and all this though she was declared a 
 princess by God from heaven, by the change of her name, "<I>Whose 
 daughters you are</I> if you imitate her in faith and good works, and 
 do not, through fear of your husbands, either quit the truth you 
 profess or neglect your duty to them, but readily perform it, without 
 either fear or force, out of conscience towards God and sense of duty 
 to them." Learn, 

 [1.] God takes exact notice, and keeps an exact record, of the actions 
 of all men and women in the world.

 [2.] The subjection of wives to their husbands is a duty which has been 
 practised universally by holy women in all ages.

 [3.] The greatest honour of any man or woman lies in a humble and 
 faithful deportment of themselves in the relation or condition in which 
 Providence has placed them.

 [4.] God takes notice of the good that is in his servants, to their 
 honour and benefit, but covers a multitude of failings; Sara's 
 infidelity and derision are overlooked, when her virtues are 
 celebrated.

 [5.] Christians ought to do their duty to one another, not out of fear, 
 nor from force, but from a willing mind, and in obedience to the 
 command of God. Wives should be in subjection to their churlish 
 husbands, not from dread and amazement, but from a desire to do well 
 and to please God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The husband's duty to the wife comes next to be considered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particulars are, 

 (1.) <I>Cohabitation,</I> which forbids unnecessary separation, and 
 implies a mutual communication of goods and persons one to another, 
 with delight and concord. 

 (2.) <I>Dwelling with the wife according to knowledge;</I> not 
 according to lust, as brutes; nor according to passion, as devils; but 
 according to knowledge, as wise and sober men, who know the word of God 
 and their own duty. 

 (3.) <I>Giving honour to the wife</I>--giving due respect to her, and 
 maintaining her authority, protecting her person, supporting her 
 credit, delighting in her conversation, affording her a handsome 
 maintenance, and placing a due trust and confidence in her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reasons are, Because she is <I>the weaker vessel</I> by nature 
 and constitution, and so ought to be defended: but then the wife is, in 
 other and higher respects, equal to her husband; they are <I>heirs 
 together of the grace of life,</I> of all the blessings of this life 
 and another, and therefore should live peaceably and quietly one with 
 another, and, if they do not, their prayers one with another and one 
 for another will be hindered, so that often "you will not pray at all, 
 or, if you do, you will pray with a discomposed ruffled mind, and so 
 without success." Learn, 

 (1.) The weakness of the female sex is no just reason either for 
 separation or contempt, but on the contrary it is a reason for honour 
 and respect: <I>Giving honour to the wife as unto the weaker 
 vessel.</I> 

 (2.) There is an honour due to all who are heirs of the grace of life. 
 
 (3.) All married people should take care to behave themselves so 
 lovingly and peaceably one to another that they may not by their broils 
 hinder the success of their prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Finally, <I>be ye</I> all of one mind, having compassion one of
 another, love as brethren, <I>be</I> pitiful, <I>be</I> courteous:
 &nbsp; 9  Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
 contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that
 ye should inherit a blessing.
 &nbsp; 10  For he that will love life, and see good days, let him
 refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no
 guile:
 &nbsp; 11  Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
 ensue it.
 &nbsp; 12  For the eyes of the Lord <I>are</I> over the righteous, and his
 ears <I>are open</I> unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord <I>is</I>
 against them that do evil.
 &nbsp; 13  And who <I>is</I> he that will harm you, if ye be followers of
 that which is good?
 &nbsp; 14  But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy <I>are
 ye:</I> and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
 &nbsp; 15  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and <I>be</I> ready
 always to <I>give</I> an answer to every man that asketh you a reason
 of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here passes from special to more general exhortations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He teaches us how Christians and friends should treat one another. 
 He advises Christians to <I>be all of one mind,</I> to be unanimous in 
 the belief of the same faith, and the practice of the same duties of 
 religion; and, whereas the Christians at that time were many of them in 
 a suffering condition, he charges them to <I>have compassion one of 
 another,</I> to <I>love as brethren,</I> to <I>pity</I> those who were 
 in distress, and to <I>be courteous</I> to all. Hence learn, 

 1. Christians should endeavour to be all of one mind in the great
 points of faith, in real affection, and in Christian practice; they 
 should be <I>like-minded one to another, according to Christ Jesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:5">Rom. xv. 5</A>),

 not according to man's pleasure, but God's word. 

 2. Though Christians cannot be exactly of the same mind, yet they
 should have compassion one for another, and love as brethren; they 
 ought not to persecute or hate one another, but love one another with 
 more than common affection; they should love as brethren. 

 3. Christianity requires pity to the distressed, and civility to all.
 He must be a flagrant sinner, or a vile apostate, who is not a proper 
 object of civil courtesy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:11,2Jo+1:10,11">1 Cor. v. 11; 2 John 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He instructs us how to behave towards enemies. The apostle knew 
 that Christians would <I>be hated</I> and evil-entreated <I>of all men 
 for Christ's sake;</I> therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He warns them not to return <I>evil for evil, nor railing for 
 railing;</I> but, on the contrary, "when they rail at you, do you bless 
 them; when they give you evil words, do you give them good ones; for 
 Christ has both by his word and example called you to bless those that 
 curse you, and has settled a blessing on you as your everlasting 
 inheritance, though you were unworthy." To bear evils patiently, and to 
 bless your enemies, is the way to obtain this blessing of God. Learn, 
 
 (1.) To <I>render evil for evil, or railing for railing,</I> is a 
 sinful unchristian practice; the magistrate may punish 
 <I>evil-doers,</I> and private men may seek a legal remedy when they 
 are wronged; but private revenge by duelling, scolding, or secret 
 mischief, is forbidden 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:22,Lu+6:27,Ro+12:17,1Th+5:15">Prov. xx. 22;
 Luke vi. 27; Rom. xii. 17; 1 Thess. v. 15</A>.

 To rail is to revile another in bitter, fierce, and reproachful terms; 
 but for ministers to rebuke sharply, and to preach earnestly against 
 the sins of the times, is not railing; all the prophets and apostles 
 practised it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:10,Zep+3:3,Ac+20:29">Isa. lvi. 10;
 Zeph. iii. 3; Acts xx. 29</A>.

 (2.) The laws of Christ oblige us to return blessing for railing. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44">Matt. v. 44</A>,

 "<I>Love your enemies, bless those that curse you, do good to those 
 that hate you, and pray for those that persecute you.</I> You must not 
 justify them in their sin, but you must do for your enemies all that 
 justice requires or charity commands." We must pity, pray for, and love 
 those who rail at us. 

 (3.) A Christian's calling, as it invests him with glorious privileges, 
 so it obliges him to difficult duties. 

 (4.) All the true servants of God shall infallibly inherit a blessing; 
 they have it already in a great degree, but the full possession of it 
 is reserved to another state and world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives an excellent prescription for a comfortable happy life in 
 this quarrelsome ill-natured world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 it is quoted from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:12-14">Ps. xxxiv. 12-14</A>.

 "If you earnestly desire that your life should be long, and your days
 peaceable and prosperous, keep your tongue from reviling, 
 evil-speaking, and slandering, and your lips from lying, deceit, and 
 dissimulation. Avoid doing any real damage or hurt to your neighbour, 
 but be ever ready to do good, and to overcome evil with good; seek 
 peace with all men, and pursue it, though it retire from you. This will 
 be the best way to dispose people to speak well of you, and live 
 peaceably with you." Learn, 

 (1.) Good people under the Old and new Testament were obliged to the 
 same moral duties; to <I>refrain the tongue from evil, and the lips 
 from guile,</I> was a duty in David's time as well as now. 

 (2.) It is lawful to consider temporal advantages as motives and 
 encouragements to religion. 

 (3.) The practice of religion, particularly the right government of the 
 tongue, is the best way to make this life comfortable and prosperous; a 
 sincere, inoffensive, discreet tongue, is a singular means to pass us 
 peaceably and comfortably through the world. 

 (4.) The avoiding of evil, and doing of good, is the way to contentment 
 and happiness both here and hereafter. 

 (5.) It is the duty of Christians not only to embrace peace when it is 
 offered, but to seek and pursue it when it is denied: peace with 
 societies, as well as peace with particular persons, in opposition to 
 division and contention, is what is here intended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He shows that Christians need not fear that such patient inoffensive 
 behaviour as is prescribed will invite and encourage the cruelty of 
 their enemies, for God will thereby be engaged on their side: <I>For 
 the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 he takes special notice of them, exercises a providential constant 
 government over them, and bears a special respect and affection to 
 them. <I>His ears are open to their prayers;</I> so that if any 
 injuries be offered to them they have this remedy, they may complain of 
 it to their heavenly Father, whose ears are always attentive to the 
 prayers of his servants in their distresses, and who will certainly aid 
 them against their unrighteous enemies. <I>But the face of the Lord is 
 against those that do evil;</I> his anger, and displeasure, and 
 revenge, will pursue them; for he is more an enemy to wicked 
 persecutors than men are. Observe,

 (1.) We must not in all cases adhere to the express words of scripture, 
 but study the sense and meaning of them, otherwise we shall be led into 
 blasphemous errors and absurdities: we must not imagine that God hath 
 eyes, and ears, and face, though these are the express words of the 
 scripture. 

 (2.) God hath a special care and paternal affection towards all his 
 righteous people. 

 (3.) God doth always hear the prayers of the faithful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:31,1Jo+5:14,Heb+4:16">John iv. 31;
 1 John v. 14; Heb. iv. 16</A>.

 (4.) Though God is infinitely good, yet he abhors impenitent sinners, 
 and will pour out his wrath upon those that do evil. He will do himself 
 right, and do all the world justice; and his goodness is no obstruction 
 to his doing so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. This patient humble behaviour of Christians is further recommended 
 and urged from two considerations:--

 (1.) This will be the best and surest way to prevent suffering; for
 <I>who is he that will harm you?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This, I suppose, is spoken of Christians in an ordinary condition, not 
 in the heat of persecution. "Ordinarily, there will be but few so
 diabolical and impious as to harm those who live so innocently and 
 usefully as you do."

 (2.) This is the way to improve sufferings. "<I>If you be followers of 
 that which is good,</I> and yet <I>suffer,</I> this is suffering for 
 righteousness; sake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and will be your glory and your happiness, as it entitles you to the 
 blessing promised by Christ" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10">Matt. v. 10</A>);
 
 therefore, 

 [1.] "You need not be afraid of any thing they can do to strike you 
 with terror, neither be much troubled nor concerned about the rage or 
 force of your enemies." Learn, <I>First,</I> to follow always that 
 which is good is the best course we can take to keep out of harm's way.
 <I>Secondly,</I> To suffer for righteousness sake is the honour and 
 happiness of a Christian; to suffer for the cause of truth, a good 
 conscience, or any part of a Christian's duty, is a great honour; the 
 delight of it is greater than the torment, the honour more than the 
 disgrace, and the gain much greater than the loss. <I>Thirdly,</I>
 Christians have no reason to be afraid of the threats or rage of any of 
 their enemies. "Your enemies are God's enemies, <I>his face is against 
 them,</I> his power is above them, they are the objects of his curse, 
 and can do nothing to you but by his permission; therefore trouble not 
 yourselves about them." 

 [2.] Instead of terrifying yourselves with the fear of men, be sure to 
 <I>sanctify the Lord God in your hearts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>let him be your fear, and let him be your dread,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12,13">Isa. viii. 12, 13</A>.

 <I>Fear not those that can only kill the body, but fear him that can
 destroy body and soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4,5">Luke xii. 4, 5</A>.

 We sanctify the Lord God in our hearts when we with sincerity and 
 fervency adore him, when our thoughts of him are awful and reverend, 
 when we rely upon his power, trust to his faithfulness, submit to his 
 wisdom, imitate his holiness, and give him the glory due to his most 
 illustrious perfections. We sanctify God before others when our 
 deportment is such as invites and encourages others to glorify and 
 honour him; both are required, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.

 "When this principle is laid deeply into your hearts, the next thing, 
 as to men, is to be always ready, that is, able and willing, <I>to give 
 an answer,</I> or make an apology or defence, of the faith you profess, 
 and that <I>to every man that asketh a reason of your hope,</I> what 
 sort of hope you have, or which you suffer such hardships in the 
 world." Learn, <I>First,</I> An awful sense of the divine perfections 
 is the best antidote against the fear of sufferings; did we fear God 
 more, we should certainly fear men less. <I>Secondly,</I> The hope and
 faith of a Christian are defensible against all the world. There may be 
 a good reason given for religion; it is not a fancy but a rational 
 scheme revealed from heaven, suited to all the necessities of miserable 
 sinners, and centering entirely in the glory of God through Jesus 
 Christ. <I>Thirdly,</I> Every Christian is bound to answer and 
 apologize for the hope that is in him. Christians should have a reason 
 ready for their Christianity, that it may appear they are not actuated 
 either by folly or fancy. This defence may be necessary more than once 
 or twice, so that Christians should be always prepared to make it, 
 either to the magistrate, if he demand it, or to any inquisitive 
 Christian, who desires to know it for his information or improvement. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> These confessions of our faith ought to be made 
 <I>with meekness and fear;</I> apologies for our religion ought to be 
 made with modesty and meekness, in the fear of God, with jealousy over 
 ourselves, and reverence to our superiors.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
 you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
 your good conversation in Christ.
 &nbsp; 17  For <I>it is</I> better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer
 for well doing, than for evil doing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The confession of a Christian's faith cannot credibly be supported but 
 by the two means here specified--<I>a good conscience</I> and a <I>good
 conversation.</I> conscience is good when it does its office well, when 
 it is kept pure and uncorrupt, and clear from guilt; then it will 
 justify you, though men accuse you. <I>A good conversation in 
 Christ</I> is a holy life, according to the doctrine and example of 
 Christ. "Look well to your conscience, and to your conversation; and 
 then, though men speak evil of you, and falsely accuse you as 
 evil-doers, you will clear yourselves, and bring them to shame. Perhaps 
 you may think it hard to suffer for well-doing, for keeping a good 
 conscience and a good conversation; but be not discouraged, for it is 
 better for you, though worse for your enemies, that you suffer for 
 well-doing than for evil-doing." Learn, 

 1. The most conscientious persons cannot escape the censures and
 slanders of evil men; they will speak evil of them, as of evil-doers, 
 and charge them with crimes which their very souls abhor: Christ and 
 his apostles were so used. 

 2. A good conscience and a good conversation are the best means to
 secure a good name; these give a solid reputation and a lasting one. 

 3. False accusation generally turns to the accuser's shame, by
 discovering at last the accuser's indiscretion, injustice, falsehood, 
 and uncharitableness. 

 4. It is sometimes the will of God that good people should suffer for
 well-doing, for their honesty and for their faith. 

 5. As well-doing sometimes exposes a good man to suffering, so
 evil-doing will not exempt an evil man from it. The apostle supposes 
 here that a man may suffer for both. If the sufferings of good people 
 for well-doing be so severe, what will the sufferings of wicked people 
 be for evil-doing? It is a sad condition which that person is in upon 
 whom sin and suffering meet together at the same time; sin makes 
 sufferings to be extreme, unprofitable, comfortless, and 
 destructive.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for
 the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
 the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
 &nbsp; 19  By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
 prison;
 &nbsp; 20  Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
 of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,
 wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The example of Christ is proposed as an argument for patience under
 sufferings, the strength of which will be discerned if we consider the
 several points contained in the words; observe therefore, 

 1. Jesus Christ himself was not exempted from sufferings in this life, 
 though he had no guilt of his own and could have declined all suffering 
 if he had pleased. 

 2. The reason or meritorious cause of Christ's suffering was the sins
 of men: <I>Christ suffered for sins.</I> The sufferings of Christ were 
 a true and proper punishment; this punishment was suffered to expiate 
 and to make an atonement for sin; and it extends to all sin.

 3. In the case of our Lord's suffering, it was the just that suffered
 for the unjust; he substituted himself in our room and stead, and bore 
 our iniquities. He that knew no sin suffered instead of those that knew 
 no righteousness. 

 4. The merit and perfection of Christ's sacrifice were such that for
 him to suffer once was enough. The legal sacrifices were repeated from 
 day to day, and from year to year; but the sacrifice of Christ, once 
 offered, purgeth away sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:27,9:26,28,10:10,12,14">Heb. vii. 27; ix. 26, 28; x. 10, 12, 14</A>.

 5. The blessed end or design of our Lord's sufferings was to bring us
 to God, to reconcile us to God, to give us access to the Father, to 
 render us and our services acceptable, and to bring us to eternal 
 glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:13,18,3:12,Heb+10:21,22">Eph. ii. 13, 18; iii. 12; 
 Heb. x. 21, 22</A>.

 6. The issue and event of Christ's suffering, as to himself, were
 these, he was put to death in his human nature, but he was quickened 
 and raised again by the Spirit. Now, if Christ was not exempted from
 sufferings, why should Christians expect it? If he suffered, to expiate 
 sins, why should not we be content when our sufferings are only for 
 trial and correction, but not for expiation? If he, though perfectly
 just, why should not we, who are all criminals? If he once suffered,
 and then entered into glory, shall not we be patient under trouble, 
 since it will be but a little time and we shall follow him to glory? If 
 he <I>suffered, to bring us to God,</I> shall not we submit to 
 difficulties, since they are of so much use to quicken us in our return 
 to God, and in the performance of our duty to him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle passes from the example of Christ to that of the old 
 world, and sets before the Jews, to whom he wrote, the different event 
 of those who believed and obeyed Christ preaching by Noah, from those 
 that continued disobedient and unbelieving, intimating to the Jews that 
 they were under a like sentence. God would not wait much longer upon 
 them. They had now an offer of mercy; those that accepted of it should 
 be saved, but those who rejected Christ and the gospel should be as 
 certainly destroyed as ever the disobedient in the times of Noah 
 were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the explication of this we may notice, 

 (1.) The preacher--Christ Jesus, who has interested himself in the 
 affairs of the church and of the world ever since he was first promised 
 to Adam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 <I>He went,</I> not by a local motion, but by special operation, as God 
 is frequently said to move,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:5,Ho+5:15,Mic+1:3">Gen. xi. 5;
 Hos. v. 15; Mic. i. 3</A>.

 <I>He went and preached,</I> by his Spirit striving with them, and
 inspiring and enabling Enoch and Noah to plead with them, and <I>preach 
 righteousness to them,</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5">2 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 (2.) The hearers. Because they were dead and disembodied when the
 apostle speaks of them, therefore he properly calls them spirits now 
 <I>in prison;</I> not that they were <I>in prison when Christ preached 
 to them,</I> as the vulgar Latin translation and the popish expositors 
 pretend. 

 (3.) The sin of these people: They were <I>disobedient,</I> that is, 
 <I>rebellious, unpersuadable,</I> and <I>unbelieving,</I> as the word 
 signifies; this their sin is aggravated from the patience and 
 <I>long-suffering of God</I> (which <I>once waited</I> upon them for 
 120 years together), <I>while Noah was preparing the ark,</I> and by 
 that, as well as by his preaching, giving them fair warning of what was 
 coming upon them. 

 (4.) The event of all: Their bodies were drowned, and their spirits
 cast into hell, which is called a prison 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:25,2Pe+2:4,5">Matt. v. 25; 2 Pet. ii. 4, 5</A>);

 but Noah and his family, who believed and were obedient, <I>were saved 
 in the ark.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the whole we learn that, 

 (1.) God takes exact notice of all the means and advantages that people 
 in all ages have had for the salvation of their souls; it is put to the 
 account of the old world that Christ offered them his help, sent his 
 Spirit, gave them fair warning by Noah, and waited a long time for 
 their amendment. 

 (2.) Though the patience of God wait long upon sinners, yet it will 
 expire at last; it is beneath the majesty of the great God always to 
 wait upon man in vain. 

 (3.) The spirits of disobedient sinners, as soon as they are out of 
 their bodies, are committed to the prison of hell, whence there is no 
 redemption. 

 (4.) The way of the most is neither the best, the wisest, nor the 
 safest way to follow: better to follow the eight in the ark than the 
 eight millions drowned by the flood and damned to hell.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  The like figure whereunto <I>even</I> baptism doth also now save
 us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
 answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of
 Jesus Christ:
 &nbsp; 22  Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
 angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Noah's salvation in the ark upon the water prefigured the salvation of 
 all good Christians in the church by baptism; that temporal salvation 
 by the ark was a type, the antitype whereunto is the eternal salvation 
 of believers by baptism, to prevent mistakes about which the 
 apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Declares what he means by saving baptism; not the outward ceremony 
 of washing with water, which, in itself, does no more than put away the 
 filth of the flesh, but it is that baptism wherein there is a faithful 
 answer or restipulation of a resolved good conscience, engaging to 
 believe in, and be entirely devoted to, God, the Father, Son, and Holy 
 Ghost, renouncing at the same time the flesh, the world, and the devil. 
 The baptismal covenant, made and kept, will certainly save us. Washing 
 is the visible sign; this is the thing signified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle shows that the efficacy of baptism to salvation depends 
 not upon the work done, but upon the resurrection of Christ, which 
 supposes his death, and is the foundation of our faith and hope, to 
 which we are rendered conformable by dying to sin, and rising again to 
 holiness and newness of life. Learn, 

 1. The sacrament of baptism, rightly received, is a means and a pledge
 of salvation. <I>Baptism now saveth us.</I> God is pleased to convey
 his blessings to us in and by his ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:38,22:16">Acts ii. 38; xxii. 16</A>.

 2. The external participation of baptism will save no man without an
 answerable good conscience and conversation. There must be the answer 
 of a good conscience towards God.--<I>Obj.</I> Infants cannot make such 
 an answer, and therefore ought not to be baptized.--<I>Answer,</I> the 
 true circumcision was that of the heart and of the spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>),

 which children were no more capable of then than our infants are 
 capable of making this answer now; yet they were allowed circumcision 
 at eight days old. The infants of the Christian church therefore may be 
 admitted to the ordinance with as much reason as the infants of the 
 Jewish, unless they are barred from it by some express prohibition of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle, having mentioned the death and resurrection of 
 Christ, proceeds to speak of his ascension, and sitting at the right 
 hand of the Father, as a subject fit to be considered by these 
 believers for their comfort in their suffering condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If the advancement of Christ was so glorious after his deep 
 humiliation, let not his followers despair, but expect that after these 
 short distresses they shall be advanced to transcendent joy and glory. 
 Learn, 

 1. Jesus Christ, after he had finished his labours and his sufferings
 upon earth, ascended triumphantly into heaven, of which see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9-11,Mk+16:19">Acts i. 9-11; Mark xvi. 19</A>.
 
 He went to heaven to receive his own acquired crown and glory
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5">John xvii. 5</A>),

 to finish that part of his mediatorial work which could not be done on
 earth, and make intercession for his people, to demonstrate the fulness 
 of his satisfaction, to take possession of heaven for his people, to 
 prepare mansions for them, and to send down the Comforter, which was to 
 be the first-fruits of his intercession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7">John xvi. 7</A>.

 2. Upon his ascension into heaven, Christ is enthroned at the right
 hand of the Father. His being said to <I>sit</I> there imports absolute 
 rest and cessation from all further troubles and sufferings, and an 
 advancement to the highest personal dignity and sovereign power. 

 3. Angels, authorities, and powers, are all made subject to Christ
 Jesus: <I>all power in heaven and earth,</I> to command, to give law, 
 issue orders, and pronounce a final sentence, is committed to Jesus, 
 God-man, which his enemies will find to their everlasting sorrow and 
 confusion, but his servants to their eternal joy and satisfaction.</P>
