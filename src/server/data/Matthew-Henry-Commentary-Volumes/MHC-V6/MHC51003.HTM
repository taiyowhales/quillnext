 I. The apostle exhorts us to set our hearts upon heaven and take them
 off from this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He exhorts to the mortification of sin, in the various instances of
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:5-11">ver. 5-11</A>.

 III. He earnestly presses to mutual love and compassion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 And concludes with exhortations to relative duties, of wives and
 husbands, parents and children, masters and servants,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
 above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
 &nbsp; 2  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
 &nbsp; 4  When Christ, <I>who is</I> our life, shall appear, then shall ye
 also appear with him in glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having described our privileges by Christ in the former 
 part of the epistle, and our discharge from the yoke of the ceremonial 
 law, comes here to press upon us our duty as inferred thence. Though we 
 are made free from the obligation of the ceremonial law, it does not 
 therefore follow that we may live as we list. We must walk the more 
 closely with God in all the instances of evangelical obedience. He 
 begins with exhorting them to set their hearts on heaven, and take them 
 off from this world: <I>If you then have risen with Christ.</I> It is 
 our privilege that we have risen with Christ; that is, have benefit by 
 the resurrection of Christ, and by virtue of our union and communion 
 with him are justified and sanctified, and shall be glorified. Hence
 he infers that we must <I>seek those things which are above.</I> We 
 must mind the concerns of another world more than the concerns of this. 
 We must make heaven our scope and aim, seek the favour of God above, 
 keep up our communion with the upper world by faith, and hope, and holy 
 love, and make it our constant care and business to secure our title to 
 and qualifications for the heavenly bliss. And the reason is because 
 <I>Christ sits at the right hand of God.</I> He who is our best friend 
 and our head is advanced to the highest dignity and honour in heaven, 
 and has gone before to secure to us the heavenly happiness; and 
 therefore we should seek and secure what he has purchased at so vast an 
 expense, and is taking so much care about. We must live such a life as 
 Christ lived here on earth and lives now in heaven, according to our 
 capacities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He explains this duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</I> 
 Observe, To seek heavenly things is to set our affections upon them, to 
 love them and let our desires be towards them. Upon the wings of 
 affection the heart soars upwards, and is carried forth towards 
 spiritual and divine objects. We must acquaint ourselves with them, 
 esteem them above all other things, and lay out ourselves in 
 preparation for the enjoyment of them. David gave this proof of his 
 <I>loving the house of God,</I> that he diligently sought after it, and 
 prepared for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.
 
 This is to be spiritually minded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6">Rom. viii. 6</A>),
 
 and to <I>seek and desire a better country, that is, a heavenly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14,16">Heb. xi. 14, 16</A>.

 <I>Things on earth</I> are here set in opposition to <I>things 
 above.</I> We must not dote upon them, nor expect too much from them, 
 that we may set our affections on heaven; for heaven and earth are 
 contrary one to the other, and a supreme regard to both is 
 inconsistent; and the prevalence of our affection to one will 
 proportionably weaken and abate our affection to the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assigns three reasons for this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we are dead; that is, to present things, and as our portion. We 
 are so in profession and obligation; for we are <I>buried with Christ, 
 and planted into the likeness of his death.</I> Every Christian is 
 <I>crucified unto the world,</I> and <I>the world is crucified unto 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14">Gal. vi. 14</A>.

 And if we are dead to the earth, and have renounced it as our
 happiness, it is absurd for us to <I>set our affections</I> upon it, 
 and <I>seek</I> it. We should be like a dead thing to it, unmoved and 
 unaffected towards it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Our true life lies in the other world: <I>You are dead, and your 
 life is hid with Christ in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The new man has its livelihood thence. It is born and nourished from 
 above; and the perfection of its life is reserved for that state. It is 
 <I>hid with Christ;</I> not hid from us only, in point of secrecy, but 
 hid for us, denoting security. The life of a Christian <I>is hid with 
 Christ. Because I live you shall live also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>.

 Christ is at present a hidden Christ, or one <I>whom we have not 
 seen;</I> but this is our comfort, that our <I>life is hid with 
 him,</I> and laid up safely with him. As we have reason to <I>love him 
 whom we have not seen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8">1 Pet. i. 8</A>),

 so we may take the comfort of a happiness out of sight, and <I>reserved
 in heaven for us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Because at the second coming of Christ we hope for the perfection of 
 our happiness. If we live a life of Christian purity and devotion now, 
 <I>when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, we shall also appear 
 with him in glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Christ is a believer's life. <I>I live, yet not I, but Christ
 lives in me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:20">Gal. ii. 20</A>.

 He is the principle and end of the Christian's life. He lives <I>in</I> 
 us by his Spirit, and we live to him in all we do. <I>To me to live is 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:21">Phil. i. 21</A>.

 (2.) Christ will appear again. He is now <I>hid;</I> and the <I>heavens
 must contain</I> him; but he will appear in all the pomp of the upper 
 world, with his <I>holy angels,</I> and in <I>his own glory and his 
 Father's glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:38,Lu+9:26">Mark viii. 38; Luke ix. 26</A>.

 (3.) We shall then appear with him in glory. It will be his glory to
 have his redeemed with him; he will come to be glorified in his saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:10">2 Thess. i. 10</A>);

 and it will be their glory to come with him, and be with him for ever. 
 At the second coming of Christ there will be a general meeting of all 
 the saints; and those whose life is now <I>hid with Christ</I> shall 
 then appear with Christ in that glory which he himself enjoys, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 Do we look for such a happiness, and should we not set our affections
 upon that world, and live above this? What is there here to make us 
 fond of it? What is there not there to draw our hearts to it? Our head
 is there, our home is there, our treasure is there, and we hope to be 
 there for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth;
 fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil
 concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
 &nbsp; 6  For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the
 children of disobedience:
 &nbsp; 7  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle exhorts the Colossians to the mortification of sin, the 
 great hindrance to seeking the things which are above. Since it is our 
 duty to set our affections upon heavenly things, it is our duty to 
 mortify our <I>members which are upon the earth,</I> and which 
 naturally incline us to the things of the world: "Mortify them, that 
 is, subdue the vicious habits of mind which prevailed in your Gentile 
 state. Kill them, suppress them, as you do weeds or vermin which spread 
 and destroy all about them, or as you kill an enemy who fights against 
 you and wounds you."--<I>Your members which are upon the earth;</I>
 either the members of the body, which are the earthly part of us, and
 were <I>curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:15">Ps. cxxxix. 15</A>),

 or the corrupt affections of the mind, which lead us to earthly things, 
 the members of the body of death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:24">Rom. vii. 24</A>.

 He specifies,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The lusts of the flesh, for which they were before so very 
 remarkable: <I>Fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil 
 concupiscence</I>--the various workings of the carnal appetites and
 fleshly impurities, which they indulged in their former course of life, 
 and which were so contrary to the Christian state and the heavenly 
 hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The love of the world: <I>And covetousness, which is idolatry;</I> 
 that is, an inordinate love of present good and outward enjoyments, 
 which proceeds from too high a value in the mind, puts upon too eager a 
 pursuit, hinders the proper use and enjoyment of them, and creates 
 anxious fear and immoderate sorrow for the loss of them. Observe, 
 Covetousness is spiritual idolatry: it is the giving of that love and 
 regard to worldly wealth which are due to God only, and carries a 
 greater degree of malignity in it, and is more highly provoking to God, 
 than is commonly thought. And it is very observable that among all the 
 instances of sin which good men are recorded in the scripture to have 
 fallen into (and there is scarcely any but some or other, in one or 
 other part of their life, have fallen into) there is no instance in all 
 the scripture of any good man charged with covetousness. He proceeds to 
 show how necessary it is to mortify sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 1. Because, if we do not kill them, they will kill us: <I>For which 
 things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of 
 disobedience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 See what we are all by nature more or less: we are <I>children of 
 disobedience:</I> not only disobedient children, but under the power of 
 sin and naturally prone to disobey. The <I>wicked are estranged from 
 the womb; they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:3">Ps. lviii. 3</A>.
 
 And, being children of disobedience, we are <I>children of
 wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:3">Eph. ii. 3</A>.

 The wrath of God comes upon all the children of disobedience. Those
 who do not obey the precepts of the law incur the penalties of it. The 
 sins he mentions were their sins in their heathen and idolatrous state, 
 and they were then especially the children of disobedience; and yet 
 these sins brought judgments upon them, and exposed them to the wrath 
 of God. 

 2. We should mortify these sins because they have lived in us: <I>In
 which you also walked some time, when you lived in them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Observe, The consideration that we have formerly lived in sin is a good
 argument why we should now forsake it. We have walked in by-paths, 
 therefore let us walk in them no more. <I>If I have done iniquity, I
 will do no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:32">Job xxxiv. 32</A>.

 The time past our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the
 Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">1 Pet. iv. 3</A>.--

 <I>When you lived among those who did such things</I> (so some
 understand it), then you walked in those evil practices. It is a hard 
 thing to live among those who do the works of darkness and not have 
 fellowship with them, as it is to walk in the mire and contract no 
 soil. Let us keep out of the way of evil-doers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice,
 blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
 &nbsp; 9  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
 man with his deeds;
 &nbsp; 10  And have put on the new <I>man,</I> which is renewed in knowledge
 after the image of him that created him:
 &nbsp; 11  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
 uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <I>nor</I> free: but Christ
 <I>is</I> all, and in all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As we are to mortify inordinate appetites, so we are to mortify 
 inordinate passions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>But now you also put off all these, anger wrath, malice;</I> for 
 these are contrary to the design of the gospel, as well as grosser 
 impurities; and, though they are more spiritual wickedness, have not 
 less malignity in them. The gospel religion introduces a change of the 
 higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the 
 dominion of right reason and conscience over appetite and passion. 
 Anger and wrath are bad, but malice is worse, because it is more rooted 
 and deliberate; it is anger heightened and settled. And, as the corrupt 
 principles in the heart must be cut off, so the product of them in the 
 tongue; as <I>blasphemy,</I> which seems there to mean, not so much 
 speaking ill of God as speaking ill of men, giving ill language to 
 them, or raising ill reports of them, and injuring their good name by 
 any evil arts,--<I>filthy communication,</I> that is, all lewd and 
 wanton discourse, which comes from a polluted mind in the speaker and 
 propagates the same defilements in the hearers,--and lying: <I>Lie not 
 one to another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for it is contrary both to the law of truth and the law of love, it is 
 both unjust and unkind, and naturally tends to destroy all faith and 
 friendship among mankind. Lying makes us like the devil (who is the 
 <I>father of lies</I>), and is a prime part of the devil's image upon 
 our souls; and therefore we are cautioned against this sin by this 
 general reason: Seeing <I>you have put off the old man with his deeds, 
 and have put on the new man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The consideration that we have by profession put away sin and espoused 
 the cause and interest of Christ, that we have renounced all sin and 
 stand engaged to Christ, should fortify us against this sin of lying. 
 Those who have put off the old man have put it off with its deeds; and 
 those who have put on the new man must put on all its deeds--not only 
 espouse good principles but act them in a good conversation. The new 
 man is said to be <I>renewed in knowledge,</I> because an ignorant soul 
 cannot be a good soul. Without knowledge the heart cannot be good,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:2">Prov. xix. 2</A>.

 The grace of God works upon the will and affections by renewing the 
 understanding. Light is the first thing in the new creation, as it was
 in the first: <I>after the image of him who created him.</I> It was the 
 honour of man in innocence that he was made after the image of God; but 
 that image was defaced and lost by sin, and is renewed by sanctifying 
 grace: so that a renewed soul is something like what Adam was in the 
 day he was created. In the privilege and duty of sanctification 
 <I>there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, 
 Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 There is now no difference arising from different country or different 
 condition and circumstance of life: it is as much the duty of the one 
 as of the other to be holy, and as much the privilege of the one as of 
 the other to receive from God the grace to be so. Christ came to take 
 down all partition-walls, that all might stand on the same level before 
 God, both in duty and privilege. And for this reason, because
 <I>Christ is all in all.</I> Christ is a Christian's all, his only Lord 
 and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness. And to those who are
 sanctified, one as well as another and whatever they are in other 
 respects, he is <I>all in all,</I> the <I>Alpha</I> and <I>Omega,</I> 
 the <I>beginning and the end:</I> he is all in all things to them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
 bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
 longsuffering;
 &nbsp; 13  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any
 man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so
 also <I>do</I> ye.
 &nbsp; 14  And above all these things <I>put on</I> charity, which is the
 bond of perfectness.
 &nbsp; 15  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
 also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
 &nbsp; 16  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
 teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and
 spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
 &nbsp; 17  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <I>do</I> all in the name
 of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds to exhort to mutual love and compassion: <I>Put on
 therefore bowels of mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 We must not only put off anger and wrath (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but we must put on compassion and kindness; not only cease to do evil, 
 but learn to do well; not only not do hurt to any, but do what good we 
 can to all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The argument here used to enforce the exhortation is very affecting: 
 <I>Put on, as the elect of God, holy and beloved.</I> Observe, 

 1. Those who are holy are the elect of God; and those who are the elect 
 of God, and holy, are beloved--beloved of God, and ought to be so of 
 all men. 

 2. Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to conduct
 themselves in every thing as becomes them, and so as not to lose the 
 credit of their holiness, nor the comfort of their being chosen and 
 beloved. It becomes those who are holy towards God to be lowly and 
 loving towards all men. Observe, What we must put on in particular.

 (1.) Compassion towards the miserable: <I>Bowels of mercy,</I> the 
 tenderest mercies. Those who owe so much to mercy ought to be merciful 
 to all who are proper objects of mercy. <I>Be you merciful, as your 
 Father is merciful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:36">Luke vi. 36</A>.

 (2.) <I>Kindness</I> towards our friends, and those who love us. A
 courteous disposition becomes the elect of God; for the design of the 
 gospel is not only to soften the minds of men, but to sweeten them, and 
 to promote friendship among men as well as reconciliation with God. 
 
 (3.) <I>Humbleness of mind,</I> in submission to those above us, and 
 condescension to those below us. There must not only be a humble
 demeanour, but a humble mind. <I>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly 
 in heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>.

 (4.) <I>Meekness</I> towards those who have provoked us, or been any
 way injurious to us. We must not be transported into any indecency by 
 our resentment of indignities and neglects: but must prudently bridle 
 our own anger, and patiently bear the anger of others. 

 (5.) <I>Long-suffering</I> towards those who continue to provoke us.
 <I>Charity suffereth long,</I> as well <I>as is kind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:4">1 Cor. xiii. 4</A>.
 
 Many can bear a short provocation who are weary of bearing when it
 grows long. But we must suffer long both the injuries of men and the
 rebukes of divine Providence. If God is long-suffering to us, under all
 our provocations of him, we should exercise long-suffering to others in
 like cases. 

 (6.) Mutual forbearance, in consideration of the infirmities and 
 deficiencies under which we all labour: <I>Forbearing one another.</I> 
 We have all of us something which needs to be borne with, and this is a 
 good reason why we should bear with others in what is disagreeable to 
 us. We need the same good turn from others which we are bound to show 
 them. 

 (7.) A readiness to forgive injuries: <I>Forgiving one another, if any 
 man have a quarrel against any.</I> While we are in this world, where 
 there is so much corruption in our hearts, and so much occasion of 
 difference and contention, quarrels will sometimes happen, even among 
 the elect of God, who are holy and beloved, as Paul and Barnabas had a 
 <I>sharp contention, which parted them asunder one from the other</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:39">Acts xv. 39</A>),
 
 and Paul and Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:14">Gal. ii. 14</A>.

 But it is our duty to forgive one another in such cases; not to bear 
 any grudge, but put up with the affront and pass it by. And the reason 
 is: <I>Even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.</I> The 
 consideration that we are forgiven by Christ so many offences is a good 
 reason why we should forgive others. It is an argument of the divinity
 of Christ that he had <I>power on earth to forgive sins;</I> and it is 
 a branch of his example which we are obliged to follow, if we ourselves 
 would be forgiven. <I>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those 
 who trespass against us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:12">Matt. vi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In order to all this, we are exhorted here to several things:--

 1. To clothe ourselves with love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Above all things put on charity:</I> <B><I>epi pasi de 
 toutois</I></B>--<I>over all things.</I> Let this be the upper garment, 
 the robe, the livery, the mark of our dignity and distinction. Or, Let 
 this be principal and chief, as the whole sum and abstract of the 
 second table. <I>Add to faith virtue, and to brotherly-kindness 
 charity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:5-7">2 Pet. i. 5-7</A>.

 He lays the foundation in faith, and the top-stone in charity, <I>which
 is the bond of perfectness,</I> the cement and centre of all happy 
 society. Christian unity consists of unanimity and mutual love. 

 2. To submit ourselves to the government of the <I>peace of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts,</I> that is, God's being 
 at peace with you, and the comfortable sense of his acceptance and 
 favour: or, a disposition to peace among yourselves, a peaceable 
 spirit, that keeps the peace, and makes peace. This is called the 
 <I>peace of God,</I> because it is of his working in all who are his. 
 The <I>kingdom of God is righteousness and peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17">Rom. xiv. 17</A>.

 "Let this peace <I>rule in your heart</I>--prevail and govern there, or 
 as an umpire decide all matters of difference among you."--<I>To which 
 you are called in one body.</I> We are called to this peace, to peace 
 with God as our privilege and peace with our brethren as our duty. 
 Being united in one body, we are called to be at peace one with 
 another, as the members of the natural body; for <I>we are the body of 
 Christ, and members in particular,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:27">1 Cor. xii. 27</A>.

 To preserve in us this peaceable disposition, we must be thankful. The
 work of thanksgiving to God is such a sweet and pleasant work that it
 will help to make us sweet and pleasant towards all men. "Instead of
 envying one another upon account of any particular favours and
 excellence, be thankful for his mercies, which are common to all of
 you."

 3. To let the <I>word of Christ dwell in us richly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The gospel is the word of Christ, which has come to us; but that is not
 enough, it must dwell in us, or <I>keep 
 house</I>--<B><I>enoikeito,</I></B> not as a servant in a family, who 
 is under another's control, but as a master, who has a right to 
 prescribe to and direct all under his roof. We must take our 
 instructions and directions from it, and our portion of meat and 
 strength, of grace and comfort, in due season, as from the <I>master of 
 the household.</I> It must dwell in us; that is, be always ready and at 
 hand to us in every thing, and have its due influence and use. We must 
 be familiarly acquainted with it, and <I>know it for our good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:27">Job v. 27</A>.

 It must dwell in us richly: not only keep house in our hearts, but keep
 a good house. Many have the word of Christ dwelling in them, but it 
 dwells in them but poorly; it has no mighty force and influence upon 
 them. Then the soul prospers when the word of God <I>dwells in us 
 richly,</I> when we have abundance of it in us, and are full of the 
 scriptures and of the grace of Christ. And this in all wisdom. The 
 proper office of wisdom is to apply what we know to ourselves, for our 
 own direction. The word of Christ must dwell in us, not in all notion
 and speculation, to make us doctors, but in all wisdom, to make us good 
 Christians, and enable us to conduct ourselves in every thing as 
 becomes Wisdom's children.

 4. To teach and admonish one another. This would contribute very much
 to our furtherance in all grace; for we sharpen ourselves by quickening 
 others, and improve our knowledge by communicating it for their 
 edification. We must <I>admonish one another in psalms and hymns.</I> 
 Observe, Singing of psalms is a gospel ordinance: <B><I>psalmois kai 
 hymnois kai odais</I></B>--the Psalms of David, and spiritual hymns and 
 odes, collected out of the scripture, and suited to special occasions, 
 instead of their lewd and profane songs in their idolatrous worship. 
 Religious poesy seems countenanced by these expressions and is capable 
 of great edification. But, when we sing psalms, we make no melody 
 unless we sing with grace in our hearts, unless we are suitably 
 affected with what we sing and go along in it with true devotion and 
 understanding. Singing of psalms is a teaching ordinance as well as a 
 praising ordinance; and we are not only to quicken and encourage 
 ourselves, but to <I>teach and admonish one another,</I> mutually 
 excite our affections, and convey instructions.

 5. All must be done in the name of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>And whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the 
 Lord Jesus,</I> according to his command and in compliance with his 
 authority, by strength derived from him, with an eye to his glory, and 
 depending upon his merit for the acceptance of what is good and the 
 pardon of what is amiss, <I>Giving thanks to God and the Father by 
 him.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) We must give thanks in all things; whatsoever we do, we must still 
 give thanks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:20">Eph. v. 20</A>,
 
 <I>Giving thanks always for all things.</I>
 
 (2.) The Lord Jesus must be the Mediator of our praises as well as of 
 our prayers. <I>We give thanks to God and the Father in the name of the 
 Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:20">Eph. v. 20</A>.

 Those who do all things in Christ's name will never want matter of
 thanksgiving to God, even the Father.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle concludes the chapter with exhortations to relative duties, 
 as before in the epistle to the Ephesians. The epistles which are most 
 taken up in displaying the glory of divine grace, and magnifying the 
 Lord Jesus, are the most particular and distinct in pressing the duties 
 of the several relations. We must never separate the privileges and 
 duties of the gospel religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He begins with the duties of wives and husbands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the 
 Lord.</I> Submission is the duty of wives, <B><I>hypotassesthe.</I></B> 
 It is the same word which is used to express our duty to magistrates 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1">Rom. xiii. 1</A>,

 <I>Let every soul be</I> subject <I>to the higher powers</I>), and is 
 expressed by subjection and reverence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:24,33">Eph. v. 24, 33</A>.

 The reason is that <I>Adam was first formed, then Eve: and Adam was not 
 deceived, but the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:13,14">1 Tim. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 He was first in the creation and last in the transgression. The <I>head
 of the woman is the man;</I> and the <I>man is not of the woman, but 
 the woman of the man; neither was the man created for the woman, but 
 the woman for the man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:3,8,9">1 Cor. xi. 3, 8, 9</A>.

 It is agreeable to the order of nature and the reason of things, as
 well as the appointment and will of God. But then it is submission, not 
 to a rigorous lord or absolute tyrant, who may do his will and is 
 without restraints, but to a husband, and to her own husband, who 
 stands in the nearest relation, and is under strict engagements to 
 proper duty too. And <I>this is fit in the Lord,</I> it is becoming
 the relation, and what they are bound in duty to do, as an instance of 
 obedience to the authority and law of Christ. On the other hand, 
 <I>husbands must love their wives, and not be bitter against them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They must love them with tender and faithful affection, as Christ loved 
 the church, and as their own bodies, and even as themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25,28,33">Eph. v. 25, 28, 33</A>),

 with a love peculiar to the nearest relation and the greatest comfort 
 and blessing of life. And they must not be bitter against them, not use 
 them unkindly, with harsh language or severe treatment, but be kind and 
 obliging to them in all things; for the <I>woman was made for the man, 
 neither is the man without the woman,</I> and the <I>man also is by the 
 woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:9,11,12">1 Cor. xi. 9, 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duties of children and parents: <I>Children, obey your parents 
 in all things, for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They must be willing to do all their lawful commands, and be at their 
 direction and disposal; as those who have a natural right and are 
 fitter to direct them than themselves. The apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:2">Eph. vi. 2</A>)

 requires them to honour as well as obey their parents; they must esteem 
 them and think honourably of them, as the obedience of their lives must 
 proceed from the esteem and opinion of their minds. And this is 
 <I>well-pleasing to God,</I> or acceptable to him; for it is the 
 <I>first commandment with promise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:2">Eph. vi. 2</A>),

 with an explicit promise annexed to it, namely, <I>That it shall be 
 well with them, and they shall live long on the earth.</I> Dutiful 
 children are the most likely to prosper in the world and enjoy long 
 life. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 
 "<I>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be 
 discouraged.</I> Let not your authority over them be exercised with 
 rigour and severity, but with kindness and gentleness, lest you raise 
 their passions and discourage them in their duty, and by holding the 
 reins too tight make them fly out with greater fierceness." The bad 
 temper and example of imprudent parents often prove a great hindrance 
 to their children and a stumbling-block in their way; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:4">Eph. vi. 4</A>.

 And it is by the tenderness of parents, and dutifulness of children,
 that God ordinarily furnishes his church with a seed to serve him, and 
 propagates religion from age to age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Servants and masters: <I>Servants, obey your masters in all things 
 according to the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Servants must do the duty of the relation in which they stand, and obey 
 their master's commands in <I>all things</I> which are consistent with 
 their duty to God their heavenly Master. <I>Not with eye-service, as 
 men-pleasers</I>--not only when their master's eye is upon them, but 
 when they are from under their master's eye. They must be both just and 
 diligent. <I>In singleness of heart, fearing God</I>--without selfish 
 designs, or hypocrisy and disguise, as those who fear God and stand in 
 awe of him. Observe, The fear of God ruling in the heart will make
 people good in every relation. Servants who fear God will be just and 
 faithful when they are from under their master's eye, because they know 
 they are under the eye of God. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:11">Gen. xx. 11</A>,

 <I>Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15">Neh. v. 15</A>,

 <I>But so did not I, because of the fear of God.</I> "And <I>whatsoever 
 you do, do it heartily</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 with diligence, not idly and slothfully:" or, "Do it cheerfully, not 
 discontented at the providence of God which put you in that 
 relation."--<I>As to the Lord, and not as to men.</I> It sanctifies a 
 servant's work when it is done as unto God--with an eye to his glory 
 and in obedience to his command, and not merely as unto men, or with 
 regard to them only. Observe, We are really doing our duty to God when 
 we are faithful in our duty to men. And, for servants' encouragement, 
 let them know that a good and faithful servant is never the further 
 from heaven for his being a servant: "<I>Knowing that of the Lord you 
 shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Serving your masters according to the command of Christ, you serve 
 Christ, and he will be your paymaster: you will have a glorious reward 
 at last. Though you are now servants, you will receive the inheritance 
 of sons. But, on the other hand, <I>He who does wrong will receive for 
 the wrong which he has done,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 There is a righteous God, who, if servants wrong their masters, will 
 reckon with them for it, though they may conceal it from their master's 
 notice. And he will be sure to punish the unjust as well as reward the 
 faithful servant: and so if masters wrong their servants.--<I>And there 
 is no respect of persons with him.</I> The righteous Judge of the earth 
 will be impartial, and carry it with an equal hand towards the master 
 and servant; not swayed by any regard to men's outward circumstances 
 and condition of life. The one and the other will stand upon a level at 
 his tribunal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that the apostle has a particular respect, in all these 
 instances of duty, to the case mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1-40">1 Cor. vii.</A>

 of relations of a different religion, as a Christian and heathen, a
 Jewish convert and an uncircumcised Gentile, where there was room to 
 doubt whether they were bound to fulfil the proper duties of their 
 several relations to such persons. And, if it hold in such cases, it is 
 much stronger upon Christians one towards another, and where both are 
 of the same religion. And how happy would the gospel religion make the 
 world, if it every where prevailed; and how much would it influence 
 every state of things and every relation of life!</P>
