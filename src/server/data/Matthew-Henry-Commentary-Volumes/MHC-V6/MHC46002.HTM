 The apostle proceeds with his argument in this chapter, and, 

 I. Reminds the Corinthians of the plain manner wherein he delivered the
 gospel to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 But yet, 

 II. Shows them that he had communicated to them a treasure of the
 truest and highest wisdom, such as exceeded all the attainments of
 learned men, such as could never have entered into the heart of man if
 it had not been revealed, nor can be received and improved to salvation
 but by the light and influence of that Spirit who revealed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6-16">ver. 6 to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency
 of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
 &nbsp; 2  For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
 Christ, and him crucified.
 &nbsp; 3  And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
 trembling.
 &nbsp; 4  And my speech and my preaching <I>was</I> not with enticing words
 of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
 &nbsp; 5  That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in
 the power of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle pursues his design, and reminds the 
 Corinthians how he acted when he first preached the gospel among 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As to the matter or subject he tell us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>He determined to know nothing among them but Jesus Christ and him 
 crucified</I>--to make a show of no other knowledge than this, to 
 preach nothing, to discover the knowledge of nothing, but Jesus Christ, 
 and him crucified. Note, Christ, in his person and offices, is the sum 
 and substance of the gospel, and ought to be the great subject of a 
 gospel minister's preaching. His business is to display the banner of 
 the cross, and invite people under it. Anyone that heard Paul preach
 found him to harp so continually on this string that he would say he 
 knew nothing but Christ and him crucified. Whatever other knowledge he 
 had, this was the only knowledge he discovered, and showed himself 
 concerned to propagate among his hearers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The manner wherein he preached Christ is here also observable. 

 1. Negatively. <I>He came not among them with excellency of speech or
 wisdom,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>His speech and preaching were not with enticing words of man's 
 wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He did not affect to appear a fine orator or a deep philosopher; nor 
 did he insinuate himself into their minds, by a flourish of words, or a 
 pompous show of deep reason and extraordinary science and skill. He did 
 not set himself to captivate the ear by fine turns and eloquent 
 expressions, nor to please and entertain the fancy with lofty flights 
 of sublime notions. Neither his speech, nor the wisdom he taught, 
 savoured of human skill: he learnt both in another school. Divine 
 wisdom needed not to be set off with such human ornaments. 

 2. Positively. He came among them <I>declaring the testimony of
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He published a divine revelation, and gave in sufficient vouchers for 
 the authority of it, both by its consonancy to ancient predictions and 
 by present miraculous operations; and there he left the matter.
 Ornaments of speech and philosophical skill and argument could add no 
 weight to what came recommended by such authority. <I>He was also among 
 them in weakness and fear, and in much trembling;</I> and yet <I>his 
 speech and preaching were in demonstration of the Spirit and of 
 power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 His enemies in the church of Corinth spoke very contemptuously of him: 
 <I>His bodily presence, say they, is weak, and his speech 
 contemptible,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:10">2 Cor. x. 10</A>.

 Possibly he had a little body, and a low voice; but, though he had not
 so good an elocution as some, it is plain that he was no mean speaker. 
 The men of Lystra looked on him to be the heathen god Mercury, come 
 down to them in the form of a man, because he was the chief speaker, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:12">Acts xiv. 12</A>.

 Nor did he want courage nor resolution to go through his work; he was
 <I>in nothing terrified by his adversaries.</I> Yet he was no boaster. 
 He did not proudly vaunt himself, like his opposers. He acted in his 
 office with much modesty, concern, and care. He behaved with great 
 humility among them; not as one grown vain with the honour and 
 authority conferred on him, but as one concerned to approve himself 
 faithful, and fearful of himself, lest he should mismanage in his 
 trust. Observe, None know the fear and trembling of faithful
 ministers, who are zealous over souls with a godly jealousy; and a deep 
 sense of their own weakness is the occasion of this fear and trembling.
 They know how insufficient they are, and are therefore fearful for 
 themselves. But, though Paul managed with this modesty and concern, yet 
 he spoke with authority: <I>In the demonstration of the Spirit and of 
 power.</I> He preached the truths of Christ in their native dress, with 
 plainness of speech. He laid down the doctrine as the Spirit delivered 
 it; and left the Spirit, by his external operation in signs and 
 miracles, and his internal influences on the hearts of men, to 
 demonstrate the truth of it, and procure its reception.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the end mentioned for which he preached Christ crucified 
 in this manner: <I>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of 
 man, but the power of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)--

 that they might not be drawn by human motives, nor overcome by mere 
 human arguments, lest it should be said that either rhetoric or logic 
 had made them Christians. But, when nothing but Christ crucified was 
 plainly preached, the success must be founded, not on human wisdom, but 
 divine evidence and operation. The gospel was so preached that God 
 might appear and be glorified in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not
 the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that
 come to nought:
 &nbsp; 7  But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <I>even</I> the
 hidden <I>wisdom,</I> which God ordained before the world unto our
 glory:
 &nbsp; 8  Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they
 known <I>it,</I> they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
 &nbsp; 9  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
 neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God
 hath prepared for them that love him.
 &nbsp; 10  But God hath revealed <I>them</I> unto us by his Spirit: for the
 Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
 &nbsp; 11  For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
 man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man,
 but the Spirit of God.
 &nbsp; 12  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
 spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are
 freely given to us of God.
 &nbsp; 13  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
 wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
 spiritual things with spiritual.
 &nbsp; 14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
 of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
 <I>them,</I> because they are spiritually discerned.
 &nbsp; 15  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself
 is judged of no man.
 &nbsp; 16  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may
 instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the chapter the apostle shows them that though he had 
 not come to them with the excellency of human wisdom, with any of the 
 boasted knowledge and literature of the Jews or Greeks, yet he had 
 communicated to them a treasure of the truest and the highest wisdom: 
 <I>We speak wisdom among those who are perfect</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 among those who are well instructed in Christianity, and come to some 
 maturity in the things of God. Those that receive the doctrine as 
 divine, and, having been illuminated by the Holy Spirit, have looked 
 well into it, discover true wisdom in it. They not only understand the 
 plain history of Christ, and him crucified, but discern the deep and 
 admirable designs of the divine wisdom therein. Though what we preach 
 is foolishness to the world, it is wisdom to them. They are made wise 
 by it, and can discern wisdom in it. Note, Those who are wise 
 themselves are the only proper judges of what is wisdom; <I>not</I> 
 indeed <I>the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this 
 world,</I> but <I>the wisdom of God in a mystery</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>);

 not worldly wisdom, but divine; not such as the men of this world could 
 have discovered, nor such as worldly men, under the direction of pride, 
 and passion, and appetite, and worldly interest, and destitute of the 
 Spirit of God, can receive. Note, How different is the judgment of God 
 from that of the world! <I>He seeth not as man seeth.</I> The wisdom he 
 teaches is of a quite different kind from what passes under that notion 
 in the world. It is not the wisdom of politicians, nor philosophers,
 nor rabbis (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 not such as they teach nor such as they relish; <I>but the wisdom of 
 God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom of God</I>--what he had a long time 
 kept to himself, and concealed from the world, and the depth of which, 
 now it is revealed, none but himself can fathom. <I>It is the mystery 
 which hath been hid from ages and generations, though now made manifest 
 to the saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:26">Col. i. 26</A>),

 hid in a manner entirely from the heathen world, and made mysterious to 
 the Jews, by being wrapped up in dark types and distant prophecies, but 
 revealed and made known to us by the Spirit of God. Note, See the 
 privilege of those who enjoy the gospel revelation: to them types are 
 unveiled, mysteries made plain, prophecies interpreted, and the secret 
 counsels of God published and laid open. The wisdom of God in a mystery 
 is now made manifest to the saints. Now, concerning this wisdom, 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The rise and origin of it: <I>It was ordained of God, before the 
 world, to our glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was ordained of God; he had determined long ago to reveal and make 
 it known, from many ages past, from the beginning, nay, from eternity; 
 and that to our glory, <I>the glory of us,</I> either us apostles or us 
 Christians. It was a great honour put upon the apostles, to be 
 entrusted with the revelation of this wisdom. It was a great and 
 honourable privilege for Christians to have this glorious wisdom 
 discovered to them. And the wisdom of God discovered to them. And the 
 wisdom of God discovered in the gospel, the divine wisdom taught by the 
 gospel, prepares for our everlasting glory and happiness in the world 
 to come. The counsels of God concerning our redemption are dated from 
 eternity, and designed for the glory and happiness of the saints. And 
 what deep wisdom was in these counsels! Note, The wisdom of God is
 both employed and displayed for the honour of the saints--employed from 
 eternity, and displayed in time, to make them glorious both here and 
 hereafter, in time and to eternity. What honour does he put on his 
 saints!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ignorance of the great men of the world about it: <I>Which none 
 of the princes of this world knew</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 the principal men in authority and power, or in wisdom and learning. 
 The Roman governor, and the guides and rulers of the Jewish church and 
 nation, seem to be the persons here chiefly meant. These were the 
 princes of this world, or this age, who, had they known this true and 
 heavenly wisdom, would not have crucified the Lord of glory. This 
 Pilate and the Jewish rulers literally did when our Redeemer was 
 crucified upon the sentence of the one and the clamorous demands of the 
 other. Observe, Jesus Christ is the Lord of Glory, a title much too 
 great for any creature to bear: and the reason why he was hated was 
 because he was not known. Had his crucifiers known him, known who and
 what he was, they would have withheld their impious hands, and not have 
 taken and slain him. This he pleaded with his Father for their pardon: 
 <I>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:34">Luke xxiii. 34</A>.

 Note, There are many things which people would not do if they knew the
 wisdom of God in the great work of redemption. They act as they do 
 because they are blind or heedless. They know not the truth, or will 
 not attend to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is such wisdom as could not have been discovered without a 
 revelation, according to what the prophet Isaiah says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:4">Isa. lxiv. 4</A>),
 
 <I>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of 
 man the things which God hath prepared for those that love him--for him 
 that waiteth for him,</I> that waiteth for his mercy, so the LXX. It 
 was a testimony of love to God in the Jewish believers to live in 
 expectation of the accomplishment o evangelical promises. Waiting upon
 God is an evidence of love to him. <I>Lo, this is our God, we have 
 waited for him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:9">Isa. xxv. 9</A>.

 Observe, There are things which God hath prepared for those that love
 him, and wait for him. There are such things prepared in a future life 
 for them, things which sense cannot discover, no present information 
 can convey to our ears, nor can yet enter our hearts. <I>Life and 
 immortality are brought to light through the gospel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10">2 Tim. i. 10</A>.

 But the apostle speaks here of the subject-matter of the divine
 revelation under the gospel. These are such as eye hath not seen nor 
 ear heard. Observe, The great truths of the gospel are things lying out 
 of the sphere of human discovery: <I>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard 
 them, nor have they entered into the heart of man.</I> Were they 
 objects of sense, could they be discovered by an eye of reason, and 
 communicated by the ear to the mind, as matters of common human 
 knowledge may, there had been no need of a revelation. But, lying out 
 of the sphere of nature, we cannot discover them but by the light of 
 revelation. And therefore we must take them as they lie in the 
 scriptures, and as God has been pleased to reveal them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We here see by whom this wisdom is discovered to us: <I>God hath 
 revealed them to us by his Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The scripture is given by inspiration of God. <I>Holy men spoke of old 
 as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2 Pet. i. 21</A>.

 And the apostles spoke by inspiration of the same Spirit, as he taught 
 them, and gave them utterance. Here is a proof of the divine authority 
 of the holy scriptures. Paul wrote what he taught: and what he taught 
 was revealed of God by his Spirit, <I>that Spirit that searches all 
 things, yea, the deep things of God, and knows the things of God, as 
 the spirit of a man that is in him knows the things of a man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 A double argument is drawn from these words in proof of the divinity of 
 the Holy Ghost:--

 1. Omniscience is attributed to him: <I>He searches all things, even
 the deep things of God.</I> He has exact knowledge of all things, and 
 enters into the very depths of God, penetrates into his most secret 
 counsels. Now who can have such a thorough knowledge of God but God? 

 2. This allusion seems to imply that the Holy Spirit is as much in God
 as a man's mind is in himself. Now the mind of the man is plainly 
 essential to him. He cannot be without his mind. Now can God be without 
 his Spirit. He is as much and as intimately one with God as the man's 
 mind is with the man. The man knows his own mind because his mind is
 one with himself. The Spirit of God knows the things of God because he 
 is one with God. And as no man can come at the knowledge of what is in 
 another man's mind till he communicates and reveals it, so neither can 
 we know the secret counsels and purposes of God till they are made 
 known to us by his Holy Spirit. We cannot know them at all till he had 
 proposed them objectively (as it is called) in the external revelation; 
 we cannot know or believe them to salvation till he enlightens the 
 faculty, opens the eye of the mind, and gives us such a knowledge and 
 faith of them. And it was by this Spirit that the apostles had
 received the <I>wisdom of God in a mystery,</I> which they spoke.
 "<I>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit 
 which is of God, that we might know the things freely given to us of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 not the spirit which is in the <I>wise men of the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 nor in the <I>rulers of the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but the <I>Spirit which is of God,</I> or proceedeth from God. We have 
 what we deliver in the name of God by inspiration from him; and it is 
 by his gracious illumination and influence that <I>we know the things 
 freely given to us of God</I> unto salvation"--that is, "the great 
 privileges of the gospel, which are the free gift of God, distributions 
 of mere and rich grace." Though these things are given to us, and the 
 revelation of this gift is made to us, we cannot know them to any 
 saving purpose till we have the Spirit. The apostles had the revelation 
 of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of 
 them from the same Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We see here in what manner this wisdom was taught or communicated: 
 <I>Which things we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, 
 but which the Holy Ghost teaches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They had received the wisdom they taught, not from the wise men of the 
 world, but from the Spirit of God. Nor did they put a human dress on 
 it, but plainly declared the doctrine of Christ, in terms also taught 
 them by the Holy Spirit. He not only gave them the knowledge of these 
 things, but gave them utterance. Observe, The truths of God need no
 garnishing by human skill or eloquence, but look best in the words 
 which the Holy Ghost teaches. The Spirit of God knows much better how 
 to speak of the things of God than the best critics, orators, or 
 philosophers. <I>Comparing spiritual things with spiritual</I>--one
 part of revelation with another, the revelation of the gospel with that 
 of the Jews, the discoveries of the New Testament with the types and 
 prophecies of the Old. The comparing of matters of revelation with 
 matters of science, things supernatural with things natural and common, 
 is going by a wrong measure. Spiritual things, when brought together, 
 will help to illustrate one another; but, if the principles of human 
 art and science are to be made a test of revelation, we shall certainly 
 judge amiss concerning it, and the things contained in it. Or, 
 <I>adapting spiritual things to spiritual</I>--speaking of spiritual 
 matters, matters of revelation, and the spiritual life, in language 
 that is proper and plain. The language of the Spirit of God is the most 
 proper to convey his meaning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. We have an account how this wisdom is received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The natural man receiveth not the things of God, for they are 
 foolishness to him, neither can he know them, because they are 
 spiritually discerned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The <I>natural man, the animal man.</I> Either,

 (1.) The man under the power of corruption, and never yet illuminated 
 by the Spirit of God, such as Jude calls <I>sensual, not having the 
 Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:19">
 <I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Men unsanctified receive not the things of God. The understanding,
 through the corruption of nature by the fall, and through the 
 confirmation of this disorder by customary sin, is utterly unapt to 
 receive the rays of divine light; it is prejudiced against them. The 
 truths of God are foolishness to such a mind. The man looks on them as 
 trifling and impertinent things, not worth his minding. <I>The light
 shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:5">John i. 5</A>.

 Not that the natural faculty of discerning is lost, but evil
 inclinations and wicked principles render the man unwilling to enter 
 into the mind of God, in the spiritual matters of his kingdom, and 
 yield to their force and power. It is the quickening beams of the 
 Spirit of truth and holiness that must help the mind to discern their 
 excellency, and to so thorough a conviction of their truth as heartily 
 to receive and embrace them. Thus the natural man, the man destitute of 
 the Spirit of God, cannot know them, because they are spiritually 
 discerned. Or,

 (2.) The natural man, that is, the wise man of the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:19,20"><I>ch.</I> i. 19, 20</A>),

 the wise man after the flesh, or according to the flesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 one who hath the wisdom of the world, man's wisdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:4-6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4-6</A>),

 a man, as some of the ancients, that would learn all truth by his own
 ratiocinations, receive nothing by faith, nor own any need of 
 supernatural assistance. This was very much the character of the 
 pretenders to philosophy and the Grecian learning and wisdom in that 
 day. Such a man receives not the things of the Spirit of God. 
 Revelation is not with him a principle of science; he looks upon it as 
 delirium and dotage, the extravagant thought of some deluded dreamer. 
 It is no way to wisdom among the famous masters of the world; and for 
 that reason he can have no knowledge of things revealed, because they 
 are only spiritually discerned, or made known by the revelation of the 
 Spirit, which is a principle of science or knowledge that he will not 
 admit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is 
 judged,</I> or discerned, <I>of no man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Either,

 (1.) He who is sanctified and made spiritually-minded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6">Rom. viii. 6</A>)

 judgeth all things, or discerneth all things--he is capable of judging 
 about matters of human wisdom, and has also a relish and savour of 
 divine truths; he sees divine wisdom, and experiences divine power, in 
 gospel revelations and mysteries, which the carnal and unsanctified 
 mind looks upon as weakness and folly, as things destitute of all power 
 and not worthy any regard. It is the sanctified mind that must discern 
 the real beauties of holiness; but, by the refinement of its 
 facilities, they do not lose their power of discerning and judging 
 about common and natural things. The spiritual man may judge of all 
 things, natural and supernatural, human and divine, the deductions of 
 reason and the discoveries of revelation. But he himself is judged or 
 discerned of <FONT SIZE=-1>NO MAN</FONT>. God's saints are his hidden 
 ones,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:3">Ps. lxxxiii. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Their life is hid with Christ in God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:3">Col. iii. 3</A>.

 The carnal man knows no more of a spiritual man than he does of other
 spiritual things. He is a stranger to the principles, pleasures, and 
 actings, of the divine life. The spiritual man does not lie open to his 
 observation. Or,

 (2.) <I>He that is spiritual</I> (who has had divine revelations made
 to him, receives them as such, and founds his faith and religion upon 
 them) can judge both of common things and things divine; he can discern 
 what is, and what is not, the doctrine of the gospel and of salvation, 
 and whether a man preaches the truths of God or not. He does not lose 
 the power of reasoning, nor renounce the principles of it, by founding 
 his faith and religion on revelation. But <I>he himself is judged of no 
 man</I>--can be judged, so as to be confuted, by no man; nor can any 
 man who is not spiritual, not under a divine <I>afflatus</I> himself 
 (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:37"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 37</A>),

 or not founding his faith on a divine revelation, discern or judge
 whether what he speaks be true or divine, or not. In short, he who 
 founds all his knowledge upon principles of science, and the mere light 
 of reason, can never be a judge of the truth or falsehood of what is 
 received by revelation. <I>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, 
 that he may instruct him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that is, the <I>spiritual man?</I> Who can enter so far into the mind 
 of God as to instruct him who has the Spirit of God, and is under his 
 inspiration? He only is the person to whom God immediately communicates 
 the knowledge of his will. And who can inform or instruct him in the
 mind of God who is so immediately under the conduct of his own Spirit? 
 Very few have known any thing of the mind of God by a natural power. 
 <I>But,</I> adds the apostle, <I>we have the mind of Christ;</I> and 
 the mind of Christ is the mind of God. He is God, and the principal 
 messenger and prophet of God. And the apostles were empowered by his 
 Spirit to make known his mind to us. And in the holy scriptures the 
 mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully revealed to 
 us. Observe, It is the great privilege of Christians that they have the 
 mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit.</P>
