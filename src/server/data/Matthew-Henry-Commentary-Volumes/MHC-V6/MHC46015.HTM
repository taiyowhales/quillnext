 In this chapter the apostle treats of that great article of 
 Christianity--the resurrection of the dead. 

 I. He establishes the certainty of our Saviour's resurrection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He, from this truth, sets himself to refute those who said, There
 is no resurrection of the dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>.

 III. From our Saviour's resurrection he establishes the resurrection of
 the dead and confirms the Corinthians in the belief of it by some other
 considerations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:20-34">ver. 20-34</A>.

 IV. He answers an objection against this truth, and takes occasion
 thence to show what a vast change will be made in the bodies of
 believers at the resurrection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:35-50">ver. 35-50</A>.

 V. He informs us what a change will be made in those who shall be 
 living at the sound of the last trumpet, and the complete conquest the 
 just shall then obtain over death and the grave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:51-57">ver. 51-57</A>.
 
 And,

 VI. He sums up the argument with a very serious exhortation to
 Christians, to be resolved and diligent in their Lord's service, 
 because they know they shall be so gloriously rewarded by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:58">ver. 58</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
 preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye
 stand;
 &nbsp; 2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I
 preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
 &nbsp; 3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
 received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
 scriptures;
 &nbsp; 4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
 according to the scriptures:
 &nbsp; 5  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
 &nbsp; 6  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
 once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some
 are fallen asleep.
 &nbsp; 7  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
 &nbsp; 8  And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of
 due time.
 &nbsp; 9  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
 called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
 &nbsp; 10  But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which
 <I>was bestowed</I> upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more
 abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which
 was with me.
 &nbsp; 11  Therefore whether <I>it were</I> I or they, so we preach, and so
 ye believed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the apostle's business in this chapter to assert and establish 
 the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which some of the
 Corinthians flatly denied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Whether they turned this doctrine into allegory, as did Hymeneus and 
 Philetus, by saying it was already past

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:17">2 Tim. ii. 17, 18</A>),

 and several of the ancient heretics, by making it mean no more than a 
 changing of their course of life; or whether they rejected it as 
 absurd, upon principles of reason and science; it seems they denied it 
 in the proper sense. And they disowned a future state of recompences, 
 by denying the resurrection of the dead. Now that heathens and infidels 
 should deny this truth does not seem so strange; but that Christians, 
 who had their religion by revelation, should deny a truth so plainly 
 discovered is surprising, especially when it is a truth of such 
 importance. It was time for the apostle to confirm them in this truth, 
 when the staggering of their faith in this point was likely to shake 
 their Christianity; and they were yet in great danger of having their 
 faith staggered. He begins with an epitome or summary of the gospel, 
 what he had preached among them, namely, the death and resurrection of 
 Christ. Upon this foundation the doctrine of the resurrection of the 
 dead is built. Note, Divine truths appear with greatest evidence when 
 they are looked upon in their mutual connection. The foundation may be
 strengthened, that the superstructure may be secured. Now concerning 
 the gospel observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What a stress he lays upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached 
 to you.</I> 

 1. It was what he constantly preached. His word was not yea and nay: he
 always preached the same gospel, and taught the same truth. He could
 appeal to his hearers for this. Truth is in its own nature invariable; 
 and the infallible teachers of divine truth could never be at variance 
 with themselves or one another. The doctrine which Paul had heretofore 
 taught, he still taught. 

 2. It was what they had received; they had been convinced of the faith,
 believed it in their hearts, or at least made profession of doing so 
 with their mouths. It was no strange doctrine. It was that very gospel 
 in which, or by which, they had hitherto stood, and must continue to 
 stand. If they gave up this truth, they left themselves no ground to 
 stand upon, no footing in religion. Note, The doctrine of Christ's
 death and resurrection is at the foundation of Christianity. Remove 
 this foundation, and the whole fabric falls, all our hopes for eternity 
 sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firmly that Christians 
 are made to stand in a day of trial, and kept faithful to God. 

 3. It was that alone by which they could hope for salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for there is <I>no salvation in any other name; no name given under 
 heaven by which we may be saved, but by the name of Christ.</I> And 
 there is no salvation in his name, but upon supposition of his death 
 and resurrection. These are the saving truths of our holy religion. The 
 crucifixion of our Redeemer and his conquest over death are the very 
 source of our spiritual life and hopes. Now concerning these saving 
 truths observe, 

 (1.) They must be retained in mind, they must be held fast (so the word
 is translated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:23">Heb. x. 23</A>):

 <I>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith.</I> Note, The saving 
 truths of the gospel must be fixed in our mind, revolved much in our 
 thoughts, and maintained and held fast to the end, if we would be 
 saved. They will not save us, if we do not attend to them, and yield to 
 their power, and continue to do so to the end. <I>He only that endureth 
 to the end shall be saved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22">Matt. x. 22</A>.

 (2.) We believe in vain, unless we continue and persevere in the faith
 of the gospel. We shall be never the better for a temporary faith; nay, 
 we shall aggravate our guilt by relapsing into infidelity. And in vain 
 is it to profess Christianity, or our faith in Christ, if we deny the 
 resurrection; for this must imply and involve the denial of his 
 resurrection; and, take away this, you make nothing of Christianity, 
 you leave nothing for faith or hope to fix upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Observe what this gospel is, on which the apostle lays such stress. 
 It was that doctrine which he had received, and delivered to them, 
 <B><I>en protois</I></B>--<I>among the first, the principal.</I> It was
 a doctrine of the first rank, a most necessary truth, That Christ died 
 for our sins, and was buried, and rose again: or, in other words, that 
 <I>he was delivered for our offences and rose again for our 
 justification</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25">Rom. iv. 25</A>),

 that he was offered in sacrifice for our sins, and rose again, to show 
 that he had procured forgiveness for them, and was accepted of God in 
 this offering. Note, Christ's death and resurrection are the very sum 
 and substance of evangelical truth. Hence we derive our spiritual life
 now, and here we must found our hopes of everlasting life 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe how this truth is confirmed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By Old-Testament predictions. He died for our sins, according to the 
 scriptures; he was buried, and rose from the dead, according to the 
 scriptures, according to the scripture-prophecies, and scripture-types.
 Such prophecies as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10,Isa+53:4-6,Da+9:26,27,Ho+6:2">Ps. xvi. 10; 
 Isa. liii. 4-6; Dan. ix. 26, 27; Hos. vi. 2</A>.
 
 Such scripture-types as Jonah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:4">Matt. xii. 4</A>),

 as Isaac, who is expressly said by the apostle to have been <I>received
 from the dead in a figure,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:9">Heb. xi. 19</A>.

 Note, It is a great confirmation of our faith of the gospel to see how
 it corresponds with ancient types and prophecies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By the testimony of many eye-witnesses, who saw Christ after he had 
 risen from the dead. He reckons up five several appearances, beside 
 that to himself. He <I>was seen of Cephas, or Peter, then of the 
 twelve,</I> called so, though Judas was no longer among them, because 
 this was their usual number; then he was <I>seen of above five hundred 
 brethren at once,</I> many of whom were living when the apostle wrote 
 this epistle, though some had fallen asleep. This was in Galilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:10">Matt. xxviii. 10</A>.

 After that, he was seen of James singly, and then by all the apostles
 when he was taken up into heaven. This was on mount Olivet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:50">Luke xxiv. 50</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:2,5-7">Acts i. 2, 5-7</A>.

 Note, How uncontrollably evident was Christ's resurrection from the
 dead, when so many eyes saw him at so many different times alive, and 
 when he indulged the weakness of one disciple so far as to let him 
 handle him, to put his resurrection out of doubt! And what reason have 
 we to believe those who were so steady in maintaining this truth, 
 though they hazarded all that was dear to them in this world, by 
 endeavouring to assert and propagate it! Even Paul himself was last of 
 all favoured with the sight of him. It was one of the peculiar offices 
 of an apostle to be a witness of our Saviour's resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:48">Luke xxiv. 48</A>);

 and, when Paul was called to the apostolical office, he was made an
 evidence of this sort; the Lord Jesus appeared to him by the way to 
 Damascus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:17">Acts ix. 17</A>.

 Having mentioned this favour, Paul takes occasion from it to make a
 humble digression concerning himself. He was highly favoured of God, 
 but he always endeavoured to keep up a mean opinion of himself, and to 
 express it. So he does here, by observing, 

 (1.) That he was <I>one born out of due time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 an abortive, <B><I>ektroma,</I></B> a child dead born, and out of time.
 Paul resembled such a birth, in the suddenness of his new birth, in 
 that he was not matured for the apostolic function, as the others were, 
 who had personal converse with our Lord. He was called to the office 
 when such conversation was not to be had, he was out of time for it. He 
 had not known nor followed the Lord, nor been formed in his family, as 
 the others were, for this high and honourable function. This was in 
 Paul's account a very humbling circumstance. 

 (2.) By owning himself inferior to the other apostles: <I>Not meet to 
 be called an apostle.</I> The least, because the last of them; called 
 latest to the office, and not worthy to be called an apostle, to have 
 either the office or the title, because he had been <I>a persecutor of 
 the church of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Indeed, he tells us elsewhere that he was <I>not a whit behind the very 
 chief apostles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5">2 Cor. xi. 5</A>)--

 for gifts, graces, service, and
 sufferings, inferior to none of them. Yet some circumstances in his 
 case made him think more meanly of himself than of any of them. Note, A 
 humble spirit, in the midst of high attainments, is a great ornament to 
 any man; it sets his good qualities off to much greater advantage. What 
 kept Paul low in an especial manner was the remembrance of his former 
 wickedness, his raging and destructive zeal against Christ and him 
 members. Note, How easily God can bring a good out of the greatest 
 evil! When sinners are by divine grace turned into saints, he makes the 
 remembrance of their former sins very serviceable, to make them humble, 
 and diligent, and faithful. 

 (3.) By ascribing all that was valuable in him to divine grace: <I>But 
 by the grace of God I am what I am,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is God's prerogative to say, <I>I am that I am;</I> it is our
 privilege to be able to say, "By God's grace we are what we are." We 
 are nothing but what God makes us, nothing in religion but what his 
 grace makes us. All that is good in us is a stream from this fountain.
 Paul was sensible of this, and kept humble and thankful by this 
 conviction; so should we. Nay, though he was conscious of his own 
 diligence, and zeal, and service, so that he could say of himself, 
 <I>the grace of God was not given him in vain, but he laboured more 
 abundantly than they all:</I> he thought himself so much more the 
 debtor to divine grace. <I>Yet not I, but the grace of God which was 
 with me.</I> Note, Those who have the grace of God bestowed on them 
 should take care that it be not in vain. They should cherish, and 
 exercise, and exert, this heavenly principle. So did Paul, and 
 therefore laboured with so much heart and so much success. And yet the 
 more he laboured, and the more good he did, the more humble he was in 
 his opinion of himself, and the more disposed to own and magnify the 
 favour of God towards him, his free and unmerited favour. Note, A 
 humble spirit will be very apt to own and magnify the grace of God. A 
 humble spirit is commonly a gracious one. Where pride is subdued there 
 it is reasonable to believe grace reigns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After this digression, the apostle returns to his argument, and tells 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 that he not only preached the same gospel himself at all times, and in 
 all places, but that all the apostles preached the same: <I>Whether it 
 were they or I, so we preached, and so you believed.</I> Whether Peter, 
 or Paul, or any other apostle, had converted them to Christianity, all 
 maintained the same truth, told the same story, preached the same 
 doctrine, and confirmed it by the same evidence. All agreed in this 
 that Jesus Christ, and him crucified and slain, and then rising from 
 the dead, was the very sum and substance of Christianity; and this all 
 true Christians believe. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; all 
 Christians agree in the belief of it. By this faith they live. In this 
 faith they die.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how
 say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
 &nbsp; 13  But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
 not risen:
 &nbsp; 14  And if Christ be not risen, then <I>is</I> our preaching vain,
 and your faith <I>is</I> also vain.
 &nbsp; 15  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we
 have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised
 not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
 &nbsp; 16  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
 &nbsp; 17  And if Christ be not raised, your faith <I>is</I> vain; ye are
 yet in your sins.
 &nbsp; 18  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are
 perished.
 &nbsp; 19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all
 men most miserable.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having confirmed the truth of our Saviour's resurrection, the apostle 
 goes on to refute those among the Corinthians who said there would be 
 none: <I>If Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some 
 among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It seems from this passage, and the course of the argument, there were 
 some among the Corinthians who thought the resurrection an 
 impossibility. This was a common sentiment among the heathens. But 
 against this the apostle produces an incontestable fact, namely, the 
 resurrection of Christ; and he goes on to argue against them from the 
 absurdities that must follow from their principle. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>If there be</I> (can be) <I>no resurrection of the dead, then 
 Christ has not risen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and again, "<I>If the dead rise not,</I> cannot be raised or recovered 
 to life, <I>then is Christ not raised,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And yet it was foretold in ancient prophecies that he should rise; and 
 it has been proved by multitudes of eye-witnesses that he had risen. 
 And will you say, will any among you dare to say, that is not, cannot 
 be, which God long ago said should be, and which is now undoubted 
 matter of fact?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It would follow hereupon that the preaching and faith of the gospel 
 would be vain: <I>If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, 
 and your faith vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This supposition admitted, would destroy the principal evidence of 
 Christianity; and so, 

 1. Make preaching vain. "<I>We</I> apostles should <I>be found false
 witnesses of God;</I> we pretend to be God's witnesses for truth, and 
 to work miracles by his power in confirmation of it, and are all the 
 while deceivers, liars for God, if in his name, and by power received 
 from him, we go forth, and publish and assert a thing false in fact, 
 and impossible to be true. And does not this make us the vainest men in 
 the world, and our office and ministry the vainest and most useless 
 thing in the world? What end could we propose to ourselves in 
 undertaking this hard and hazardous service, if we knew our religion 
 stood on no better foundation, nay, if we were not well assured of the 
 contrary? What should we preach for? Would not our labour be wholly in
 vain? We can have no very favourable expectations in this life; and we 
 could have none beyond it. If Christ be not raised, the gospel is a 
 jest; it is chaff and emptiness." 

 2. This supposition would make the faith of Christians vain, as well as
 the labours of ministers: <I>If Christ be not raised, your faith is 
 vain; you are yet in your sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 yet under the guilt and condemnation of sin, because it is through his 
 death and sacrifice for sin alone that forgiveness is to be had. <I>We 
 have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:7">Eph. i. 7</A>.

 No remission of sins is to be had but through the shedding of his
 blood. And had his blood been shed, and his life taken away, without 
 ever being restored, what evidence could we have had that through him 
 we should have justification and eternal life? Had he remained under 
 the power of death, how could he have delivered us from its power? And 
 how vain a thing is faith in him, upon this supposition! He must rise 
 for our justification who was delivered for our sins, or in vain we 
 look for any such benefit by him. There had been no justification nor 
 salvation if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ be 
 vain, and of no signification, if he be still among the dead?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another absurdity following from this supposition is that <I>those 
 who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</I> if there be no 
 resurrection, they cannot rise, and therefore are lost, even those who 
 have died in the Christian faith, and for it. It is plain from this 
 that those among the Corinthians who denied the resurrection meant 
 thereby a state of future retribution, and not merely the revival of 
 the flesh; they took death to be the destruction and extinction of the 
 man, and not merely of the bodily life; for otherwise the apostle could 
 not infer the utter loss of those who slept in Jesus, from the 
 supposition that they would never rise more or that they had no hopes 
 in Christ after life; for they might have hope of happiness for their 
 minds if these survived their bodies, and this would prevent the 
 limiting of their hopes in Christ to this life only. "Upon supposition 
 there is no resurrection in your sense, no after-state and life, then 
 dead Christians are quite lost. How vain a thing were our faith and 
 religion upon this supposition!" And this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Would infer that Christ's ministers and servants were <I>of all men 
 most miserable,</I> as having <I>hope in him in this life only</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which is another absurdity that would follow from asserting no 
 resurrection. Their condition who hope in Christ would be worse than 
 that of other men. <I>Who hope in Christ.</I> Note, All who believe in 
 Christ have hope in him; all who believe in him as a Redeemer hope for 
 redemption and salvation by him; but if there be no resurrection, or 
 state of future recompence (which was intended by those who denied the 
 resurrection at Corinth), their hope in him must be limited to this 
 life: and, if all their hopes in Christ lie within the compass of this 
 life, they are in a much worse condition than the rest of mankind, 
 especially at that time, and under those circumstances, in which the 
 apostles wrote; for then they had no countenance nor protection from 
 the rulers of the world, but were hated and persecuted by all men.
 Preachers and private Christians therefore had a hard lot if in this 
 life only they had hope in Christ. Better be any thing than a Christian 
 upon these terms; for in this world they are hated, and hunted, and 
 abused, stripped of all worldly comforts and exposed to all manner of 
 sufferings: they fare much harder than other men in this life, and yet 
 have no further nor better hopes. And is it not absurd for one who 
 believes in Christ to admit a principle that involves so absurd an 
 inference? Can that man have faith in Christ who can believe concerning 
 him that he will leave his faithful servants, whether ministers or 
 others, in a worse state than his enemies? Note, It were a gross 
 absurdity in a Christian to admit the supposition of no resurrection or 
 future state. It would leave no hope beyond this world, and would 
 frequently make his condition the worst in the world. Indeed, the 
 Christian is by his religion crucified to this world, and taught to 
 live upon the hope of another. Carnal pleasures are insipid to him in a 
 great degree; and spiritual and heavenly pleasures are those which he 
 affects and pants after. How sad is his case indeed, if he must be dead 
 to worldly pleasures and yet never hope for any better!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  But now is Christ risen from the dead, <I>and</I> become the
 firstfruits of them that slept.
 &nbsp; 21  For since by man <I>came</I> death, by man <I>came</I> also the
 resurrection of the dead.
 &nbsp; 22  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
 alive.
 &nbsp; 23  But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
 afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.
 &nbsp; 24  Then <I>cometh</I> the end, when he shall have delivered up the
 kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all
 rule and all authority and power.
 &nbsp; 25  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
 feet.
 &nbsp; 26  The last enemy <I>that</I> shall be destroyed <I>is</I> death.
 &nbsp; 27  For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
 all things are put under <I>him, it is</I> manifest that he is
 excepted, which did put all things under him.
 &nbsp; 28  And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall
 the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things
 under him, that God may be all in all.
 &nbsp; 29  Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if
 the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the
 dead?
 &nbsp; 30  And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
 &nbsp; 31  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
 Lord, I die daily.
 &nbsp; 32  If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
 Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat
 and drink; for to morrow we die.
 &nbsp; 33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
 &nbsp; 34  Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
 knowledge of God: I speak <I>this</I> to your shame.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle establishes the truth of the resurrection 
 of the dead, the holy dead, the dead in Christ,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. On the resurrection of Christ. 

 1. Because he is indeed <I>the first-fruits of those that slept,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He has truly risen himself, and he has risen in this very quality and 
 character, as the first-fruits of those who sleep in him. As he has 
 assuredly risen, so in his resurrection there is as much an earnest 
 given that the dead in him shall rise as there was that the Jewish 
 harvest in general should be accepted and blessed by the offering and 
 acceptance of the first-fruits. The whole lump was made holy by the 
 consecration of the first-fruits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:16">Rom. xi. 16</A>),

 and the whole body of Christ, all that are by faith united to him, are 
 by his resurrection assured of their own. As he has risen, they shall
 rise; just as the lump is holy because the first fruits are so. He has 
 not risen merely for himself, but as head of the body, the church; and 
 <I>those that sleep in him God will bring with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:14">1 Thess. iv. 14</A>.
 
 Note, Christ's resurrection is a pledge and
 earnest of ours, if we are true believers in him; because he has risen,
 we shall rise. We are a part of the consecrated lump, and shall partake
 of the acceptance and favour vouchsafed the first-fruits. This is the
 first argument used by the apostle in confirmation of the truth; and it
 is, 

 2. Illustrated by a parallel between the first and second Adam. For,
 since by man came death, it was every way proper that by man should
 come deliverance from it, or, which is all one, a resurrection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And so, <I>as in Adam all die, in Christ shall all be made alive;</I>
 as through the sin of the first Adam all men became mortal, because all 
 derived from him the same sinful nature, so through the merit and 
 resurrection of Christ shall all who are made to partake of the Spirit, 
 and the spiritual nature, revive, and become immortal. All who die die 
 through the sin of Adam; all who are raised, in the sense of the 
 apostle, rise through the merit and power of Christ. But the meaning is 
 not that, as all men died in Adam, so all men, without exception, shall 
 be made alive in Christ; for the scope of the apostle's argument 
 restrains the general meaning. Christ rose as the first-fruits; 
 therefore <I>those that are Christ's</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 shall rise too. Hence it will not follow that all men without exception 
 shall rise too; but it will fitly follow that all who thus rise, rise 
 in virtue of Christ's resurrection, and so that their revival is owing 
 to the man Christ Jesus, as the mortality of all mankind was owing to 
 the first man; and so, as by man came death, by man came deliverance. 
 Thus it seemed fit to the divine wisdom that, as the first Adam ruined 
 his posterity by sin, the second Adam should raise his seed to a 
 glorious immortality.

 3. Before he leaves the argument he states that there will be an order
 observed in their resurrection. What that precisely will be we are 
 nowhere told, but in the general only here that there will be order 
 observed. Possibly those may rise first who have held the highest rank, 
 and done the most eminent service, or suffered the most grievous evils, 
 or cruel deaths, for Christ's sake. It is only here said that the
 first-fruits are supposed to rise first, and afterwards all who are 
 Christ's, when he shall come again. Not that Christ's resurrection must 
 in fact go before the resurrection of any of his, but it must be laid 
 as the foundation: as it was not necessary that those who lived remote 
 from Jerusalem must go thither and offer the first-fruits before they 
 could account the lump holy, yet they must be set apart for this 
 purpose, till they could be offered, which might be done at any time 
 from pentecost till the feast of dedication. See Bishop Patrick on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:2">Num. xxiv. 2</A>.

 The offering of the first-fruits was what made the lump holy; and the
 lump was made holy by this offering, though it was not made before the 
 harvest was gathered in, so it were set apart for that end, and duly 
 offered afterwards. So Christ's resurrection must, in order of nature, 
 precede that of his saints, though some of these might rise in order of 
 time before him. It is because he has risen that they rise. Note,
 Those that are Christ's must rise, because of their relation to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He argues from the continuance of the mediatorial kingdom till all 
 Christ's enemies are destroyed, the last of which is death, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.
 
 He has risen, and, upon his resurrection, was invested with sovereign
 empire, <I>had all power in heaven and earth put into his hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18">Matt. xxviii. 18</A>),

 <I>had a name given him above every name, that every knee might bow to
 him, and every tongue confess him Lord.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:9-11">Phil. ii. 9-11</A>.
 
 And the administration of this kingdom must continue in his hands till
 all opposing <I>power, and rule, and authority, be put down</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>till all enemies are put under his feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and <I>till the last enemy is destroyed,</I> which is death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This argument implies in it all these particulars:--

 (1.) That our Saviour rose from the dead to have all power put into his
 hands, and have and administer a kingdom, as Mediator: <I>For this end 
 he died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead 
 and living,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:9">Rom. xiv. 9</A>.

 (2.) That this mediatorial kingdom is to have an end, at least as far
 as it is concerned in bringing his people safely to glory, and subduing 
 all his and their enemies: <I>Then cometh the end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 (3.) That it is not to have an end till all opposing power be put down, 
 and all enemies brought to his feet, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 (4.) That, among other enemies, death must be destroyed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 or abolished; its powers over its members must be disannulled. Thus far 
 the apostle is express; but he leaves us to make the inference that 
 therefore the saints must rise, else death and the grave would have 
 power over them, nor would our Saviour's kingly power prevail against 
 the last enemy of his people and annul its power. When saints shall 
 live again, and die no more, then, and not till then, will death be 
 abolished, which must be brought about before our Saviour's mediatorial 
 kingdom is delivered up, which yet must be in due time. The saints 
 therefore shall live again and die no more. This is the scope of the 
 argument; but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle drops several hints in the course of it which it will be 
 proper to notice: as, 

 (1.) That our Saviour, as man and mediator between God and man, has a 
 delegated royalty, a kingdom given: <I>All things are put under him, he 
 excepted that did put all things under him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 As man, all his authority must be delegated. And, though his mediation 
 supposes his divine nature, yet as Mediator he does not so explicitly 
 sustain the character of God, but a middle person between God and man, 
 partaking of both natures, human and divine, as he was to reconcile 
 both parties, God and man, and receiving commission and authority from 
 God the Father to act in this office. The Father appears, in this whole 
 dispensation, in the majesty and with the authority of God: the Son, 
 made man, appears as the minister of the Father, though he is God as 
 well as the Father. Nor is this passage to be understood of the eternal 
 dominion over all his creatures which belongs to him as God, but of a 
 kingdom committed to him as Mediator and God-man, and that chiefly 
 after his resurrection, when, having overcome, he sat down with his 
 Father on his throne,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>.

 Then was the prediction verified, <I>I have set my king upon my holy 
 hill of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>),

 placed him on his throne. This is meant by the phrase so frequent in
 the writings of the New Testament, of <I>sitting at the right hand of
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:19,Ro+8:34,Col+3:1">Mark xvi. 19; 
 Rom. viii. 34; Col. iii. 1</A>,

 &c.),
 <I>on the right hand of power</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:62,Lu+22:69">Mark xiv. 62; Luke xxii. 69</A>),

 <I>on the right hand of the throne of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>),

 <I>on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1">Heb. viii. 1</A>.

 Sitting down in this seat is taking upon him the exercise of his 
 mediatorial power and royalty, which was done upon his ascension into 
 heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:19">Mark xvi. 19</A>.

 And it is spoken of in scripture as a recompence made him for his deep 
 humiliation and self-abasement, in becoming man, and dying for man the 
 accursed death of the cross,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6-12">Phil. ii. 6-12</A>.

 Upon his ascension, he was made head over all things to the church, had
 power given him to govern and protect it against all its enemies, and 
 in the end destroy them and complete the salvation of all that believe 
 in him. This is not a power appertaining to Godhead as such; it is not 
 original and unlimited power, but power given and limited to special 
 purposes. And though he who has it is God, yet, inasmuch as he is 
 somewhat else besides God, and in this whole dispensation acts not as 
 God, but as Mediator, not as the offended Majesty, but as one 
 interposing in favour of his offending creatures, and this by virtue of 
 his consent and commission who acts and appears always in that 
 character, he may properly be said to have this power given him; he may 
 reign as God, with power unlimited, and yet may reign as Mediator, with 
 a power delegated, and limited to these particular purposes. 

 (2.) That this delegated royalty must at length <I>be delivered up to 
 the Father,</I> from whom it was received 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 for it is a power received for particular ends and purposes, a power to 
 govern and protect his church till all the members of it be gathered 
 in, and the enemies of it for ever subdued and destroyed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),
 
 and when these ends shall be obtained the power and authority will not 
 need to be continued. The Redeemer must reign till his enemies be 
 destroyed, and the salvation of his church and people accomplished; 
 and, when this end is attained, then will he deliver up the power which 
 he had only for this purpose, though he may continue to reign over his 
 glorified church and body in heaven; and in this sense it may 
 notwithstanding be said that <I>he shall reign for ever and ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Rev. xi. 15</A>),

 <I>that he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his 
 kingdom there shall be no end</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:33">Luke i. 33</A>),

 <I>that his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:14">Dan. vii. 14</A>.
 
 See also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:7">Mich. iv. 7</A>.

 (3.) The Redeemer shall certainly reign till the last enemy of his
 people be destroyed, till death itself be abolished, till his saints 
 revive and recover perfect life, never to be in fear and danger of 
 dying any more. He shall have all power in heaven and earth till 
 then--<I>he who loved us, and gave himself for us, and washed us from 
 our sins in his own blood</I>--he who is so nearly related to us, and 
 so much concerned for us. What support should this be to his saints in 
 every hour of distress and temptation! <I>He is alive who was dead, and 
 liveth for ever,</I> and doth reign, and will continue to reign, till 
 the redemption of his people be completed, and the utter ruin of their 
 enemies effected. 

 (4.) When this is done, <I>and all things are put under his feet, then 
 shall the Son become subject to him that put all things under him, that 
 God may be all in all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The meaning of this I take to be that then the man Christ Jesus, who 
 hath appeared in so much majesty during the whole administration of his 
 kingdom, shall appear upon giving it up to be a subject of the Father.
 Things are in scripture many times said <I>to be</I> when they are 
 <I>manifested</I> and <I>made to appear;</I> and this delivering up of 
 the kingdom will make it manifest that he who appeared in the majesty 
 of the sovereign king was, during this administration, a subject of 
 God. The glorified humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all the 
 dignity and power conferred on it, was no more than a glorious 
 creature. This will appear when the kingdom shall be delivered up; and 
 it will appear to the divine glory, that God may be all in all, that 
 the accomplishment of our salvation may appear altogether divine, and 
 God alone may have the honour of it. Note, Though the human nature must 
 be employed in the work of our redemption, yet God was all in all in 
 it. <I>It was the Lord's doing and should be marvellous in our 
 eyes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He argues for the resurrection, from the case of those who were 
 baptized for the dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>What shall those do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise 
 not at all? Why are they baptized for the dead?</I> What shall they do 
 if the dead rise not? What have they done? How vain a thing hath their 
 baptism been! Must they stand by it, or renounce it? why are they 
 baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? <B><I>hyper ton 
 nekron.</I></B> But what is this baptism for the dead? It is necessary 
 to be known, that the apostle's argument may be understood; whether it 
 be only <I>argumentum ad hominem,</I> or <I>ad rem;</I> that is, 
 whether it conclude for the thing in dispute universally, or only 
 against the particular persons who were baptized for the dead. But who 
 shall interpret this very obscure passage, which, though it consists of 
 no more than three words, besides the articles, has had more than three 
 times three senses put on it by interpreters? It is not agreed what is
 meant by baptism, whether it is to be taken in a proper or figurative 
 sense, and, if in a proper sense, whether it is to be understood or 
 Christian baptism properly so called, or some other ablution. And as 
 little is it agreed who are the dead, or in what sense the preposition 
 <B><I>hyper</I></B> is to be taken. Some understand the dead of our 
 Saviour himself; <I>vide</I> Whitby <I>in loc.</I> Why are persons 
 baptized in the name of a dead Saviour, a Saviour who remains among the 
 dead, if the dead rise not? But it is, I believe, and instance 
 perfectly singular for <B><I>hoi nekroi</I></B> to mean no more than 
 one dead person; it is a signification which the words have nowhere 
 else. And the <B><I>hoi baptizomenoi</I></B> (<I>the baptized</I>) seem 
 plainly to mean some particular persons, not Christians in general, 
 which yet must be the signification if the <B><I>hoi nekroi</I></B> 
 (<I>the dead</I>) be understood of our Saviour. Some understand the 
 passage of the martyrs: Why do they suffer martyrdom for their 
 religion? This is sometimes called the baptism of blood by ancients, 
 and, by our Saviour himself, baptism indefinitely,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22,Lu+12:50">Matt. xx. 22; Luke xii. 50</A>.

 But in what sense can those who die martyrs for their religion be said
 to be baptized (that is, die martyrs) for the dead? Some understand it 
 of a custom that was observed, as some of the ancients tell us, among 
 many who professed the Christian name in the first ages, of baptizing 
 some in the name and stead of catechumens dying without baptism. But 
 this savoured of such superstition that, if the custom had prevailed in 
 the church so soon, the apostle would hardly have mentioned it without 
 signifying a dislike of it. Some understand it of baptizing over the 
 dead, which was a custom, they tell us, that early obtained; and this 
 to testify their hope of the resurrection. This sense is pertinent to 
 the apostle's argument, but it appears not that any such practice was 
 in use in the apostle's time. Others understand it of those who have
 been baptized for the sake, or on occasion, of the martyrs, that is, 
 the constancy with which they died for their religion. Some were 
 doubtless converted to Christianity by observing this: and it would 
 have been a vain thing for persons to have become Christians upon this 
 motive, if the martyrs, by losing their lives for religion, became 
 utterly extinct, and were to live no more. But the church at Corinth 
 had not, in all probability, suffered much persecution at this time, or 
 seem many instances of martyrdom among them, nor had many converts been 
 made by the constancy and firmness which the martyrs discovered. Not to 
 observe that <B><I>hoi nekroi</I></B> seems to be too general an 
 expression to mean only the martyred dead. It is as easy an explication 
 of the phrase as any I have met with, and as pertinent to the argument, 
 to suppose the <B><I>hoi nekroi</I></B> to mean some among the 
 Corinthians, who had been taken off by the hand of God. We read that 
 <I>many were sickly among them, and many slept</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:30"><I>ch.</I> xi. 30</A>),

 because of their disorderly behaviour at the Lord's table. These
 executions might terrify some into Christianity; as the miraculous 
 earthquake did the jailer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:29,30">Acts xvi. 29, 30</A>,

 &c. Persons baptized on such an occasion might be properly said to be
 baptized for the dead, that is, on their account. And the <B><I>hoi 
 baptizomenoi</I></B> (<I>the baptized</I>) and the <B><I>hoi 
 nekroi</I></B> (<I>the dead</I>) answer to one another; and upon this 
 supposition the Corinthians could not mistake the apostle's meaning.
 "Now," says he, "what shall they do, and why were they baptized, if the 
 dead rise not? You have a general persuasion that these men have done 
 right, and acted wisely, and as they ought, on this occasion; but why, 
 if the dead rise not, seeing they may perhaps hasten their death, by 
 provoking a jealous God, and have no hopes beyond it?" But whether this 
 be the meaning, or whatever else be, doubtless the apostle's argument 
 was good and intelligible to the Corinthians. And his next is as plain 
 to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He argues from the absurdity of his own conduct and that of other 
 Christians upon this supposition,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It would be a foolish thing for them to run so many hazards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 "<I>Why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</I> Why do we expose ourselves 
 to continual peril--we Christians, especially we apostles?" Every one
 knows that it was dangerous being a Christian, and much more a preacher 
 and an apostle, at that time. "Now," says the apostle, "what fools are 
 we to run these hazards, if we have no better hopes beyond death, if 
 when we die we die wholly, and revive no more!" Note, Christianity were 
 a foolish profession if it proposed no hopes beyond this life, at least 
 in such hazardous times as attended the first profession of it; it 
 required men to risk all the blessings and comforts of this life, and 
 to face and endure all the evils of it, without any future prospects. 
 And is this a character of his religion fit for a Christian to endure? 
 And must he not fix this character on it if he give up his future 
 hopes, and deny the resurrection of the dead? This argument the apostle 
 brings home to himself: "<I>I protest,</I>" says he, "<I>by your 
 rejoicing in Jesus Christ,</I> by all the comforts of Christianity, and 
 all the peculiar succours and supports of our holy faith, that <I>I die 
 daily,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 He was in continual danger of death, and carried his life, as we say, 
 in his hand. And why should he thus expose himself, if he had no hopes 
 after life? To live in daily view and expectation of death, and yet 
 have no prospect beyond it, must be very heartless and uncomfortable, 
 and his case, upon this account, a very melancholy one. He had need be
 very well assured of the resurrection of the dead, or he was guilty of 
 extreme weakness, in hazarding all that was dear to him in this world, 
 and his life into the bargain. He had encountered very great 
 difficulties and fierce enemies; he had <I>fought with beasts at 
 Ephesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 and was in danger of being pulled to pieces by an enraged multitude, 
 stirred up by Demetrius and the other craftsmen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:24">Acts xix. 24</A>,

 &c.), though some understand this literally of Paul's being exposed to
 fight with wild beasts in the amphitheatre, at a Roman show in that 
 city. And Nicephorus tells a formal story to this purport, and of the 
 miraculous complaisance of the lions to him when they came near him. 
 But so remarkable a trial and circumstance of his life, methinks, would 
 not have been passed over by Luke, and much less by himself, when he 
 gives us so large and particular a detail of his sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:24">2 Cor. xi. 24</A>,

 <I>ad fin.</I> When he mentioned that he was five times scourged of the
 Jews, thrice beaten with rods, once stoned, thrice shipwrecked, it is 
 strange that he should not have said that he was once exposed to fight 
 with the beasts. I take it, therefore, that this fighting with beasts 
 is a figurative expression, that the beasts intended were men of a 
 fierce and ferine disposition, and that this refers to the passage 
 above cited. "Now," says he, "what advantage have I from such contests, 
 if the dead rise not? Why should I die daily, expose myself daily to 
 the danger of dying by violent hands, if the dead rise not? And if 
 <I>post mortem nihil</I>--<I>if I am to perish by death,</I> and expect 
 nothing after it, could any thing be more weak?" Was Paul so senseless?
 Had he given the Corinthians any ground to entertain such a thought of 
 him? If he had not been well assured that death would have been to his 
 advantage, would he, in this stupid manner, have thrown away his life?
 Could any thing but the sure hopes of a better life after death have 
 extinguished the love of life in him to this degree? "<I>What 
 advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?</I> What can I propose to 
 myself?" Note, It is very lawful and fit for a Christian to propose 
 advantage to himself by his fidelity to God. Thus did Paul. Thus did 
 our blessed Lord himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 And thus we are bidden to do after his example, and have our fruit to
 holiness, that our end may be everlasting life. This is the very end of 
 our faith, even the salvation of our souls

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:9">1 Pet. i. 9</A>),

 not only what it will issue in, but what we should aim at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It would be a much wiser thing to take the comforts of this life: 
 <I>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 let us turn epicures. Thus this sentence means in the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:13">Isa. xxii. 13</A>.

 Let us even live like beasts, if we must die like them. This would be a 
 wiser course, if there were no resurrection, no after-life or state, 
 than to abandon all the pleasures of life, and offer and expose 
 ourselves to all the miseries of life, and live in continual peril of 
 perishing by savage rage and cruelty. This passage also plainly 
 implies, as I have hinted above, that those who denied the resurrection 
 among the Corinthians were perfect Sadducees, of whose principles we 
 have this account in the holy writings, that they say, <I>There is no 
 resurrection, neither angel nor spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:8">Acts xxiii. 8</A>),

 that is, "Man is all body, there is nothing in him to survive the body, 
 nor will that, when once he is dead, ever revive again." Such Sadducees 
 were the men against whom the apostle argued; otherwise his arguments 
 had no force in them; for, though the body should never revive, yet, as 
 long as the mind survived it, he might have much advantage from all the 
 hazards he ran for Christ's sake. Nay, it is certain that the mind is 
 to be the principal seat and subject of the heavenly glory and 
 happiness. But, if there were no hopes after death, would not every 
 wise man prefer an easy comfortable life before such a wretched one as 
 the apostle led; nay, and endeavour to enjoy the comforts of life as 
 fast as possible, because the continuance of it is short? Note, Nothing 
 but the hopes of better things hereafter can enable a man to forego all 
 the comforts and pleasures here, and embrace poverty, contempt, misery, 
 and death. Thus did the apostles and primitive Christians; but how 
 wretched was their case, and how foolish their conduct, if they 
 deceived themselves, and abused the world with vain and false 
 hopes!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The apostle closes his argument with a caution, exhortation, and 
 reproof. 

 1. A caution against the dangerous conversation of bad men, men of
 loose lives and principles: <I>Be not deceived,</I> says he; <I>evil 
 communications corrupt good manners,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Possibly, some of those who said that there was no resurrection of the 
 dead were men of loose lives, and endeavoured to countenance their 
 vicious practices by so corrupt a principle; and had that speech often 
 in their mouths <I>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</I> Now, 
 the apostle grants that their talk was to the purpose if there was no 
 future state. But, having confuted their principle, he now warns the
 Corinthians how dangerous such men's conversation must prove. He tells 
 them that they would probably be corrupted by them, and fall in with 
 their course of life, if they gave into their evil principles. Note, 
 Bad company and conversation are likely to make bad men. Those who 
 would keep their innocence must keep good company. Error and vice are 
 infectious: and, if we would avoid the contagion, we must keep clear of 
 those who have taken it. <I>He that walketh with wise men shall be 
 wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:20">Prov. xiii. 20</A>.

 2. Here is an exhortation to break off their sins, and rouse 
 themselves, and lead a more holy and righteous life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Awake to righteousness,</I> or <I>awake righteously,</I> 
 <B><I>eknepsate dikaios,</I></B> <I>and sin not,</I> or sin no more. 
 "Rouse yourselves, break off your sins by repentance: renounce and 
 forsake every evil way, correct whatever is amiss, and do not, by sloth 
 and stupidity, be led away into such conversation and principles as 
 will sap your Christian hopes, and corrupt your practice." The 
 disbelief of a future state destroys all virtue and piety. But the best 
 improvement to be made of the truth is to cease from sin, and set 
 ourselves to the business of religion, and that in good earnest. If 
 there will be a resurrection and a future life, we should live and act 
 as those who believe it, and should not give into such senseless and 
 sottish notions as will debauch our morals, and render us loose and 
 sensual in our lives. 

 3. Here is a reproof, and a sharp one, to some at least among them:
 <I>Some of you have not the knowledge of God; I speak this to your 
 shame.</I> Note, It is a shame in Christians not to have the knowledge 
 of God. The Christian religion gives the best information that can be 
 had about God, his nature, and grace, and government. Those who profess 
 this religion reproach themselves, by remaining without the knowledge 
 of God; for it must be owing to their own sloth, and slight of God, 
 that they are ignorant of him. And is it not a horrid shame for a 
 Christian to slight God, and be so wretchedly ignorant in matters that 
 so nearly and highly concern him? Note, also, It must be ignorance of 
 God that leads men into the disbelief of a resurrection and future 
 life. Those who know God know that he will not abandon his faithful 
 servants, nor leave them exposed to such hardships and sufferings 
 without any recompence or reward. They know he is not unfaithful nor 
 unkind, to forget their labour and patience, their faithful services 
 and cheerful sufferings, or let their <I>labour be in vain.</I> But I 
 am apt to think that the expression has a much stronger meaning; that 
 there were atheistical people among them who hardly owned a God, or one 
 who had any concern with or took cognizance of human affairs. These 
 were indeed a scandal and shame to any Christian church. Note, Real 
 atheism lies at the bottom of men's disbelief of a future state. Those 
 who own a God and a providence, and observe how unequal the 
 distributions of the present life are, and how frequently the best men 
 fare worst, can hardly doubt an after state, where every thing will be 
 set to rights.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  But some <I>man</I> will say, How are the dead raised up? and
 with what body do they come?
 &nbsp; 36  <I>Thou</I> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except
 it die:
 &nbsp; 37  And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
 shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some
 other <I>grain:</I>
 &nbsp; 38  But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to
 every seed his own body.
 &nbsp; 39  All flesh <I>is</I> not the same flesh: but <I>there is</I> one <I>kind
 of</I> flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,
 <I>and</I> another of birds.
 &nbsp; 40  <I>There are</I> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial:
 but the glory of the celestial <I>is</I> one, and the <I>glory</I> of the
 terrestrial <I>is</I> another.
 &nbsp; 41  <I>There is</I> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
 moon, and another glory of the stars: for <I>one</I> star differeth
 from <I>another</I> star in glory.
 &nbsp; 42  So also <I>is</I> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
 corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
 &nbsp; 43  It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown
 in weakness; it is raised in power:
 &nbsp; 44  It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
 There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
 &nbsp; 45  And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
 soul; the last Adam <I>was made</I> a quickening spirit.
 &nbsp; 46  Howbeit that <I>was</I> not first which is spiritual, but that
 which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
 &nbsp; 47  The first man <I>is</I> of the earth, earthy: the second man <I>is</I>
 the Lord from heaven.
 &nbsp; 48  As <I>is</I> the earthy, such <I>are</I> they also that are earthy:
 and as <I>is</I> the heavenly, such <I>are</I> they also that are heavenly.
 &nbsp; 49  And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
 bear the image of the heavenly.
 &nbsp; 50  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
 inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit
 incorruption.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle comes now to answer a plausible and principal objection 
 against the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, concerning which 
 observe the proposal of the objection: <I>Some man will say, How are 
 the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The objection is plainly two-fold. <I>How are they raised up?</I> that 
 is, "By what means? How can they be raised? What power is equal to this 
 effect?" It was an opinion that prevailed much among the heathens, and 
 the Sadducees seem to have been in the same sentiment, that it was not 
 within the compass of divine power, <I>mortales &aelig;ternitate 
 donare, aut revocare defunctos--to make mortal men immortal, or revive 
 and restore the dead.</I> Such sort of men those seem to have been who 
 among the Corinthians denied the resurrection of the dead, and object 
 here, "How are they raised? How should they be raised? Is it not 
 utterly impossible?" The other part of the objection is about the 
 quality of their bodies, who shall rise: "<I>With what body will they 
 come?</I> Will it be with the same body, with like shape, and form, and 
 stature, and members, and qualities, or various?" The former objection 
 is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter the enquiry of 
 curious doubters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To the former the apostle replies by telling them this was to be 
 brought about by divine power, that very power which they had all 
 observed to do something very like it, year after year, in the death 
 and revival of the corn; and therefore it was an argument of great 
 weakness and stupidity to doubt whether the resurrection of the dead 
 might not be effected by the same power: <I>Thou fool! that which thou 
 sowest is not quickened unless it die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 It must first corrupt, before it will quicken and spring up. It not 
 only sprouts after it is dead, but it must die that it may live. And 
 why should any be so foolish as to imagine that the man once dead 
 cannot be made to live again, by the same power which every year brings 
 the dead grain to life? This is the substance of the apostle's answer 
 to the first question. Note, It is a foolish thing to question the 
 divine power to raise the dead, when we see it every day quickening and 
 reviving things that are dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But he is longer in replying to the second enquiry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He begins by observing that there is a change made in the grain that 
 is sown: It is <I>not that body which shall be</I> that is sown, but 
 <I>bare grain,</I> of wheat or barley, &c.; but God gives it such a 
 body as he will, and in such way as he will, only so as to distinguish 
 the kinds from each other. Every seed sown has its <I>proper body,</I> 
 is constituted of such materials, and figured in such a manner, as are 
 proper to it, proper to that kind. This is plainly in the divine power, 
 though we no more know how it is done than we know how a dead man is 
 raised to life again. It is certain the grain undergoes a great change, 
 and it is intimated in this passage that so will the dead, when they 
 rise again, and live again, in their bodies, after death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He proceeds hence to observe that there is a great deal of variety 
 among others bodies, as there is among plants: as, 

 (1.) In bodies of flesh: <I>All flesh is not the same;</I> that of men 
 is of one kind, that of beasts another, another that of fishes, and 
 that of birds another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 There is a variety in all the kinds, and somewhat peculiar in every 
 kind, to distinguish it from the other.

 (2.) In bodies celestial and terrestrial there is also a difference; 
 and what is for the glory of one is not for the other; for the true 
 glory of every being consists in its fitness for its rank and state. 
 Earthly bodies are not adapted to the heavenly regions, nor heavenly 
 bodies fitted to the condition of earthly beings. Nay, 

 (3.) There is a variety of glory among heavenly bodies themselves: 
 <I>There is one glory of the sun, and another of the moon, and another 
 of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 All this is to intimate to us that the bodies of the dead, when they 
 rise, will be so far changed, that they will be fitted for the heavenly 
 regions, and that there will be a variety of glories among the bodies 
 of the dead, when they shall be raised, as there is among the sun, and 
 moon, and stars, nay among the stars themselves. All this carries an 
 intimation along with it that it must be as easy to divine power to 
 raise the dead, and recover their mouldered bodies, as out of the same 
 materials to form so many different kinds of flesh and plants, and, for 
 aught we know, celestial bodies as well as terrestrial ones. The sun
 and stars may, for aught we know, be composed of the same materials as 
 the earth we tread on, though as much refined and changed by the divine 
 skill and power. And can he, out of the same materials, form such 
 various beings, and yet not be able to raise the dead? Having thus 
 prepared the way, he comes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To speak directly to the point: <I>So also,</I> says he, <I>is the 
 resurrection of the dead;</I> so (as the plant growing out of the 
 putrefied grain), so as no longer to be a terrestrial but a celestial 
 body, and varying in glory from the other dead, who are raised, as one 
 star does from another. But he specifies some particulars: as, 

 (1.) <I>It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is 
 sown.</I> Burying the dead is like sowing them; it is like committing 
 the seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again. And our 
 bodies, which are sown, are corruptible, liable to putrefy and moulder, 
 and crumble to dust; but, when we rise, they will be out of the power 
 of the grave, and never more be liable to corruption. 

 (2.) <I>It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory.</I> Ours is at 
 present a vile body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21">Phil. iii. 21</A>.

 Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body; it is thrown into the grave 
 as a despised and broken vessel, in which there is no pleasure. But at 
 the resurrection a glory will be put upon it; it will be made like the 
 glorious body of our Saviour; it will be purged from all the dregs of 
 earth, and refined into an ethereal substance, and shine out with a 
 splendour resembling his. 

 (3.) <I>It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</I> It is laid 
 in the earth, a poor helpless thing, wholly in the power of death, 
 deprived of all vital capacities and powers, of life and strength: it 
 is utterly unable to move or stir. But when we arise our bodies will 
 have heavenly life and vigour infused into them; they will be hale, and 
 firm, and durable, and lively, and liable no more to any infirmity, 
 weakness, or decay.

 (4.) <I>It is sown a natural,</I> or <I>animal</I> body, <B><I>soma 
 psychikon,</I></B> a body fitted to the low condition and sensitive 
 pleasures and enjoyments of this life, which are all gross in 
 comparison of the heavenly state and enjoyments. But when we rise it 
 will be quite otherwise; our body will rise spiritual. Not that body 
 would be changed into spirit: this would be a contradiction in our 
 common conceptions; it would be as much as to say, Body changed into 
 what is not body, matter made immaterial. The expression is to be
 understood comparatively. We shall at the resurrection have bodies 
 purified and refined to the last degree, made light and agile; and, 
 though they are not changed into spirit, yet made fit to be perpetual 
 associates of spirits made perfect. And why should it not be as much in 
 the power of God to raise incorruptible, glorious, lively, spiritual 
 bodies, out of the ruins of those vile, corruptible, lifeless, and 
 animal ones, as first to make matter out of nothing, and then, out of 
 the same mass of matter, produce such variety of beings, both in earth 
 and heaven? <I>To God all things are possible;</I> and this cannot be 
 impossible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He illustrates this by a comparison of the first and second Adam: 
 <I>There is an animal body,</I> says he, <I>and there is a spiritual 
 body;</I> and then goes into the comparison in several instances. 

 (1.) As we have our natural body, the animal body we have in this 
 world, from the first Adam, we expect our spiritual body from the 
 second. This is implied in the whole comparison. 

 (2.) This is but consonant to the different characters these two 
 persons bear: <I>The first Adam was made a living soul,</I> such a 
 being as ourselves, and with a power of propagating such beings as 
 himself, and conveying to them a nature and animal body like his own, 
 but none other, nor better. The <I>second Adam is a quickening
 Spirit;</I> he is the resurrection and the life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:25">John xi. 25</A>.
 
 He hath life in himself, and quickeneth whom he will,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:20,21">John v. 20, 21</A>.

 <I>The first man was of the earth,</I> made out of the earth, and was
 earthy; his body was fitted to the region of his abode: <I>but the 
 second Adam is the Lord from heaven;</I> he who came down from heaven, 
 and giveth life to the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33">John vi. 33</A>);

 he who came down from heaven and was in heaven at the same time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13">John iii. 13</A>);

 the Lord of heaven and earth. If the first Adam could communicate to us
 natural and animal bodies, cannot the second Adam make our bodies 
 spiritual ones? If the deputed lord of this lower creation could do
 the one, cannot the Lord from heaven, the Lord of heaven and earth, do 
 the other? 

 (3.) We must first have natural bodies from the first Adam before we 
 can have spiritual bodies from the second 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>);

 we <I>must bear the image of the earthy before we can bear the image of 
 the heavenly.</I> Such is the established order of Providence. We must 
 have weak, frail, mortal bodies by descent from the first Adam, before 
 we can have lively, spiritual, and immortal ones by the quickening 
 power of the second. We must die before we can live to die no more. 
 
 (4.) Yet if we are Christ's, true believers in him (for this whole
 discourse relates to the resurrection of the saints), it is as certain 
 that we shall have spiritual bodies as it is now that we have natural 
 or animal ones. By these we are as the first Adam, earthy, we bear his 
 image; by those we shall be as the second Adam, have bodies like his 
 own, heavenly, and so bear him image. And we are as certainly intended 
 to bear the one as we have borne the other. As surely therefore as we 
 have had natural bodies, we shall have spiritual ones. The dead in 
 Christ shall not only rise, but shall rise thus gloriously changed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He sums up this argument by assigning the reason of this change 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>Now this I say that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of 
 God; nor doth corruption inherit incorruption.</I> The natural body is 
 flesh and blood, consisting of bones, muscles, nerves, veins, arteries, 
 and their several fluids; and, as such, it is of a corruptible frame 
 and form, liable to dissolution, to rot and moulder. But no such thing
 shall inherit the heavenly regions; for this were for corruption to 
 inherit incorruption, which is little better than a contradiction in 
 terms. The heavenly inheritance is incorruptible, and never fadeth 
 away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1 Pet. i. 4</A>.

 How can this be possessed by flesh and blood, which is corruptible and
 will fade away? It must be changed into ever-during substance, before 
 it can be capable of possessing the heavenly inheritance. The sum is 
 that the bodies of the saints, when they shall rise again, will be 
 greatly changed from what they are now, and much for the better. They 
 are now corruptible, flesh and blood; they will be then incorruptible, 
 glorious, and spiritual bodies, fitted to the celestial world and 
 state, where they are ever afterwards to dwell, and have their eternal 
 inheritance.</P>

 To confirm what he had said of this change,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He here tells them what had been concealed from or unknown to them 
 till then--that all the saints would not die, but all would be changed.
 Those that are alive at our Lord's coming will be caught up into the 
 clouds, without dying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:11">1 Thess. iv. 11</A>.

 But it is plain from this passage that it will not be without changing
 from corruption to incorruption. The frame of their living bodies
 shall be thus altered, as well as those that are dead; and this <I>in a 
 moment, in the twinkling of an eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 What cannot almighty power effect? That power that calls the dead into 
 life can surely thus soon and suddenly change the living; for changed 
 they must be as well as the dead, because flesh and blood cannot 
 inherit the kingdom of God. This is the mystery which the apostle
 shows the Corinthians: <I>Behold, I show you a mystery;</I> or bring 
 into open light a truth dark and unknown before. Note, There are many 
 mysteries shown to us in the gospel; many truths that before were 
 utterly unknown are there made known; many truths that were but dark 
 and obscure before are there brought into open day, and plainly 
 revealed; and many things are in part revealed that will never be fully 
 known, nor perhaps clearly understood. The apostle here makes known a 
 truth unknown before, which is that the saints living at our Lord's 
 second coming will not die, but be changed, that this change will be 
 made in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and <I>at the sound of 
 the last trump;</I> for, as he tells us elsewhere, the <I>Lord himself 
 shall descend with a shout, with a voice of the archangel, and with the 
 trump of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16">1 Thess. iv. 16</A>),

 so here, <I>the trumpet must sound.</I> It is the loud summons of all
 the living and all the dead, to come and appear at the tribunal of 
 Christ. At this summons the graves shall open, the dead saints shall 
 rise incorruptible, and the living saints be changed to the same 
 incorruptible state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assigns the reason of this change 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):

 <I>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must 
 put on immortality.</I> How otherwise could the man be a fit inhabitant 
 of the incorruptible regions, or be fitted to possess the eternal 
 inheritance? How can that which is corruptible and mortal enjoy what
 is incorruptible, permanent, and immortal? This corruptible body must 
 be made incorruptible, this mortal body must be changed into immortal, 
 that the man may be capable of enjoying the happiness designed for him.
 Note, It is this corruptible that must put on incorruption; the 
 demolished fabric that must be reared again. What is sown must be 
 quickened. Saints will come in their own bodies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 not in other bodies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He lets us know what will follow upon this change of the living 
 and dead in Christ: <I>Then shall be brought to pass that saying, Death 
 is swallowed up in victory;</I> or, <I>He will swallow up death in 
 victory.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:8">Isa. xxv. 8</A>.

 For <I>mortality shall be then swallowed up of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:4">2 Cor. v. 4</A>),

 and death perfectly subdued and conquered, and saints for ever
 delivered from its power. Such a conquest shall be obtained over it 
 that it shall for ever disappear in those regions to which our Lord 
 will bear his risen saints. And therefore will the saints hereupon sing 
 their <B><I>epinikion,</I></B> their <I>song of triumph.</I> Then, when 
 this mortal shall have put on immortality, will death be swallowed up, 
 for ever swallowed up, <B><I>eis nikos.</I></B> Christ hinders it from 
 swallowing his saints when they die; but, when they rise again, death 
 shall, as to them, be swallowed for ever. And upon this destruction of 
 death will they break out into a song of triumph.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They will glory over death as a vanquished enemy, and insult this 
 great and terrible destroyer: "<I>O death! where is thy sting?</I> 
 Where is now thy sting, thy power to hurt? What mischief hast thou done 
 us? We are dead; but behold we live again, and shall die no more. Thou 
 art vanquished and disarmed, and we are out of the reach of thy deadly 
 dart. Where now is thy fatal artillery? Where are thy stores of death? 
 We fear no further mischiefs from thee, nor heed thy weapons, but defy 
 thy power, and despise thy wrath. And, <I>O grave! where is thy 
 victory?</I> Where now is thy victory? What has become of it? Where are 
 the spoils and trophies of it? Once we were thy prisoners, but the 
 prison-doors are burst open, the locks and bolts have been forced to 
 give way, our shackles are knocked off, and we are for ever released. 
 Captivity is taken captive. The imaginary victor is conquered, and 
 forced to resign his conquest and release his captives. Thy triumphs, 
 grave, are at an end. The bonds of death are loosed, and we are at 
 liberty, and are never more to be hurt by death, nor imprisoned in the 
 grave." In a moment, the power of death, and the conquests and spoils 
 of the grave, are gone; and, as to the saints, the very signs of them 
 will not remain. Where are they? Thus will they raise themselves, when
 they become immortal, to the honour of their Saviour and the praise of 
 divine grace: they shall glory over vanquished death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The foundation for this triumph is here intimated, 

 (1.) In the account given whence death had its power to hurt: <I>The 
 sting of death is sin.</I> This gives venom to his dart: this alone 
 puts it into the power of death to hurt and kill. Sin unpardoned, and 
 nothing else, can keep any under his power. And the <I>strength of sin 
 is the law;</I> it is the divine threatening against the transgressors 
 of the law, the curse there denounced, that gives power to sin. Note, 
 Sin is the parent of death, and gives it all its hurtful power. <I>By 
 one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Rom. v. 12</A>.

 It is its cursed progeny and offspring.

 (2.) In the account given of the victory saints obtain over it through
 Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.

 <I>The sting of death is sin;</I> but Christ, by dying, has taken out 
 this sting. He has made atonement for sin; he has obtained remission of 
 it. It may hiss therefore, but it cannot hurt. <I>The strength of sin
 is the law;</I> but the curse of the law is removed by our Redeemer's 
 <I>becoming a curse for us.</I> So that sin is deprived of its strength 
 and sting, through Christ, that is, by his incarnation, suffering, and 
 death. Death may seize a believer, but cannot sting him, cannot hold
 him in his power. There is a day coming when the grave shall open, the 
 bands of death be loosed, the dead saints revive, and become 
 incorruptible and immortal, and put out of the reach of death for ever.
 And then will it plainly appear that, as to them, death will have lost 
 its strength and sting; and all by the mediation of Christ, by his 
 dying in their room. By dying, he conquered death, and spoiled the 
 grave; and, through faith in him, believers become sharers in his 
 conquests. They often rejoice beforehand, in the hope of this victory; 
 and, when they arise glorious from the grave, they will boldly triumph 
 over death. Note, It is altogether owing to the grace of God in Christ 
 that sin is pardoned and death disarmed. The law puts arms into the 
 hand of death, to destroy the sinner; but pardon of sin takes away this 
 power from the law, and deprives death of its strength and sting. It is 
 <I>by the grace of God, through the redemption which is in Christ 
 Jesus, that we are freely justified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:24">Rom. iii. 24</A>.
 
 It is no wonder, therefore,

 (3.) If this triumph of the saints over death should issue in 
 thanksgiving to God: <I>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory 
 through Christ Jesus, our Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>.

 The way to sanctify all our joy is to make it tributary to the praise 
 of God. Then only do we enjoy our blessings and honours in a holy 
 manner when God has his revenue of glory out of it, and we are free to 
 pay it to him. And this really improves and exalts our satisfaction. We 
 are conscious at once of having done our duty and enjoyed our pleasure. 
 And what can be more joyous in itself than the saints' triumph over 
 death, when they shall rise again? And shall they not then rejoice in 
 the Lord, and be glad in the God of their salvation? Shall not their 
 souls magnify the Lord? When he shows <I>such wonders to the dead,
 shall they not arise and praise him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:10">Ps. lxxxviii. 10</A>.

 Those who remain under the power of death can have no heart to praise;
 but such conquests and triumphs will certainly tune the tongues of the 
 saints to thankfulness and praise--praise for the victory (it is great 
 and glorious in itself), and for the means whereby it is obtained (it 
 is given of God through Christ Jesus), a victory obtained not by our 
 power, but the power of God; not given because we are worthy, but 
 because Christ is so, and has by dying obtained this conquest for us. 
 Must not this circumstance endear the victory to us, and heighten our 
 praise to God? Note, How many springs of joy to the saints and 
 thanksgiving to God are opened by the death and resurrection, the 
 sufferings and conquests, of our Redeemer! With what acclamations will 
 saints rising from the dead applaud him! How will the heaven of heavens 
 resound his praises for ever! <I>Thanks be to God</I> will be the 
 burden of their song; and angels will join the chorus, and declare 
 their consent with a loud Amen, Hallelujah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>58  Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
 always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know
 that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this verse we have the improvement of the whole argument, in an 
 exhortation, enforced by a motive resulting plainly from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An exhortation, and this threefold:--

 1. That they should be stedfast--<B><I>hedraioi,</I></B> firm, fixed in
 the faith of the gospel, that gospel which he had preached and they had
 received, namely, <I>That Christ died for our sins, and arose again the
 third day, according to the scriptures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 and fixed in the faith of the glorious resurrection of the dead, which, 
 as he had shown, had so near and necessary a connection with the 
 former. "Do not let your belief of these truths be shaken or staggered. 
 They are most certain, and of the last importance." Note, Christians 
 should be stedfast believers of this great article of the resurrection 
 of the dead. It is evidently founded on the death of Christ. <I>Because 
 he lives, his servants shall live also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>.

 And it is of the last importance; a disbelief of a future life will
 open a way to all manner of licentiousness, and corrupt men's morals to 
 the last degree. It will be easy and natural to infer hence that we
 may live like beasts, and eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. 

 2. He exhorts them to be <I>immovable,</I> namely, in their expectation
 of this great privilege of being raised incorruptible and immortal.
 Christians should not be moved away from this hope of this gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:23">Col. i. 23</A>),

 this glorious and blessed hope; they should not renounce nor resign 
 their comfortable expectations. They are not vain, but solid hopes, 
 built upon sure foundations, the purchase and power of their risen 
 Saviour, and the promise of God, to whom it is impossible to lie--hopes 
 that shall be their most powerful supports under all the pressures of 
 life, the most effectual antidotes against the fears of death, and the 
 most quickening motives to diligence and perseverance in Christian 
 duty. Should they part with these hopes? Should they suffer them to be
 shaken? Note, Christians should live in the most firm expectation of a 
 blessed resurrection. This hope should be an anchor to their souls, 
 firm and sure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:19">Heb. vi. 19</A>.

 3. He exhorts them <I>to abound in the work of the Lord,</I> and that
 <I>always,</I> in the Lord's service, in obeying the Lord's commands. 
 They should be diligent and persevering herein, and going on towards 
 perfection; they should be continually making advances in true piety, 
 and ready and apt for every good work. The most cheerful duty, the
 greatest diligence, the most constant perseverance, become those who 
 have such glorious hopes. Can we too much abound in zeal and diligence 
 in the Lord's work, when we are assured of such abundant recompences in 
 a future life? What vigour and resolution, what constancy and patience, 
 should those hopes inspire! Note, Christians should not stint
 themselves as to their growth in holiness, but be always improving in 
 sound religion, and abounding in the work of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The motive resulting from the former discourse is that their 
 <I>labour shall not be in vain in the Lord;</I> nay, they know it shall 
 not. They have the best grounds in the world to build upon: they have 
 all the assurance that can rationally be expected: as surely as Christ 
 is risen, they shall rise; and Christ is as surely risen as the 
 scriptures are true, and the word of God. The apostles saw him after 
 his death, testified this truth to the world in the face of a thousand 
 deaths and dangers, and confirmed it by miraculous powers received from
 him. Is there any room to doubt a fact so well attested? Note, True 
 Christians have undoubted evidence that their labour will not be in 
 vain in the Lord; not their most diligent services, nor their most 
 painful sufferings; they will not be in vain, not be vain and 
 unprofitable. Note, The labour of Christians will not be lost labour; 
 they may lose for God, but they will lose nothing by him; nay, there is 
 more implied than is expressed in this phrase: it means that they shall 
 be abundantly rewarded. He will never be found unjust to forget their 
 labour of love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.

 Nay, he will do exceedingly abundantly above what they can now ask or
 think. Neither the services they do for him, nor the sufferings they 
 endure for him here, are worthy to be compared with the joy hereafter 
 to be revealed in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:18">Rom. viii. 18</A>.

 Note, Those who serve God have good wages; they cannot do too much nor
 suffer too much for so good a Master. If they serve him now, they shall 
 see him hereafter; if they suffer for him on earth, they shall reign 
 with him in heaven; if they die for his sake, they shall rise again 
 from the dead, be crowned with glory, honour, and immortality, and 
 inherit eternal life.</P>
