 epistle is styled (as are some few others) <I>general</I> or 
 <I>Catholic,</I> because it is not immediately directed to any 
 particular person, family, or church, but to the whole society of 
 Christians of that time, lately converted to the faith of Christ, 
 whether from Judaism or paganism: and it is, and will be, of standing, 
 lasting, and special use in and to the church as long as Christianity, 
 that is, as time, shall last. The general scope of it is much the same 
 with that of the

 of the second epistle of Peter</A>,

 which having been already explained, the less will need to be said on 
 this. It is designed to warn us against seducers and their seduction, 
 to inspire us with a warm love to, and a hearty concern for, truth 
 (evident and important truth), and that in the closest conjunction with
 holiness, of which charity, or sincere unbiased brotherly-love, is a 
 most essential character and inseparable branch. The truth we are to 
 hold fast, and endeavour that others may be acquainted with and not 
 depart from, has two special characters:--It is <I>the truth as it is in
 Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:21">Eph. iv. 21</A>;

 and it is <I>truth after</I> (or <I>which is according to)
 godliness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:1">Tit. i. 1</A>.

 The gospel is the gospel of Christ. He has revealed it to us, and he is 
 the main subject of it; and therefore we are indispensably bound to 
 learn thence all we can of his person, natures, and offices: 
 indifference as to this is inexcusable in any who call themselves 
 <I>Christians;</I> and we know from what fountain we are wholly and 
 solely to draw all necessary saving knowledge. Further, it is also a 
 doctrine of godliness. Whatever doctrines favour the corrupt lusts of 
 men cannot be of God, let the pleas and pretensions for them be what 
 they will. Errors dangerous to the souls of men soon sprang up in the 
 church. <I>The servants slept and tares were sown.</I> But such were 
 the wisdom and kindness of Providence that they began sensibly to 
 appear and show themselves, while some, at least, of the apostles were 
 yet alive to confute them, and warn others against them. We are apt to
 think, If we had lived in their times, we should have been abundantly
 fenced against the attempts and artifices of seducers; but we have
 their testimony and their cautions, which is sufficient; and, if we
 will not believe their writings, neither should we have believed or
 regarded their sayings, if we had lived among them and conversed
 personally with them.</P>
