 I. He continues his account of the duty of masters, from the close of
 the former chapter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He exhorts to the duty of prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>),

 and to a prudent and decent conduct towards those with whom we converse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 III. He closes the epistle with the mention of several of his friends,
 of whom he gives an honourable testimony,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Masters, give unto <I>your</I> servants that which is just and
 equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds with the duty of masters to their servants, which 
 might have been joined to the foregoing chapter, and is a part of that 
 discourse. Here observe, 

 1. Justice is required of them: <I>Give unto your servants that which 
 is just and equal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only strict justice, but equity and kindness. Be faithful to your 
 promises to them, and perform your agreements; not defrauding them of 
 their dues, nor <I>keeping back by fraud the hire of the labourers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.

 Require no more of them than they are able to perform; and do not lay
 unreasonable burdens upon them, and beyond their strength. Provide for
 them what is fit, supply proper food and physic, and allow them such 
 liberties as may fit them the better for cheerful service and make it 
 the easier to them, and this though they be employed in the meanest and 
 lowest offices, and of another country and a different religion from 
 yourselves.

 2. A good reason for this regard: "<I>Knowing that you also have a 
 Master in heaven.</I> You who are masters of others have a Master 
 yourself, and are servants of another Lord. You are not lords of 
 yourselves, and are accountable to one above you. Deal with your 
 servants as you expect God should deal with you, and as those who 
 believe they must give an account. You are both servants of the same 
 Lord in the different relations in which you stand, and are equally 
 accountable to him at last. <I>Knowing that your Master also is in 
 heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him,</I>"

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
 &nbsp; 3  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a
 door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am
 also in bonds:
 &nbsp; 4  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If this be considered as connected with the foregoing verse, then we 
 may observe that it is part of the duty which masters owe their 
 servants to pray with them, and to pray daily with them, or <I>continue 
 in prayer.</I> They must not only do justly and kindly by them, but act 
 a Christian and religious part, and be concerned for their souls as 
 well as their bodies: "As parts of your charge, and under your 
 influence, be concerned for the blessing of God upon them, as well as 
 the success of your affairs in their hands." And this is the duty of 
 every one--to <I>continue in prayer.</I> "Keep up your constant times of
 prayer, without being diverted from it by other business; keep your 
 hearts close to the duty, without wandering or deadness, and even to 
 the end of it: <I>Watching the same.</I>" Christians should lay hold of 
 all opportunities for prayer, and choose the fittest seasons, which are 
 least liable to disturbance from other things, and keep their minds 
 lively in the duty, and in suitable frames.--<I>With thanksgiving,</I>
 or solemn acknowledgment of the mercies received. Thanksgiving must 
 have a part in every prayer.--<I>Withal praying also for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 The people must pray particularly for their ministers, and bear them 
 upon their hearts at all times at the throne of grace. As if he had 
 said, "Do not forget us, whenever you pray for yourselves," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19,1Th+5:25,Heb+13:18">Eph. vi. 19; 
 1 Thess. v. 25; Heb. xiii. 18</A>.

 <I>That God would open to us a door of utterance,</I> that is, either 
 afford opportunity to preach the gospel (so he says, <I>a great door
 and effectual is opened to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:9">1 Cor. xvi. 9</A>),

 or else give me ability and courage, and enable me with freedom and 
 faithfulness; so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19">Eph. vi. 19</A>,

 <I>And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my 
 mouth boldly, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in 
 bonds;</I> that is, either the deepest doctrines of the gospel with 
 plainness, of which Christ is the principal subject (he calls it the 
 <I>mystery of the gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19">Eph. vi. 19</A>),

 or else he means the preaching of the gospel to the Gentile world, 
 which he calls the <I>mystery hidden from ages</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:26"><I>ch.</I> i. 26</A>)
 
 and the <I>mystery of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:4">Eph. iii. 4</A>.

 For this he was now in bonds. He was a prisoner at Rome, by the violent
 opposition of the malicious Jews. He would have them pray for him,
 that he might not be discouraged in his work, nor driven from it by his 
 sufferings: "<I>That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 That I may make this mystery known to those who have not heard of it, 
 and make it plain to their understanding, in such a manner as I ought 
 to do." He had been particular in telling them what he prayed for on 
 their behalf,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:9-11"><I>ch.</I> i</A>.

 Here he tells them particularly what he would have them pray for on his 
 behalf. Paul knew as well as any man how to speak; and yet he begged 
 their prayers for him, that he might be taught to speak. The best and 
 most eminent Christians need the prayers of meaner Christians, and are 
 not above asking them. The chief speakers need prayer, that God would 
 give them a door of utterance, and that they may speak as they ought to 
 speak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the
 time.
 &nbsp; 6  Let your speech <I>be</I> alway with grace, seasoned with salt,
 that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle exhorts them further to a prudent and decent conduct 
 towards all those with whom they conversed, towards the heathen world, 
 or those out of the Christian church among whom they lived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>Walk in wisdom towards those who are without.</I> Be careful, in all 
 your converse with them, to get no hurt by them, or contract any of 
 their customs; for <I>evil communications corrupt good manners;</I> and 
 to do not hurt to them, or increase their prejudices against religion, 
 and give them an occasion of dislike. Yea, do them all the good you 
 can, and by all the fittest means and in the proper seasons recommend 
 religion to them.--<I>Redeeming the time;</I> that is, either "improving
 every opportunity of doing them good, and making the best use of your 
 time in proper duty" (diligence in redeeming time very much recommends 
 religion to the good opinion of others), or else "walking cautiously 
 and with circumspections, to give them no advantage against you, nor 
 expose yourselves to their malice and ill-will," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:15,16">Eph. v. 15, 16</A>.

 <I>Walk circumspectly, redeeming the time, because the days are
 evil,</I> that is, dangerous, or times of trouble and suffering. And
 towards others, or those who are within as well as those who are
 without, "Let <I>your speech be always with grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let all your discourse be as becomes Christians, suitable to your 
 profession--savoury, discreet, seasonable." Though it be not always of 
 grace, it must be always with grace; and, though the matter of our 
 discourse be that which is common, yet there must be an air of piety 
 upon it and it must be in a Christian manner <I>seasoned with salt.</I> 
 Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, makes it savoury, and 
 keeps it from corrupting. <I>That you may know how to answer every 
 man.</I> One answer is proper for one man, and another for another man

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:4,5">Prov. xxvi. 4, 5</A>.

 We have need of a great deal of wisdom and grace to give proper answers
 to every man, particularly in answering the questions and objections of 
 adversaries against our religion, giving the reasons of our faith, and 
 showing the unreasonableness of their exceptions and cavils to the best 
 advantage for our cause and least prejudice to ourselves. <I>Be ready 
 always to give an answer to every man who asketh you a reason of the 
 hope that is in you, with meekness and fear,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, <I>who is</I> a
 beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the
 Lord:
 &nbsp; 8  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might
 know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
 &nbsp; 9  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is <I>one</I>
 of you. They shall make known unto you all things which <I>are
 done</I> here.
 &nbsp; 10  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus,
 sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received
 commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)
 &nbsp; 11  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the
 circumcision. These only <I>are my</I> fellowworkers unto the kingdom
 of God, which have been a comfort unto me.
 &nbsp; 12  Epaphras, who is <I>one</I> of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth
 you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may
 stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
 &nbsp; 13  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you,
 and them <I>that are</I> in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
 &nbsp; 14  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
 &nbsp; 15  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and
 the church which is in his house.
 &nbsp; 16  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be
 read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise
 read the <I>epistle</I> from Laodicea.
 &nbsp; 17  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou
 hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
 &nbsp; 18  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds.
 Grace <I>be</I> with you. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of this epistle the apostle does several of his friends 
 the honour to leave their names upon record, with some testimony of his 
 respect, which will be spoken of wherever the gospel comes, and last to 
 the end of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning Tychicus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 By him this epistle was sent; and he does not give them an account in 
 writing of his present state, because Tychicus would do it by word of 
 mouth more fully and particularly. He knew they would be glad to hear 
 how it fared with him. The churches cannot but be concerned for good 
 ministers and desirous to know their state. He gives him this 
 character, <I>A beloved brother and faithful minister.</I> Paul, though 
 a great apostle, owns a faithful minister for a brother and a beloved 
 brother. Faithfulness in any one is truly lovely, and renders him 
 worthy our affection and esteem. <I>And a fellow-servant in the 
 Lord.</I> Ministers are servants to Christ, and fellow-servants to one 
 another. They have one Lord, though they have different stations and 
 capacities of service. Observe, It adds much to the beauty and strength 
 of the gospel ministry when ministers are thus loving and condescending 
 one to another, and by all just means support and advance one another's 
 reputation. Paul sent him not only to tell them of his affairs, but to 
 bring him an account of theirs: <I>Whom I have sent unto you for the 
 same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your 
 hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He was willing to hear from them as they could be to hear from him, and 
 thought himself as much obliged to sympathize with them as he thought 
 them obliged to sympathize with him. It is a great comfort, under the 
 troubles and difficulties of life, to have the mutual concern of 
 fellow-christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning Onesimus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of 
 you.</I> He was sent back from Rome along with Tychicus. This was he 
 whom Paul had begotten in his bonds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Philem+1:10">Philem. 10</A>.

 He had been servant to Philemon, and was a member, if not a minister,
 of their church. He was converted at Rome, whither he had fled from his 
 master's service; and was now sent back, it is probable, with the 
 epistle to Philemon, to introduce him again into his master's family. 
 Observe, Though he was a poor servant, and had been a bad man, yet, 
 being now a convert, Paul calls him a <I>faithful and beloved 
 brother.</I> The meanest circumstance of life, and greatest wickedness 
 of former life, make no difference in the spiritual relation among 
 sincere Christians: they partake of the same privileges, and are 
 entitles to the same regards. The <I>righteousness of God by faith of 
 Jesus Christ is unto all and upon all those that believe; for there is 
 no difference</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:22">Rom. iii. 22</A>):

 and <I>there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, for you 
 are all one in Christ Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.

 Perhaps this was some time after he was converted and sent back to
 Philemon, and by this time he had entered into the ministry, because 
 Paul calls him a brother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>Aristarchus, a fellow-prisoner.</I> Those who join in services 
 and sufferings should be thereby engaged to one another in holy love. 
 Paul had a particular affection for his fellow-servants and his 
 fellow-prisoners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas.</I> This is supposed to be the 
 same who wrote the gospel which bears his name. <I>If he come unto you 
 receive him.</I> Paul had a quarrel with Barnabas upon the account of 
 this Mark, who was his nephew, and <I>thought not good to take him with 
 them, because he departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with 
 them to the work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:38">Acts xv. 38</A>.

 He would not take Mark with him, but took Silas, because Mark had
 deserted them; and yet Paul is not only reconciled to him himself, but 
 recommends him to the respect of the churches, and gives a great 
 example of a truly Christian forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty 
 of a fault, it must not be always remembered against them. We must 
 forget as well as forgive. <I>If a man be overtaken in a fault, you who 
 are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is one who is called <I>Jesus,</I> which is the Greek name for 
 the Hebrew <I>Joshua. If Jesus had given them rest, then would he not
 afterwards have spoken of another day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:8">Heb. iv. 8</A>.

 <I>Who is called Justus.</I> It is probable that he changed his name 
 for that of Justus, in honour to the name of the Redeemer. Or else 
 Jesus was his Jewish name, for he was of the circumcision; and Justus 
 his Roman or Latin name. <I>These are my fellow-labourers unto the 
 kingdom of God, who have been a comfort unto me.</I> Observe, What 
 comfort the apostle had in the communion of saints and ministers! One 
 is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his 
 fellow-workers, who were working out their own salvation and 
 endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. Good ministers take 
 great comfort in those who are their fellow-workers unto the kingdom of 
 God. Their friendship and converse together are a great refreshment 
 under the sufferings and difficulties in their way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. <I>Epaphras</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 the same with <I>Epaphroditus.</I> He is <I>one of you,</I> one of your 
 church; <I>he salutes you,</I> or sends his service to you, and his 
 best affections and wishes. <I>Always labouring fervently for you in 
 prayers.</I> Epaphras had learned of Paul to be much in prayer for his 
 friends. Observe, 

 1. In what manner he prayed for them. He laboured in prayer, laboured
 fervently, and always laboured fervently for them. Those who would
 succeed in prayer must take pains in prayer; and we must be earnest in 
 prayer, not only for ourselves, but for others also. It is the
 effectual fervent prayer which is the prevailing prayer, and availeth 
 much

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:16">Jam. v. 16</A>),

 and <I>Elias prayed earnestly that it might not rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 2. What is the matter of this prayer: <I>That you may stand perfect
 and complete in all the will of God.</I> Observe, To stand perfect and 
 complete in the will of God is what we should earnestly desire both for 
 ourselves and others. We must stand complete in all the will of God; in 
 the will of his precepts by a universal obedience, and in the will of 
 his providence by a cheerful submission to it: and we stand perfect and 
 complete in both by constancy and perseverance unto the end. The 
 apostle was witness for Epaphras that he had a great zeal for them: 
 "<I>I bear him record;</I> I can testify for him that he has a great 
 concern for you, and that all he does for you proceeds from a warm 
 desire for your good." And his zeal extended to all about them: to 
 <I>those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.</I> He had a great concern 
 for the Christian interest in the neighbouring places, as well as among 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. <I>Luke</I> is another here mentioned, whom he calls the 
 <I>beloved physician.</I> This is he who wrote the Gospel and Acts, and 
 was Paul's companion. Observe, He was both a physician and an 
 evangelist. Christ himself both taught and healed, and was the great 
 physician as well as prophet of the church. He was the beloved 
 physician; one who recommended himself more than ordinary to the 
 affections of his friends. Skill in physic is a useful accomplishment 
 in a minister and may be improved to more extensive usefulness and 
 greater esteem among Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. <I>Demas.</I> Whether this was written before the second epistle 
 to Timothy or after is not certain. There we read
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2 Tim. iv. 10</A>),
 
 <I>Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.</I> Some 
 have thought that this epistle was written after; and then it is an 
 evidence that, though Demas forsook Paul, yet he did not forsake 
 Christ; or he forsook him but for a time, and recovered himself again, 
 and Paul forgave him and owned him as a brother. But others think more 
 probably that this epistle was written before the other; this in 
 <I>anno</I> 62, that in 66, and then it is an evidence how considerable 
 a man Demas was, who yet afterwards revolted. Many who have made a 
 great figure in profession, and gained a great name among Christians, 
 have yet shamefully apostatized: <I>They went forth from us, because 
 they were not of us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. The <I>brethren in Laodicea</I> are here mentioned, as living in
 the neighbourhood of Colosse: and Paul sends salutations to them, and
 orders that this epistle should be read in the church of the Laodiceans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that a copy of it should be sent thither, to be read publicly in their 
 congregation. And some think Paul sent another epistle at this time to 
 Laodicea, and ordered them to send for that from Laodicea, and read it 
 in their church: <I>And that you likewise read the epistle from 
 Laodicea.</I> If so, that epistle is now lost, and did not belong to 
 the canon; for all the epistles which the apostles ever wrote were not 
 preserved, any more than the words and actions of our blessed Lord.
 <I>There are many other things which Jesus did, which if they should be 
 written every one, I suppose the world itself could not contain the 
 books which would be written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25">John xxi. 25</A>.

 But some think it was the epistle to the Ephesians, which is still
 extant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. <I>Nymphas</I> is mentioned

 as one who lived at Colosse, and had a church in his house; that is, 
 either a religious family, where the several parts of worship were 
 daily performed; or some part of the congregation met there, when they 
 had no public places of worship allowed, and they were forced to 
 assemble in private houses for fear of their enemies. <I>The disciples 
 were assembled for fear of the Jews</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19">John xx. 19</A>),

 and the apostle preached in his <I>own lodging and hired house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:23,30">Acts xxviii. 23, 30</A>.

 In the former sense it showed his exemplary piety; in the latter his 
 zeal and public spirit.</P>

 XI. Concerning <I>Archippus,</I> who was one of their ministers at 
 Colosse. They are bidden to admonish him to mind his work as a 
 minister, to <I>take heed to it, and to fulfil it</I>--to be diligent
 and careful of all the parts of it, and to persevere in it unto the 
 end. They must attend to the main design of their ministry, without 
 troubling themselves or the people with things foreign to it, or of 
 less moment. Observe, 

 (1.) The ministry we have received is a great honour; for it is 
 <I>received in the Lord,</I> and is by his appointment and command. 
 
 (2.) Those who have received it must fulfil it, or do the full duty of 
 it. Those betray their trust, and will have a sad account at last, who 
 <I>do this work of the Lord negligently.</I> 

 (3.) The people may put their ministers in mind of their duty, and 
 excite them to it: <I>Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry,</I> 
 though no doubt with decency and respect, not from pride and 
 conceit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XII. Concerning himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The salutation of me Paul. Remember my bonds.</I> He had a scribe to
 write all the rest of the epistle, but these words he wrote with his 
 own hand: <I>Remember my bonds.</I> He does not say, "Remember I am a 
 prisoner, and send me supply;" but, "Remember I am in bonds as the 
 apostle of the Gentiles, and let this confirm your faith in the gospel 
 of Christ:" it adds weight to this exhortation: <I>I therefore, the
 prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1">Eph. iv. 1</A>.
 
 "<I>Grace be with you.</I> The favour of God, and all good, the blessed
 fruits and effects of it, be with you, and be your portion."</P>
