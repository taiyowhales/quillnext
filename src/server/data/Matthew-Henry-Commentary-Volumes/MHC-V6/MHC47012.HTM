 In this chapter the apostle proceeds in maintaining the honour of his
 apostleship. He magnified his office when there were those who vilified
 it. What he says in his own praise was only in his own justification
 and the necessary defence of the honour of his ministry, the
 preservation of which was necessary to its success. First, He makes
 mention of the favour God had shown him, the honour done him, the
 methods God took to keep him humble, and the use he made of this
 dispensation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 Then he addresses himself to the Corinthians, blaming them for what was
 faulty among them, and giving a large account of his behaviour and kind
 intentions towards them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:11-21">ver. 11, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
 visions and revelations of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 2  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
 the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
 tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
 &nbsp; 3  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the
 body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
 &nbsp; 4  How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard
 unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
 &nbsp; 5  Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
 but in mine infirmities.
 &nbsp; 6  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool;
 for I will say the truth: but <I>now</I> I forbear, lest any man
 should think of me above that which he seeth me <I>to be,</I> or
 <I>that</I> he heareth of me.
 &nbsp; 7  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
 abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in
 the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
 exalted above measure.
 &nbsp; 8  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might
 depart from me.
 &nbsp; 9  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
 strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will
 I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may
 rest upon me.
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
 necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake:
 for when I am weak, then am I strong.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The narrative the apostle gives of the favours God had shown him, 
 and the honour he had done him; for doubtless he himself is the man in 
 Christ of whom he speaks. Concerning this we may take notice, 

 1. Of the honour itself which was done to the apostle: he was <I>caught
 up into the third heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 When this was we cannot say, whether it was during those three days 
 that he lay without sight at his conversion or at some other time 
 afterwards, much less can we pretend to say <I>how</I> this was, 
 whether by a separation of his soul from his body or by an 
 extraordinary transport in the depth of contemplation. It would be 
 presumption for us to determine, if not also to enquire into, this 
 matter, seeing the apostle himself says, <I>Whether in the body or out 
 of the body, I cannot tell.</I> It was certainly a very extraordinary 
 honour done him: in some sense he was caught up into the <I>third 
 heaven,</I> the heaven of the blessed, above the a&euml;rial heaven, in 
 which the fowls fly, above the starry heaven, which is adorned with 
 those glorious orbs: it was into the third heaven, where God most 
 eminently manifests his glory. We are not capable of knowing all, nor 
 is it fit we should know very much, of the particulars of that glorious 
 place and state; it is our duty and interest to give diligence to make 
 sure to ourselves a mansion there; and, if that be cleared up to us, 
 then we should long to be removed thither, to abide there for ever. 
 This third heaven is called paradise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 in allusion to the earthly paradise out of which Adam was driven for 
 his transgression; it is called the paradise of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7">Rev. ii. 7</A>),
 
 signifying to us that by Christ we are restored to all the joys and 
 honours we lost by sin, yea, to much better. The apostle does not 
 mention what he saw in the third heaven or paradise, but tells us that 
 <I>he heard unspeakable words,</I> such as it is not possible for a man 
 to utter--such are the sublimity of the matter and our unacquaintedness 
 with the language of the upper world: nor was it lawful to utter those 
 words, because, while we are here in this world, we have a more sure 
 word of prophecy than such visions and revelations. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 We read of the tongue of angels as well as men, and Paul knew as much
 of that as ever any man upon earth did, and yet preferred charity, that 
 is, the sincere love of God and our neighbour. This account which the 
 apostle gives us of his vision should check our curious desires after 
 forbidden knowledge, and teach us to improve the revelation God has 
 given us in his word. Paul himself, who had been in the third heaven, 
 did not publish to the world what he had heard there, but adhered to 
 the doctrine of Christ: on this foundation the church is built, and on 
 this we must build our faith and hope.

 2. The modest and humble manner in which the apostle mentions this
 matter is observable. One would be apt to think that one who had had 
 such visions and revelations as these would have boasted greatly of 
 them; but, says he, <I>It is not expedient for me doubtless to 
 glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He therefore did not mention this immediately, nor till <I>above 
 fourteen years</I> after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And then it is not without some reluctancy, as a thing which in a 
 manner he was forced to by the necessity of the case. Again, he speaks 
 of himself in the third person, and does not say, I am the man who was 
 thus honoured above other men. Again, his humility appears by the
 check he seems to put upon himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 which plainly shows that he delighted not to dwell upon this theme. 
 Thus was he, who was not behind the chief of the apostles in dignity, 
 very eminent for his humility. Note, It is an excellent thing to have
 a lowly spirit in the midst of high advancements; and those who abase 
 themselves shall be exalted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle gives an account of the methods God took to keep him 
 humble, and to prevent his <I>being lifted up above measure;</I> and 
 this he speaks of to balance the account that was given before of the 
 visions and revelations he had had. Note, When God's people communicate 
 their experiences, let them always remember to take notice of what God 
 has done to keep them humble, as well as what he has done in favour to 
 them and for their advancement. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The apostle was pained with a thorn in the flesh, and buffeted with 
 a messenger of Satan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 We are much in the dark what this was, whether some great trouble or 
 some great temptation. Some think it was an acute bodily pain or 
 sickness; others think it was the indignities done him by the false 
 apostles, and the opposition he met with from them, particularly on the 
 account of his speech, which was contemptible. However this was, God 
 often brings this good out of evil, that the reproaches of our enemies 
 help to hide pride from us; and this is certain, that what the apostle 
 calls a thorn in his flesh was for a time very grievous to him: but the 
 thorns Christ wore for us, and with which he was crowned, sanctify and 
 make easy all the thorns in the flesh we may at any time be afflicted 
 with; for <I>he suffered, being tempted, that he might be able to 
 succour those that are tempted.</I> Temptations to sin are most 
 grievous thorns; they are messengers of Satan, to buffet us. Indeed it 
 is a great grievance to a good man to be so much as tempted to sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The design of this was to keep the apostle humble: <I>Lest he should 
 be exalted above measure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Paul himself knew he <I>had not yet attained, neither was already 
 perfect;</I> and yet he was in danger of being lifted up with pride. If 
 God love us, he will hide pride from us, and keep us from being exalted 
 above measure; and spiritual burdens are ordered, to cure spiritual 
 pride. This thorn in the flesh is said to be a messenger of Satan, 
 which he did not send with a good design, but on the contrary, with ill 
 intentions, to discourage the apostle (who had been so highly favoured 
 of God) and hinder him in his work. But God designed this for good, and 
 he overruled it for good, and made this messenger of Satan to be so far 
 from being a hindrance that it was a help to the apostle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The apostle prayed earnestly to God for the removal of this sore 
 grievance. Note, Prayer is a salve for every sore, a remedy for every 
 malady; and when we are afflicted with thorns in the flesh we should 
 give ourselves to prayer. Therefore we are sometimes tempted that we 
 may learn to pray. The apostle <I>besought the Lord thrice, that it 
 might depart from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, Though afflictions are sent for our spiritual benefit, yet we may 
 pray to God for the removal of them: we ought indeed to desire also 
 that they may reach the end for which they are designed. The apostle 
 prayed earnestly, and repeated his requests; he besought the Lord 
 <I>thrice,</I> that is, often. So that if an answer be not given to the 
 first prayer, nor to the second, we must hold on, and hold out, till we 
 receive an answer. Christ himself prayed to his Father thrice. As 
 troubles are sent to teach us to pray, so they are continued to teach 
 us to continue instant in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We have an account of the answer given to the apostle's prayer, 
 that, although the trouble was not removed, yet an equivalent should be 
 granted: <I>My grace is sufficient for thee.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Though God accepts the prayer of faith, yet he does not always 
 answer it in the letter; as he sometimes grants in wrath, so he 
 sometimes denies in love. 

 (2.) When God does not remove our troubles and temptations, yet, if he 
 gives us grace sufficient for us, we have no reason to complain, nor to 
 say that he deals ill by us. It is a great comfort to us, whatever 
 thorns in the flesh we are pained with, that God's grace is sufficient 
 for us. Grace signifies two things:--

 [1.] The good-will of God towards us, and this is enough to enlighten
 and enliven us, sufficient to strengthen and comfort us, to support our 
 souls and cheer up our spirits, in all afflictions and distresses. 

 [2.] The good work of God in us, the grace we receive from the fulness 
 that is in Christ our head; and from him there shall be communicated 
 that which is suitable and seasonable, and sufficient for his members.
 Christ Jesus understands our case, and knows our need, and will 
 proportion the remedy to our malady, and not only strengthen us, but 
 glorify <I>himself. His strength is made perfect in our weakness.</I> 
 Thus his grace is manifested and magnified; he ordains his praise out 
 of the mouths of babes and sucklings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the use which the apostle makes of this dispensation: 
 <I>He gloried in his infirmities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 and took pleasure in them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He does not mean his sinful infirmities (those we have reason to be
 ashamed of and grieved at), but he means his afflictions, his 
 reproaches, necessities, persecutions, and distresses for Christ's 
 sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And the reason of his glory and joy on account of these things was 
 this--they were fair opportunities for Christ to manifest the power and 
 sufficiency of his grace resting upon him, by which he had so much 
 experience of the strength of divine grace that he could say, <I>When I 
 am weak, then am I strong.</I> This is a Christian paradox: when we are 
 weak in ourselves, then we are strong in the grace of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ; when we see ourselves weak in ourselves, then we go out of 
 ourselves to Christ, and are qualified to receive strength from him, 
 and experience most of the supplies of divine strength and grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
 ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind
 the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
 &nbsp; 12  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
 patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
 &nbsp; 13  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
 except <I>it be</I> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive
 me this wrong.
 &nbsp; 14  Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will
 not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the
 children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for
 the children.
 &nbsp; 15  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though
 the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
 &nbsp; 16  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being
 crafty, I caught you with guile.
 &nbsp; 17  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto
 you?
 &nbsp; 18  I desired Titus, and with <I>him</I> I sent a brother. Did Titus
 make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <I>walked we</I>
 not in the same steps?
 &nbsp; 19  Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak
 before God in Christ: but <I>we do</I> all things, dearly beloved, for
 your edifying.
 &nbsp; 20  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as
 I would, and <I>that</I> I shall be found unto you such as ye would
 not: lest <I>there be</I> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes,
 backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
 &nbsp; 21  <I>And</I> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among
 you, and <I>that</I> I shall bewail many which have sinned already,
 and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
 lasciviousness which they have committed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle addresses himself to the Corinthians two 
 ways:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He blames them for what was faulty in them; namely, that they had 
 not stood up in his defence as they ought to have done, and so made it 
 the more needful for him to insist so much on his own vindication. They 
 in manner compelled him to commend himself, who <I>ought to have been 
 commended of them</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And had they, or some among them, not failed on their part, it would 
 have been less needful for him to have said so much on his own behalf. 
 He tells them further that they in particular had good reason to speak 
 well of him, as being <I>in nothing behind the very chief apostles,</I> 
 because he had given them full proof and evidence of his apostleship; 
 for <I>the signs of an apostle were wrought among them in all patience, 
 in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</I> Note, 

 1. It is a debt we owe to good men to stand up in the defence of their
 reputation; and we are under special obligations to those we have 
 received benefit by, especially spiritual benefit, to own them as 
 instruments in God's hand of good to us, and to vindicate them when 
 they are calumniated by others. 

 2. How much soever we are, or ought to be, esteemed by others, we ought
 always to think humbly of ourselves. See an example of this in this
 great apostle, who thought himself to be nothing, though in truth he 
 was not behind the greatest apostles--so far was he from seeking praise 
 from men, though he tells them their duty to vindicate his 
 reputation--so far was he from applauding himself, when he was forced 
 to insist upon his own necessary self-defence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives a large account of his behaviour and kind intentions 
 towards them, in which we may observe the character of a faithful 
 minister of the gospel. 

 1. He was not willing to be burdensome to them, nor did he seek theirs,
 but them. He says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 he had not been burdensome to them, for the time past, and tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 he would not be burdensome to them for the time to come, when he should 
 come to them. He spared their purses, and did not covet their money: 
 <I>I seek not yours but you.</I> He sought not to enrich himself, but 
 to save their souls: he did not desire to make a property of them to 
 himself, but to gain them over to Christ, whose servant he was. Note, 
 Those who aim at clothing themselves with the fleece of the flock, and 
 take no care of the sheep, are hirelings, and not good shepherds. 

 2. He would gladly spend and be spent for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 that is, he was willing to take pains and to suffer loss for their 
 good. He would spend his time, his parts, his strength, his interest, 
 his all, to do them service; nay, so spend as to be spent, and be like 
 a candle, which consumes itself to give light to others. 

 3. He did not abate in his love to them, notwithstanding their
 unkindness and ingratitude to him; and therefore was contented and glad 
 to take pains with them, though <I>the more abundantly he loved them 
 the less he was loved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is applicable to other relations: if others be wanting in their 
 duty to us it does not follow therefore that we may neglect our duty to 
 them. 

 4. He was careful not only that he himself should not be burdensome,
 but that none he employed should. This seems to be the meaning of what 
 we read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 If it should be objected by any that though he did not himself burden 
 them, <I>yet, being crafty, he caught them with guile,</I> that is, he 
 sent those among them who pillaged them, and afterwards he shared with 
 them in the profit: "This was not so," says the apostle; "I did not 
 make a gain of you myself, nor by any of those whom I sent; nor did 
 Titus, nor any others--We walked by the same spirit and in the same 
 steps." They all agreed in this matter to do them all the good they 
 could, without being burdensome to them, to promote the gospel among 
 them and make it as easy to them as possible. Or, this may be read
 with an interrogation, as utterly disclaiming any guile in himself and 
 others towards them. 
 
 5. He was a man who did all things for edifying,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This was his great aim and design, to do good, to lay the foundation 
 well, and then with care and diligence to build the superstructure. 

 6. He would not shrink from his duty for fear of displeasing them,
 though he was so careful to make himself easy to them. Therefore he was 
 resolved to be faithful in reproving sin, though he was therein 
 <I>found to be such as they would not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The apostle here mentions several sins that are too commonly found 
 among professors of religion, and are very reprovable: <I>debates, 
 envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, 
 tumults;</I> and, though those who are guilty of these sins can hardly 
 bear to be reproved for them, yet faithful ministers must not fear 
 offending the guilty by sharp reproofs, as they are needful, in public 
 and in private. 

 7. He was grieved at the apprehension that he should find scandalous
 sins among them not duly repented of. This, he tells them, would be the 
 cause of great humiliation and lamentation. Note,

 (1.) The falls and miscarriages of professors cannot but be a humbling 
 consideration to a good minister; and God sometimes takes this way to 
 humble those who might be under temptation to be lifted up: <I>I fear 
 lest my God will humble me among you.</I> 

 (2.) We have reason to bewail those who sin and do not repent, to
 <I>bewail many that have sinned, and have not repented,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 If these have not, as yet, grace to mourn and lament their own case, 
 their case is the more lamentable; and those who love God, and love 
 them, should mourn for them.</P>
