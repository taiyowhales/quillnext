 After an account of the great trials and sufferings which the servants 
 of God had endured, we have now a more pleasant scene opening; the day 
 begins now to dawn, and here we have represented, 

 I. The Lord Jesus at the head of his faithful followers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Three angels sent successively to proclaim the fall of Babylon and
 the things antecedent and consequent to so great an event, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.

 III. The vision of the harvest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:14-20">ver. 14</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
 with him a hundred forty <I>and</I> four thousand, having his
 Father's name written in their foreheads.
 &nbsp; 2  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
 and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
 harpers harping with their harps:
 &nbsp; 3  And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
 before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
 that song but the hundred <I>and</I> forty <I>and</I> four thousand, which
 were redeemed from the earth.
 &nbsp; 4  These are they which were not defiled with women; for they
 are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever
 he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, <I>being</I> the
 firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
 &nbsp; 5  And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
 fault before the throne of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have one of the most pleasing sights that can be viewed in this 
 world--the Lord Jesus Christ at the head of his faithful adherents and
 attendants. Here observe, 

 1. How Christ appears: as a Lamb standing upon <I>mount Zion.</I> Mount
 Zion is the gospel church. Christ is with his church and in the midst 
 of her in all her troubles, and therefore she is not consumed. It is 
 his presence that secures her perseverance; he appears as <I>a Lamb, a 
 true Lamb, the Lamb of God.</I> A counterfeit lamb is mentioned as 
 rising out of the earth in the last chapter, which was really a dragon; 
 here Christ appears as the true paschal Lamb, to show that his 
 mediatorial government is the fruit of his sufferings, and the cause of 
 his people's safety and fidelity. 

 2. How his people appear: very honourably.

 (1.) As to the numbers, they are many, even all who are sealed; not one 
 of them lost in all the tribulations through which they have gone. 

 (2.) Their distinguishing badge: they had <I>the name of God written in 
 their foreheads;</I> they made a bold and open profession of their 
 faith in God and Christ, and, this being followed by suitable actings, 
 they are known and approved.

 (3.) Their congratulations and songs of praise, which were peculiar to 
 the redeemed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 their praises were loud as thunder, or <I>as the voice of many 
 waters;</I> they were melodious, as <I>of harpers;</I> they were 
 heavenly, <I>before the throne</I> of God. <I>The song was new,</I> 
 suited to the new covenant, and unto that new and gracious dispensation 
 of Providence under which they now were; and their song was a secret to 
 others, <I>strangers intermeddled not with their joy;</I> others might 
 repeat the words of the song, but they were strangers to the true sense 
 and spirit of it.

 (4.) Their character and description. 

 [1.] They are described by their chastity and purity: <I>They are 
 virgins.</I> They had not defiled themselves either with corporal or 
 spiritual adultery; they had kept themselves clean from the 
 abominations of the antichristian generation.

 [2.] By their loyalty and stedfast adherence to Christ: <I>They follow 
 the Lamb withersoever he goes;</I> they follow the conduct of his word, 
 Spirit, and providence, leaving it to him to lead them into what duties 
 and difficulties he pleases. 

 [3.] By their former designation to this honour: <I>These were redeemed 
 from among men, being the first-fruits to God, and to the Lamb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Here is plain evidence of a special redemption: <I>They were redeemed 
 from among men.</I> Some of the children of men are, by redeeming 
 mercy, distinguished from others: <I>They were the first-fruits to God, 
 and to the Lamb,</I> his choice ones, eminent in every grace, and the 
 earnest of many more who should <I>be followers of them, as they were 
 of Christ.</I>

 [4.] By their universal integrity and conscientiousness: <I>There was 
 no guile found in them,</I> and <I>they were without fault before the 
 throne of God.</I> They were without any prevailing guile, any allowed 
 fault; their hearts were right with God, and, as for their human 
 infirmities, they were freely pardoned in Christ. This is the happy 
 remnant who attend upon the Lord Jesus as their head and Lord; he is 
 glorified in them, and they are glorified in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
 the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
 earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
 &nbsp; 7  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;
 for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
 heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
 &nbsp; 8  And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
 is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of
 the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
 &nbsp; 9  And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
 If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive <I>his</I>
 mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
 &nbsp; 10  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
 is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;
 and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence
 of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
 &nbsp; 11  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and
 ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast
 and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
 &nbsp; 12  Here is the patience of the saints: here <I>are</I> they that
 keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the chapter we have three angels or messengers sent 
 from heaven to give notice of the fall of Babylon, and of those things 
 that were antecedent and consequent to that great event.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The first angel was sent on an errand antecedent to it, and that was 
 <I>to preach the everlasting gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The gospel is an everlasting gospel; it is so in its nature, and it 
 will be so in its consequences. Though all flesh be grass, the word of 
 the Lord endureth for ever. 

 2. It is a work fit for an angel to preach this everlasting gospel;
 such is the dignity, and such is the difficulty of that work! And yet 
 we have this treasure in earthen vessels. 

 3. The everlasting gospel is of great concern to all the world; and, as
 it is the concern of all, it is very much to be desired that it should 
 be made known to all, even <I>to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, 
 and people.</I> 

 4. The gospel is the great means whereby men are brought to fear God,
 and to give glory to him. Natural religion is not sufficient to keep up 
 the fear of God, nor to secure to him glory from men; it is the gospel 
 that revives the fear of God, and retrieves his glory in the world. 

 5. When idolatry creeps into the churches of God, it is by the
 preaching of the gospel, attended by the power of the Holy Spirit, that 
 men are <I>turned from idols to serve the living God,</I> as the 
 Creator of <I>the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains 
 of waters,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 To worship any God besides him who created the world is idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The second angel follows the other, and proclaims the actual fall 
 of Babylon. The preaching of the everlasting gospel had shaken the 
 foundations of antichristianism in the world, and hastened its 
 downfall. By Babylon is generally understood Rome, which was before 
 called <I>Sodom</I> and <I>Egypt,</I> for wickedness and cruelty, and 
 is now first called <I>Babylon,</I> for pride and idolatry. Observe, 

 1. What God has fore-ordained and foretold shall be done as certainly
 as if it were done already.

 2. The greatness of the papal Babylon will not be able to prevent her
 fall, but will make it more dreadful and remarkable. 

 3. The wickedness of Babylon, in corrupting, debauching, and
 intoxicating the nations round about her, will make her fall just and 
 will declare the righteousness of God in her utter ruin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Her crimes are recited as the just cause of her destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A third angel follows the other two, and gives warning to all of 
 that divine vengeance which would overtake all those that obstinately 
 adhered to the antichristian interest after God had thus proclaimed its 
 downfall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 If after this (this threatening denounced against Babylon, and in part 
 already executed) any should persist in their idolatry, professing 
 subjection to the beast and promoting his cause, they must expect <I>to 
 drink deep of the wind of the wrath of God;</I> they shall be forever 
 miserable in soul and body; Jesus Christ will inflict this punishment 
 upon them, and the holy angels will behold it and approve of it. 
 Idolatry, both pagan and papal, is a damning sin in its own nature, and 
 will prove fatal to those who persist in it, after fair warning given 
 by the word of Providence; those who refuse to come out of Babylon, 
 when thus called, and resolve to partake of her sins, must receive of 
 her plagues; and the guilt and ruin of such incorrigible idolaters will 
 serve to set forth the excellency of the patience and obedience of the 
 saints. These graces shall be rewarded with salvation and glory. When 
 the treachery and rebellion of others shall be punished with 
 everlasting destruction, then it will be said, to the honour of the 
 faithful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Here is the patience of the saints;</I> you have before seen their 
 patience exercised, now you see it rewarded.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write,
 Blessed <I>are</I> the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:
 Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and
 their works do follow them.
 &nbsp; 14  And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
 <I>one</I> sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
 crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
 &nbsp; 15  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
 voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
 reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of
 the earth is ripe.
 &nbsp; 16  And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the
 earth; and the earth was reaped.
 &nbsp; 17  And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,
 he also having a sharp sickle.
 &nbsp; 18  And another angel came out from the altar, which had power
 over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
 sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
 clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
 &nbsp; 19  And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and
 gathered the vine of the earth, and cast <I>it</I> into the great
 winepress of the wrath of God.
 &nbsp; 20  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood
 came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the
 space of a thousand <I>and</I> six hundred furlongs.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the vision of the harvest and vintage, introduced with a 
 solemn preface. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Here note, 

 1. Whence this prophecy about the harvest came: it came down from 
 heaven, and not from men, and therefore it is of certain truth and 
 great authority. 

 2. How it was to be preserved and published--by writing; it was to be a
 matter of record, that the people of God might have recourse to it for 
 their support and comfort upon all occasions.

 3. What it principally intended, and that is, to show the blessedness
 of all the faithful saints and servants of God, both in death and after 
 death: <I>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from 
 henceforth,</I> &c. Here observe,

 (1.) The description of those that are and shall be blessed--such as 
 die in the Lord, either die in the cause of Christ, or rather die in a 
 state of vital union with Christ, such as are found in Christ when 
 death comes. 

 (2.) The demonstration of this blessedness: <I>They rest from their 
 labours, and their works do follow them.</I> 

 [1.] They are blessed in their rest; they rest from all sin, 
 temptation, sorrow, and persecution. <I>There the wicked cease from 
 troubling, there the weary are at rest.</I>

 [2.] They are blessed in their recompence: <I>Their works follow 
 them;</I> they do not go before them as their title, or price of 
 purchase, but follow them as their evidence of having lived and died in 
 the Lord; and the memory of them will be pleasant, and the reward 
 glorious, far above the merit of all their services and sufferings.

 [3.] They are happy in the time of their dying, when they have lived to 
 see the cause of God reviving, the peace of the church returning, and 
 the wrath of God falling upon their idolatrous cruel enemies. Such 
 times are good times to die in; they have Simeon's desire: <I>Now, 
 Lord, let thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy 
 salvation.</I> And all this is ratified and confirmed by the testimony 
 of the Spirit witnessing with their spirits and with the written 
 word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the vision itself, represented by a harvest and a 
 vintage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By a harvest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 an emblem that sometimes signifies the cutting down of the wicked, when 
 ripe for ruin, by the judgments of God, and sometimes the gathering in 
 of the righteous, when ripe for heaven, by the mercy of God. This seems 
 rather to represent God's judgments against the wicked: and here 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The Lord of the harvest--one so <I>like unto the Son of man</I>
 that he was the same, even the Lord Jesus, who is described, 

 [1.] By the chariot in which he sat--<I>a white cloud,</I> a cloud that 
 had a bright side turned to the church, how dark soever it might be to 
 the wicked.

 [2.] By the ensign of his power: <I>On his head was a golden crown,</I>
 authority to do all that he did and whatsoever he would do.

 [3.] By the instrument of his providences: <I>In his hand a sharp
 sickle.</I> 

 [4.] By the solicitations he had from the temple to perform this great 
 work. What he did, he was desired to do by his people; and, though he 
 was resolved to do it, he would for this thing be sought unto by them, 
 and so it should be in return to their prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The harvest-work, which is, to thrust the sickle into the corn, 
 and reap the field. The sickle is the sword of God's justice; the field 
 is the world; reaping is cutting the inhabitants of the earth down and 
 carrying them off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The harvest-time; and this is when the corn is ripe, when the 
 measure of the sin of men is filled up, and they are ripe for 
 destruction. The most inveterate enemies of Christ and his church are 
 not destroyed till by their sin they are ripe for ruin, and then he 
 will spare them no longer; he will thrust in his sickle, and the earth 
 shall be reaped.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By a vintage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Some think that these two are only different emblems of the same 
 judgment; others that they refer to distinct events of providence 
 before the end of all things. Observe,

 (1.) To whom this vintage-work was committed--to an angel, <I>another 
 angel that came out from the altar,</I> that is, from the holiest of 
 all in heaven. 

 (2.) At whose request this vintage-work was undertaken: it was, as 
 before, at the cry of an <I>angel out of the temple,</I> the ministers 
 and churches of God on earth. 

 (3.) The work of the vintage, which consists of two parts:--

 [1.] The cutting off, and <I>gathering, the clusters of the vine,</I>
 which were now ripe and ready, <I>fully ripe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 [2.] Casting these grapes <I>into the wine-press</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 here we are told, <I>First,</I> What was the wine-press: it was <I>the 
 wrath of God,</I> the fire of his indignation, some terrible calamity, 
 very probably the sword, shedding the blood of the wicked. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Where was the place of the wine-press--<I>without the 
 city,</I> where the army lay that came against Babylon. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 The quantity of the wine, that is, of the blood that was drawn forth by 
 this judgment: it was, for depth, up <I>to the horses' bridles,</I> 
 and, for breadth and length, <I>a thousand and six hundred furlongs</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 that is, say some, 200 Italian miles, which is thought to be the 
 measure of the holy land, and may be meant of the patrimony of the holy 
 see, encompassing the city of Rome. But here we are left of doubtful 
 conjectures. Perhaps this great event has not yet had its 
 accomplishment, but <I>the vision is for an appointed time;</I> and 
 therefore, though it may seem to tarry, we are to wait for it. <I>But 
 who shall live when the Lord does this?</I></P>
