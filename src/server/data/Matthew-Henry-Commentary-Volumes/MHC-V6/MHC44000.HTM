 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> have with an abundant satisfaction seen the 
 foundation of our holy religion laid in the history of our blessed 
 Saviour, its great author, which was related and left upon record by 
 four several inspired writers, who all agree in this sacred truth, and 
 the incontestable proofs of it, that <I>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of 
 the living God.</I> Upon this rock the Christian church is built. How 
 it began to be built upon this rock comes next to be related in this 
 book which we have now before us, and of this we have the testimony 
 only of <I>one witness;</I> for the matters of fact concerning Christ 
 were much more necessary to be fully related and attested than those 
 concerning the apostles. Had Infinite Wisdom seen fit, we might have 
 had as many books of the Acts of the Apostles as we have gospels, nay, 
 as we might have had gospels: but, for fear of over-burdening the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25">John xxi. 25</A>),

 we have sufficient to answer the end, if we will but make use of it.
 The history of this book (which was always received as a part of the 
 sacred canon) may be considered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As looking back to the preceding gospels, giving light to them, and 
 greatly assisting our faith in them. The promises there made we here 
 find made good, particularly the great promises of the descent of the 
 Holy Ghost, and his wonderful operations, both <I>on</I> the apostles 
 (whom here in a few days we find quite other men than what the gospels 
 left them; no longer weak-headed and weak-hearted, but able to say that
 which then they were not able to bear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:12">John xvi. 12</A>)

 as bold as lions to face those hardships at the thought of which they 
 then trembled as lambs), and also with the apostles, making the word 
 mighty to the <I>pulling down of</I> Satan's <I>strong holds,</I> which 
 had been before comparatively preached in vain. The commission there 
 granted to the apostles we here find executed, and the powers there 
 lodged in them we here find exerted in miracles wrought on the bodies 
 of people--miracles of mercy, restoring sick bodies to health and dead
 bodies to life--miracles of judgment, striking rebels blind or dead;
 and much greater miracles wrought on the minds of people, in conferring 
 spiritual gifts upon them, both of understanding and utterance; and 
 this in pursuance of Christ's purposes, and in performance of his 
 promises, which we had in the gospels. The proofs of Christ's 
 resurrection with which the gospels closed are here abundantly 
 corroborated, not only by the constant and undaunted testimony of those 
 that conversed with him after he arose (who had all deserted him, and 
 one of them denied him, and would not otherwise have been rallied again 
 but by his resurrection, but must have been irretrievably dispersed, 
 and yet by that were enabled to own him more resolutely than ever, in 
 defiance of bonds and deaths), but by the working of the Spirit with 
 that testimony for the conversion of multitudes to the faith of Christ, 
 according to the word of Christ, that his resurrection, the sign of the 
 prophet Jonas, which was reserved to the last, should be the most 
 convincing proof of his divine mission. Christ had told his disciples 
 that they should be his witnesses, and this book brings them in 
 witnessing for him,--that they should be <I>fishers of men,</I> and
 here we have them enclosing multitudes in the gospel-net,--that they
 should be the <I>lights of the world,</I> and here we have the world 
 enlightened by them; but that day--spring from on high the first
 appearing of which we there discerned we here find shining more and 
 more. The <I>corn of wheat,</I> which there fell to the ground, here 
 springs up and bears much fruit; the <I>grain of mustard-seed</I> there 
 is here a <I>great tree;</I> and <I>the kingdom of heaven,</I> which 
 was then <I>at hand,</I> is here set up. Christ's predictions of the 
 virulent persecutions which the preachers of the gospel should be 
 afflicted with (though one could not have imagined that a doctrine so 
 well worthy of all acceptation should meet with so much opposition) we 
 here find abundantly fulfilled, and also the assurances he gave them of 
 extraordinary supports and comforts under their sufferings. Thus, as 
 the latter part of the history of the Old Testament verifies the 
 promises made to the fathers of the former part (as appears by that 
 famous and solemn acknowledgment of Solomon's, which runs like a 
 receipt in full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56">1 Kings viii. 56</A>,

 <I>There has not failed one word of all his good promises which he
 promised by the hand of Moses his servant</I>), so this latter part of 
 the history of the New Testament exactly answers to the world of Christ 
 in the former part of it: and thus they mutually confirm and illustrate 
 each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As looking forward to the following epistles, which are an 
 explication of the gospels, which open the mysteries of Christ's death 
 and resurrection, the history of which we had in the gospels. This book 
 introduces them and is a key to them, as the history of David is to 
 David's psalms. We are members of the Christian church, that 
 <I>tabernacle of God among men,</I> and it is our honour and privilege 
 that we are so. Now this book gives us an account of the framing and 
 rearing of that tabernacle. The four gospels showed us how the 
 foundation of that house was laid; this shows us how the superstructure 
 began to be raised, 

 1. Among the Jews and Samaritans, which we have an account of in the
 former part of this book. 

 2. Among the Gentiles, which we have an account of in the latter part:
 from thence, and downward to our own day, we find the Christian church 
 subsisting in a visible profession of faith in Christ, as the Son of 
 God and Saviour of the world, made by his baptized disciples, 
 incorporated into religious societies, statedly meeting in religious 
 assemblies, attending on the apostles' doctrine, and joining in prayers 
 and the breaking of bread, under the guidance and presidency of men 
 that gave themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word, and in a 
 spiritual communion with all in every place that do likewise. Such a 
 body as this thee is now in the world, which we belong to: and, to our 
 great satisfaction and honour, in this book we find the rise and origin 
 of it, vastly different from the Jewish church, and erected upon its 
 ruins; but undeniably appearing to be of God, and not of man. With what 
 confidence and comfort may we proceed in, and adhere to, our Christian 
 profession, as far as we find it agrees with this <I>pattern in the 
 mount,</I> to which we ought religiously to conform and confine 
 ourselves!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things more are to be observed concerning this book:--

 (1.) The penman of it. It was written by Luke, who wrote the third of 
 the four gospels, which bears his name; and who (as the learned Dr. 
 Whitby shows) was, very probably, one of the seventy disciples, whose 
 commission

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1">Luke x. 1</A>,

 &c.) was little inferior to that of the twelve apostles. This Luke was
 very much a companion of Paul in his services and sufferings. <I>Only 
 Luke is with me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2 Tim. iv. 11</A>.

 We may know by his style in the latter part of this book when and where
 he was with him, for then he writes, We did so and so, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10,20:6"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 10; xx. 6</A>;

 and thenceforward to the end of the book. He was with Paul in his
 dangerous voyage to Rome, when he was carried thither a prisoner, was
 with him when from his prison there he wrote his epistles to the
 Colossians and Philemon, in both which he is named. And it should seem
 that St. Luke wrote this history when he was with St. Paul at Rome,
 during his imprisonment there, and was assistant to him; for the
 history concludes with St. Paul's preaching there in his <I>own hired
 house.</I> 

 (2.) The title of it: <I>The Acts of the Apostles; of the holy
 Apostles,</I> so the Greek copies generally read it, and so they are 
 called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20">Rev. xviii. 20</A>,

 <I>Rejoice over her you holy apostles.</I> One copy inscribes it,
 <I>The Acts of the Apostles by Luke the Evangelist.</I> 

 [1.] It is the history of the apostles; yet there is in it the history 
 of Stephen, Barnabas, and some other apostolical men, who, though not 
 of the twelve, were endued with the same Spirit, and employed in the 
 same work; and, of those that were apostles, it is the history of Peter 
 and Paul only that is here recorded (and Paul was now of the twelve),
 Peter the apostle of the circumcision, and Paul the apostles of the
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7">Gal. ii. 7</A>.

 But this suffices as a specimen of what the rest did in other places,
 pursuant to their commission, for there were none of them idle; and as 
 we are to think what is related in the gospels concerning Christ 
 sufficient, because Infinite Wisdom thought so, the same we are to 
 think here concerning what is related of the apostles and their 
 labours; for what more is told us from tradition of the labours and 
 sufferings of the apostles, and the churches they planted, is 
 altogether doubtful and uncertain, and what I think we cannot build 
 upon with any satisfaction at all. This is <I>gold, silver,</I> and 
 <I>precious stones,</I> built upon the <I>foundation:</I> that is 
 <I>wood, hay, and stubble.</I>

 [2.] It is called their <I>acts,</I> or <I>doings; Gesta 
 apostolorum;</I> so some. <B><I>Praxeis</I></B>--their practices of
 the lessons their Master had taught them. The apostles where active 
 men; and though the wonders they did were by the word, yet they are 
 fitly called <I>their acts;</I> they spoke, or rather the Spirit by 
 them <I>spoke, and it was done.</I> The history is filled with their 
 sermons and their sufferings; yet so much did they labour in their 
 preaching, and so voluntarily did they expose themselves to sufferings, 
 and such were their achievements by both, that they may very well be 
 called their <I>acts.</I></P>
