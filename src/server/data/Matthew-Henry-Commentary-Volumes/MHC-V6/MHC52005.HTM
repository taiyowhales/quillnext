 The apostle, having spoken in the end of the foregoing chapter 
 concerning the resurrection, and the second coming of Christ, proceeds 
 to speak concerning the uselessness of enquiring after the particular 
 time of Christ's coming, which would be sudden and terrible to the 
 wicked, but comfortable to the saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 He then exhorts them to the duties of watchfulness, sobriety, and the
 exercise of faith, love, and hope, as being suitable to their state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 In the next words he exhorts them to several duties they owed to
 others, or to one another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>),

 afterwards to several other Christian duties of great importance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>),

 and then concludes this epistle,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need
 that I write unto you.
 &nbsp; 2  For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so
 cometh as a thief in the night.
 &nbsp; 3  For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden
 destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child;
 and they shall not escape.
 &nbsp; 4  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
 overtake you as a thief.
 &nbsp; 5  Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the
 day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle tells the Thessalonians it was needless or useless to 
 enquire about the particular time of Christ's coming: <I>Of the times 
 and seasons you need not that I write unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The thing is certain that Christ will come, and there is a certain time 
 appointed for his coming; but there was no need that the apostle should 
 write about this, and therefore he had no revelation given him; nor 
 should they or we enquire into this secret, <I>which the Father has 
 reserved in his own power. Of that day and hour knoweth no man.</I> 
 Christ himself did not reveal this while upon earth; it was not in his 
 commission as the great prophet of the church: nor did he reveal this 
 to his apostles; there was <I>no need</I> of this. There are times and 
 seasons for us to do our work in: these it is our duty and interest to 
 know and observe; but the time and season when we must give up our 
 account we know not, nor is it needful that we should know them. Note, 
 There are many things which our vain curiosity desires to know which 
 there is no necessity at all of our knowing, nor would our knowledge of 
 them do us good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells them that the coming of Christ would be sudden, and a 
 great surprise to most men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And this is what they knew perfectly, or might know, because our Lord 
 himself had so said: <I>In such an hour as you think not, the Son of 
 man cometh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:44">Matt. xxiv. 44</A>.
 
 So 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:35,36">Mark xiii. 35, 36</A>,

 <I>Watch you therefore, for you know not when the master of the house 
 cometh; lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping.</I> And no doubt 
 the apostle had told them, as of the coming of Christ, so also of his 
 coming suddenly, which is the meaning of his coming <I>as a thief in 
 the night,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:15">Rev. xvi. 15</A>.

 As the thief usually cometh in the dead time of the night, when he is
 least expected, such a <I>surprise</I> will the day of the Lord be; so 
 sudden and surprising will be his appearance. The knowledge of this 
 will be more useful than to know the exact time, because this should 
 awaken us to stand upon our watch, that we may be ready whenever he 
 cometh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He tells them how terrible Christ's coming would be to the 
 ungodly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It will be to their destruction in that day of the Lord. The righteous
 God will bring ruin upon his and his people's enemies; and this their 
 destruction, as it will be total and final, so, 

 1. It will be sudden. It will overtake them, and fall upon them, in
 the midst of their carnal security and jollity, when they say in their 
 hearts, <I>Peace and safety,</I> when they dream of felicity and please 
 themselves with vain amusements of their fancies or their senses, and 
 think not of it,--<I>as travail cometh upon a woman with child,</I> at 
 the set time indeed, but not perhaps just then expected, nor greatly 
 feared. 

 2. It will be unavoidable destruction too: <I>They shall not
 escape;</I> they shall in no wise escape. There will be no means 
 possible for them to avoid the terror nor the punishment of that day.
 There will be <I>no place where the workers of iniquity shall be able 
 to hide themselves,</I> no shelter from the storm, nor shadow from the 
 burning heat that shall consume the wicked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He tells them how comfortable this day will be to the righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. Their character and privilege. They are not in darkness; they are 
 the children of the light, &c. This was the happy condition of the 
 Thessalonians as it is of all true Christians. They were not in a state 
 of sin and ignorance as the heathen world. They were <I>some time 
 darkness, but were made light in the Lord.</I> They were favoured with 
 the divine revelation of things that are unseen and eternal, 
 particularly concerning the coming of Christ, and the consequences 
 thereof. They were the <I>children of the day,</I> for the day-star had 
 risen upon them; yea, the Sun of righteousness had arisen on them with 
 healing under his wings. They were no longer under the darkness of 
 heathenism, nor under the shadows of the law, but under the gospel, 
 which brings life and immortality to light. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10">2 Tim. i. 10</A>.

 2. Their great advantage on this account: that <I>that day should not
 overtake them as a thief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It was at least their own fault if they were surprised by that day. 
 They had fair warning, and sufficient helps to provide against that 
 day, and might hope to stand with comfort and confidence before the Son 
 of man. This would be a time of <I>refreshing to them from the presence 
 of the Lord,</I> who to <I>those that look for him will appear without 
 sin unto their salvation,</I> and will come to them as a friend in the 
 day, not as a thief in the night.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Therefore let us not sleep, as <I>do</I> others; but let us watch
 and be sober.
 &nbsp; 7  For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be
 drunken are drunken in the night.
 &nbsp; 8  But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
 breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of
 salvation.
 &nbsp; 9  For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
 salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
 &nbsp; 10  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should
 live together with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On what had been said, the apostle grounds seasonable exhortations to 
 several needful duties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To watchfulness and sobriety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 These duties are distinct, yet they mutually befriend one another. For, 
 while we are compassed about with so many temptations to intemperance 
 and excess, we shall not keep sober, unless we be upon our guard, and, 
 unless we keep sober, we shall not long watch. 

 1. Then <I>let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch;</I> we must
 not be secure and careless, nor indulge spiritual sloth and idleness. 
 We must not be off our watch, but continually upon our guard against 
 sin, and temptation to it. The generality of men are too careless of 
 their duty and regardless of their spiritual enemies. They say, 
 <I>Peace and safety,</I> when they are in the greatest danger, doze 
 away their precious moments on which eternity depends, indulging idle 
 dreams, and have no more thoughts nor cares about another world than 
 men that are asleep have about this. Either they do not consider the 
 things of another world at all, because they are asleep; or they do not 
 consider them aright, because they dream. But let us watch, and act 
 like men that are awake, and that stand upon their guard. 

 2. Let us also <I>be sober,</I> or temperate and moderate. Let us keep
 our natural desires and appetites after the things of this world within 
 due bounds. Sobriety is usually opposed to excess in meats and drinks,
 and here particularly it is opposed to drunkenness; but it also extends 
 to all other temporal things. Thus our Saviour warned his disciples to 
 <I>take heed lest their hearts should be overcharged with surfeiting 
 and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on them 
 unawares,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:34">Luke xxi. 34</A>.

 <I>Our moderation</I> then, as to all temporal things, <I>should be 
 known to all men, because the Lord is at hand.</I> Besides this, 
 watchfulness and sobriety are most suitable to the Christian's 
 character and privilege, as being <I>children of the day;</I> because 
 <I>those that sleep sleep in the night, and those that are drunken are 
 drunken in the night,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is a most reproachful thing for men to sleep away the day-time,
 which is for work and not for sleep, to be drunken in the day, when so 
 many eyes are upon them, to behold their shame. It was not so strange 
 if those who had not the benefit of divine revelation suffered 
 themselves to be lulled asleep by the devil in carnal security, and if 
 they laid the reins upon the neck of their appetites, and indulged 
 themselves in all manner of riot and excess; for it was night-time with 
 them. They were not sensible of their danger, therefore they 
 <I>slept;</I> they were not sensible of their duty, therefore they were 
 drunk: but it ill becomes Christians to do thus. What! shall 
 Christians, who have the light of the blessed gospel shining in their 
 faces, be careless about their souls, and unmindful of another world?
 Those who have so many eyes upon them should conduct themselves with 
 peculiar propriety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To be well armed as well as watchful: to put on the whole armour of 
 God. This is necessary in order to such sobriety as becomes us and will 
 be a preparation for the day of the Lord, because our spiritual enemies 
 are many, and mighty, and malicious. They draw many to their interest,
 and keep them in it, by making them careless, secure, and presumptuous, 
 by making them drunk--drunk with pride, drunk with passion, drunk and
 giddy with self-conceit, drunk with the gratifications of sense: so 
 that we have need to arm ourselves against their attempts, by putting 
 on the spiritual breast-plate to keep the heart, and the spiritual 
 helmet to secure the head; and this spiritual armour consists of three 
 great graces of Christians, faith, love, and hope, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. We must live by faith, and this will keep us watchful and sober. If 
 we believe that the eye of God (who is a spirit) is always upon us, 
 that we have spiritual enemies to grapple with, that there is a world 
 of spirits to prepare for, we shall see reason to watch and be sober. 
 Faith will be our best defence against the assaults of our enemies. 

 2. We must get a heart inflamed with love; and this also will be our
 defence. True and fervent love to God, and the things of God, will keep 
 us watchful and sober, and hinder our apostasy in times of trouble and 
 temptation. 

 3. We must make salvation our hope, and should have a lively hope of
 it. This good hope, through grace, of eternal life, will be as a helmet 
 to defend the head, and hinder our being intoxicated with the pleasures 
 of sin, which are but for a season. If we have hope of salvation, let 
 us take heed of doing any thing that shall shake our hopes, or render 
 us unworthy of or unfit for the great salvation we hope for. Having 
 mentioned salvation and the hope of it, the apostle shows what grounds 
 and reasons Christians have to hope for this salvation, as to which 
 observe, He says nothing of their meriting it. No, the doctrine of our
 merits is altogether unscriptural and antiscriptural; there is no 
 foundation of any good hope upon that account. But our hopes are to be 
 grounded,

 (1.) Upon God's appointment: because <I>God hath not appointed us to 
 wrath, but to obtain salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If we would trace our salvation to the first cause, that is God's 
 appointment. Those who live and die in darkness and ignorance, who
 sleep and are drunken as in the night, are, it is but too plain, 
 <I>appointed to wrath;</I> but as for those who are of the day, if they 
 watch and be sober, it is evident that they are <I>appointed to obtain 
 salvation.</I> And the sureness and firmness of the divine appointment 
 are the great support and encouragement of our hope. Were we to obtain 
 salvation by our own merit or power, we could have but little or no 
 hope of it; but seeing we are to obtain it by virtue of God's 
 appointment, which we are sure cannot be shaken (<I>for his purpose, 
 according to election, shall stand</I>), on this we build unshaken 
 hope, especially when we consider,

 (2.) Christ's merit and grace, and that salvation is by our Lord Jesus 
 Christ, who died for us. Our salvation therefore is owing to, and our 
 hopes of it are grounded on, Christ's atonement as well as God's 
 appointment: and, as we should think on God's gracious design and 
 purpose, so also on Christ's death and sufferings, for this end, 
 <I>that whether we wake or sleep</I> (whether we live or die, for death 
 is but a sleep to believers, as the apostles had before intimated) 
 <I>we should live together with Christ</I> live in union and in glory 
 with him for ever. And, as it is the salvation that Christians hope for 
 to <I>be for ever with the Lord,</I> so one foundation of their hope is 
 their union with him. And if they are united with Christ, and live in 
 him, and live to him, here, the sleep of death will be no prejudice to 
 the spiritual life, much less to the life of glory hereafter. On the 
 contrary, Christ died for us, that, living and dying, we might be his; 
 that we might live to him while we are here, and live with him when we 
 go hence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one
 another, even as also ye do.
 &nbsp; 12  And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour
 among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
 &nbsp; 13  And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's
 sake. <I>And</I> be at peace among yourselves.
 &nbsp; 14  Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly,
 comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all
 <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 15  See that none render evil for evil unto any <I>man;</I> but ever
 follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all
 <I>men.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle exhorts the Thessalonians to several 
 duties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Towards those who were nearly related one to another. Such should 
 comfort themselves, or exhort one another, and edify one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 1. They must comfort or exhort themselves and one another; for the 
 original word may be rendered both these ways. And we may observe, As 
 those are most able and likely to comfort others who can comfort 
 themselves, so the way to have comfort ourselves, or to administer 
 comfort to others, is by compliance with the exhortation of the word.
 Note, We should not only be careful about our own comfort and welfare, 
 but to promote the comfort and welfare of others also. He was a Cain 
 that said, <I>Am I my brother's keeper?</I> We <I>must bear one 
 another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</I> 

 2. They must edify one another, by <I>following after those things
 whereby one may edify another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:19">Rom. xiv. 19</A>.

 As Christians are lively stones built up together a spiritual house,
 they should endeavour to promote the good of the whole church by 
 promoting the work of grace in one another. And it is the duty of every 
 one of us to study that which is for the edification of those with whom 
 we converse, <I>to please all men for their</I> real <I>profit.</I> We 
 should communicate our knowledge and experiences one to another. We 
 should join in prayer and praise one with another. We should set a good 
 example one before another. And it is the duty of those especially who 
 live in the same vicinity and family thus to comfort and edify one 
 another; and this is the best neighbourhood, the best means to answer 
 the end of society. Such as are nearly related together and have
 affection for one another, as they have the greatest opportunity, so 
 they are under the greatest obligation, to do this kindness one to 
 another. This the Thessalonians did (<I>which also you do</I>), and 
 this is what they are exhorted to continue and increase in doing. Note, 
 Those who do that which is good have need of further exhortations to 
 excite them to do good, to do more good, as well as continue in doing 
 what they do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows them their duty towards their ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Though the apostle himself was driven from them, yet they had others 
 who laboured among them, and to whom they owed these duties. The 
 apostle here exhorts them to observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the ministers of the gospel are described by the work of their 
 office; and they should rather mind the work and duty they are called 
 to than affect venerable and honourable names that they may be called 
 by. Their work is very weighty, and very honourable and useful. 

 (1.) Ministers must labour among their people, labour with diligence, 
 and unto weariness (so the word in the original imports); <I>they must 
 labour in the word and doctrine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17">1 Tim. v. 17</A>.

 They are called labourers, and should not be loiterers. They must 
 labour with their people, to instruct, comfort, and edify them. And, 
 
 (2.) Ministers are to rule their people also, so the word is rendered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17">1 Tim. v. 17</A>.

 They must rule, not with rigour, but with love. They must not exercise 
 dominion as temporal lords; but rule as spiritual guides, by setting a 
 good example to the flock. They are over the people in the Lord, to 
 distinguish them from civil magistrates, and to denote also that they 
 are but ministers under Christ, appointed by him, and must rule the 
 people by Christ's laws, and not by laws of their own. This may also 
 intimate the end of their office and all their labour; namely, the 
 service and honour of the Lord. 

 (3.) They must also admonish the people, and that not only publicly, 
 but privately, as there may be occasion. They must instruct them to do 
 well, and should reprove when they do ill. It is their duty not only to 
 give good counsel, but also to give admonition, to give warning to the 
 flock of the dangers they are liable to, and reprove for negligence or 
 what else may be amiss.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the duty of the people is towards their ministers. There is a 
 mutual duty between ministers and people. If ministers should labour 
 among the people, then, 

 (1.) The people must know them. As the shepherd should know his flock, 
 so the sheep must know their shepherd. They must know his person, hear 
 his voice, acknowledge him for their pastor, and pay due regard to his 
 teaching, ruling, and admonitions. 

 (2.) They must esteem their ministers highly in love; they should 
 greatly value the office of the ministry, honour and love the persons 
 of their ministers, and show their esteem and affection in all proper 
 ways, and this for their work's sake, because their business is to 
 promote the honour of Christ and the welfare of men's souls. Note, 
 Faithful ministers ought to be so far from being lightly esteemed 
 because of their work that they should be highly esteemed on account of 
 it. The work of the ministry is so far from being a disgrace to those 
 who upon other accounts deserve esteem, that it puts an honour upon 
 those who are faithful and diligent, to which otherwise they could lay 
 no claim, and will procure them that esteem and love among good people 
 which otherwise they could not expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives divers other exhortations touching the duty Christians 
 owe to one another. 
 
 1. To <I>be at peace among themselves,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Some understand this exhortation (according to the reading in some 
 copies) as referring to the people's duty to their ministers, to live 
 peaceably with them, and not raise nor promote dissensions at any time 
 between minister and people, which will certainly prove a hindrance to 
 the success of a minister's work and the edification of the people. 
 This is certain, that ministers and people should avoid every thing 
 that tends to alienate their affections one from another. And the 
 people should be at peace among themselves, doing all they can to 
 hinder any differences from rising or continuing among them, and using 
 all proper means to preserve peace and harmony. 

 2. <I>To warn the unruly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 There will be in all societies some who walk disorderly, who go out of 
 their rank and station; and it is not only the duty of ministers, but 
 of private Christians also, to warn and admonish them. Such should be 
 reproved for their sin, warned of their danger, and told plainly of the 
 injury they do their own souls, and the hurt they may do to others. 
 Such should be put in mind of what they should do, and be reproved for 
 doing otherwise. 
 
 3. <I>To comfort the feebleminded,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 By these are intended the timorous and faint-hearted, or such as are 
 dejected and of a sorrowful spirit. Some are cowardly, afraid of 
 difficulties, and disheartened at the thoughts of hazards, and losses, 
 and afflictions; now such should be encouraged; we should not despise 
 them, but comfort them; and who knows what good a kind and comfortable 
 word may do them? 
 
 4. <I>To support the weak,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Some are not well able to perform their work, nor bear up under their 
 burdens; we should therefore support them, help their infirmities, and 
 lift at one end of the burden, and so help to bear it. It is the grace
 of God, indeed, that must strengthen and support such; but we should 
 tell them of that grace, and endeavour to minister of that grace to 
 them. 
 
 5. <I>To be patient towards all men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We must bear and forbear. We must be long-suffering, and suppress our
 anger, if it begin to rise upon the apprehension of affronts or 
 injuries; at least we must not fail to moderate our anger: and this 
 duty must be exercised towards all men, good and bad, high and low. We 
 must not be high in our expectations and demands, nor harsh in our 
 resentments, nor hard in our impositions, but endeavour to make the 
 best we can of every thing, and think the best we can of every body. 

 6. <I>Not to render evil for evil to any man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This we must look to, and be very careful about, that is, we must by 
 all means forbear to avenge ourselves. If others do us an injury, this 
 will not justify us in returning it, in doing the same, or the like, or
 any other injury to them. It becomes us to forgive, as those that are,
 and that hope to be, forgiven of God. 

 7. <I>Ever to follow that which is good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 In general, we must study to do what is our duty, and pleasing to God,
 in all circumstances, whether men do us good turns or ill turns; 
 whatever men do to us, we must do good to others. We must always 
 endeavour to be beneficent and instrumental to promote the welfare of 
 others, both among ourselves (in the first place to those that <I>are 
 of the household o faith</I>), and then, <I>as we have opportunity,
 unto all men,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have divers short exhortations, that will not burden our 
 memories, but will be of great use to direct the motions of our hearts 
 and lives; for the duties are of great importance, and we may observe 
 how they are connected together, and have a dependence upon one 
 another. 
 
 1. <I>Rejoice evermore,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This must be understood of spiritual joy; for we must rejoice in our
 creature-comforts as if we rejoiced not, and must not expect to live 
 many years, and rejoice in them all; but, if we do rejoice in God, we 
 may do that evermore. In him our joy will be full; and it is our fault 
 if we have not a continual feast. If we are sorrowful upon any worldly 
 account, yet still we may always rejoice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10">2 Cor. vi. 10</A>.

 Note, A religious life is a pleasant life, it is a life of constant
 joy. 
 
 2. <I>Pray without ceasing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, The way to rejoice evermore is to pray without ceasing. We should
 rejoice more if we prayed more. We should keep up stated times for 
 prayer, and continue instant in prayer. We should pray always, and not
 faint: pray without weariness, and continue in prayer, till we come to 
 that world where prayer shall be swallowed up in praise. The meaning is 
 not that men should do nothing but pray, but that nothing else we do 
 should hinder prayer in its proper season. Prayer will help forward and 
 not hinder all other lawful business, and every good work. 

 3. <I>In every thing give thanks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 If we pray without ceasing, we shall not want matter for thanksgiving 
 <I>in every thing.</I> As we must in every thing make our requests 
 known to God by supplications, so we must not omit thanksgiving, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Phil. iv. 6</A>.

 We should be thankful in every condition, even in adversity as well as
 prosperity. It is never so bad with us but it might be worse. If we
 have ever so much occasion to make our humble complaints to God, we 
 never can have any reason to complain of God, and have always much 
 reason to praise and give thanks: the apostle says, This is the <I>will 
 of God in Christ Jesus concerning us, that we give thanks,</I> seeing 
 God is reconciled to us in Christ Jesus; in him, through him, and for 
 his sake, he allows us to rejoice evermore, and appoints us in every 
 thing to give thanks. It is pleasing to God.

 4. <I>Quench not the Spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 for it is this Spirit of grace and supplication that helpeth our 
 infirmities, that assisteth us in our prayers and thanksgivings. 
 Christians are said to <I>be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with 
 fire.</I> He worketh as fire, by enlightening, enlivening, and 
 purifying the souls of men. We must be careful not to quench this holy 
 fire. As fire is put out by withdrawing fuel, so we quench the Spirit 
 if we do not stir up our spirits, and all that is within us, to comply 
 with the motions of the good Spirit; and as fire is quenched by pouring 
 water, or putting a great quantity of dirt upon it, so we must be 
 careful not to quench the Holy Spirit by indulging carnal lusts and 
 affections, or minding only earthly things. 

 5. <I>Despise not prophesyings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 for, if we neglect the means of grace, we forfeit the Spirit of grace. 
 By <I>prophesyings</I> here we are to understand the preaching of the 
 word, the interpreting and applying of the scriptures; and this we must 
 not despise, but should prize and value, because it is the ordinance of 
 God, appointed of him for our furtherance and increase in knowledge and 
 grace, in holiness and comfort. We must not despise preaching, though 
 it be plain, and not with enticing words of men's wisdom, and though we 
 be told no more than what we knew before. It is useful, and many times 
 needful, to have our minds stirred up, our affections and resolutions 
 excited, to those things that we knew before to be our interest and our 
 duty. 
 
 6. <I>Prove all things, but hold fast that which is good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This is a needful caution, to prove all things; for, though we must put 
 a value on preaching, we must not take things upon trust from the 
 preacher, but try them by the law and the testimony. We must search the 
 scriptures, whether what they say be true or not. We must not believe 
 every spirit, but must try the spirits. But we must not be always 
 trying, always unsettled; no, at length we must be settled, and hold 
 fast that which is good. When we are satisfied that any thing is right, 
 and true, and good, we must hold it fast, and not let it go, whatever 
 opposition or whatever persecution we meet with for the sake thereof.
 Note, The doctrines of human infallibility, implicit faith, and blind 
 obedience, are not the doctrines of the Bible. Every Christian has and 
 ought to have, the judgment of discretion, and should have <I>his 
 senses exercised in discerning between good and evil,</I> truth and 
 falsehood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:13,14">Heb. v. 13, 14</A>.

 And proving all things must be in order to holding fast that which is
 good. We must not always be seekers, or fluctuating in our minds,
 <I>like children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.</I> 

 7. <I>Abstain from all appearance of evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This is a good means to prevent our being deceived with false
 doctrines, or unsettled in our faith; for our Saviour has told us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>),

 <I>If a man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it 
 be of God.</I> Corrupt affections indulged in the heart, and evil 
 practices allowed of in the life, will greatly tend to promote fatal 
 errors in the mind; whereas purity of heart, and integrity of life, 
 will dispose men to receive the truth in the love of it. We should 
 therefore abstain from evil, and all appearances of evil, from sin, and 
 that which looks like sin, leads to it, and borders upon it. He who is
 not shy of the appearances of sin, who shuns not the occasions of sin, 
 and who avoids not the temptations and approaches to sin, will not long 
 abstain from the actual commission of sin.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words, which conclude this epistle, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's prayer for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He had told them, in the beginning of this epistle, that he always made 
 mention of them in his prayers; and, now that he is writing to them, he 
 lifts up his heart to God in prayer for them. Take notice, 

 1. To whom the apostle prays, namely, <I>The very God of peace.</I> He
 is the God of grace, and the God of peace and love. He is the author of 
 peace and lover of concord; and by their peaceableness and unity, from 
 God as the author, those things would best be obtained which he prays 
 for. 

 2. The things he prays for on behalf of the Thessalonians are their
 sanctification, that <I>God would sanctify them wholly;</I> and their 
 preservation, that they might be <I>preserved blameless.</I> He prays 
 that they may be wholly sanctified, that the whole man may be 
 sanctified, and then that the whole man, spirit, soul, and body, may be 
 preserved: or, he prays that they may be wholly sanctified, that is, 
 more perfectly, for the best are sanctified but in part while in this 
 world; and therefore we should pray for and press towards complete 
 sanctification. Where the good work of grace is begun, it shall be 
 carried on, be protected and preserved; and all those who are 
 sanctified in Christ Jesus shall be preserved to the coming of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ. And because, if God did not carry on his good work in the 
 soul, it would miscarry, we should pray to God to perfect his work, and 
 <I>preserve us blameless,</I> free from sin and impurity, till at 
 length we are <I>presented faultless before the throne of his glory 
 with exceeding joy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His comfortable assurance that God would hear his prayer: 
 <I>Faithful is he who calleth you, who will also do it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The kindness and love of God had appeared to them in calling them to 
 the knowledge of his truth, and the faithfulness of God was their 
 security that they should persevere to the end; and therefore, the 
 apostle assures them, God would do what he desired; he would effect 
 what he had promised; he would accomplish all the good pleasure of his 
 goodness towards them. Note, Our fidelity to God depends upon his 
 faithfulness to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His request of their prayers: <I>Brethren, pray for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 We should pray for one another; and brethren should thus express 
 brotherly love. This great apostle did not think it beneath him to call 
 the Thessalonians brethren, nor to request their prayers. Ministers 
 stand in need of their people's prayers; and the more people pray for 
 their ministers the more good ministers may have from God, and the more 
 benefit people may receive by their ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His salutation: <I>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Thus the apostle sends a friendly salutation from himself, and 
 Silvanus, and Timotheus, and would have them salute each other in their 
 names; and thus he would have them signify their mutual love and 
 affection to one another by the kiss of charity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:14">1 Pet. v. 14</A>),

 which is here called a holy kiss, to intimate how cautious they should 
 be of all impurity in the use of this ceremony, then commonly 
 practised; as it should not be a treacherous kiss like that of Judas, 
 so not a lascivious kiss like that of the harlot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:13">Prov. vii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His solemn charge for the reading of this epistle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 This is not only an exhortation, but an adjuration by the Lord. And 
 this epistle was to be read to all the holy brethren. It is not only 
 allowed to the common people to read the scriptures, and what none 
 should prohibit, but it is their indispensable duty, and what they 
 should be persuaded to do. In order to this, these holy oracles should 
 not be kept concealed in an unknown tongue, but translated into the 
 vulgar languages, that all men, being concerned to know the scriptures, 
 may be able to read them, and be acquainted with them. The public 
 reading of the law was one part of the worship of the sabbath among the 
 Jews in their synagogues, and the scriptures should be read in the 
 public assemblies of Christians also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostolical benediction that is usual in other epistles: <I>The 
 grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We need no more to make us happy than to know that grace which our Lord 
 Jesus Christ has manifested, be interested in that grace which he has 
 purchased, and partake of that grace which dwells in him as the head of 
 the church. This is an ever-flowing and overflowing fountain of grace 
 to supply all our wants.</P>
