 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter begins with an exhortation to progressive holiness and a 
 due regard to the ministers of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 Then the apostle returns from a long digression to speak further of the
 affair concerning the incestuous person, and tells them what comfort he
 received in his distress about that matter, upon his meeting with Titus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>),

 and how re rejoiced in their repentance, with the evidences thereof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 And, lastly, he concludes with endeavouring to comfort the Corinthians,
 upon whom his admonitions had had so good an effect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
 cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
 perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
 &nbsp; 2  Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man,
 we have defrauded no man.
 &nbsp; 3  I speak not <I>this</I> to condemn <I>you:</I> for I have said before,
 that ye are in our hearts to die and live with <I>you.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  Great <I>is</I> my boldness of speech toward you, great <I>is</I> my
 glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful
 in all our tribulation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses contain a double exhortation:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To make a progress in holiness, or <I>to perfect holiness in the 
 fear of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This exhortation is given with most tender affection to those who were 
 dearly beloved, and enforced by strong arguments, even the 
 consideration of those exceedingly great and precious promises which 
 were mentioned in the former chapter, and which the Corinthians had an 
 interest in and a title to. The promises of God are strong inducements 
 to sanctification, in both the branches thereof; namely, 

 1. The dying unto sin, or mortifying our lusts and corruptions: we must
 <I>cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit.</I> Sin 
 is filthiness, and there are defilements of body and mind. There are 
 sins of the flesh, that are committed with the body, and sins of the 
 spirit, spiritual wickednesses; and we must cleanse ourselves from the 
 filthiness of both, for God is to be glorified both with body and soul.
 
 2. The living unto righteousness and holiness. If we hope God is our
 Father, we must endeavour to be <I>partakers of his holiness,</I> to be 
 holy as he is holy, and perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect. We 
 must be still perfecting holiness, and not be contented with sincerity 
 (which is our gospel perfection), without aiming at sinless perfection, 
 though we shall always come short of it while we are in this world; and 
 this we must do in the <I>fear of God,</I> which is the root and 
 principle of all religion, and there is no holiness without it. Note, 
 Faith and hope in the promises of God must not destroy our fear of God, 
 <I>who taketh pleasure in those that fear him and hope in his 
 mercy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To show a due regard to the ministers of the gospel: <I>Receive 
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those who labour in the word and doctrine should <I>be had in 
 reputation,</I> and <I>be highly esteemed for their work's sake:</I> 
 and this would be a help to making progress in holiness. If the 
 ministers of the gospel are thought contemptible because of their 
 office, there is danger lest the gospel itself be contemned also. The 
 apostle did not think it any disparagement to court the favour of the 
 Corinthians; and, though we must flatter none, yet we must be gentle 
 towards all. He tells them, 

 1. He had done nothing to forfeit their esteem and good-will, but was
 cautious not to do any thing to deserve their ill-will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>We have wronged no man:</I> we have done you no harm, but always 
 designed your good." <I>I have coveted no man's silver, nor gold, nor 
 apparel,</I> said he to the elders of Ephesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:33">Acts xx. 33</A>.

 "<I>We have corrupted no man,</I> by false doctrines or flattering
 speeches. <I>We have defrauded no man;</I> we have not sought 
 ourselves, nor to promote our own secular interests by crafty and 
 greedy measures, to the damage of any persons." This is an appeal like 
 that of Samuel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:1-25">1 Sam. xii</A>.

 Note, Then may ministers the more confidently expect esteem and favour
 from the people when they can safely appeal to them that they are 
 guilty of nothing that deserves disesteem or displeasure. 

 2. He did not herein reflect upon them for want of affection to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 So tenderly and cautiously did the apostle deal with the Corinthians, 
 among whom there were some who would be glad of any occasion to 
 reproach him, and prejudice the minds of others against him. To prevent 
 any insinuations against him on account of what he had said, as if he 
 intended to charge them with wronging him, or unjust accusations of him 
 for having wronged them, he assures them again of his great affection 
 to them, insomuch that he could spend his last breath at Corinth, and 
 <I>live and die with them,</I> if his business with other churches, and 
 his work as an apostle (which was not to be confined to one place 
 only), would permit him to do so. An he adds it was his great affection 
 to them that made him use such <I>boldness</I> or freedom of <I>speech 
 towards them,</I> and caused him to <I>glory,</I> or make his boast of 
 them, in all places, and upon all occasions, being <I>filled with 
 comfort, and exceedingly joyful in all their tribulations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest,
 but we were troubled on every side; without <I>were</I> fightings,
 within <I>were</I> fears.
 &nbsp; 6  Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
 comforted us by the coming of Titus;
 &nbsp; 7  And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith
 he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire,
 your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced
 the more.
 &nbsp; 8  For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
 though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath
 made you sorry, though <I>it were</I> but for a season.
 &nbsp; 9  Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye
 sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly
 manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
 &nbsp; 10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
 repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
 &nbsp; 11  For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a
 godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, <I>what</I>
 clearing of yourselves, yea, <I>what</I> indignation, yea, <I>what</I>
 fear, yea, <I>what</I> vehement desire, yea, <I>what</I> zeal, yea, <I>what</I>
 revenge! In all <I>things</I> ye have approved yourselves to be clear
 in this matter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There seems to be a connection between 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:13,7:5"><I>ch.</I> ii. 13</A>

 (where the apostle said he had no rest in his spirit when he found not
 Titus at Troas) and the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:13,7:5">fifth verse of this chapter</A>:

 and so great was his affection to the Corinthians, and his concern
 about their behaviour in relation to the incestuous person, that, in 
 his further travels, he still had no rest till he heard from them. And 
 now he tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was distressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He was troubled when he did not meet with Titus at Troas, and 
 afterwards when for some time he did not meet with him in Macedonia: 
 this was a grief to him, because he could not hear what reception he 
 met with at Corinth, nor how their affairs went forward. And, besides 
 this, they met with other troubles, with incessant storms of 
 persecutions; there were <I>fightings without,</I> or continual 
 contentions with, and opposition from, Jews and Gentiles; and there 
 were <I>fears within,</I> and great concern for such as had embraced 
 the Christian faith, lest they should be corrupted or seduced, and give 
 scandal to others, or be scandalized.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was comforted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. The very coming of Titus was some comfort to him. It was matter of 
 joy to see him, whom he long desired and expected to meet with. The 
 very coming of Titus and his company, who was dear to him as his <I>own 
 son in the common faith</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:4">Tit. i. 4</A>),

 was a great comfort to the apostle in his travels and troubles. But, 

 2. The good news which Titus brought concerning the Corinthians was
 matter of greater consolation. He found Titus to be comforted in them; 
 and this filled the apostle with comfort, especially when he acquainted 
 him with their earnest desire to give good satisfaction in the things 
 about which the apostle had written to them; and of their mourning for 
 the scandal that was found among them and the great grief they had 
 caused to others, and their fervent mind or great affection towards the 
 apostle, who had dealt so faithfully with them in reproving their 
 faults: so true is the observation of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:23">Prov. xxviii. 23</A>),

 <I>He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he 
 that flattereth with his tongue.</I> 

 3. He ascribes all his comfort to God as the author. It was God who
 comforted him by the coming of Titus, even the God of all comfort: 
 <I>God, who comforteth those that are cast down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, We should look above and beyond all means and instruments, unto 
 God, as the author of all the consolation and the good that we 
 enjoy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How greatly he rejoiced at their repentance, and the evidences 
 thereof. The apostle was sorry that he had grieved them, that some 
 pious persons among them laid to heart very greatly what he said in his 
 former epistle, or that it was needful he should make those sorry whom 
 he would rather have made glad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 But now he rejoiced, when he found they had <I>sorrowed to 
 repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Their sorrow in itself was not the cause of his rejoicing; but the 
 nature of it, and the effect of it (<I>repentance unto salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 made him rejoice; for now it appeared that they had received damage by 
 him in nothing. Their sorrow was <I>but for a season;</I> it was turned 
 into joy, and that joy was durable. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The antecedent of true repentance is godly sorrow; this worketh 
 repentance. It is not repentance itself, but it is a good preparative 
 to repentance, and in some sense the cause that produces repentance. 
 The offender had great sorrow, he was in danger of being <I>swallowed 
 up with overmuch sorrow;</I> and the society was greatly sorrowful 
 which before was puffed up: and this sorrow of theirs was after a godly 
 manner, or according to God (as it is in the original), that is, it was 
 according to the will of God, tended to the glory of God, and was 
 wrought by the Spirit of God. It was a godly sorrow, because a sorrow 
 for sin, as an offence against God, an instance of ingratitude, and a 
 forfeiture of God's favour. There is a great difference between this 
 sorrow of a godly sort and the sorrow of this world. Godly sorrow 
 produces repentance and reformation, and will end in salvation; but 
 worldly sorrow worketh death. The sorrows of worldly men for worldly 
 things will bring down gray hairs the sooner to the grave, and such a 
 sorrow even for sin as Judas had will have fatal consequences, as his 
 had, which wrought death. Note, 

 (1.) Repentance will be attended with salvation. Therefore, 

 (2.) True penitents will never repent that they have repented, nor of 
 any thing that was conducive thereto. 

 (3.) Humiliation and godly sorrow are previously necessary in order to 
 repentance, and both of them are from God, the giver of all grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The happy fruits and consequences of true repentance are mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 and those <I>fruits that are meet for repentance</I> are the best 
 evidences of it. Where the heart is changed, the life and actions will 
 be changed too. The Corinthians made it evident that their sorrow was a 
 godly sorrow, and such as wrought repentance, because it wrought in 
 them great carefulness about their souls, and to avoid sin, and please 
 God; it wrought also a clearing of themselves, not by insisting upon 
 their own justification before God, especially while they persisted in 
 their sin, but by endeavours to put away the accursed thing, and so 
 free themselves from the just imputation of approving the evil that had 
 been done. It wrought indignation at sin, at themselves, at the tempter 
 and his instruments; it wrought fear, a fear of reverence, a fear of 
 watchfulness, and a fear of distrust, not a distrust of God, but of 
 themselves; an awful fear of God, a cautious fear of sin, and a jealous 
 fear of themselves. It wrought vehement desires after a thorough 
 reformation of what had been amiss, and of reconciliation with God whom 
 they had offended. It wrought zeal, a mixture of love and anger, a zeal 
 for duty, and against sin. It wrought, lastly, revenge against sin and 
 their own folly, by endeavours to make all due satisfaction for 
 injuries that might be done thereby. And thus <I>in all things had
 they approved themselves to be clear in that matter.</I> Not that they 
 were innocent, but that they were penitent, and therefore clear of 
 guilt before God, who would pardon and not punish them; and they ought 
 no longer to be reproved, much less to be reproached, by men, for what 
 they had truly repented of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, <I>I did it</I> not for his
 cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered
 wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear
 unto you.
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and
 exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his
 spirit was refreshed by you all.
 &nbsp; 14  For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not
 ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our
 boasting, which <I>I made</I> before Titus, is found a truth.
 &nbsp; 15  And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst
 he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and
 trembling ye received him.
 &nbsp; 16  I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
 <I>things.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle endeavours to comfort the Corinthians, upon 
 whom his admonitions had had such good effect. And in order thereto, 

 1. He tells them he had a good design in his former epistle, which
 might be thought severe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was not chiefly <I>for his cause that did the wrong,</I> not only 
 for his benefit, much less merely that he should be punished; nor was 
 it merely <I>for his cause that suffered wrong,</I> namely, the injured 
 father, and that he might have what satisfaction could be given him; 
 but it was also to manifest his great and sincere concern and <I>care 
 for them,</I> for the whole church, lest that should suffer by letting 
 such a crime, and the scandal thereof, remain among them without due 
 remark and resentment. 

 2. He acquaints them with the joy of Titus as well as of himself upon
 the account of their repentance and good behaviour. Titus was rejoiced, 
 and his spirit refreshed, with their comfort, and this comforted and 
 rejoiced the apostle also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and, as Titus was comforted while he was with them, so when he 
 remembered his reception among them, expressing their obedience to the 
 apostolical directions, and their fear and trembling at the reproofs 
 that were given them, the thoughts of these things inflamed and 
 increased his affections to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Note, Great comfort and joy follow upon godly sorrow. As sin occasions 
 general grief, so repentance and reformation occasion general joy. Paul 
 was glad, and Titus was glad, and the Corinthians were comforted, and 
 the penitent ought to be comforted; and well may all this joy be on 
 earth, when there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. 

 3. He concludes this whole matter with expressing the entire
 confidence he had in them: He was not ashamed of his boasting 
 concerning them to Titus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 for he was not disappointed in his expectation concerning them, which 
 he signified to Titus, and he could now with great joy declare what 
 confidence he still had in them as to all things, that he did not doubt 
 of their good behaviour for the time to come. Note, It is a great 
 comfort and joy to a faithful minister to have to do with a people whom 
 he can confide in, and who he has reason to hope will comply with every 
 thing he proposes to them that is for the glory of God, the credit of 
 the gospel, and their advantage.</P>
