 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
 crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
 &nbsp; 2  In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
 river, <I>was there</I> the tree of life, which bare twelve <I>manner
 of</I> fruits, <I>and</I> yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves
 of the tree <I>were</I> for the healing of the nations.
 &nbsp; 3  And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and
 of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:
 &nbsp; 4  And they shall see his face; and his name <I>shall be</I> in their
 foreheads.
 &nbsp; 5  And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
 neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and
 they shall reign for ever and ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The heavenly state which was before described as a city, and called the 
 new Jerusalem, is here described as a paradise, alluding to the earthly 
 paradise which was lost by the sin of the first Adam; here is another 
 paradise restored by the second Adam. A paradise in a city, or a whole
 city in a paradise! In the first paradise there were only two persons 
 to behold the beauty and taste the pleasures of it; but in this second 
 paradise whole cities and nations shall find abundant delight and 
 satisfaction. And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The river of paradise. The earthly paradise was well watered: no 
 place can be pleasant or fruitful that is not so. This river is 
 described, 

 1. By its fountain-head--<I>the throne of God and the Lamb.</I> All our
 springs of grace, comfort, and glory, are in God; and all our streams 
 from him are through the mediation of the Lamb. 

 2. By its quality--<I>pure and clear as crystal.</I> All the streams of
 earthly comfort are muddy; but these are clear, salutary, and 
 refreshing, giving life, and preserving life, to those who drink of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tree of life, in this paradise. Such a tree there was in the 
 earthly paradise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:9">Gen. ii. 9</A>.

 This far excels it. And now, as to this tree, observe,

 1. The situation of it--<I>in the midst of the street, and on either
 side the river;</I> or, as might have been better rendered, <I>in the 
 midst between the terrace-walk and the river.</I> This tree of life is 
 fed by the pure waters of the river that comes from the throne of God. 
 The presence and perfections of God furnish out all the glory and 
 blessedness of heaven. 
 
 2. The fruitfulness of this tree.

 (1.) It brings forth many sorts of fruit--<I>twelve sorts,</I> suited 
 to the refined taste of all the saints. 

 (2.) It brings forth fruit at all times--<I>yields its fruit every 
 month.</I> This tree is never empty, never barren; there is always 
 fruit upon it. In heaven there is not only a variety of pure and 
 satisfying pleasures, but a continuance of them, and always fresh. 

 (3.) The fruit is not only pleasant, but wholesome. The presence of God 
 in heaven is the health and happiness of the saints; there they find in 
 him a remedy for all their former maladies, and are preserved by him in 
 the most healthful and vigorous state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The perfect freedom of this paradise from every thing that is evil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>There shall be no more curse;</I> no <I>accursed 
 one</I>--<B><I>katanathema,</I></B> no serpent there, as there was in 
 the earthly paradise. Here is the great excellency of this paradise.
 The devil has nothing to do there; he cannot draw the saints from 
 serving God to be subject to himself, as he did our first parents, nor 
 can he so much as disturb them in the service of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The supreme felicity of this paradisiacal state. 

 1. There the saints shall see the face of God; there they shall enjoy
 the beatific vision. 

 2. God will own them, as having his seal and name on their foreheads.
 
 3. <I>They shall reign with him for ever;</I> their service shall be
 not only freedom but honour and dominion. 

 4. All this shall be with perfect knowledge and joy. They shall be full
 of wisdom and comfort, continually walking in the light of the Lord; 
 and this not for a time, <I>but for ever and ever.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And he said unto me, These sayings <I>are</I> faithful and true:
 and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto
 his servants the things which must shortly be done.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, I come quickly: blessed <I>is</I> he that keepeth the
 sayings of the prophecy of this book.
 &nbsp; 8  And I John saw these things, and heard <I>them.</I> And when I had
 heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the
 angel which showed me these things.
 &nbsp; 9  Then saith he unto me, See <I>thou do it</I> not: for I am thy
 fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them
 which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.
 &nbsp; 10  And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy
 of this book: for the time is at hand.
 &nbsp; 11  He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
 filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
 him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
 still.
 &nbsp; 12  And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward <I>is</I> with me, to
 give every man according as his work shall be.
 &nbsp; 13  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first
 and the last.
 &nbsp; 14  Blessed <I>are</I> they that do his commandments, that they may
 have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
 gates into the city.
 &nbsp; 15  For without <I>are</I> dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
 murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
 &nbsp; 16  I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these
 things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David,
 <I>and</I> the bright and morning star.
 &nbsp; 17  And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
 heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
 whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.
 &nbsp; 18  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
 prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
 God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
 &nbsp; 19  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
 this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
 life, and out of the holy city, and <I>from</I> the things which are
 written in this book.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a solemn ratification of the contents of this book, and 
 particularly of this last vision (though some think it may not only 
 refer to the whole book, but to the whole New Testament, yea, to the 
 whole Bible, completing and confirming the can on of scripture); and
 here, 

 1. This is confirmed by the name and nature of that God who gave out
 these discoveries: he is <I>the Lord God, faithful and true,</I> and so
 are all his sayings. 

 2. By the messengers he chose, to reveal these things to the world; the
 holy angels showed them to holy men of God; and God would not employ 
 his saints and angels in deceiving the world.

 3. They will soon be confirmed by their accomplishment: they are things
 that must shortly be done; Christ will make haste, <I>he will come 
 quickly,</I> and put all things out of doubt; and then those will prove 
 the wise and happy men who have believed and kept his words. 

 4. By the integrity of that angel who had been the apostle's guide and
 interpreter in these visions; this integrity was such that he not only 
 refused to accept religious adoration from John, but once and again 
 reproved him for it. He who was so tender of the honour of God, and so 
 displeased with what was a wrong to God, would never come in his name 
 to lead the people of God into mere dreams and delusions; and it is a 
 still further confirmation of the sincerity of this apostle that he 
 confesses his own sin and folly, into which he had now again relapsed, 
 and he leaves this his failing on perpetual record: this shows he was a 
 faithful and an impartial writer. 

 5. By the order given to leave the book of the prophecy open, to be
 perused by all, that they might labour to understand it, that they 
 might make their objections against it, and compare the prophecy with 
 the events. God here deals freely and openly with all; he does not 
 speak in secret, but calls every one to witness to the declarations 
 here made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 6. By the effect this book, thus kept open, will have upon men; those 
 that are filthy and unjust will take occasion thence to be more so, but 
 it will confirm, strengthen, and further sanctify those that are 
 upright with God; it will be a savour of life to some and of death to 
 others, and so will appear to be from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 7. It will be Christ's rule of judgment at the great day; he will 
 dispense rewards and punishments to men according as their works agree 
 or disagree with the word of God; and therefore that word itself must 
 needs be faithful and true. 

 8. It is the word of him who is the author, finisher, and rewarder of
 the faith and holiness of his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 He is <I>the first and the last,</I> and the same from first to last, 
 and so is his word too; and he will by this word give to his people, 
 who conform themselves to it, <I>a right to the tree of life,</I> and 
 an entrance into heaven; and this will be a full confirmation of the 
 truth and authority of his word, since it contains the title and 
 evidence of that confirmed state of holiness and happiness that remains 
 for his people in heaven. 

 9. It is a book that condemns and excludes from heaven all wicked,
 unrighteous persons, and particularly <I>those that love and make 
 lies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and therefore can never be itself a lie. 

 10. It is confirmed by <I>the testimony of Jesus, which is the Spirit 
 of prophecy.</I> And this Jesus, as God, is <I>the root of David,</I> 
 though, as man, his offspring--a person in whom all uncreated and 
 created excellencies meet, too great and too good to deceive his 
 churches and the world. He is the fountain of all light, the <I>bright 
 and the morning star,</I> and as such has given to his churches this 
 morning light of prophecy, to assure them of the light of that perfect 
 day which is approaching.

 11. It is confirmed by an open and general invitation to all to come
 and partake of the promises and privileges of the gospel, those streams 
 of the water of life; these are tendered to all who feel in their souls 
 a thirst which nothing in this world can quench. 

 12. It is confirmed by the joint testimony of the Spirit of God, and
 that gracious Spirit that is in all the true members of the church of 
 God; <I>the Spirit and the bride</I> join in testifying the truth and 
 excellency of the gospel.

 13. It is confirmed by a most solemn sanction, condemning and cursing
 all who should dare to corrupt or change the word of God, either by 
 adding to it or taking from it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 He that adds to the word of God draws down upon himself <I>all the 
 plagues written in this book;</I> and he who takes any thing away from 
 it cuts himself off from all the promises and privileges of it. This
 sanction is like a flaming sword, to guard the canon of the scripture 
 from profane hands. Such a fence as this God set about the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2">Deut. iv. 2</A>),

 and the whole Old Testament

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4">Mal. iv. 4</A>),

 and now in the most solemn manner about the whole Bible, assuring us 
 that it is a book of the most sacred nature, divine authority, and of 
 the last importance, and therefore the peculiar care of the great 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come
 quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
 &nbsp; 21  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with you all. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have now come to the conclusion of the whole, and that in three 
 things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's farewell to his church. He seems now, after he has been 
 discovering these things to his people on earth, to take leave of them, 
 and return to heaven; but he parts with them in great kindness, and 
 assures them it shall not be long before he comes again to them: 
 <I>Behold, I come quickly.</I> As when he ascended into heaven, after 
 his resurrection, he parted with a promise of his gracious presence, so 
 here he parts with a promise of a speedy return. If any say, "Where is 
 the promise of his coming, when so many ages have passed since this was 
 written?" let them know he is not slack to his people, but 
 long-suffering to his enemies: his coming will be sooner than they are 
 aware, sooner than they are prepared, sooner than they desire; and to 
 his people it will be seasonable. The vision is for an appointed time, 
 and will not tarry. <I>He will come quickly;</I> let this word be 
 always sounding in our ear, and let us give all diligence that we may 
 be found of him in peace, <I>without spot and blameless.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The church's hearty echo to Christ's promise, 

 1. Declaring her firm belief of it: <I>Amen, so it is,</I> so it shall
 be. 

 2. Expressing her earnest desire of it: <I>Even so, come, Lord Jesus;
 make hast, my beloved, and be thou like a roe, or like a young hart on 
 the mountain of spices.</I> Thus beats the pulse of the church, thus 
 breathes that gracious Spirit which actuates and informs the mystical 
 body of Christ; and we should never be satisfied till we find such a 
 spirit breathing in us, and causing us to <I>look for the blessed hope, 
 and glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jesus 
 Christ.</I> This is the language of the church of the first-born, and 
 we should join with them, often putting ourselves in mind of his 
 promise. What comes from heaven in a promise should be sent back to 
 heaven in a prayer, "<I>Come, Lord Jesus,</I> put an end to this state 
 of sin, sorrow, and temptation; gather thy people out of this present 
 evil world, and take them up to heaven, that state of perfect purity, 
 peace, and joy, and so finish thy great design, and fulfil all that 
 word in which thou hast caused thy people to hope."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostolical benediction, which closes the whole: <I>The grace 
 of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen.</I> Here observe, 

 1. The Bible ends with a clear proof of the Godhead of Christ, since
 the Spirit of God teaches the apostle to bless his people in the name 
 of Christ, and to beg from Christ a blessing for them, which is a 
 proper act of adoration. 

 2. Nothing should be more desired by us than that the grace of Christ
 may be with us in this world, to prepare us for the glory of Christ in 
 the other world. It is by his grace that we must be kept in a joyful 
 expectation of his glory, fitted for it, and preserved to it; and his 
 glorious appearance will be welcome and joyful to those that are 
 partakers of his grace and favour here; and therefore to this most 
 comprehensive prayer we should all add our hearty <I>Amen,</I> most 
 earnestly thirsting after greater measures of the gracious influences 
 of the blessed Jesus in our souls, and his gracious presence with us, 
 till glory has perfected all his grace towards us, for he is a sun and 
 a shield, <I>he gives grace and glory, and no good thing will he 
 withhold from those that walk uprightly.</I></P>
