 In this chapter we have an account of the pouring forth of these vials
 that were filled with the wrath of God. They were poured out upon the
 whole antichristian empire, and on every thing appertaining to it. 
 
 I. Upon the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. Upon the sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. Upon the rivers and fountains of water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:4">ver. 4</A>.

 Here the heavenly hosts proclaim and applaud the righteousness of the
 judgments of God.

 IV. The fourth vial was poured out on the sun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:8">ver. 8</A>.

 V. The fifth on the seat of the beast. 

 VI. The sixth on the river Euphrates. 

 VII. The seventh in the air, upon which the cities of the nations fell, 
 and great Babylon came in remembrance before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the
 seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath
 of God upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 2  And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;
 and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had
 the mark of the beast, and <I>upon</I> them which worshipped his
 image.
 &nbsp; 3  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
 became as the blood of a dead <I>man:</I> and every living soul died
 in the sea.
 &nbsp; 4  And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
 fountains of waters; and they became blood.
 &nbsp; 5  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous,
 O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast
 judged thus.
 &nbsp; 6  For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
 hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
 &nbsp; 7  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
 Almighty, true and righteous <I>are</I> thy judgments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We had in the foregoing chapter the great and solemn preparation that 
 was made for the pouring out of the vials; now we have the performance 
 of that work. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, though every thing was made ready before, yet nothing was to 
 be put in execution without an immediate positive order from God; and 
 this he gave out of the temple, answering the prayers of his people, 
 and avenging their quarrel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. No sooner was the word of command given than it was immediately 
 obeyed; no delay, no objection made. We find that some of the best men, 
 as Moses and Jeremiah, did not so readily come in and comply with the 
 call of God to their work; but the angels of God excel not only in 
 strength, but in a readiness to do the will of God. God says, <I>Go 
 your ways, and pour out the vials,</I> and immediately the work is 
 begun. We are taught to pray that the will of God may be done on earth 
 as it is done in heaven. And now we enter upon a series of very
 terrible dispensations of Providence, of which it is difficult to give 
 the certain meaning or to make the particular application. But in the 
 general it is worth our observation that,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We have here a reference and allusion to several of the plagues of 
 Egypt, such as the turning of their waters into blood, and smiting them 
 with boils and sores. Their sins were alike, and so were their 
 punishments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These vials have a plain reference to the seven trumpets, which 
 represented the rise of antichrist; and we learn hence that the fall of 
 the church's enemies shall bear some resemblance to their rise, and 
 that God can bring them down in such ways as they chose to exalt 
 themselves. And the fall of antichrist shall be gradual; as Rome was 
 not built in one day, so neither shall it fall in one day, but it falls 
 by degrees; it shall fall so as to rise no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The fall of the antichristian interest shall be universal. Every 
 thing that any ways belonged to them, or could be serviceable to them, 
 the premises and all their appurtenances, are put into the writ for 
 destruction: their earth, their air, their sea, their rivers, their 
 cities, all consigned over to ruin, all accursed for the sake of the 
 wickedness of that people. Thus the creation groans and suffers through 
 the sins of men. Now we proceed to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The first angel who poured out his vial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Where it fell--<I>upon the earth;</I> that is, say some, upon the 
 common people; others upon the body of the Romish clergy, who were the 
 basis of the papacy, and of an earthly spirit, all carrying on earthly 
 designs.

 [2.] What it produced--<I>noisome and grievous sores on all who had the 
 mark of the beast.</I> They had marked themselves by their sin; now God 
 marks them out by his judgments. This sore, some think, signifies some 
 of the first appearances of Providence against their state and interest 
 which gave them great uneasiness, as it discovered their inward 
 distemper and was a token of further evil; the plague--tokens 
 appeared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>The second angel poured out his vial;</I> and here we see, 

 [1.] Where it fell--<I>upon the sea;</I> that is, say some, upon the 
 jurisdiction and dominion of the papacy; others upon the whole system 
 of their religion, their false doctrines, their corrupt glosses, their 
 superstitious rites, their idolatrous worship, their pardons, 
 indulgences, a great conflux of wicked inventions and institutions, by 
 which they maintain a trade and traffic advantageous to themselves, but 
 injurious to all who deal with them.

 [2.] What it produced: It turned the sea into blood, <I>as the blood of 
 a dead man, and every living soul died in the sea.</I> God discovered 
 not only the vanity and falsehood of their religion, but the pernicious 
 and deadly nature of it--that the souls of men were poisoned by that 
 which was pretended to be the sure means of their salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The next angel poured out his vial; and we are told, 

 [1.] Where it fell--<I>upon the rivers, and upon the fountains of 
 waters;</I> that is, say some very learned men, upon their emissaries, 
 and especially the Jesuits, who, like streams, conveyed the venom and 
 poison of their errors and idolatries from the spring-head through the 
 earth.

 [2.] What effect it had upon them: <I>It turned them into blood;</I> 
 some think it stirred up Christian princes to take a just revenge upon 
 those that had been the great incendiaries of the world, and had 
 occasioned the shedding of the blood of armies and of martyrs. The 
 following doxology

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>)

 favours this sense. The instrument that God makes use of in this work 
 is here called <I>the angel of the waters,</I> who extols the 
 righteousness of God in this retaliation: <I>They have shed the blood 
 of thy saints, and thou hast given them blood to drink, for they are 
 worthy,</I> to which another angel answered by full consent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and
 power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
 &nbsp; 9  And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the
 name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they
 repented not to give him glory.
 &nbsp; 10  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
 beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed
 their tongues for pain,
 &nbsp; 11  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and
 their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we see the work going on in the appointed order. The 
 fourth angel poured out his vial, and that fell upon the sun; that is, 
 say some, upon some eminent prince of the popish communion, who should 
 renounce their false religion a little while before his utter downfall; 
 and some expect it will be the German emperor. And now what will be the 
 consequence of this? That sun which before cherished them with warm and 
 benign influences shall now grow hot against these idolaters, and shall 
 scorch them. Princes shall use their power and authority to suppress 
 them, which yet will be so far from bringing them to repentance, that 
 it will cause them to curse God and their king, and look upward, 
 throwing out their blasphemous speeches against the God of heaven; they 
 will be hardened to their ruin. The fifth angel poured out his vial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 And observe,

 1. Where this fell--<I>upon the seat of the beast,</I> upon Rome
 itself, the mystical Babylon, the head of the antichristian empire. 

 2. What effect it had there: The whole kingdom of the beast <I>was
 full of darkness</I> and distress. That very city which was the seat of 
 their policy, the source of all their learning, and all their 
 knowledge, and all their pomp and pleasure, now becomes a source of 
 darkness, and pain, and anguish. Darkness was one of the plagues of 
 Egypt, and it is opposed to lustre and honour, and so forebodes the 
 contempt and scorn to which the antichristian interest should be 
 exposed. Darkness is opposed to wisdom and penetration, and forebodes 
 the confusion and folly which the idolaters should discover at that 
 time. It is opposed to pleasure and joy, and so signifies their anguish 
 and vexation of Spirit, when their calamities thus came upon them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
 Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
 the kings of the east might be prepared.
 &nbsp; 13  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <I>come</I> out of the
 mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out
 of the mouth of the false prophet.
 &nbsp; 14  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
 <I>which</I> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole
 world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God
 Almighty.
 &nbsp; 15  Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <I>is</I> he that watcheth,
 and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
 shame.
 &nbsp; 16  And he gathered them together into a place called in the
 Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The sixth angel poured out his vial;</I> and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Where it fell--<I>upon the great river Euphrates.</I> Some take it
 literally, for the place where the Turkish power and empire began; and 
 they think this is a prophecy of the destruction of the Turkish 
 monarchy and of idolatry, which they suppose will be effected about the 
 same time with that of the papacy, as another antichrist, and that 
 thereby a way shall be made for the conveniency of the Jews, those 
 princes of the east. Others take it for the river Tiber; for, as Rome 
 is mystical Babylon, Tiber is mystical Euphrates. And when Rome shall 
 be destroyed her river and merchandise must suffer with her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What did this vial produce? 

 1. The drying up of the river, which furnished the city with wealth,
 provisions, and all sorts of accommodations. 

 2. A way is hereby prepared <I>for the kings of the east.</I> The
 idolatry of the church of Rome had been a great hindrance both to the 
 conversion of the Jews, who have been long cured of their inclination 
 to idols, and of the Gentiles, who are hardened in their idolatry by 
 seeing that which so much symbolizes with it among those called 
 Christians. It is therefore very probable that the downfall of popery, 
 removing these obstructions, will open a way for both the Jews and 
 other eastern nations to come into the church of Christ. And, if we 
 suppose that Mahomedism shall fall at the same time, there will be 
 still a more open communication between the western and eastern 
 nations, which may facilitate the conversion of the Jews, and of <I>the 
 fulness of the Gentiles.</I> And when this work of God appears, and is 
 about to be accomplished, no wonder if it occasion another consequence, 
 which is, 

 3. The last effort of the great dragon; he is resolved to have another
 push for it, that, if possible, he may retrieve the ruinous posture of 
 his affairs in the world. He is now rallying his forces, recollecting 
 all his spirits, to make one desperate sally before all be lost. This 
 is occasioned by the pouring out of the sixth vial. Here observe,

 (1.) The instruments he makes use of to engage the powers of the earth 
 in his cause and quarrel: <I>Three unclean spirits like frogs</I> come 
 forth, one <I>out of the mouth of the dragon,</I> another <I>out of the 
 mouth of the beast, and</I> a third <I>out of the mouth of the false 
 prophet.</I> Hell, the secular power of antichrist, and the 
 ecclesiastical power, would combine to send their several instruments, 
 furnished with hellish malice, with worldly policy, and with religious 
 falsehood and deceit; and these would muster up the devil's forces for 
 a decisive battle. 

 (2.) The means these instruments would use to engage the powers of 
 earth in this war. They would work pretended miracles, the old 
 stratagem of him <I>whose coming is after the working of Satan, with 
 all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of 
 unrighteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:9,10">2 Thess. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 Some think that a little before the fall of antichrist the popish
 pretence of power to work miracles will be revived and will very much 
 amuse and deceive the world. 

 (3.) The field of battle--a place called <I>Armageddon;</I> that is, 
 say some, the mount of Megiddo, near to which, by a stream issuing 
 thence, Barak overcame Sisera, and all the kings in alliance with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:19">Judges v. 19</A>.

 And in the valley of Megiddo Josiah was slain. This place had been
 famous for two events of a very different nature, the former very happy 
 for the church of God, the latter very unhappy; but it shall now be the 
 field of the last battle in which the church shall be engaged, and she 
 shall be victorious. This battle required time to prepare for it, and 
 therefore the further account of it is suspended till we come to the 
 nineteenth chapter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 (4.) The warning which God gives of this great and decisive trial, to 
 engage his people to prepare for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It would be sudden and unexpected, and therefore Christians should be 
 clothed, and armed, and ready for it, that they might not be surprised 
 and ashamed. When God's cause comes to be tried, and his battles to be
 fought, all his people shall be ready to stand up for his interest and 
 be faithful and valiant in his service.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
 there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
 throne, saying, It is done.
 &nbsp; 18  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and
 there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon
 the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <I>and</I> so great.
 &nbsp; 19  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the
 cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance
 before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the
 fierceness of his wrath.
 &nbsp; 20  And every island fled away, and the mountains were not
 found.
 &nbsp; 21  And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <I>every
 stone</I> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
 because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was
 exceeding great.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have an account of the seventh and last angel pouring forth his 
 vial, contributing his part towards the accomplishment of the downfall 
 of Babylon, which was the finishing stroke. And here, as before, 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Where this plague fell--<I>on the air,</I> upon the prince of the
 power of the air, that is, the devil. His powers were restrained, his 
 policies confounded; he was bound in God's chain: the sword of God was 
 upon his eye and upon his arm; for he, as well as the powers of the 
 earth, is subject to the almighty power of God. He had used all 
 possible means to preserve the antichristian interest, and to prevent 
 the fall of Babylon--all the influence that he has upon the minds of
 men, blinding their judgments and perverting them, hardening their 
 hearts, raising their enmity to the gospel as high as could be. But now 
 here is a vial poured out upon his kingdom, and he is not able to 
 support his tottering cause and interest any longer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it produced, 

 1. A thankful voice from heaven, pronouncing that now the work was
 done. The church triumphant in heaven saw it, and rejoiced; the church 
 militant on earth saw it, and became triumphant. It is finished.

 2. A mighty commotion on the earth--an earthquake, so great as never
 was before, shaking the very centre, and this ushered in by the usual 
 concomitants of thunder and lightnings. 

 3. The fall of Babylon, which was divided into three parts, <I>called
 the cities of the nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 having had rule over the nations, and taken in the idolatry of the 
 nations, incorporating into her religion something of the Jewish, 
 something of the pagan, and something of the Christian religion, she 
 was as three cities in one. God now remembered this great and wicked 
 city. Though for some time he seemed to have forgotten her idolatry and 
 cruelty, yet now he gives unto her <I>the cup of the wine of the 
 fierceness of his wrath.</I> And this downfall extended further than to 
 the seat of antichrist; it reached from the centre to the 
 circumference; and every island and every mountain, that seemed by 
 nature and situation the most secured, were carried away in the deluge 
 of this ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How the antichristian party were affected with it. Though it fell 
 upon them as a dreadful storm, as if the stones of the city, tossed up 
 into the air, came down upon their heads, like hailstones of a talent 
 weight each, yet they were so far from repenting that they blasphemed
 that God who thus punished them. Here was a dreadful plague of the 
 heart, a spiritual judgment more dreadful and destructive than all the 
 rest. Observe, 

 1. The greatest calamities that can befal men will not bring them to
 repentance without the grace of God working with them. 

 2. Those that are not made better by the judgments of God are always
 the worse for them. 

 3. To be hardened in sin and enmity against God by his righteous
 judgments is a certain token of utter destruction.</P>
