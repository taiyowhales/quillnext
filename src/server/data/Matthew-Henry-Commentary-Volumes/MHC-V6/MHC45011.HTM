 The apostle, having reconciled that great truth of the rejection of the
 Jews with the promise made unto the fathers, is, in this chapter,
 further labouring to mollify the harshness of it, and to reconcile it
 to the divine goodness in general. It might be said, "Hath God then
 cast away his people?" The apostles therefore sets himself, in this
 chapter, to make a reply to this objection, and that two ways:--

 I. He shows at large what the mercy is that is mixed with this wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-32">ver. 1-32</A>.

 II. He infers thence the infinite wisdom and sovereignty of God, with
 the adoration of which he concludes this chapter and subject,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I
 also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <I>of</I> the tribe of
 Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 2  God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye
 not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession
 to God against Israel, saying,
 &nbsp; 3  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine
 altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
 &nbsp; 4  But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
 myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <I>the
 image of</I> Baal.
 &nbsp; 5  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
 according to the election of grace.
 &nbsp; 6  And if by grace, then <I>is it</I> no more of works: otherwise
 grace is no more grace. But if <I>it be</I> of works, then is it no
 more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
 &nbsp; 7  What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh
 for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
 &nbsp; 8  (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit
 of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they
 should not hear;) unto this day.
 &nbsp; 9  And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
 and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
 &nbsp; 10  Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow
 down their back alway.
 &nbsp; 11  I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
 forbid: but <I>rather</I> through their fall salvation <I>is come</I> unto
 the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
 &nbsp; 12  Now if the fall of them <I>be</I> the riches of the world, and
 the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
 their fulness?
 &nbsp; 13  For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of
 the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
 &nbsp; 14  If by any means I may provoke to emulation <I>them which are</I>
 my flesh, and might save some of them.
 &nbsp; 15  For if the casting away of them <I>be</I> the reconciling of the
 world, what <I>shall</I> the receiving <I>of them be,</I> but life from the
 dead?
 &nbsp; 16  For if the firstfruit <I>be</I> holy, the lump <I>is</I> also <I>holy:</I>
 and if the root <I>be</I> holy, so <I>are</I> the branches.
 &nbsp; 17  And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
 wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them
 partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
 &nbsp; 18  Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
 bearest not the root, but the root thee.
 &nbsp; 19  Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I
 might be graffed in.
 &nbsp; 20  Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
 standest by faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:
 &nbsp; 21  For if God spared not the natural branches, <I>take heed</I> lest
 he also spare not thee.
 &nbsp; 22  Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
 which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue
 in <I>his</I> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
 &nbsp; 23  And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
 graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
 &nbsp; 24  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
 nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive
 tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <I>branches,</I>
 be graffed into their own olive tree?
 &nbsp; 25  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of
 this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
 blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
 Gentiles be come in.
 &nbsp; 26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There
 shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
 ungodliness from Jacob:
 &nbsp; 27  For this <I>is</I> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away
 their sins.
 &nbsp; 28  As concerning the gospel, <I>they are</I> enemies for your sakes:
 but as touching the election, <I>they are</I> beloved for the fathers'
 sakes.
 &nbsp; 29  For the gifts and calling of God <I>are</I> without repentance.
 &nbsp; 30  For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
 obtained mercy through their unbelief:
 &nbsp; 31  Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
 mercy they also may obtain mercy.
 &nbsp; 32  For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might
 have mercy upon all.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proposes here a plausible objection, which might be urged 
 against the divine conduct in casting off the Jewish nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Hath God cast away his people?</I> Is the rejection total and 
 final? Are they all abandoned to wrath and ruin, and that eternal? Is 
 the extent of the sentence so large as to be without reserve, or the 
 continuance of it so long as to be without repeal? Will he have no more 
 a peculiar people to himself?" In opposition to this, he shows that 
 there was a great deal of goodness and mercy expressed along with this 
 seeming severity, particularly he insists upon three things:--

 1. That, though some of the Jews were cast off, yet they were not all
 so. 

 2. That, though the body of the Jews were cast off, yet the Gentiles
 were taken in. And, 

 3. That, though the Jews were cast off at present, yet in God's due
 time they should be taken into his church again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Jews, it is true, were many of them cast off, but not all. The 
 supposition of this he introduces with a <I>God forbid.</I> He will by 
 no means endure such a suggestions. God had made a distinction between 
 some of them and others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, that obtained 
 righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-7"><I>v.</I> 1-7</A>.

 These are said to be such as he <I>foreknew</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, had thoughts of love to, before the world was; for whom he 
 thus foreknew he did predestinate. her lies the ground of the 
 difference. They are called the <I>election</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, the elect, God's chosen ones, whom he calls the election, 
 because that which first distinguished them from the dignified them 
 above others was God's electing love. Believers are the 
 <I>election,</I> all those and those only whom God hath chosen.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows that he himself was one of them: <I>For I also am an 
 Israelite;</I> as if he had said, "Should I say that all the Jews are 
 rejected, I should cut off my own claims, and see myself abandoned." 
 Paul was a chosen vessel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15">Acts ix. 15</A>),

 and yet he was of the <I>seed of Abraham,</I> and particularly of the 
 tribe of Benjamin, the least and youngest of all the tribes of 
 Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He suggests that as in Elias's time, so now, this chosen remnant
 was really more and greater than one would think it was, which 
 intimates likewise that it is no new nor unusual thing for God's grace 
 and favour to Israel to be limited and confined to a remnant of that 
 people; for so it was in Elijah's time. The scripture saith it of 
 Elias, <B><I>en Elia</I></B>--<I>in the story of Elias,</I> the great
 reformer of the Old Testament. Observe, 

 [1.] His mistake concerning Israel; as if their apostasy in the days of
 Ahab was so general that he himself was the only faithful servant God 
 had in the world. He refers to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:14">1 Kings xix. 14</A>,

 where (it is here said) <I>he maketh intercession to God against
 Israel.</I> A strange kind of intercession: <B><I>entynchanei to Theo 
 kata tou Israel</I></B>--<I>He deals with God against Israel;</I> so it 
 may be read; so <B><I>entynchano</I></B> is translated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:24">Acts xxv. 24</A>.

 The Jews <B><I>enetychon moi</I></B>--<I>have dealt with me.</I> In
 prayer we deal with God, commune with him, discourse with him: it is 
 said of Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">Jam. v. 17</A>)

 that he <I>prayed in praying.</I> We are then likely to pray in
 praying, to make a business of that duty, when we pray as those that 
 are dealing with God in the duty. Now Elijah in this prayer spoke as if 
 there were one left faithful in Israel but himself. See to what a low 
 ebb the profession of religion may sometimes be brought, and how much 
 the face of it may be eclipsed, that the most wise and observing men 
 may give it up for gone. So it was in Elijah's time. That which makes
 the show of a nation is the powers and the multitude. The powers of
 Israel were then persecuting powers: They have <I>killed thy prophets, 
 and digged down thine altars,</I> and they <I>seek my life.</I> The 
 multitude of Israel were then idolatrous: <I>I am left alone.</I> Thus 
 those few that were faithful to God were not only lost in the crowd of 
 idolaters, but crushed and driven into corners by the rage of 
 persecutors. <I>When the wicked rise, a man is hidden,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:12">Prov. xxviii. 12</A>.--

 <I>Digged down thine altars;</I> not only neglected them, and let them
 go out of repair, but digged them down. When altars were set up for 
 Baal, it is no wonder if God's altars were pulled down; they could not 
 endure that standing testimony against their idolatry. This was his 
 intercession <I>against Israel;</I> as if he had said, "Lord, is not 
 this a people ripe for ruin, worthy to be cast off? What else canst
 thou do for thy great name?" It is a very sad thing for any person or 
 people to have the prayers of God's people against them, especially of 
 God's prophets, for God espouses, and sooner or later will visibly own, 
 the cause of his praying people. 

 [2.] The rectifying of this mistake by the answer of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I have reserved.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Things are often much
 better with the church of God than wise and good men think they are. 
 They are ready to conclude hardly, and to give up all for gone, when it 
 is not so. <I>Secondly,</I> In times of general apostasy, there is
 usually a remnant that keep their integrity--some, though but a few; 
 all do not go one way. <I>Thirdly,</I> That when there is a remnant who 
 keep their integrity in times of general apostasy it is God that 
 reserves to himself that remnant. If he had left them to themselves, 
 they had gone down the stream with the rest. It is his free and 
 almighty grace that makes the difference between them and 
 others.--<I>Seven thousand:</I> a competent number to bear their 
 testimony against the idolatry of Israel, and yet, compared with the 
 many thousands of Israel, a very small number, one of a city, and two 
 of a tribe, like the grape-gleanings of the vintage. Christ's flock is 
 but a little flock; and yet, when they come all together at last, they 
 will be a great and innumerable multitude, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.

 Now the description of this remnant is that <I>they had not bowed the 
 knee to the image of Baal,</I> which was then the reigning sin of 
 Israel. In court, city, and country, Baal had the ascendant; and the 
 generality of people, more or less, paid their respect to Baal. The 
 best evidence of integrity is a freedom from the present prevailing 
 corruptions of the times and places that we live in, to swim against 
 the stream when it is strong. Those God will own for his faithful 
 witnesses that are bold in bearing their testimony to the 
 <I>present</I> truth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12">2 Pet. i. 12</A>.

 This is thank-worthy, not to bow to Baal when every body bows. Sober
 singularity is commonly the badge of true sincerity. 

 [3.] The application of this instance to the case in hand: <I>Even so 
 at this present time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 God's methods of dispensation towards his church are as they used to
 be. As it has been, so it is. In Elijah's time there was a remnant,
 and so there is now. If then there was a remnant left under the Old
 Testament, when the displays of grace were less clear and the pourings 
 out of the Spirit less plentiful, much more now under the gospel, when 
 the grace of God, which bringeth salvation, appears more 
 illustrious.--<I>A remnant,</I> a few of many, a remnant of believing 
 Jews when the rest were obstinate in their unbelief. This is called 
 <I>a remnant according to the election of grace;</I> they are such as 
 were chosen from eternity in the counsels of divine love to be vessels 
 of grace and glory. Whom he did predestinate those he called. If the
 difference between them and others be made purely by the grace of God, 
 as certainly it is (<I>I have reserved them,</I> saith he, <I>to 
 myself</I>), then it must needs be according to the election; for we 
 are sure that whatever God does he does it according to the counsel of 
 his own will. Now concerning this remnant we may observe, <I>First,</I> 
 Whence it takes its rise, from the free grace of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that grace which excludes works. The eternal election, in which the 
 difference between some and others is first founded, is purely of 
 grace, free grace; not for the sake of works done or foreseen; if so, 
 it would not be <I>grace. Gratia non est ullo modo gratia, si non sit 
 omni modo gratuita--It is not grace, properly so called, if it be not 
 perfectly free.</I> Election is purely according to the good pleasure 
 of his will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:5">Eph. i. 5</A>.

 Paul's heart was so full of the freeness of God's grace that in the
 midst of his discourse he turns aside, as it were, to make this remark, 
 <I>If of grace, then not of works.</I> And some observe that faith 
 itself, which in the matter of justification if opposed to works, is 
 here included in them; for faith has a peculiar fitness to receive the 
 free grace of God for our justification, but not to receive that grace 
 for our election. <I>Secondly,</I> What it obtains: that which Israel,
 that is, the body of that people, in van sought for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for,</I> that is,
 justification, and acceptance with God (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31"><I>ch.</I> ix. 31</A>),

 but the <I>election have obtained it.</I> In them the promise of God
 has its accomplishment, and God's ancient kindness for that people is 
 remembered. He calls the remnant of believers, not the elect, but the 
 <I>election,</I> to show that the sole foundation of all their hopes 
 and happiness is laid in election. They were the persons whom God had 
 in his eye in the counsels of his love; they are the election; they are 
 God's choice. Such was the favour of God to the chosen remnant.
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The rest were blinded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Some are chosen and called, and the call is made effectual. But others 
 are left to perish in their unbelief; nay, they are made worse by that 
 which should have made them better. The gospel, which to those that 
 believed was the savour of life unto life, to the unbelieving was the 
 savour of death unto death. The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. 
 Good old Simeon foresaw that the child Jesus was set for the fall, as 
 well as for the rising again, of many in Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>.--

 <I>Were blinded;</I> <B><I>eporothesan</I></B>--<I>they were
 hardened;</I> so some. They were seared, and made brawny and 
 insensible. They could neither see the light, nor feel the touch, of 
 gospel grace. Blindness and hardness are expressive of the same 
 senselessness and stupidity of spirit. They shut their eyes, and would 
 not see; this was their sin: and then God, in a way of righteous 
 judgment, blinded their eyes, that they could not see; this was their 
 punishment. This seemed harsh doctrine: to qualify it, therefore, he 
 vouches two witnesses out of the Old Testament, who speak of such a 
 thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Isaiah, who spoke of such a judgment in his day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:10;Isa+6:9"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 10; vi. 9</A>.

 The <I>spirit of slumber,</I> that is, an indisposedness to mind either
 their duty or interest. They are under the power of a prevailing 
 unconcernedness, like people that are slumbering and sleeping; not 
 affected with any thing that is said or done. They were resolved to 
 continue as they were, and would not stir. The following words explain 
 what is meant by the spirit of slumber: <I>Eyes, that they should not 
 see, and ears, that they should not hear.</I> They had the faculties, 
 but in the things that belonged to their peace they had not the use of 
 those faculties; they were quite infatuated, they saw Christ, but they 
 did not believe in him; they heard his word, but they did not receive 
 it; and so both their hearing and their seeing were in vain. It was all 
 one as if they had neither seen nor heard. Of all judgments spiritual 
 judgments are the sorest, and most to be dreaded, though they make the 
 least noise.--<I>Unto this day.</I> Ever since Esaias prophesied, this
 hardening work has been in the doing; some among them have been blind 
 and senseless. Or, rather, ever since the first preaching of the 
 gospel: though they have had the most convincing evidences that could 
 be of the truth of it, the most powerful preaching, the fairest offers, 
 the clearest calls from Christ himself, and from his apostles, yet to 
 this day they are blinded. It is still true concerning multitudes of 
 them, even to this day in which we live; they are hardened and blinded, 
 the obstinacy and unbelief go by succession from generation to 
 generation, according to their own fearful imprecation, which entailed 
 the curse: <I>His blood be upon us and upon our children.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),
 
 quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22,23">Ps. lxix. 22, 23</A>,

 where David having in the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from 
 his own people the Jews, particularly that of their giving him 
 <I>vinegar to drink</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>,

 which was literally fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:48">Matt. xxvii. 48</A>),

 an expression of the greatest contempt and malice that could be, in the 
 next words, under the form of an imprecation, he foretels the dreadful 
 judgments of God upon them for it: <I>Let their table become a 
 snare,</I> which the apostle here applies to the present blindness of 
 the Jews, and the offence they took at the gospel, which increased 
 their hardness. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of 
 David against his enemies; they are to be looked upon as prophetic of 
 the judgments of God upon the public and obstinate enemies of Christ 
 and his kingdom. His prayer that it might be so was a prophecy that it
 should be so, and not the private expression of his own angry 
 resentments. It was likewise intended to justify God, and to clear his 
 righteousness in such judgments. He speaks here, 

 [1.] Of the ruin of their comforts: <I>Let their table be made a
 snare,</I> that is, as the psalmist explains it, Let that which should 
 be for their welfare be a trap to them. The curse of God will turn meat 
 into poison. It is a threatening like that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2">Mal. ii. 2</A>,

 <I>I will curse your blessings.</I> Their table a snare, that is, an 
 occasion of sin and an occasion of misery. Their very food, that should 
 nourish them, shall choke them.

 [2.] Of the ruin of their powers and faculties

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 their eyes darkened, their backs bowed down, that they can neither find
 the right way, nor, if they could, are they able to walk in it. The 
 Jews, after their national rejection of Christ and his gospel, became 
 infatuated in their politics, so that their very counsels turned 
 against them, and hastened their ruin by the Romans. They looked like a 
 people designed for slavery and contempt, their backs bowed down, to be 
 ridden and trampled upon by all the nations about them. Or, it may be 
 understood spiritually; their backs are bowed down in carnality and 
 worldly-mindedness. <I>Curv&aelig; in terris anim&aelig;--They mind 
 earthly things.</I> This is an exact description of the state and 
 temper of the present remainder of that people, than whom, if the 
 accounts we have of them be true, there is not a more worldly, wilful, 
 blind, selfish, ill-natured, people in the world. They are manifestly 
 to this day under the power of this curse. Divine curses will work 
 long. It is a sign we have our eyes darkened if we are bowed down in 
 worldly-mindedness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another thing which qualified this doctrine of the rejection of the 
 Jews was that though they were cast off and unchurched, yet the 
 Gentiles were taken in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>),

 which he applies by way of caution to the Gentiles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17-22"><I>v.</I> 17-22</A>.</P>

 1. The rejection of the Jews made room for the reception of the 
 Gentiles. The Jews' leavings were a feast for the poor Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Have they stumbled that they should fall?</I> Had God no other end 
 in forsaking and rejecting them than their destruction?" He startles at 
 this, rejecting the thought with abhorrence, as usually he does when 
 any thing is suggested which seems to reflect upon the wisdom, or 
 righteousness, or goodness of God: <I>God forbid!</I> no, <I>through 
 their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles.</I> Not but that 
 salvation might have come to the Gentiles if they had stood; but by the 
 divine appointment it was so ordered that the gospel should be preached 
 to the Gentiles upon the Jews' refusal of it. Thus in the parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:8,9">Matt. xxii. 8, 9</A>),

 <I>Those that were</I> first <I>bidden were not worthy--Go ye therefore 
 into the highways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21">Luke xiv. 21</A>.

 And so it was in the history 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46">Acts xiii. 46</A>):

 <I>It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken 
 to you; but, seeing you put it from you, lo, we turn to the 
 Gentiles;</I> so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:6">Acts xviii. 6</A>.

 God will have a church in the world, will have the wedding furnished
 with guests; and, if one will not come, another will, or why was the 
 offer made? The Jews had the refusal, and so the tender came to the 
 Gentiles. See how Infinite Wisdom brings light out of darkness, good
 out of evil, meat out of the eater, and sweetness out of the strong. To 
 the same purport he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 <I>The fall of them was the riches of the world,</I> that is, it 
 hastened the gospel so much the sooner into the Gentile world. The 
 gospel is the greatest riches of the place where it is; it is better 
 than thousands of gold and silver. Or, The riches of the Gentiles was 
 the multitude of converts among them. True believers are God's jewels.
 To the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>The casting away of them is the reconciling of the world.</I> God's 
 displeasure towards them made way for his favour towards the Gentiles. 
 God was in Christ <I>reconciling the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:19">2 Cor. v. 19</A>.

 And therefore he took occasion from the unbelief of the Jews openly to
 disavow and disown them, though they had been his peculiar favourites, 
 to show that in dispensing his favours he would now no longer act in 
 such a way of peculiarity and restriction, but that in every nation he 
 that feared God and wrought righteousness should be accepted of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34,35">Acts x. 34, 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The use that the apostle makes of this doctrine concerning the 
 substitution of the Gentiles in the room of the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As a kinsman to the Jews, here is a word of excitement and 
 exhortation to them, to stir them up to receive and embrace the 
 gospel-offer. This God intended in his favour to the Gentiles, to 
 provoke the Jews to jealousy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and Paul endeavours to enforce it accordingly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>If by any means I might provoke to emulation those who are my 
 flesh.</I> "Shall the despised Gentiles run away with all the comforts 
 and privileges of the gospel, and shall not we repent of our refusal, 
 and now at last put in for a share? Shall not we believe and obey, and 
 be pardoned and saved, as well as the Gentiles?" See an instance of 
 such an emulation in Esau, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:6-9">Gen. xxviii. 6-9</A>.

 There is a commendable emulation in the affairs of our souls: why
 should not we be as holy and happy as any of our neighbours? In this 
 emulation there needs no suspicion, undermining or countermining; for 
 the church has room enough, and the new covenant grace and comfort 
 enough, for us all. The blessings are not lessened by the multitudes
 of the sharers.--<I>And might save some of them.</I> See what was 
 Paul's business, to save souls; and yet the utmost he promises himself 
 is but to save some. Though he was such a powerful preacher, spoke and
 wrote with such evidence and demonstration of the Spirit, yet of the 
 many he dealt with he could but save some. Ministers must think their 
 pains well bestowed if they can but be instrumental to save some.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As an apostle to the Gentiles, here is a word of caution for them: 
 "<I>I speak to you Gentiles.</I> You believing Romans, you hear what 
 riches of salvation are come to you by the fall of the Jews, but take 
 heed lest you do any thing to forfeit it." Paul takes this, as other 
 occasions, to apply his discourse to the Gentiles, because he was the 
 apostle of the Gentiles, appointed for the service of their faith, to 
 plant and water churches in the Gentile nations. This was the purport 
 of his extraordinary mission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21">Acts xxii. 21</A>,

 <I>I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15">Acts ix. 15</A>.
 
 It was likewise the intention of his ordination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Gal. ii. 9</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2">Acts xiii. 2</A>.

 It ought to be our great and special care to do good to those that are
 under our charge: we must particularly mind that which is our own work. 
 It was an instance of God's great love to the poor Gentiles that he 
 appointed Paul, who in gifts and graces excelled all the apostles, to 
 be the apostle of the Gentiles. The Gentile world was a wider province; 
 and the work to be done in it required a very able, skilful, zealous, 
 courageous workman: such a one was Paul. God calls those to special 
 work whom he either sees or makes fit for it.--<I>I magnify my 
 office.</I> There were those that vilified it, and him because of it.
 It was because he was the apostle of the Gentiles that the Jews were so 
 outrageous against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21,22">Acts xxii. 21, 22</A>),

 and yet he thought never the worse of it, though it set him up as the
 butt of all the Jewish rage and malice. It is a sign of true love to 
 Jesus Christ to reckon that service and work for him truly honourable 
 which the world looks upon with scorn, as mean and contemptible. The 
 office of the ministry is an office to be <I>magnified.</I> Ministers 
 are ambassadors for Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God, and 
 for their work's sake are to be esteemed highly in love.--<I>My 
 office;</I> <B><I>ten diakonian mou</I></B>--<I>my ministry,</I> my 
 service, not my lordship and dominion. It was not the dignity and 
 power, but the duty and work, of an apostle, that Paul was so much in 
 love with. Now two things he exhorts the Gentiles to, with reference to 
 the rejected Jews:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To have a respect for the Jews, notwithstanding, and to desire 
 their conversion. This is intimated in the prospect he gives them of 
 the advantage that would accrue to the church by their conversion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12,15"><I>v.</I> 12, 15</A>.

 It would be as life from the dead; and therefore they must not insult 
 and triumph over those poor Jews, but rather pity them, and desire 
 their welfare, and long for the receiving of them in again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To take heed to themselves, lest they should stumble and fall, as 
 they Jews had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17-22"><I>v.</I> 17-22</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The privilege which the Gentiles had by being taken into 
 the church. They were grafted in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 as a branch of a wild olive into a good olive, which is contrary to the 
 way and custom of the husbandman, who grafts the good olive into the 
 bad; but those that God grafts into the church he finds wild and 
 barren, and good for nothing. Men graft to mend the tree; but God
 grafts to mend the branch.

 1. The church of God is an olive-tree, flourishing and fruitful as an
 olive 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:8.Ho+14:6">Ps. lii. 8; Hos. xiv. 6</A>),

 the fruit useful for the honour both of God and man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:9">Judg. ix. 9</A>.

 2. Those that are out of the church are as wild olive-trees, not only
 useless, but what they do produce is sour and unsavoury: <I>Wild by 
 nature,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This was the state of the poor Gentiles, that wanted church privileges, 
 and in respect of real sanctification; and it is the natural state of 
 every one of us, to be wild by nature. 

 3. Conversion is the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive.
 We must be cut off from the old stock, and be brought into union with a
 new root. 

 4. Those that are grafted into the good olive-tree partake of the root
 and fatness of the olive. It is applicable to a saving union with 
 Christ; all that are by a lively faith grafted into Christ partake of 
 him as the branches of the root--receive from his fulness. But it is
 here spoken of a visible church-membership, from which the Jews were as 
 branches broken off; and so the Gentiles were grafted in, 
 <B><I>autois</I></B>--<I>among those</I> that continued, or in the room 
 of those that were broken off. The Gentiles, being grafted into the
 church, partake of the same privileges that the Jews did, <I>the root 
 and fatness.</I> The olive-tree is the visible church (called so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:16">Jer. xi. 16</A>);

 the root of this tree was Abraham, not the root of communication, so 
 Christ only is the root, but the root of administration, he being the 
 first with whom the covenant was so solemnly made. Now the believing 
 Gentiles partake of this root: <I>he also is ason of Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>),

 the <I>blessing of Abraham comes upon the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>),
 
 the same fatness of the olive-tree, the same for substance, special 
 protection, lively oracles, means of salvation, a standing ministry, 
 instituted ordinances; and, among the rest, the visible 
 church-membership of their infant seed, which was part of the fatness 
 of the olive-tree that the Jews had, and cannot be imagined to be 
 denied to the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> A caution not to abuse these privileges. 

 1. "Be not proud

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Boast not against the branches.</I> Do not therefore trample upon 
 the Jews as a reprobate people, nor insult over those that are broken 
 off, much less over those that do continue." Grace is given, not to 
 make us proud, but to make us thankful. The law of faith excludes all 
 boasting either of ourselves or against others. "Do not say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>They were broken off that I might be grafted in;</I> that is, do not 
 think that thou didst merit more at the hand of God than they, or didst 
 stand higher in his favour." "But remember, <I>thou bearest not the 
 root, but the root thee.</I> Though thou art grafted in, thou art still 
 but a branch borne by the root; nay, and an engrafted branch, brought 
 into the good olive <I>contrary to nature</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 not free-born, but by an act of grace enfranchised and naturalized. 
 Abraham, the root of the Jewish church, is not beholden to thee; but 
 thou art greatly obliged to him, as the trustee of the covenant and the 
 father of many nations. Therefore, <I>if thou boast,</I> know (this 
 word must be supplied to clear the sense) <I>thou bearest not the root 
 but the root thee.</I>" 
 
 2. "Be not secure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Be not high-minded, but fear.</I> Be not too confident of your own 
 strength and standing." A holy fear is an excellent preservative 
 against high-mindedness: happy is the man that thus feareth always. We 
 need not fear but God will be true to his word; all the danger is lest 
 we be false to ours. <I>Let us therefore fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 The church of Rome now boasts of a patent of perpetual preservation;
 but the apostle here, in his epistle to that church when she was in her 
 infancy and integrity, enters an express caveat against that boast, and 
 all claims of that kind.--<I>Fear</I> what? "Why fear lest thou commit 
 a forfeiture as they have done, lest thou lose the privileges thou now 
 enjoyest, as they have lost theirs." The evils that befal others should 
 be warnings to us. <I>Go</I> (saith God to Jerusalem

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12">Jer. vii. 12</A>),

 and <I>see what I did to</I> Shiloh; so now, let all the churches of 
 God go and see what he did to Jerusalem, and what is become of the day 
 of their visitation, that we may hear and fear, and take heed of 
 Jerusalem's sin. The patent which churches have of their privileges is 
 not for a certain term, nor entailed upon them and their heirs; but it 
 runs as long as they carry themselves well, and no longer. Consider, 
 
 (1.) "How they were broken off. It was not undeservedly, by an act of 
 absolute sovereignty and prerogative, but <I>because of unbelief.</I>" 
 It seems, then, it is possible for churches that have long stood by 
 faith to fall into such a state of infidelity as may be their ruin.
 Their unbelief did not only provoke God to cut them off, but they did 
 by this cut themselves off; it was not only the meritorious, but the 
 formal cause of their separation. "Now, thou art liable to the same
 infirmity and corruption that they fell by." Further observe, They were 
 <I>natural branches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 not only interested in Abraham's covenant, but descending from 
 Abraham's loins, and so born upon the premises, and thence had a kind 
 of tenant-right: yet, when they sunk into unbelief, God did not spare 
 them. Prescription, long usage, the faithfulness of their ancestors, 
 would not secure them. It was in vain to plead, though they insisted 
 much upon it, that they were Abraham's seed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9,Joh+8:33">Matt. iii. 9; John viii. 33</A>.

 It is true they were the husbandmen to whom the vineyard was first let
 out; but, when they forfeited it, it was justly taken from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:41,43">Matt. xxi. 41, 43</A>.

 This is called here <I>severity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 God laid righteousness to the line and judgment to the plummet, and 
 dealt with them according to their sins. Severity is a word that sounds 
 harshly; and I do not remember that it is any where else in scripture 
 ascribed to God; and it is here applied to the unchurching of the Jews. 
 God is most severe towards those that have been in profession nearest 
 to him, if they rebel against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 Patience and privileges abused turn to the greatest wrath. Of all
 judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; for of these he is here 
 speaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (2.) "How thou standest, thou that art engrafted in." He speaks to the
 Gentile churches in general, though perhaps tacitly reflecting on some 
 particular person, who might have expressed some such pride and triumph 
 in the Jews' rejection. "Consider then," 

 [1.] "By what means thou standest: <I>By faith,</I> which is a
 depending grace, and fetches in strength from heaven. Thou dost not 
 stand in any strength of thy own, of which thou mightest be confident: 
 thou art no more than the free grace of God makes thee, and his grace 
 is his own, which he gives or withholds at pleasure. That which ruined 
 them was unbelief, and by faith thou standest; therefore thou hast no 
 faster hold than they had, thou standest on no firmer foundation than 
 they did." 
 
 [2.] "On what terms

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Towards thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness,</I> that 
 is, continue in a dependence upon and compliance with the free grace of 
 God, the want of which it was that ruined the Jews--if thou be careful 
 to keep up thine interest in the divine favour, by being continually 
 careful to please God and fearful of offending him." The sum of our 
 duty, the condition of our happiness, is to keep ourselves in the love 
 of God. <I>Fear the Lord and his goodness.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another thing that qualified this doctrine of the Jews' rejection 
 is that, though for the present they are cast off, yet the rejection is 
 not final; but, when the fulness of time is come, they will be taken in 
 again. They are not cast off for ever, but mercy is remembered in the 
 midst of wrath. Let us observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this conversion of the Jews is here described. 

 (1.) It is said to be their fulness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that is, the addition of them to the church, the filling up again of 
 that place which became vacant by their rejection. This would be the 
 enriching of the world (that is, the church in the world) with a great 
 deal of light and strength and beauty. 

 (2.) It is called the receiving of them. The conversion of a soul is 
 the receiving of that soul, so the conversion of a nation. They shall 
 be received into favour, into the church, into the love of Christ, 
 whose arms are stretched out for the receiving of all those that will 
 come to him. And this will be as <I>life from the dead</I>--so strange 
 and surprising, and yet withal so welcome and acceptable. The 
 conversion of the Jews will bring great joy to the church. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:32">Luke xv. 32</A>,

 <I>He was dead, and is alive;</I> and therefore <I>it was meet we
 should make merry and be glad.</I> 

 (3.) It is called the <I>grafting of them in again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 into the church, from which they had been broken off. That which is 
 grafted in receives sap and virtue from the root; so does a soul that 
 is truly grafted into the church receive life, and strength, and grace 
 from Christ the quickening root. They shall be <I>grafted into their 
 own olive-tree</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 that is, into the church of which they had formerly been the most 
 eminent and conspicuous members, to retrieve those privileges of 
 visible church-membership which they had so long enjoyed, but have now 
 sinned away and forfeited by their unbelief. 

 (4.) It is called the <I>saving of all Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 True conversion may well be called salvation; it is salvation begun. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:47">Acts ii. 47</A>.

 The adding of them to the church is the saving of them: <B><I>tous
 sozomenous,</I></B> in the present tense, <I>are saved.</I> When 
 conversion-work goes on, salvation-work goes on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What it is grounded upon, and what reason we have to look for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because of the holiness of the first-fruits and the root, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Some by the first-fruits understand those of the Jews that were already 
 converted to the faith of Christ and received into the church, who were 
 as the first-fruits dedicated to God, as earnests of a more plentiful 
 and sanctified harvest. A good beginning promises a good ending. Why 
 may we not suppose that others may be savingly wrought upon as well as 
 those who are already brought in? Others by the first-fruits understand 
 the same with the root, namely, the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and 
 Jacob, from whom the Jews descended, and with whom, as the prime 
 trustees, the covenant was deposited: and so they were the root of the 
 Jews, not only as a people, but as a church. Now, if they were holy, 
 which is not meant so much of inherent as of federal holiness--if they
 were in the church and in the covenant--then we have reason to conclude
 that God hath a kindness for the <I>lump</I>--the body of that people;
 and for the <I>branches</I>--the particular members of it. The Jews are
 in a sense a holy nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6">Exod. xix. 6</A>),

 being descended from holy parents. Now it cannot be imagined that such
 a holy nation should be totally and finally cast off. This proves that
 the seed of believers, as such, are within the pale of the visible
 church, and within the verge of the covenant, till they do, by their
 unbelief, throw themselves out; for, <I>if the root be holy, so are the
 branches.</I> Though real qualifications are not propagated, yet
 relative privileges are. Though a wise man does not beget a wise man,
 yet a free man begets a free man. Though grace does not run in the
 blood, yet external privileges do (till they are forfeited), even to a
 thousand generations. Look how they will answer it another day that cut
 off the entail, by turning the seed of the faithful out of the church,
 and so not allowing the blessing of Abraham to come upon the Gentiles.
 The Jewish branches are reckoned holy, because the root was so. This is
 expressed more plainly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>They are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</I> In this love to the 
 fathers the first foundation of their church-state was laid 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:37">Deut. iv. 37</A>):

 <I>Because he loved they fathers, therefore he chose their seed after 
 them.</I> And the same love would revive their privileges, for still 
 the ancient loving-kindness is remembered; they are <I>beloved for the 
 fathers' sakes.</I> It is God's usual method of grace. Kindness to the 
 children for the father's sake is therefore called the <I>kindness of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+9:3,7">2 Sam. ix. 3, 7</A>.

 Though, as concerning the gospel (namely, in the present dispensation
 of it), they are enemies to it <I>for your sakes,</I> that is, for the 
 sake of the Gentiles, against whom they have such an antipathy; yet, 
 when God's time shall come, this will wear off, and God's love to their 
 fathers will be remembered. See a promise that points at this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.

 The iniquity of the fathers is visited but to the third and fourth 
 generation; but there is mercy kept for thousands. Many fare the better 
 for the sake of their godly ancestors. It is upon this account that
 the church is called their own <I>olive-tree.</I> Long it had been 
 their own peculiar, which is some encouragement to us to hope that 
 there may be room for them in it again, for old acquaintance-sake.
 That which hath been may be again. Though particular persons and
 generations wear off in unbelief, yet there having been a national 
 church-membership, though for the present suspended, we may expect that 
 it will be revived.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because of the power of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>God is able to graft them in again.</I> The conversion of souls is a 
 work of almighty power; and when they seem most hardened, and blinded, 
 and obstinate, our comfort is that God is able to work a change, able 
 to graft those in that have been long cast out and withered. When the 
 house is kept by the strong man armed, with all his force, yet God is 
 stronger than he, and is able to dispossess him. The condition of their 
 restoration is faith: <I>If they abide not still in unbelief.</I> So 
 that nothing is to be done but to remove that unbelief that is the 
 great obstacle; and God is able to take that away, though nothing less 
 than an almighty power will do it, the same power that raised up Christ 
 from the dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19,29">Eph. i. 19, 29</A>.
 
 Otherwise, can these dry bones live?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Because of the grace of God manifested to the Gentiles. Those that
 have themselves experienced the grace of God, preventing, 
 distinguishing grace, may thence take encouragement to hope well 
 concerning others. This is his argument 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "If thou wast grafted into a good olive, that was wild by nature, much 
 more shall these that were the natural branches, and may therefore be 
 presumed somewhat nearer to the divine acceptance." This is a 
 suggestion very proper to check the insolence of those Gentile 
 Christians that looked with disdain and triumph upon the condition of 
 the rejected Jews, and trampled upon them; as if he had said, "Their 
 condition, bad as it is, is not so bad as yours was before your 
 conversion; and therefore why may it not be made as good as yours is?" 
 This is his argument 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>):

 <I>As you in times past have not,</I> &c. It is good for those that 
 have found mercy with God to be often thinking what they were in time 
 past, and how they obtained that mercy. This would help to soften our
 censures of those that still continue in unbelief, and quicken our 
 prayers for them. He argues further from the occasion of the Gentiles' 
 call, that is, the unbelief of the Jews; thence it took rise: "<I>You 
 have obtained mercy through their unbelief;</I> much more shall they 
 obtain mercy through your mercy. If the putting out of their candle was 
 the lighting of yours, by that power of God which brings good out of 
 evil, much more shall the continued light of your candle, when God's 
 time shall come, be a means of lighting theirs again." "<I>That through 
 your mercy they might obtain mercy,</I> that is, that they may be 
 beholden to you, as you have been to them." He takes it for granted 
 that the believing Gentiles would do their utmost endeavour to work 
 upon the Jews--that, when God had persuaded Japhet, Japhet would be 
 labouring to persuade Shem. True grace hates monopolies. Those that 
 have found mercy themselves should endeavour that through their mercy 
 others also may obtain mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Because of the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament, which 
 point at this. He quotes a very remarkable one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26,Isa+59:20,21"><I>v.</I> 26,
 from Isa. lix. 20, 21</A>.

 Where we may observe, 

 [1.] The coming of Christ promised: <I>There shall come out of Zion the
 deliverer.</I> Jesus Christ is the great deliverer, which supposes 
 mankind in a state of misery and danger. In Isaiah it is, <I>the 
 Redeemer shall come to Zion.</I> There he is called the Redeemer; here 
 the deliverer; he delivers in a way of redemption, by a price. There
 he is said to come to Zion, because when the prophet prophesied he was 
 yet to come into the world, and Zion was his first head-quarters. 
 Thither he came, there he took up his residence: but, when the apostle 
 wrote this, he had come, he had been in Zion; and he is speaking of the 
 fruits of his appearing, which shall come <I>out of Zion;</I> thence, 
 as from the spring, issued forth those streams of living water which in 
 the everlasting gospel watered the nations. <I>Out of Zion went forth 
 the law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>.

 [2.] The end and purpose of this coming: <I>He shall turn away 
 ungodliness from Jacob.</I> Christ's errand into the world was to turn 
 away ungodliness, to turn away the guilt by the purchase of pardoning 
 mercy, and to turn away the power by the pouring out of renewing grace, 
 to save his people from their sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>),

 to separate between us and our sins, that iniquity might not be our
 ruin, and that it might not be our ruler. Especially to turn it away 
 from Jacob, which is that for the sake of which he quotes the text, as 
 a proof of the great kindness God intended for the seed of Jacob. What 
 greater kindness could he do them than to turn away ungodliness from 
 them, to take away that which comes between them and all happiness, 
 take away sin, and then make way for all good? This is the blessing 
 that Christ was sent to bestow upon the world, and to tender it to the 
 Jews in the first place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>),

 to turn people from their iniquities. In Isaiah it is, <I>The Redeemer
 shall come to Zion, and unto those that turn from transgression in 
 Jacob,</I> which shown who in Zion were to have a share in and to reap 
 benefit by the deliverance promised, those and those only that leave 
 their sins and turn to God; to them Christ comes as a Redeemer, but as
 an avenger to those that persist in impenitence. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:2,3">Deut. xxx. 2, 3</A>.
 
 Those that turn from sin will be owned as the true citizens of Zion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19">Eph. ii. 19</A>),

 the right Jacob,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:4,6">Ps. xxiv. 4, 6</A>.

 Putting both these readings together, we learn that none have an
 interest in Christ but those that turn from their sins, nor can any 
 turn from their sins but by the strength of the grace of 
 Christ.--<I>For this is my covenant with them</I>--this, that the 
 deliverer shall come to them--this, that my Spirit shall not depart 
 from them, as it follows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>.

 God's gracious intentions concerning Israel were made the matter of a 
 covenant, which the God that cannot lie could not but be true and 
 faithful to. They were the <I>children of the covenant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25">Acts iii. 25</A>.

 The apostle adds, <I>When I shall take away their sins,</I> which some
 think refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:9">Isa. xxvii. 9</A>,

 or only to the foregoing words, to <I>turn away ungodliness.</I> Pardon
 of sin is laid as the foundation of all the blessings of the new 
 covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb. viii. 12</A>):

 <I>For I will be merciful.</I> Now from all this he infers that 
 certainly God had great mercy in store for that people, something 
 answerable to the extent of these rich promises: and he proves his 
 inference 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 by this truth: <I>For the gifts and callings of God are without 
 repentance.</I> Repentance is sometimes taken for a change of mind, and 
 so God never repents, for he is in one mind and who can turn him? 
 Sometimes for a change of way, and that is here understood, intimating 
 the constancy and unchangeableness of that love of God which is founded 
 in election. Those gifts and callings are immutable; whom he so loves,
 he loves to the end. We find God repenting that he had given man a 
 being 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:6">Gen. vi. 6</A>,

 <I>It repented the Lord that he had made man),</I> and repenting that 
 he had given a man honour and power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:11">1 Sam. xv. 11</A>,

 <I>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king</I>); but we 
 never find God repenting that he had given a man grace, or effectually 
 called him; those gifts and callings are without repentance.</P>

 The apostle having insisted so largely, through the greatest part of 
 this chapter, upon reconciling the rejection of the Jews with the 
 divine goodness, he concludes here with the acknowledgment and 
 admiration of the divine wisdom and sovereignty in all this. Here the 
 apostle does with great affection and awe adore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The secrecy of the divine counsels: <I>O the depth!</I> in these 
 proceedings towards the Jews and Gentiles; or, in general, the whole 
 mystery of the gospel, which we cannot fully comprehend.--<I>The riches
 of the wisdom and knowledge of God,</I> the abundant instances of his 
 wisdom and knowledge in contriving and carrying on the work of our
 redemption by Christ, a depth which the angels pry into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:12">1 Pet. i. 12</A>.
 
 Much more may it puzzle any human understanding to give an account of
 the methods, and reasons, and designs, and compass of it. Paul was as
 well acquainted with the mysteries of the kingdom of God as ever any
 mere man was; and yet he confesses himself at a loss in the
 contemplation, and, despairing to find the bottom, he humbly sits down
 at the brink, and adores the depth. Those that know most in this state
 of imperfection cannot but be most sensible of their own weakness and
 short-sightedness, and that after all their researches, and all their
 attainments in those researches, while they are here they cannot order
 their speech by reason of darkness. Praise is silent to thee,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:1">Ps. lxv. 1</A>.--

 <I>The depth of the riches.</I> Men's riches of all kinds are shallow,
 you may soon see the bottom; but God's riches are deep

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>):

 <I>Thy judgments are a great deep.</I> There is not only depth in the
 divine counsels, but riches too, which denotes an abundance of that 
 which is precious and valuable, so complete are the dimensions of the 
 divine counsels; they have not only depth and height, but <I>breadth 
 and length</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:18">Eph. iii. 18</A>),
 
 and that passing knowledge, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.--

 <I>Riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God.</I> His seeing all things
 by one clear, and certain, and infallible view--all things that are, or
 ever were, or ever shall be,--that all is naked and open before him:
 there is his knowledge. His ruling and ordering all things, directing
 and disposing them to his own glory, and bringing about his own
 purposes and counsels in all; this is his <I>wisdom.</I> And the vast
 extent of both these is such a depth as is past our fathoming, and we
 may soon lose ourselves in the contemplation of them. Such <I>knowledge
 is too wonderful for me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:6">Ps. cxxxix. 6</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.--

 <I>How unsearchable are his judgments!</I> that is, his counsels and 
 purposes: and his <I>ways,</I> that is, the execution of these counsels 
 and purposes. We know not what he designs. When the wheels are set in 
 motion, and Providence has begun to work, yet we know not what he has 
 in view; it is <I>past finding out.</I> This does not only overturn all 
 our positive conclusions about the divine counsels, but it also checks 
 all our curious enquiries. Secret things belong not to us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29">Deut. xxix. 29</A>.
 
 God's way is in the sea, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:19">Ps. lxxvii. 19</A>.

 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9,Ps+97:2">Job xxiii. 8, 9; Ps. xcvii. 2</A>.

 What he does we know not now,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:7">John xiii. 7</A>.

 We cannot give a reason of God's proceedings, nor by searching find out
 God. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:9,9:10">Job v. 9; ix. 10</A>.

 The judgments of his mouth, and the way of our duty, blessed be God,
 are plain and easy, it is a high-way; but the judgments of his hands, 
 and the ways of his providence, are dark and mysterious, which 
 therefore we must not pry into, but silently adore and acquiesce in.
 The apostle speaks this especially with reference to that strange turn, 
 the casting off of the Jews and the entertainment of the Gentiles, with 
 a purpose to take in the Jews again in due time; these were strange 
 proceedings, the choosing of some, the refusing of others, and neither 
 according to the probabilities of human conjecture. Even so, Father, 
 because it seemed good in thing eyes. These are methods unaccountable, 
 concerning which we must say, <I>O the depth!</I>--<I>Past finding 
 out,</I> <B><I>anexichniastoi</I></B>--<I>cannot be traced.</I> God 
 leaves no prints nor footsteps behind him, does not make a path to 
 shine after him; but his paths of providence are new every morning. He 
 does not go the same way so often as to make a track of it. <I>How 
 little a portion is heard of him!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:14">Job xxvi. 14</A>.

 It follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 <I>For who hath known the mind of the Lord?</I> Is there any creature
 made of his cabinet-council, or laid, as Christ was, in the bosom of 
 the Father? Is there any to whom he has imparted his counsels, or that 
 is able, upon the view of his providences, to know the way that he 
 takes? There is so vast a distance and disproportion between God and 
 man, between the Creator and the creature, as for ever excludes the 
 thought of such an intimacy and familiarity. The apostle makes the same 
 challenge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:16">1 Cor. ii. 16</A>):

 <I>For who hath known the mind of the Lord?</I> And yet there he adds, 
 <I>But we have the mind of Christ,</I> which intimates that through 
 Christ true believers, who have his Spirit, know so much of the mind of 
 God as is necessary to their happiness. He that knew the mind of the 
 Lord has declared him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>.

 And so, though we know not the mind of the Lord, yet, if we have the 
 mind of Christ, we have enough. <I>The secret of the Lord is with
 those that fear him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>.

 <I>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do?</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">John xv. 15</A>.--

 <I>Or who has been his counsellor?</I> He needs no counsellor, for he
 is infinitely wise; nor is any creature capable of being his 
 counsellor; this would be like lighting a candle to the sun. This
 seems to refer to that scripture

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:13,14">Isa. xl. 13, 14</A>),

 <I>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or, being his counsellor,
 hath taught him? With whom took he counsel?</I> &c. It is the substance 
 of God's challenge to Job concerning the work of creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1-41">Job xxxviii.</A>),

 and is applicable to all the methods of his providence. It is nonsense
 for any man to prescribe to God, or to teach him how to govern the 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sovereignty of the divine counsels. In all these things God 
 acts as a free agent, does what he will, because he will, and gives not 
 account of any of his matters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:13,33:13">Job xxiii. 13; xxxiii. 13</A>),

 and yet there is no unrighteousness with him. To clear which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He challenges any to prove God a debtor to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Who hath first given to him?</I> Who is there of all the creatures 
 that can prove God is beholden to him? Whatever we do for him, or 
 devote to him, it must be with that acknowledgment, which is for ever a 
 bar to such demands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14">1 Chron. xxix. 14</A>):

 <I>Of thine own we have given thee.</I> All the duties we can perform 
 are not requitals, but rather restitutions. If any can prove that God 
 is his debtor, the apostle here stands bound for the payment, and 
 proclaims, in God's name, that payment is ready: <I>It shall be 
 recompensed to him again.</I> It is certain God will let nobody lose by 
 him; but never any one yet durst make a demand of this kind, or attempt 
 to prove it. This is here suggested, 

 (1.) To silence the clamours of the Jews. When God took away their 
 visible church-privileges from them, he did but take his own: and may 
 he not do what he will with his own--give or withhold his grace where 
 and when he pleases? 

 (2.) To silence the insultings of the Gentiles. When God sent the
 gospel among them, and gave so many of them grace and wisdom to accept 
 of it, it was not because he owed them so much favour, or that they 
 could challenge it as a debt, but of his own good pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He resolves all into the sovereignty of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things,</I> that 
 is, God is all in all. All things in heaven and earth (especially those 
 things which relate to our salvation, the things which belong to our 
 peace) are of him by way of creation, through him by way of 
 providential influence, that they may be to him in their final tendency 
 and result. Of God as the spring and fountain of all, through Christ, 
 God-man, as the conveyance, to God as the ultimate end. These three 
 include, in general, all God's causal relations to his creatures: of 
 him as the first efficient cause, through him as the supreme directing 
 cause, to him as the ultimate final cause; for the Lord hath made all 
 for himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:11">Rev. iv. 11</A>.

 If all be of him and through him, there is all the reason in the world 
 that all should be to him and for him. It is a necessary circulation; 
 if the rivers received their waters from the sea, they return them to 
 the sea again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:7">Eccl. i. 7</A>.

 To do all to the glory of God is to make a virtue of necessity; for all
 shall in the end be to him, whether we will or no. And so he concludes 
 with a short doxology: <I>To whom be glory for ever, Amen.</I> God's 
 universal agency as the first cause, the sovereign ruler, and the last 
 end, ought to be the matter of our adoration. Thus all his works do 
 praise him objectively; but his saints do bless him actively; they hand 
 that praise to him which all the creatures do minister matter for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:10">Ps. cxlv. 10</A>.

 Paul had been discoursing at large of the counsels of God concerning
 man, sifting the point with a great deal of accuracy; but, after all, 
 he concludes with the acknowledgment of the divine sovereignty, as that 
 into which all these things must be ultimately resolved, and in which 
 alone the mind can safely and sweetly rest. This is, if not the 
 scholastic way, yet the Christian way, of disputation. Whatever are
 the premises, let god's glory be the conclusion; especially when we 
 come to talk of the divine counsels and actings, it is best for us to 
 turn our arguments into awful and serious adorations. The glorified
 saints, that see furthest into these mysteries, never dispute, but 
 praise to eternity.</P>
